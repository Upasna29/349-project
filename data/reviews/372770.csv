I'll just list everything that is bad about it.\n-Quite a bit of the artwork and animations are poor.\n-The level design is basic.\n-The enemies are either incredibly easy/bugged or are only hard because they are annoying.\n-The gold drop rate seems low so if you want to buy stuff you have to spend a bunch of time mindlessly farming the spawner minions in the first level.\n-There is no strategy, it is just hold down left click and occasionally move based on certain enemy attacks. Maybe this changes later on in the game but I just couldn't sit through the tedious starting levels to find out.\n-The music is actually enjoyable but the clips are pretty short and they just play at random intervals with nothing in between\n\nThere are many other better, and cheaper, rogue-lites out there.\nWould not recommend.","June 20, 2015","false","0.6"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","29","41","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/recommended/372770/","hippyshake","Hippyshake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/","1352 products in account","It would be easy to write off Floors of Discomfort (FoD) within the first few minutes of game play, as I almost did (my first thought: "This feels like it belongs on Kongregate."). That would be unfair though, because there really is more to it than first meets the eye.\n\nThe Overview: FoD is a platformer only inasmuch as you walk left or right killing things, and occasionally jump. That's it, really. The challenge comes with the sheer numbers of enemies thrown at you from the very start. For example, you can enter a new game and literally be overwhelmed with mobs in a matter of seconds (including one beastie who opens a portal through which other beasties can come). The more you play, however, the more you realize that some strategy is necessary to ensure your survival.  Running away from (or jumping over) mobs is a viable option. Some mobs (and crates strewn about the levels) drop coins, which can be used in an in-game store to purchase power-ups. Treasure chests also might provide help (pray for the Speed Boost). The longer you survive, the more powerful you can become, but proper management of your extremely limited money is essential.  The "Rogue-lite" aspects of the game refer to the random item and mob placement, the platform surface (although it might as well be designed, as it doesn't feel any different from one game to the next) and sorta-kinda permadeath.\n\nThe Finer Points: The first thing I usually do in an Indie game is to turn off the music, but it's actually above par here; I enjoyed the combination of atmospheric/dub/pop present in FoD (it also played continuously for me, but there is at least one report of it playing intermittently). The power-ups are also creative and fun. The character models are interesting to look at, and the hand-drawn art can be charming; at its  best, it's reminiscent of The Binding of Isaac. I love the look of the shop, for example, although in higher resolutions (which cap out at 1600x900) items float above the shelves they should be resting on.  Unfortunately, the rest of the play field (such as the background and platform surface) is dull and uninspired, and the tiled patterns used don't gel with the hand-drawn art, bringing down the overall look of the game.  The character animations are fairly fluid, though.\n\nA couple of other things to consider: The controls cannot be remapped, and gamepads don't seem to be implemented which, in a platformer, seems a bit of an oversight. Finally, there is only one character unlocked at the start of the game, which means no choice for the player (a rarity in "Rogue-like" games).\n\nThings I'd like to see in a patch: Steam overlay integration. Trading cards and (especially) achievements; in a game this difficult, with this few player options, achievements would go a long way to making it feel worth playing. I'd also like to see a crouch option, but I suspect the entire enemy is hitboxed, and not just the weapon it uses. Another character option at the start of the game would be great, too; make the rest unlockable.  Different heights and gaps in the platform would definitely increase replay value, although I'm sure that would involved re-coding enemy AI as well as the play field, so I wouldn't really expect it.\n\nAll that said, however, the game is pretty much complete, and I enjoyed it once I realized it was deeper than it first appeared. It's something to pick up and play for short bursts when you want to beat the crap out of things and push yourself to do better "just one more time." It's priced about a buck too high, but FoD is simple and fun, and, at its current price of $5.99, less than the cost of a matinee ticket. Recommended.","July 21, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is very difficult, and I always think making a hard game is a lot, lot harder than just making an easy one. :D Good luck on your next game(s), I hope you're happier with them!\n","December 6, 2015","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I liked the art, gameplay, and unlockable characters. The art gives this game a distinct kind of character that you wont find in many other places. The music is also a plus. The characters in this game are diverse, and I enjoyed playing them, especially the Skelewizard. The gameplay is very basic, and easy to grasp. Progressing through the various "floors" requires you to acquire items to make up for your character's shortcomings and counter the enemies ahead. I would buy this game if you have some spare change and want something to pass a bit of time with.\n\nThe game has a few flaws, mostly being glitches and a lack of a items. There is a decent amount of items in the game, some you can buy in the store, and some that you must pick up in chests and from bosses. I found that, however, in a short time I had already seen what I believe to be all of the items. It would be nice to see more items added to the game. I am happy with the items in the game so far, as they all feel unique and helpful to some degree (except for temporary boost gems). While there may be some glitches, they were a minor inconvenienve to me.\n\nAll in all, I would purchase this short game if you are looking for a quick fix. While not a completely stellar game, it has its charm, and you can't argue with the price.","December 28, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
