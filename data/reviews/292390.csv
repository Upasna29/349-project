(Read The Frakking Manual)\n\nThere are no hand-holding tutorials in this game, it expected you to read the manual before diving in or referencing it when you didn't know how to preform an action.\n\nManual is in Steam Folder so read it before you play.\n\nDon't let my Steam time fool you, I actually bought this game when it was new (And on 4 CD's if I remember correctly, I think I still have them somewhere). I have played this game from beginning to end multiple times and for its time, it was an amazing game. It hasn't aged the best and could do with a remastering that's for sure, but it still has all the classic difficulty and random scary moments (which now seem a bit tame) which gave it the charm I fell in love with.\n\nPros:\n\n- Excellent story\n- Wonderful Puzzles\n- The mix of Point & Click and FPS is a refreshing change\n- Challenging without being impossible\n- Does not hold your hand (you can spend hours trying to figure out a simple puzzle because you missed an item earlier in the level, which is wonderful!)\n- Those FMV sequences are wonderful despite the aged quality\n\nCons:\n\n- Controls cannot be remapped in game\n- Mouse is super wonky (it was designed around ball mice, so optical mice go nuts on it, lower your dpi if possible)\n- The resolution is pretty bad\n- Sound levels aren't normalized and can sometimes be a bit much on headphones.\n\nI'd recommend this to anyone looking for a classic game with some excellent story and a very unique feel. I will probably finish this game again. However, one thing everyone should do is remap their keys (you'll have to find the .ini for it), as the default keyset is pretty bad (though old school players will fall into it pretty quick). For a game that's almost two decades old, it hasn't lost its charm, even if the graphics are dated.","March 17, 2015","true","0.3"," 93 of 106 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","93","106","4","4"

I've played for few minutes and I really enjoyed this game.\n\n\nVideos are very nice if you notice the quality of FMV (Full Motion Video). There is nearly no difference between the actors and the game. The music doesn't annoy. The graphics are correct. Environments are nice (apparently you can access different dimensions which radically changes the atmosphere), I only regret the lack of detail of monsters. Story is interesting and the interactions with the game are numerous because this is a point & click (your character has always something to say about anything he encounters... like in a real point & click).\n\nControls: thanks to Arucard who gave us the hint on the Steam forum, there is a list of all the keys of the game and a way to change theses. Be ware there are some game tips spoilers at the end: http://www.gog.com/forum/realms_of_the_haunting/tips_for_beginners/page1\n\nControls were the only bad aspect of the game before I’ve found this link!\n\n\nActually I’m really happy to have found this game.\nBecause it didn't receive the success it deserved... and it's time to change that! ^^\n\nBonuses:\n\nA better review than mine: http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=5987&tab=review\n\nAnd some info: Gremlin created on Nintendo 64 the game "Body Harvest". Released before GTA III and considered as a true GTA like. Quite original (you travel in 4 different times) and one of the most underrated game of the history.\nRealms of the Haunting even surprises you at the downloading, its file weights 1.4 go. For its time (1996) it was amazing. Another clue of the huge amount of content this game has.","April 25, 2014","true","3.4"," 62 of 78 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","62","78","0","10"

I played it for the first time ever in 2015, and it was a great experience. Having said that, there are a couple of things you need to bear in mind:\n\n1. No tutorial. Look up the manual onine and give it a read so you know how to play (it's important, trust me).\n2. No autosaves. Save often, and use multiple save slots in case you screw up badly.\n3. The controls are weird. This game's from that era where developers were still figuring out optimal controls, and these are NOT optimal. You get used to them after a couple of hours though, by which point they feel fine.\n\nIf you can get past that, and the dated graphics, this is a very enjoyable game. The story is interesting. The gameplay is solid. The puzzles make sense. The acting is... not terrible, certainly better than a lot of other live action FMV games. It's also worth noting that, even though the graphics are dated, they're well designed and in my opinion, quite nice. The blend of point-and-click and FPS action also works really well.\n\nIf you're looking for a retro PC gaming experience, you can't go wrong.","June 27, 2015","true","20.0"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","38","41","0","1"

At the time,  it was one of the best example of fusion gameplay and it is still a great game.  It also included inventory puzzles that make the environment more interactive that most shooters of time.\n\nIt’s good enough that I bought it again on steam, even after buying on GOG just so I could tell everyone here about it! (Don’t be fooled by the low playing time. Steam requires a certain amount of ingame time to write a review so I installed it. It may say 11 minutes, but I actually played the entire game 17 years ago)\n\nIt is definitely a piece of its time and if you require” ultra super high funtime” graphics to enjoy a game, you should give it a pass.  It has FMV sequences, a relic of another time certainly, but my memory is that they were not intrusive and actually pretty well done at a time when most developers grabbed the receptionist and stuck her in the game so they didn’t have to hire an actual actor.\n\nThe story, and there actually is one,  centers around the death of your father and your inheritance, a house.  The house has portals to multiple dimensions and what seems to be a straight up good vs. evil becomes more complicated as the game progresses.\n\nThe weapons are varied from a colt (which you don’t want to have to reload in combat) to a sword.  The shotgun has to be seen to believed.  Unlike most shooters of the day, it’s not a straight escalation of damage from near useless to BFG2000. Instead damage varies depending on the target. Some do more damage against some foes than they do against others. Strategy is more important than simply blasting everything that moves. Although you will do some serious shooting throughout.\n\nThis is a great one and you should play it all the way through. A really superb game from the 1st golden age of PC gaming.","April 25, 2014","true","0.2"," 46 of 59 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","46","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/recommended/292390/","derungrund","Der Ungrund","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derungrund/","387 products in account","“Realms of the Haunting” is a strange synthesis of three major early 1990s gaming trends: adventure games, full motion video, and old school first person shooters.  But while RotH seamlessly combines all three elements into a single package, it also arguably sounded their death knell in the process.  Released in late 1996, it was in direct competition with “Quake,” “Tomb Raider,” and, several months later, “Dark Forces 2,” three milestone games which set the trend for gaming in the late 1990s and left RotH’s dated looking, Doom style, 2D engine in the dust.  Likewise, the adventure genre was also on the wane, with just “Grim Fandango,” “Gabriel Knight 3,” and "The Longest Journey" to look forward to before going mostly dormant for nearly a decade.  By the end of 1997, the short lived full motion video craze would be eclipsed by the advent of dedicated 3D graphics cards, and mammoth 8 disc, FMV epics like “Phantasmagoria,” “Gabriel Knight 2” and “Under a Killing Moon” would be relegated to historical oddities.\n\nGiven this, it’s no wonder that RotH flopped on release.  It was conceived as the hottest game of 1995, but as a testament to just how quickly technology and gaming trends were moving in the 1990s, by the time it was released just under 2 years later, time had already passed it by.\n\nWhich is a shame, as this very well could have been the best game of 1995 had it been release just a year earlier. Despite the limitations of its engine, in its design the game is arguably a missing link between “Doom” and “Thief.”  The game world is highly interactable, with lots of objects to click and use.  Levels are also sprawling, labyrinthine, and nearly open world.  They rarely close off once you finish them, so if you really wanted to you could walk from one end of the game world to the other.  Plus, barring a few tedious, late game, mazes and switch throwing, the puzzles are mostly pretty fun and reminiscent of some of “Thief’s” best.\n\nThe best part, however, is the plot, which is a completely silly hodge-podge of b-horror films, 90s comic book clichés (there are undertones of both Garth Ennis’ “Preacher” and Neil Gaiman’s “Sandman”), and even, in the game’s dimension hoping with a female sidekick, shades of “Dr Who.”  Of course, comparing RotH to any of these sources is giving it way too much credit.  Its FMV sequences are often leaden and stretch on way too long, suffering from the bad, soap opera, editing technique where the video cuts to super long reaction shots of characters looking pensive after every single thing anyone says.  Plus, things get nonsensical fast, and about half way through the game, the FMV sequences mostly just focus on people appearing to tell you what absurd, magical artifact you have to track down next, before disappearing.  But, honestly, bad acting, z-grade special effects, and nonsensical plots are the main reason for playing 90s FMV games….so I mean none of this as a criticism.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does show its age in some less enjoyable ways. Combat sucks, enemies tend to have way too many hit points, and strafe is locked to the “.” and “,” keys, which makes it unnecessarily difficult at times.  Likewise, in the grand tradition of old-school adventure games, many puzzles come down to pixel hunts, a fact which is made all the more frustrating by the fact that you have to search pixels both above and below you, rather than just on a flat 2D plane.\n\nThat said, RotH is such a bizarre genre mash-up that could never have been made at any other point in gaming history, that I couldn’t help but find it charming, despite its flaws.   This is exactly the game I dreamt of making as a kid back in 1995, when “Doom” and Sierra adventure games were my main obsessions. And ultimately its a facinating look back at an entirely unique species in the evolution of FPSs, despite (or, perhaps, because of) the fact that many of its unique genetic mutations have since been selected out of the gaming population.","November 14, 2014","true","12.2"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","3"

I've never played it before or back in the day so this was a first impression.  It's such a huge 20 chapter adventure of FPS, scares, puzzles, cutscene movies and story, that you get so engaged in it, it really feels like you are controlling a character in a movie.\n\nThe graphics are impressive for the time, the mapping especially is so well thought out and designed that I was always amazed whenever I arrived at a new location.  It's not all hallways and darkness, there's such a variety of fantasy like locations that it never gets dull.\n\nThe puzzle solving is done just right, from simple switches and keys to brain teasers and physical mazes, it's nicely mixed with the action and story throughout the chapters.  I didn't find the puzzles to be overly complex, just enough to give you a good hard think.\n\nThe music being midi was ok but feels a bit underwhelming for such a movie like game, a CD soundtrack would of really enhanced the experience like what games consoles of the time would have back then, but it's still nice and eerie.\n\nThe inventory system is interesting, split into different categories where you can examine your items and read parchments to engage you more into the plot.  It does take a bit of getting used to, between using an object with the environment, on yourself, or just holding it and finding out you've accidently switched it with something else.\n\nThe controls take some adapting to, following a guide to remap them to WASD is highly recommended, then it's a matter of how to shoot.  Since the mouse is not locked to the screen, this gives you a bit of freedom.  The gun will follow your mouse arrow around, so with enough practice you can take out enemies from different sides of the screen without moving an inch.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, they are pretty ugly and creepy, often spawning out of nowhere which can give you some scares.  I recommend not leaving any alive else you will probably bump into them later on.\n\nA good variety of weapons are to be found, guns, swords, wands and more, all having a unique look to them, and at times saving you ammo since some self recharge, very happy with those.\n\nI found the difficulty to be very fair, if you have a good handle on the controls and don't mind a bit of puzzle solving, you can progress at a good pace.\n\nOverall the story that this tells is done so well, with plenty of characters, good and evil, plot twists and mystery unravelling along the way.  I couldn't wait to find out what happens next, where I was going to travel to or the puzzles I was going to solve.  They really don't make games like this anymore, highly recommended!","September 9, 2014","true","25.7"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","1"

YEt, at the same time, it also has some really interesting ideas. Items can be examined in detail, for example, and discussed with your partner. The horror is also drawn mainly from atmosphere, rather than jump scares. And the story is long, complicated, interesting and doesn't talk down to you. The interface too is surprisingly effective and fun.\n\nDon't get me wrong; the AI is hokey, the FMVs are often bizarre and the level design is atrocious at times.

AI is clunky, controls are stiff, music is sub-par, but still it not only succeeds, but passes with flying colors as a game wholly unlike any other. It's atmospherically excellent, surprisingly being genuinely chilling and sometimes downright frightening despite its obvious age. The gameplay itself is fairly standard — proceed throughout the corridors, shoot, solve puzzles, and generally explore the wonderful environments to further the story. Oddly enough, the story is very engrossing in its overall simplicity but also its complexity, which somehow both describe it perfectly despite being antonyms. Even with its cons, there is something so bizarrely charming and alluring about it, and it delivered one of the best experiences I have ever had in gaming.\n\nThere is a palpable amount of love, care, and attention put into this game, and it shines through in every moment.

As Adam enters the haunted house, the doors locks behind him and he is forced to journey throughout the entire house while looking for answers as well as means of escaping it.\nAdam soon discovers the house contains portals to several different universes, and that he is the Chosen One who must prevent the final apocalypic battle between the forces of good and evil. From time to time you meet several guidances that share knowledge with you and assist you in your quest.\n\nRealms of the Haunting has an interesting way of gameplay and story. From time to time, cinematics are played to inform the player more about the current state of the story. These cinematics are nicely done because it blends real-life characters with the virtual game world. However the game has a very complex level design which is sometimes confusing and you have to find your way out. Luckily maps can be found and inside your inventory, hints about items are given.  Also the puzzles can be very challenging which makes this game not easy but that makes it challenging. The controls for movement and shooting are somewhat awkward and cannot be easily changed but that's something you must learn to get used to. Realms of the Haunting is a game that is far ahead for its time and a true gem to play.\n\nIf you are into shooter-, adventure-, puzzle, horror- or retrogames, then Realms of the Haunting is definitely the game for you!

Someone will tell you it's a Doom clone, and that would be too reductive. Some other will tell you it's an adventure, but that would mean discounting away the combat focus. And it's also a bit of a platformer, a horror story (complete with 90s videogame "quality" live-action scenes), and why not, something of a survival. It's many things at once, and for a good part, it succeeds in mixing them.\n\nPerhaps we could say System Shock is the closest match. Hybrid mouse-keyboard interface, shooting and adventure elements, sprawling map with lots of backtracking. However, ROTH can't quite reach the greatness of SS, if only because it falls down after the first half, whereas Looking Glass' masterpiece keeps a crescendo throughout almost the entire game.\n\nYes, because while the controls can take a while to get used to, the first half of the game has the player exploring amazingly well-made mansions and temples, solving interesting (if hard) puzzles, being kept on their toes by dangerous but fair enemies, and generally following a gripping story. And then, the second half is ruined by generic otherwordly locations, obtuse puzzles, annoying enemies, and a plot that just stops making any sense.\n\nI still recommend playing it, if only for the first half. As I said before, few games are like it, and for the time its quality stays up, it's genuinely one of the most interesting adventure-horror-shooters... screw that, one of the most interesting games around, period. It received a sort of spiritual successor in Clive Barker's Undying, which shares some of the same strengths and faults, fixing a few problems and introducing some new ones. Both games are well worth checking out, as long as you can forgive some issues.","November 1, 2014","true","0.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

I played it soooo many times that I lost count!\n\nyou know a game is old when the exit game button is entitled "quit to DOS"!!!\n\nThe game itself is a perfect example of the way a story should be told, it has an extremely deep story line carefully melded with an intricate level of spooky goings on and damn nasty little creatures.\n\nThe game starts in a mansion/ haunted house where Adam has been summoned to check out his fathers last footsteps,  its evident when you get there that its no normal mansion.  Adam soon gets involved in a battle of the supernatural far beyond what was expected!\n\nThe game is designed with real actor footage and you can quite easily lose 40hrs+ of your life to its well developed story.\n\nIt is one of my fondest memories and i still own the game in its original format and now on steam.\n\nHighly reccomended to all, especially Amnesia fans and fans of games with really deep story lines.\n","October 29, 2014","true","0.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The atmosphere is superb throughout the game with some genuinely scary moments, that still look and feel great today despite the game’s age. The only problem I encountered was the dubious control scheme that seems to require four hands to play as keys like jump, strafe, and movement are scattered all over the keyboard. I expect this would turn off many gamers, but there are patches online that fix this, and honestly, it did not bother me too much once I got used to it. The story is engaging and well told through motion-captured clips and diaries scattered throughout the game, but multiple endings would have made the game feel more complete. Overall, though, Realms of the Haunting is a classic.","January 10, 2015","true","16.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phaota/recommended/292390/","phaota","Phaota","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phaota/","71 products in account","Loved this game when it first came out in 1997 and played it a LOT.  Back then, it was quite scary at times.  Sure, the gameplay can be a bit repetitive and the enemies are very stupid A.I. wise, but it's still fun to play.  My two main complaints about bringing it to Steam is that it should have been updated to use the w-a-d-s keys for movement instead of the arrow buttons and the graphics ought to have been overhauled.  Back in the day, the visuals were top notch, now they look like old .gif files.  This goes more so with the full motion video cutscenes.  Here, we have a problem.  The audio is missing from them.  Another small issue is the lack of a keyboard layout setting so you can customize your keys.  Even with the issues, it's fun to have the chance to play this title again after all these years.  I still have my four CD-ROM jewel case set of the original 90s release, with the 50 pages booklet that came with it.  This is a good thing since I can call upon that for help.  BTW, for those that need to know, Page Up/Down keys for Looking Up/Down, Home/End sets your viewing angle tilt, ~ tilde key turns your run mode on/off, A key is jump, Z for crouch, H key displays mouse/keyboard functions and I key is your Inventory/Settings button menu.  Double Clicking on green health potions in the menu while make your character drink it.  You can't go past mid-point in the health bar though.  Holding down both mouse buttons at the same time will give you free view mode so you can pan the camera around the environment.","November 6, 2014","true","0.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/recommended/292390/","76561197983662248","TechieRefugee","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983662248/","714 products in account","To start: I used to add a header to these reviews, but since it often made the review too long to submit, I've opted to leave it on my Backloggery.\n\nGameplay: Realms of the Haunting is one of those games that I was both quite interested by and somewhat leery about. I was interested in this game for a few reasons: one, it's a hybrid of point and click adventure games and first person shooters; second, the premise looked really cool; and third, it was Let's Played by one of my favorite Youtubers (Kikoskia, for those curious). I was also leery about it, because this is a game made by Gremlin Interactive, the same company that made Normality, a game that had puzzles designed by people from a far-off land in which PCP fills the air. Fortunately, this game doesn't have quite as insane puzzle design as Normality, but it does get kinda silly at times. Also, there's quite a few "key-for-a-key" moments throughout the game. Thankfully, the developers put in an "Easy Mode" in which, once activated, clicking on a puzzle object will automatically use the relevant item in your inventory. Honestly, I don't see why they bothered with this; the only thing "Easy Mode" removes is the impulsive rubbing of objects on walls/locks/enemies/whatever.\n\nAs for the game's shooting, it's... different. Also, the controls are... different. Essentially, what happens is that you move as one would in old-school FPSes by using the arrow keys (also, I'd recommend checking the Steam Forums to learn how to change the control scheme, since in-game this game doesn't have customizable controls) while independently moving the cursor around with the mouse. The game does a quite bad job at explaining the controls to you as well; a great example being the consumption of healing salves. You'd think that you could just equip it and hit the use button, right? Nope. What you've gotta do is go into the inventory, left-click on the salve, then right-click on the same icon to use it. Pretty terrible, and the game makes no effort to explain this to you. In fact, I don't even think it was in the manual (although I couldn't really be arsed to read it; the controls should've just been a lot more intuitive).\n\nAnyways, as far as combat goes, rather than point your crosshairs at the enemies, you instead click on the enemy when they are in your viewport. This means that it's impossible to miss your shot (unless you're using weapons that spawn projectiles as opposed to hitscanning), which is a great thing; ammo is kinda scarce. Most enemies pose no threat to you, so long as you're not rubbing your head on their chests or something. There really aren't that many enemies that have projectiles, and they only show up midgame and beyond. There's quite a few weapons in the game, but a lot of the later weapons are functionally the same.\n\nNow, you may notice that I've only spent about eight hours on this game. This game can take a while longer, if you're patient and decide not to run everywhere. If you do feel like running everywhere, I can easily see a few hours being taken off of this game. Even then, there will be a lot of time gained from backtracking and Item Rubbing Quests. Because of this, I kinda feel like this game has about 40% padding and 60% actual content. The 60% is pretty dang good, but the 40% brings ya down (especially the Brain Hunt in Chapter 16; that was absolute garbage). Because of this, I'll give this game a 7/10 for the gameplay.\n\nStory: It's pretty dang good, actually. If you like the older Shin Megami Tensei games like Nocturne and the Famicom games, this one will be right up your alley, if admittedly not as theologically interesting. It is primarily a story in which the story pushes the characters along, opposed to character arcs driving the story. You play as Adam Randall, a man who is trying to investigate some really weird goings-on with his dad, who he hasn't had much of a relationship with. Adam's perceived goal is in an abandoned mansion, but this mansion is a bit different. A bit... eldritch in nature. Then Belial shows up and things get interesting. WIthout spoiling too much, just know that if you're looking for incredible character arcs, this ain't the game for you. If you're looking for some jolly fisticuffs between angels and demons, you've come to the right place. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: One disappointing thing straight out of the gate: this game's maximum resolution is 640x480. There's really nothing I found that I was able to do about that. However, given that this game is an FMV game made for Windows 95, it's a damned miracle this game even runs on a modern OS (and yes, I know it uses DOSbox, so it's not really that much of a surprise, but trust me; I know about getting FMV games to run on modern OSes). Even though the world and the textures may not be the highest-fidelity things out there, there is one thing this game gets right: the art style. It's really, really good. Seriously, the sight after opening the Sarcophagus is absolutely impressive. They did a really excellent job on this front. Also, I belive Gremlin Interactive's engine is based off of BUILD, so expect some really weird texture warping as you turn and tilt the camera if you don't already going into the game. Despite some residual technical issues that this game has, it still manages to look really top notch for '96, even holding some very impressive sights to this day. 4/5.\n\nSound: The voice acting isn't bad, but it's nothing that will really blow you away. The OST and sound design on the other hand, are actually quite good. One of the big standouts of this game is its music, which does a fantastic job setting up the mood of the area, even if it sometimes forgets to turn off the intense music after the intense stuff is long gone. As for the sound design, it's also done quite well; the monsters, the guns, all kinds of other ambient effects... they're all really good. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/8/4/4; cumulative score of 7.7/10. It's one of those games that has aged somewhat, but given that there is a lot of quite high quality content in this game, this age can be fairly easily ignored, save for Chapter 16's Brain Hunt which is still the worst part of the entire game.","October 31, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Ive tried so many times to run this game at home but my family laptop couldnt support that resolution (it really couldnt ^^).\nSo i was used to go to a friend to play this game after homeweorks with his dad shouting because he wanted to play flight simulator. Thos times.\nGame works perfectly on steam,as far as i played it through, and the story is very intriguing,there are some cinematics and even if the gameplay graphic is not that beautiful now,the game is very entertaining with a good dark atmosphere.\n\nYou will adventure as Adam Randall which ventures into a house to investigate the circumnstances of father's death.\nAs he is trying to reach a clue about it,Adam will have to solve puzzles, fighting his way with dark creatures and he will then realize that there are some parallel univerese linked to this place.\n\nThe game will allow players to save whenever they wish without using checkpoints, and you will have some vareiety of weapons into your arsenal to ensure you that you will be safe in the horde of creatures that  will try to block your advance. However,  the game is much more puzzle based then what a classic FPS is.\n\nI will give this game a 10/10 because i usually dislike fps. But this game has a great horror/dark atmosphere that keeps me playing.","March 1, 2015","true","2.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","7","12","2","0"

I was amazed by its graphics, the good acted FMV scenes and the VERY well written storyline. Good to see that the game wasn't forgotten, and brought to Steam. I bought it again, and gonna probably play it again a couple of times. ^^\n\n\nFor the ones that don't know, this is a first person shooter (in the veins of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D), but with a horror theme, light adventure elements (an inventory system, interactions with the environment, etc). And the game also has an AMAZING story, told by great (even if a bit corny) FMV scenes (with real actors).  The game aged quite a bit, but its still quite playable. The soundtrack is still very good (and very creepy), the sound effects are still very realistic, and the gameplay is still fun to play.\n\nOh, and the game is quite long for a FPS. Not only there are 2 or so hours of FMVs, you also have some nice puzzles to solve, LOTS of enemies to fight and quite a few maps to explore. Don't expect to beat this game in less than 10 hours on your first try, specially if you don't use walkthroughs.\n\n\nVery good classic, quite recommended for old coots like myself. :p\n","April 25, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The plot is revealed at an excellent pace and many moments of this game will make both your jaw drop and a will put a nostalgia tear right in your eye.\nStill reminds me of classic horror literature, of the old Stephen King and some Lovecraft novels.\nIf you are a horror fan but did not play this....I have bad news for you!!!","May 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

There is no direction and the levels are huge but you never know what to do. There is no level saving or anything, and no quicksave, so you must remember to manually save. I wasn't able to move forward because of a glitch that every time I stepped on this floor you need to walk through to get back to this hall, you would be hurt and teleported to this different area. It made no sense and clearly was not mean to be like that because the walkthrough I looked at didn't mention it and discussed it as if you just had to get back to an area. And since all my saves were close to where I was and the bug was still there I couldn't just restart the level because the game doesn't save at each level. 4/10.

By the time I did have a good computer I was onto other games like Sin and Half-Life.\n\nI picked it up for just over a dollar on the Christmas sale - and I am extremely happy I did. This game is like the best of everything I remember from my early years of gaming.\n\nI am nearly finished now - and it has been a surprisingly solid experience considering it is nearly 20 years old. It is definitely dated - the corridor like mazes and underwhelming shooting come to mind. But the adventure elements are fun and I haven't found the need for a walkthrough yet (I am on chapter 14 currently).\n\nThe level design for the most part is really good considering the 2.5d engine - the mansion in particular feels like an actual place with lots of interactive scenery and secrets to find. The graphics are also well drawn and the 3d modeling that is present really help the atmosphere thoughout the game.\n\nThe voice acting is solid - though the FMV cutscenes are like watching a low budget knock off of an episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark. Luckily the story is interesting and the characters are likable.\n\nI do recommend this game to anyone who grew up with games from this era and anyone who is interested in retro gaming - especially if it is on sale.","January 5, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/292390/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","OK, I'm going to be honest here. I only bought this on Steam becase I wanted to write a review of it, I love it that much.\n\nThis game brings back amazing memories.   Realms of the Haunting (or ROTH) is a superb game.  It probably looks quite dated now, but in the same way as Ultima Underworld... It's dated, but you can still have a damn good time playing it.\n\nIt was the first game to really play with the whole 3d-as-an-immersive-experience thing... teleporting to other "dimensions", random turns which end you up where you started... All great fun.  most games before it were simplistic 3d (Doom, Heretic, Wolf3d, Rise of the Triad etc).. This\n\nROTH (or Rise of the Helmet) as we used to call it in homage to Rise of the Triad, starts you off in a mansion that you're sent to (for some plot-crucial reason).  There, you discover that something is amiss, and you're there to sort the place out.  Before long, you start to question whether the things that are going on in the mansion are actually part of something a bit bigger.... At this point, I won't go any further, but suffice to say the game gets a whole lot more interesting than a creepy mansion-crawl.  Not to detract from the mansion at all.  Considering the level engine, the mansion is actually huge, and great fun (albeit scary fun) to explore...\n\nRight from the start, ROTH sets the scene with amazing textures, fun spooky things happening, and a creature-spawn system which is neither random, nor predictable.      As you're getting your feet at the beginning of the game, you can end up dying a lot... As you progress though, you start to amass an interesting and diverse arsenal.  The end is a little like Painkiller: You end up using a lot of what you have, because it all has it's own place and uses.\n\nThe game isn't very polished.. it has flaws here and there.  But as an immersive, fun, interesting, different experience, I have to say ROTH has everything you need.   If you enjoyed DooM-era games with a  theme/twist (I'm looking at you Duke Nukem, System-Shock and Dark Forces), and you like a bit of suspense (kinda looking at Doom3, but more looking at System Shock), then you'll probably enjoy ROTH.\n\nThere are one or two puzzles that it can help to have a guide handy for.  Not because they're hard, but because they use mechanics that aren't often employed, so you can be forgiven for not thinking of it.\n\nWELL worth a few quid, and about 10 to 15 hours of your time.  Grab a slice of nostalgia and play a golden oldie.\n","January 7, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why? Because I really, really like it.\n\nGraphically, the game hasn't aged well, unfortunately. It came along at this time when everybody was transitioning from sprite-based 3D games to polygon-based 3D games, and rather than develop a new engine, the creators chose to use the revamped engine from their own game "Normality". Possibly the game was already in development when Quake came out and it would have cost too much to start again. It's still fairly pretty though, except for the low-resolution textures.\n\nSonically, the game is amazing. On the whole the voice acting is very good (David Learner, yeah!) except for a couple of overly-hammy moments, but the sound effects are where the game shines. The rolling thunder in and around the house, the whispered voices in the Tower, the sloshing of water and crunching of rats as you pass over them all add tremendously to the effect.\n\nGameplay wise, the game was quite innovative for the time. The developers themselves say in the making-of video they didn't want to just do "Doom [with] some cruddy logic", and what you have here is more of a point-and-click adventure game done from a first-person perspective, with some gunplay. For some reason people say this game is hard and you don't get enough healing potions, but I never had that problem. Maybe I've just played it too much. The controls may also be a pain for you if you're used to WASD with mouse, but I'd just come from playing Duke Nukem 3D and so found them quite intuitive.\n\nThe story of the game is it's highlight, though. What seems like a straight forward "investigate a strange house" plot quickly expands into something that covers the Knights Templar, the Book of Revelations, and a madman's plot to incarnate Satan in physical form. Yes. Whilst some of the plot is told via cut-scenes, a lot of the backstory is gleaned from scrolls, books and letters found around the place, so they can be missed.\n\nI highly recommend this game, although do perfectly understand those who think it hasn't aged well. And I'll admit the last couple of chapters where they throw in some puzzles that have nothing to do with the plot can be frustrating, but there's always walkthroughs for that....","February 22, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, the keyboard mapping SUCKS (a common theme with DOS games, I guess), and while there's no easy way to rebind the keys, you can search for "realms of the haunting wasd" and come up with a guide that details how to change the mapping to a far more acceptable form. Lastly, the game has several commands that are NOT explained in game and are quite tricky to figure out on your own, like how to use potions, but this is from an era in which you were expected to read the manual, so read the manual, will save you quite a bit of headache.\n\nThe Good: It's a curious mix of old-timey FPS and point n' click games. While you do carry a wobbly gun around and mow down demons in sharp-cornered corridors, you also spend much of your time investigating objects, reading notes and solving puzzles. The story is a fairly clichéd good-vs-evil epic, but has some interesting twists here and there and never feels truly boring. Another novel point is the extensive use of FMV for the cutscenes, and would you believe it? They're actually great! Somehow, the actors do an excellent job and come off as not only believable but genuinely interesting and likeable (even if your female counterpart seems close to breaking down in laughter at times where she really shouldn't).\nThe graphics are... well, I can't really say they're great, but they're perfectly serviceable and just about what you'd expect from this kind of game. If you're used to Build engine games this really shouldn't be any different. Level design IS very good though, and does a great job of creating "alien" worlds for you to traverse, especially in the second half of the game. The game does have an annoying tendency to put you in mazes, but fortunately there's (almost) always a map for you to refer to.\nWeapon selection is very varied and interesting, even if most of the weapons boil down to the same thing. You have your classic pistol and shotguns, moving on to mystical staves, wands, swords that shoot bolts of light and even a shield; while ammo does seem in terribly short supply early on, most of the weapons you get after the first two recharge a while after being shot, so you'll find yourself cycling through 4-5 weapons to fire at every single enemy. Not only that, but your fists do almost as much damage as the pistol and have surprising range, so fisticuffs is actually a very reasonable choice.\nIn another deviation from the norm, you can also examine damn near every item you come across (with voice acting, too!), and you get a female sidekick early on; while she's never visible in-game, not even in mirrors, she's constantly commenting on things you see, and you can enter in-depth conversations with her about important plot points that really flesh out the story. The game has a fair lot of puzzles, and thankfully, few to none of them are of the dreaded "pixel hunt" or "using obnoxious item in unexpected place" kinds, though some of them are very much brutal.\nLastly, the game caps off at anywhere between 10 to 17 hours, depending on how quick you are to solve problems and how much of the optional material you decide to investigate.\n\nThe Evil: A few areas and puzzles have needlessly convoluted or extremely hidden solutions, requiring you to poke and prod at damn near everything on the scenery in the hopes that you find the one sword that spins and opens a secret passage. Other areas are very maze-like (sometimes actual mazes), extremely hard to navigate, and don't always have maps.\nIn-game written texts, like manuscripts and books, are very hard to read due to the low resolution, and I've pretty much skipped most of them. Don't worry, the characters themselves usually narrate the plot-important bits.\nThe game does feel very old and might come off as unappealing if you're not really used to old FPSes without precise aiming and... well, looking up and down quickly.\n\nThe Verdict:If you can get it for free, get it for free (no, I don't mean piracy, you scallywag). If you can't anymore, buy it if you have any interest in old-style FPS, particularly of the Build engine kind, and like solving puzzles.

I like the look of this game. Don't mind the graphics at all.  I like how you shoot your gun. You just click your pointer on the enemy . Like anyone who knows old games there's no strafe. Which is fine. Game is easy in the sense that the enemy's I've encountered (only two types) are slow moving. That does not make it easy though. I still died, and have not reached a save point the few time''s I've tried. I haven't really done any puzzles yet besides getting past the first room, but I'm liking the game so far.  Glad to have purchased this hidden gem.\n\nLast time I died is when you...... *very minor tactical spoiler* .....get the shotgun. 4 Swords a slicin. 3 hens a alaying. 2 turtledoves and one very low health bar....\n\nOh I don't know if you guys (whoever has the rights to this game) has the rights to Normality, but that one would be awesome to be on steam!\n\nI figured out how to save. F9 is quicksave it only saves for the moment. Once you exit the game, or go to the main menu (after you die) then you will lose your quicksave. If you want to save the permanent way where you can load it (you can save at any point in the game by the way) then you bring up your inventory using: I.\n\nThen I guess theirs a floppy disk icon?

I was home sick from work one day and was looking through my Steam list and decided to give it a go. The game has plenty of value, there's many hrs of gameplay in this title and although the controls feel odd & the graphics are a little dated you can tweak the dosbox config files to give you a little bit better picture.\n\nYou move around using the arrow keys, with caps lock as toggle run, A as jump, E as use and I to open your inventory. To drink a potion you must press I to open inventroy then left click it so it's in your "hand" then press U on the keyboard to use it. Kind of crazy system but once you get used to it then it's alright.\n\nThe combat is interesting because it has melee weapons as well as ranged, it can be hard to judge the melee range at times so I find it best to just stand back and spam the attack button until a hit collides then backpedal and keep swinging again.\n\nSimilar to other games of the time there are a number of puzzles you must solve by finding items hidden throughout the area and then using them on a certain object to continue. Thankfully this version of the game has the update that enables "easy puzzle mode" which auto equips the correct item when attempting to use something so you don't have to madly try everything in your inventory on everything, this cuts down on much frustration and makes for an overall more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe story is told through strange live action FMVs with terrible green screening, they look really bad by todays standards but the storyline is suitably cheesy that it just seems to work, I feel if the subject was more serious then the low quality would detract from it but I still found the FMVs enjoyable with their retro charm.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game although I must say I preface this by mentioning I got the game free from an indiegala giveaway so you may be able to find someone who doesn't want their code that you can get it free from. Worth a look at this title to see what the state of gaming was back then as it feels pretty well made.","April 8","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are kinda funky, but not impossible to get used to. With the right amount of patience the game can be very enjoyable. It also has a very good story line, which is much longer than one would expect from a DOS game.\n\nFor what it is: 4/5","May 20","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Played it when was younger and it scared the crap outa me. Got it to reminise and it still scared the crap out of me. It's a horror puzzle solving game at its best with an interesting story and twist ending. Even when the game starts you get chills down your spine with the monster eye opening. The only bad thing is the controls were not updated to allow mouse look around. It is wasd  to move and arrow keys to look and then use mouse to search which takes some getting used to. Get over the controls and the dated graphics and its a fantastic game","June 4","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
