"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marlech/recommended/91700/","Marlech","Marlech","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Marlech/","354 products in account","Many people buy this game thinking they're buying a System Shock or a Deus Ex. Maybe a Borderlands or a STALKER. This is an incorrect assumption to make. It's true that EYE features many RPG elements. It has dialogue, branching paths, levels, inventory management, stores and side-missions. But this is all plays second fiddle to what EYE is really aiming for. It's not a Deus Ex as much as it is a Serious Sam. It's not a Borderlands as much as it is a Painkiller. I really cannot emphasize this enough, it's my belief that the majority of the complaints directed towards EYE stem from a false presupposition of what this game is trying to be. That is not the players fault though, because EYE doesn't exactly make these things clear.\n\nEYE is a mess.\n\nUnless you are a Dwarf Fortress player, EYE is likely to be the biggest, messiest game you are ever likely to see. Right off the bat it gives you a character creation screen which makes absolutely no sense to anyone beginning the game without first googling what in the hell you are looking at. The dialogue is either intentionally vague, bizarre and most of the time incomprehensible. You will be thrown into a world which appears to have some sort of lore and backstory but you'll be lucky if you ever understand a tenth of what is going on. When the game presents you with the tutorial level, many aspects of that tutorial will need tutorials themselves, and you will be confronted with a library of tutorial videos on how certain game mechanics work. Your body can be hacked and destroyed by doors and ATMs. Sometimes huge monsters will appear in the level and fire rockets in directions you didn't even know existed and you have to kill it. Sometimes you'll be tasked to kill a high ranking enemy and he will zip about the game shooting and cloaking tanking hits like nothing else. This game is primarily single-player, but you can have 64-player coop. You can buy spells and augmentations and guns and big hammers all with a currency called Brozouf which you seem to endlessly gain in areas where you are doing something for some reason for someone. EYE is a deranged and twisted mess of Syndicate, Neuromancer, Warhammer 40k and the entire personal drug stash of Hunter S. Thompson. And you know what? It's amazing.\n\nThere is no messing around with regenerating health, cover or killcams. You can go in fast and furious or heavy like robocop. The guns feel like they should. There is real impact when you shoot something. Enemies will go flying across the screen. You can teleport into people and laugh as they explode. You can hit people in the face with giant hammers and watch as they bounce off the walls. You can hack people. You can force push four-armed creatures into radioactive goo. You can block bullets with swords. This game can be anything you want, but above all it is satisfying.\n\nIf you get this game, it's imperative that you know what you getting into. If you want a cyberpunk dystopia with thought provoking dialogue and choices that mean something, I don't advise you to get this game. If you want a crazy FPS that is a completely unapologetic mess that explains nothing but offers everything then I would strongly recommend this game.","February 5, 2014","true","50.3"," 772 of 794 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","772","794","0","15"

I could go on. It is a fairly convincing argument, in that I can't say there is any particular gameplay element that hasn't been done in another game, in some cases, better than E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. But there's something about the way all the numerous elements are put together that turns the game into something inexplicably unique.\n\nE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy was supposedly inspired by the creator's own tabletop RPG, and it shows. Leveling attributes, purchasing equipment, diverging quests and storylines, it is all pretty standard, but solid and really well thought out. Guns feel satisfying to use, and don't even get me started about the sword that explodes things. There's this super bizarre art-style as well, and this impenetrably complicated backstory. It plays like a lucid dream, and like a dream, it makes sense while you're in it, but once you wake up you're able once again to reflect on how absurd it was.\n\nIn fact, this game is so odd, it defies criticism. Every complaint I can render can be immediately turned into a selling point.\n\nThe confusing state of affairs and alliances in the story that would normally frustrate me is actually perfectly appropriate. It reflects how little you know about this strange place and adds weight to decisions. Frankly, it parallels how little I know about real world history, and that actually seems appropriate.\n\nThe difficult hacking is incredibly hard to master, but a door can literally hack me back and kick my face in. Spending 10 minutes hacking a gunship to be back-hacked 5 times before finally succeeding and using the gunship to level a platoon of enemies is a great feeling.\n\nThe bizarre interactions with enemies that can literally cause your character to have a mental breakdown, start hallucinating and uncontrollably shoot all your allies. This is a win-win situation when playing with your buddies. Just trust me, it is.\n\nThe severe lack of explanation of controls gives this feeling of accomplishment to figuring out how to jump. The broken English adds to the atmosphere, the characters really seem like they're speaking another language, one designed to describe psychokinetic ghost monsters that we have no easy words for in our primitive language.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a very decent and enjoyable RPG FPS that takes every opportunity to completely screw with you mind. If you are a recovering drug addict and you're feeling withdrawal, this game could substitute for altering your state of mind. And that is why I love it.\n\nMy legs are OK.","June 25, 2014","true","54.7"," 345 of 352 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","345","352","0","3"

Some games teeter on the edge of madness. EYE jumps in headfirst, dragging you kicking and screaming into its surreal world. And when you come crawling out of its pool of LSD dreams and dialogue that makes you question your existence, you realize you had a great time all along, and jump back in.\n\nA fair warning: The game's mechanics are poorly explained, but instead of this being as big of a disappointment as you might think,  many people in the community will agree that's part of the experience. Everyone loads up  EYE and knows absolutely nothing about what they're getting into. And while you're trying to learn the mechanics, you will be faced with introspective dialogue, tight gunplay, and chopping monsters and people into little bits with your sword(s). Everything from the character creation to the way the game is played is left up to the player to figure out,  The weapons are all fun to use, with giant hammers, sniper rifles, assault rifles, SMGs, pistols, and swords all making their debut.\n\nYou can customize your character in many ways. Do you want to play an enigmatic hacker who sticks to the shadows with cyber technology cloaking his every movement, wielding a sniper rifle to deal death from afar? Or would you rather play a tank character with a minigun, Heavy armor, and three swords? How about a fast moving swordsman with cyber legs upgraded for super jump, wielding dual pistols and a submachine gun for those fast-paced gun fights? All of these are possible, though it will take either a couple playthroughs or reading some guides to figure out how. There are some heavy RPG elements like branching dialogue, character stats and upgrading, research, a magic system, and customization. This takes the form of various upgrades you can make to your character, enhancing certain skills, as well as upgrades you can purchase at your hub base (with some exploration).\n\nCo-op is a blast, though unfortunately most of the online community is dead. When I played there were only a handful of servers and only one or two of those were not password-protected or PvP.  Many times these mindless co-op matches would devolve into my allies and I running around with our medkit syringes, trying to use their overdose function to blow up tiny npc critters.\n\nThe level design is massive. You can spend a fair amount of time simply exploring one grimy street corner to another. There are also optional sidequests and characters throughout most levels.  Many times these characters will reward you with research or money.\n\nFor the current price ($10.00) definitely worth your time. It may not be the most polished game, but it's quite memorable, and I have yet to play another FPS like it.\n\n\nThings to consider when purchasing this game:\n- You will probably need to resort to a guide to even play this game at all, let alone figure out all the tricks it has.\n- It is not the most polished. Don't expect great graphics (however the gameplay is fine, with little to no bugs encountered)\n- It may require viewing all the tutorial videos included in the game or reading guides to understand some of the core mechanics\n- online multiplayer (both PvE and PvP) is mostly dead.\n- There is the potential for multiple playthroughs/replayability\n\n8/10\nI have no idea what's going on, there's insanity everywhere, and my legs are OK.","November 17, 2014","true","13.0"," 330 of 344 people (96%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","96","330","344","40","5"

(Quite conveniently there is a demo.)\n\nI will admit, I was afraid that this game would be next in a streak of bad purchases on my part. E.Y.E quickly showed me that my doubts were unfounded.\n\nE.Y.E is a combat focused fps/rpg, and the combat is amazing. In this game, an assault rifle is not a bullet hose; it is a deadly weapon with high recoil and each shot having extreme stopping power. The hunting rifle feels like it could kill a god. The Damocles sword causes explosions on hit and can block bullets.\n\nIn addition to all that, your play style can be augmented with powers such as the cloak (A la Crysis) or the dermal sheath to enhance your armor. You can obtain spells that can drive a target insane to stir up chaos within a horde or you can implode an enemy and teleport to where it used to be.\n\nMost of this is unlocked by spending money (Brouzouf) at the temple HQ. In addition to that, you spend money to purchase cybernetic upgrades anywhere which enhance your powers and statistics.\n\nIn addition to all that, you can save multiple characters that play wildly differently.\n\nNow for the bad stuff. This game is prone to bugs, including an unfortunate bug that causes saving to not work sometimes. That is the number one word of caution I'd issue to potential customers, but if you are willing to put up with it you will be rewarded.\n\nAs others have said, this game does not explain itself very well. I didn't have too much trouble getting into it, but some will. (I would suggest using auto skill point allocation on your first attempt.) A more diplomatic reviewer would say that there is a strong element of discovery; the fact that this game tells you so little means you can play for months and still find something completely new.\n\nAnd there are bizarre and often unnecessary mechanics such as sanity, which can be nullified by the research system. Dying has potential to leave a permanent statistical penalty, except that it's not really permanent. You can also get rid of that with the research system. (The research system being one of the most bizarre and unintuitive parts of the game.)\n\nHaving said all of that, I would still strongly recomend this title to anybody that has patience for a game that is a little rough around the edges. Very few games are as rewarding as this, and for $10 it is an excelent value.","November 25, 2013","true","214.2"," 338 of 366 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","338","366","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/balls_of_ice/recommended/91700/","balls_of_ice","Scopedog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/balls_of_ice/","387 products in account","You have to admire a game with ambition. Unfortunately, sometimes, a game shoots for the moon and misses – a game with incredible ambition just may not have the budget or staff to fully realise those ideas, but you have to give credit to a developer for trying something a little different.\n\nE.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy does not shoot for the moon. It hammers together a death laser from twigs and spunk and accidently blows up an orphanage. This game was sold to me as “Warhammer 40000 meets Deus Ex”, but really that does not do this game justice. Everything about E.Y.E is completely and irredeemably mad.\n\nThings start as they mean to continue. The game immediately asks you to create a character with a baffling recombinant genetic system – various genes are spliced together to form a statistical framework for your character, with absolutely no indication what the various stats might be used for nor how they’re calculated. This quickly becomes a running theme throughout this game, as you’re dumped into the universe with absolutely no clue what is going on - either in the games utterly labyrinthine underlying system, or in the bonkers story that surrounds it.\n\nYou play a cyber-knight wizard from a monastic order of Space Templars – immediately familiar territory for fans of Games Workshop, though there’s definitely an underlying layer of French surrealism that goes beyond the weirdest nonsense dribbled out of Nottingham. From what I can gather from the largely gibberish story, you are trying to topple a poorly defined federation, as well as dealing with a schism in your order which has lead to cyber wizard  infighting.  You also conveniently have amnesia, or cyberbrain damage, or something, though in a break from tired tradition everyone treats you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ whenever you ask any questions you should blatantly already know.\n\nThere’s also monsters that come from, or are maybe made out of something called the meta-streumonic force. This force seems to give you psychic powers (because of course it does), but is otherwise unexplained. It mainly serves to add a bit of enemy variety, though considering how annoying these monsters are to fight, you might wish the developers hadn’t bothered.\n\nE.Y.E. is an RPG/shooter hybrid, one that takes heavy influence from genre luminaries Deus Ex and System Shock 2. The abilities and equipment available to even a starting character is surprisingly vast. In addition to the expected cybernetic upgrades, there are also psychic powers – you begin the game with the ability to clone yourself three times, which in addition to giving the enemies more targets also have an admirable level of firepower, though they appear to have graduated from stormtrooper marksmanship academy. Most characters will choose to specialise as the higher levels of psychic powers, cybernetic upgrades and weapons are only available to characters with an appropriately high stat. Unusually, every stat is useful, and it is quite possible to make a “jack of all trades” character without gimping yourself.\n\nThe actual missions are a hectic, sprawling and confused affair. The mission maps are absolutely enormous, and there are multiple ways to complete a mission with various styles that are effective. Combat wise, a character based on hacking and cyberwear might use his cloak to close , drop a drone and hack an enemies brain, whereas a psychic knight might teleport (well, telefrag) about the battlefield cleaving up enemies with the preposterously powerful melee options. Enemies respawn and mill about the place, and unfortunately are ridiculously accurate over long distances – early characters can often find themselves turned into cyber mulch before they even work out where fire is coming from.  This can make a sniper weapon even for close range beatsticks an unfortunate necessity.\n\nThe ways in which characters can complete objectives are also rather varied – hackers gain a variety of optional shortcuts, and most missions give you two or three ways to deal with a problem, including a diplomatic path. Now would be a suitable time to bring up the game’s dialogue, which is without exception mental. I’m not sure whether it’s a translation issue or the script was just this mad to begin with, but NPCs seem to switch characters multiple times throughout any interaction – a stoic character that starts out your best friend may become incredibly aggressive for no reason, or regress into surfer lingo. That last part is not a joke. In all honesty this just adds to the surreal atmosphere, and whether it was intentional or not it’s certainly entertaining.\n\nWhat is not entertaining is the way in which this game deals with death. I appreciate that there needs to be a penalty for failure, but this game is needlessly punitive and it very nearly soured me on the whole experience. Every time you die, there’s a chance you will gain a fatal injury – which vary from a minor to an enormous permanent stat decrease. Some of these are the equivalent of losing two or three whole character levels – and considering most people will finish the game at around lv25, this is not a small issue. There is a karma stat that influences the likelihood of these injuries occurring, but I never worked out what influenced it – it seemed to go up and down entirely randomly. A few early mistakes can forever cripple a character, and even with a VERY late game way of removing these injuries it feels like a very poorly thought out mechanic.\n\nHowever, if you can put up with the rough edges, there’s definitely an intriguing game buried in amongst the madness. You might not love E.Y.E, but you will certainly remember it – and that’s more than can be said for some games with a hundred times its budget.","October 17, 2014","true","32.2"," 163 of 171 people (95%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","95","163","171","21","3"

Before you waste away thousands of rifle rounds on hostile targets and feel frustrated with the unstable mechanics, this singular piece shall guide you through its uncanny corridors of ethereal aesthetics and awe-inspiring level design with cryptic conceptual texts and inhuman characters. What you are about to experience if you are ready to hit the “play” option on Steam is unlike any previous gaming session you have had.\n\nThese French developers allowed no boundaries of sanity to sink into the game’s foundations, and even when facing the predicaments of low-budget production in building a massive world, they resorted to landscapes of colossal, dead skyscrapers or Martian rocks and alien sacred ruins. E.Y.E. is, in most of its characteristics, a unique game, and its architecture and depressing lighting and feeling of constant hostility might scare the newcomer away; if not, then the never-ending enemy hordes with minute aiming are more likely to cause that effect later on. After surfacing from such unyielding challenges, you might still be able to enjoy its wonderful vistas and its almost perfect FPS traits intensely – featuring the most creative and challenging hacking system I have ever tried.\n\nThe death system is cruel, and unlike anything I have ever seen in RPGs. The infamous fatal wounds will drop your skill values permanently (at least until the BioRegen augmentations are researched), and Karma WILL weigh in against you when the dice of death roll. It is only one of the several nuisances that E.Y.E. will unfold (others include: the unrealistic spawning patterns, the unbalanced and unexplained mechanics, the sometimes unpolished visuals, the inconsistent research requirements, poor proofreading, etc.). But that obstacle is easily outtaken as your motor and psychological responses begin adapting to the game’s chaotic structure rapidly. The player may not feel comfortable with the vertiginous world that E.Y.E. portrays, but they shall respect the sensorial value of its audiovisual execution and the impact of its apparently “nonsensical” mythos about an unimaginably futuristic humanity that has populated several exoplanets and has fused cybernetics with the power of its psyche and dark thaumaturgy. Yes, the premise of the game goes that far.\n\nWith all of its annoying flaws, this game amazes me every time I start it up. Unsure if it is because of its psychedelic telling of a bleak and metaphysical future or because of its entertaining gameplay, I choose to take on a holistic perspective on it and appreciate its hindrances and virtues, since it allows for that luxury. All that being said, I certainly recommend this Deus Ex/System Shock/DooM/Warhammer 40K - FPS/RPG hybrid for any fan of any such items.","January 29, 2015","true","44.6"," 129 of 137 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","129","137","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/czeekykunt/recommended/91700/","czeekykunt","Holier Than Thou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/czeekykunt/","126 products in account","There has never been a game like E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy. It is just so lovably bizarre. So many aspects of it are fresh and new or just very well done. Some elements, however, are a bit lacking or broken resulting in a weird balance of bad and good (mostly good). Let's discuss.\n\nGameplay\nThis is the most important aspect of any game I'd say, and E.Y.E has mostly got that down fairly well. The guns are varied and a lot of the great ones are available right away. Some require purchase in an armory if you have enough money and the right skills. There is a leaning function that allows peaking around corners for surveying an area and picking off enemies before advancing. Great thing for an FPS. Careful when reloading because it expels that magazine and ALL the ammo in it, so get rid of your impulse reloading before playing, or you'll quickly find yourself in the battefield with your pants down because you got rid of all of your ammunition. The melee combat isn't the most intuitive, but it has the ability to block other melee attacks and even bullets! Healing can be done through a power called alchemy or a medkit (more on that later). There are other "powers" split into two groups: cybernetic abilities and PSI powers. The former are just manipulations of your cyber enhancements to jump higher, aim better, boost defense, etc. The latter are actual powers where your character focuses his "PSI force" to manipulate his enemies. These include teleporting inside of enemies, driving enemies insane, putting enemies into endless hypnosis, insta-killing, etc. Another interesting thing made easier in this cyberpunk world is hacking. There are five hacking commands: attack, mask, scan, shield, and overflow. These basically mean take away "cyber hp", decrese enemy offense, decrease enemy defense, up your defense, and up your offense (while slightly lowering your defense). Once your get the hang of it, you will come to masterfully use these in a special order in rapid succession to slowly whittle your enemy's cyber hp down to nothing and either destroy, possess, or gain access to whatever you were hacking. There is a singleplayer or co-op campaign and a couple multiplayer gamemodes which are general deathmatch or an explosive version of CTF. These are all the basic gameplay elements.\n\nCharacter\nYour character in this game has many options for classes he can pursue depending on your distribution of skill points. You can be a hulking brute that throws cars at people, a master marksman, an exceptional hacker, or just a jack of all trades. Ignore the karma system, for it is nonsensical and useless because it resets after enough time so you can go on a cute animal killing spree and then do nothing for a day and all will be well and you are a saint again. Wow, I must love run-ons. Anyway, there is a section for cybernetic upgrades to improve your cyborg body. They improve skills, give you more resurrectors for when you die, and increase the effectiveness of your cyber abilities. Cyber legs is the most important one no matter what. I'm telling you to really put your cash into that ♥♥♥♥ because it lets you go faster than the Flash and jump higher than the sky. The currency you can spend on upgrades and other stuff is called Brouzoufs. You earn these by existing. No, seriously, every time you go onto the battlefield and do things you accumulate more and more of this peculiar currency. At the field armory, you get to choose between light, medium, or heavy armor, so not so much customization in the fashion department, but that hardly matters as long as you are protected enough by your standards. The inventory is grid based, so you can't pack everything with you and you must make some compromises and think about whether you want to bring extra ammo or grenades; also if you go with a heavy weapon, bring a smaller backup so you don't blow yourself up fighting in close quarters. Also, careful when you die, because certain deaths like getting shredded by traps or falling into an abyss could result in a fatal wound which decreases skills. This game punishes deaths and I think that is good as punishment for death is good incentive to improve your performance. It sort of gets rid of the casuals. Finally, if you are paranoid -a result of the mental balance system which is affected by a skill and the amount of bullets being shot at you- or bleeding profusely, do maintenance, so you don't accidentally shoot your friend or bleed out and die. Now for story time.\n\nStory/Lore\nSadly, a lot of the lore is shoved into a small library and some elements of it sound like fiction written by a very imaginative 5th grader; however, it still incorporates many intriguing ideas and commentaries on the world (at least the in game world). Here's just the main story, read the lore later (it's complicated). The E.Y.E are a bunch of cyborg monks who are Japanese or something, but worship discount Norse gods. They are secretly funded by a bunch of corporations who hate the seemingly universal government known as (get ready for generic name) the Federation. So the E.Y.E fights the feds, however, there is a lot of infighting between two clans that formed: Culter Dei and Jian Shang Di. So the more Asian ones hate the less Asian ones and are trying to segregate themselves because of who knows what. Could be religious/spiritual beliefs, could be racial differences, could be differing ideas on strategy, or could be political beliefs. Maybe someone stole some Brouzoufs from the commander. Anyway, during all of this ♥♥♥♥, some force of werewolves, nude nuns with big guns, the distant cousin of the Doom imp, and tiny Xenomorphs are ravaging communities and are symbol of human faults. Your charcter must chose a path near the end of this mixed up war and side with one of three sides and then repeats. One thing to note is that a lot of the mission structure seems boring and a bit sloppy at times, but tolerable. You eventually do all three and you find yourself on a floating rock and discover you are basically quite sad and insane. That's the gist of it at least.\n\nResearch\nThis part deserves its own category because it is a fairly fresh and interesting idea, but it could be a bit more in depth and comes with some b.s. You select the amount of scientists to work on a research you found in the field. These are represented by silver briefcases. Anyway, the more scientists, the less time it takes, but the more scientist means more money you have to spend. When the research finishes after a number of in game days, you get something either really helpful or kind of useless. Some researches are required to unlock weapons or other researches. Some researches can even reverse the fatal wounds discussed earlier. Please, PLEASE research the medkit first thing or you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nThis game is something special. It was an ambitious project by a tiny French studio, but I'm sure you've heard the stories. The translations at times are laughably bad, and since it is essentially an ARPG, it has crits, but a lot of them, according to the game, are "bulls*it" and "ultra-failed". There are a few strange flaws, but they still add to the game's charm somehow. I recommend this very highly. It is a nice change from CS:GO or some other ridiculous Valve shooter/mulitplayer game. I explicitly mention Valve because it utilizes the Source engine, and very well I must say. Also, try and find some of the secrets or interesting side characters as they will provide you with a  nice chortle. I just really hope more people purchase this no matter how much because the community is sadly lacking. These are my thoughts on E.Y.E, and I hope you've thoroughly enjoyed reading this.

The result is EYE: Divine Cybermancy, a game with no limitations or respect for the rules of game design, with over the top action, incredibly in-depth, flexible and at times daunting character progression, abusable physics, insanely powerful weapons and an perplexingly convoluted, mind-numbing narrative coupled with a generous host of bugs, 16+ player coop and generally just absolutely crazy gameplay. EYE is SO crazy that the player character has a sanity meter, and when it dips low, he can suffer vivid halucinations. EYE gives the player numerous options for negotiating its sprawling stages: Where negotiation, hacking and stealth fail, the player can employ a varying array of firearms, melee weapons, cybernetic augments and psychic powers to devastate your numerically superior but sorely outmatched foes. As you progress, even assault VTOLs and twenty-foot tall rocket-spewing psycho-deamons will not give you pause. EYE also lets you adjust not only its difficulty but the respawn rate and AI behaviors of its enemies, giving you fine control over its experience. EYE has a few major issues, most notably its poor English translation, easily (and necessarily, in my opinion) remedied by downloading and applying a fan-made translation patch, available from the steam forum. EYE was released around the same time as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, obviously to capitalize on an upswing in interest in cyberpunk games, but in truth, it is a very different beast. Where Deus Ex rewards the calculating, stealthy player who avoids the game's useless lethal weapons in favor of the almighty tranq rifle, EYE fully allows you to become an unstoppable, heavily armed and armored, posthuman super-warrior, and its setting and asthetic owes a great deal more to Warhammer 40,000 then, say, Neuromancer- amusing considering this game's developer has gone on to work on an actual 40k game, the upcoming FPS Space Hulk: Deathwing. EYE is a strange, awkward game, but well worth the price of admission.","June 1, 2015","true","75.7"," 94 of 96 people (98%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","98","94","96","8","2"

All you need to know is that it's not for people who don't like experimenting and fumbling around in the dark trying to figure out what is going on. This game takes a lot of dedication and can be frustrating to those who will not take the time to figure it out.\n\nBut you'll never play anything like it ever again. Take that for what you will, I'm going to give this game a recommendation on the basis of how unique and out there it is. I couldn't get into it personally since I'm not a very "Experimenty" kind of guy, but I could never in good conscience thumb down a game that is this creative. Besides, the general consensus is that you will love this game if you can get into it.","June 20, 2014","true","4.6"," 109 of 117 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","109","117","0","5"

You can play alone or cooperatively with up to three other friends, taking on quests for the Culter clan. The gameplay is a mix of Deus Ex and Fallout 3, where you can take on some quests in multiple ways - alternate entrances, barging in through the front door, hacking certain access points to finish your objective. It's nice in co-op when one character can focus on building a particular skill (hacking was mine, for example) and another can spend points on other attributes to better round out the team.\n\nThe biggest problem this game has is its low-budget trappings and short campaign length. While I was surprised how good the gunplay felt, don't expect voice acting, quality translation, a fleshed out story and characters etc. It's a few notches above a bare-bones mod running on Source. E.Y.E is also rather brief, about 10 hours or so with nothing to keep you playing afterward.\n\nThis game is essentially Deus Ex but ten times f**king weirder and I love it for that, within the first 20 minutes you kill your mentor but you are not his murderer, fight a creature of the Metastreumonic-force, shoot a bandit with a shotgun from a mile away, and talk to people who may or may not even exist.\n\nIf the story is too confusing for you, I'll provide a rundown: You are part of an organization whose primary goal is to rescue space turtles. You travel the galaxy rescuing space turtles. That is all you need to know.","September 2, 2013","true","4.4"," 194 of 234 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","194","234","0","6"

It's French and the translation is awful, but there is a community mod to fix that. The gameplay is standard first-person shooter fare, with RPG elements such as stats, critical hits and misses (the words '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! Ultra-failed attack! will become very familiar to you), and cyberpunk elements such as psionics and body augmentation. The graphics are standard Source mod fare (the game runs on the Source engine), but the soundtrack and overall sound design is good and the maps are some of the biggest the engine can support, and the overall atmosphere is top-notch, grim and dark and grimy, very reminiscent of Alien and Blade Runner.\n\nThe gameplay is a little repetitive and the story is incomprehensible at points, but the main charm to E.Y.E. is all of the things it attempts to do. There are hacking minigames where you can kill or take control of any enemy (except the Neo-streumonic force), even turrets and gunships - but what they boil down to is spamming commands while watching a bar fill up. Stealth gameplay is attempted, with cloaking devices and line of sight - but because of engine limitations, all of the NPCs know where you are at all times and simply choose to ignore you until you trigger them. The list goes on and it is essentially pointless to go through everything the game tries to do but does not succeed at. The leveling mechanics are flawed, the unlocking mechanics even worse, playing at higher difficulties without min-maxing like crazy is the definition of tedium, but the guns feel good to shoot, the melee weapons feel good to use, the game looks good, and it has a wild charm to it that, in my opinion, overrides all of the negatives to it.\n\nYou should play E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy because of all it attempts to do; even though it doesn't succeed on many fronts, the sheer scope of its endeavor will be more than enough to satisfy.","December 14, 2013","true","65.9"," 91 of 111 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","91","111","0","4"

Something about the atmosphere felt very dry and devoid of life. You walk through huge, empty maps with nothing in the way of NPCs except for the people you have to fight and talk to for quests. The music loops through the menus and locations instead of changing based on where you are or what you are doing, so you might as well just listen to your own music while you play. The poor translation from the french language makes the writing look really sloppy and keeps you from being even remotely engaged with the story. Respawning enemies is such a poor design choice that I can't even begin to describe how much it hurts the game. It's like someone challenged the developers to find the worst possible subgenre of the worst possible genre to have respawning enemies, so they picked FPS/RPG.\n\nOn the plus side, co-op is really easy to get into and is pretty fun. Graphically, the game looks sharp and the animations, while imperfect, are ahead of the curve for an indie title. Just be prepared for a very confusing experience if you choose to try this game out.

It's a game in which you have a lot of options, it's pretty stable, and it has a lot of cool little features such as psi which allows you to do...well...pretty much anything I can think of, go invisible, give you better hacking, night vision, jump high.\n\nSo where does E.Y.E start? I have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue, apparently in the middle of some war that's never explained beyond some alien race is strong enough to take over the human race with their awesome cyber powers or some ♥♥♥♥, I got that from wikipedia so it's probably not real, it basically throws you into the game and gives you 23 tutorial videos, you have to watch them and they're so gruellingly long, jesus christ it took me like 5 minutes to watch all them.\n\nThere's a lot of GUIs, and the GUIs are very unique, none of the game is in English (I honestly don't even know what language it is in.) the gunplay is fun, but the AI is very well...not so smart, you're definitely not going to get S.T.A.L.K.E.R. AI in this game, it seems like the AI phases out of the floor (not kidding.) and they'll just pile at you one by one into a room where you mow them down with a minigun that takes 5 shots to kill (that's not a joke, by the way.)\n\nYou talk to NPCs to buy stuff, but you need to be a certain rank and have the certain skills in specific classes, not to mention the gun selling NPC is a ♥♥♥♥ing jew and jews you out of 600,000 brozoufs (this game's currency) and it seems every NPC is the same, they give you boring one liners that make you feel lost and uninvolved in the game.\n\nThe textures are that of a Source game and feel extremely unpolished, it seems blue is the theme of the entire game, everything is blue except the player models which are mostly yellow and black, it feels like the models in the game are polished with a beautiful phong but everything else just feels like it was made in 5 minutes because they were running out of time on their deadlines.\n\nThe music? It's great, I'm not much of an in-game music fan because I like to substitute my own music, but what little I heard of it was very impressive from such a small development team (I believe it was 12 people?)\n\nThe gunplay isn't actually half bad, it's really fun to just blow people's heads off (yes, you can do that.) repeatedly, not to mention sometimes you get shot by people you can't even see, little can you expect it, there's people that go invisible, rockets, and other cool little things that really just make gunplay well...fun...it's not rewarding, but it's not awful.\n\nHacking? Oh god it's confusing, very confusing, but once you get hold of it it's actually extremely fun to do, the hacking can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ at first but what comes out of it is awesome. Failing to hack a helicopter 6 times, getting to hack it, and then watching it drive by and shoot the hell out of enemy soldiers is always a fun thing to watch.\n\nThe language really makes you feel out of place, like you don't belong, and a lot of interesting stuff happens in the game but none of it seems to make sense because you have no clue what's going on, so if you have to know what's going on in a game to enjoy it, E.Y.E is not your game.\n\nThe missions are honestly, really dreadful to go through, it's basically your usual "go here do that" mission, go here, kill this captain, go to the other side of the map, plant this bomb...but the thing about it is, it gives you markers but it doesn't baby you through it so in looking for a mission, you can often end up in other places on total accident, most of which are actually really, really interesting to take a look at. I remember specifically on the 2nd level with your mentor, there's a tunnel and inside of it, well...on second thought, I'll let you find it.\n\nIn conclusion?:\nMusic: 8/10, it's good, but it's not my type.\nModels, textures, missions?: This is a hard part to rate, the models are beautiful but the textures and missions are dreadful. 6/10.\nGameplay, gunplay?: I'd give this a solid 9/10, it's FUN, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just shoot and kill.\nInteraction (menus, AI)?: I have to give this a really generous 5/10, I just can't follow it, the boring one liners and the half-♥♥♥♥♥ tutorials leave a really bad taste in my mouth, you basically have to figure out what the hell is going on by reading books in the archive of New Eden. It's pretty awful, honestly.\nAll in all?: I'd give this a generous 7/10, because I'm a sucker for games with a good atmosphere, it gives me a really STALKER-esque feel and that makes me give it a higher review than I would. I would recommend it to STALKER fans, but not many other people, hence the "would you recommend this?" Yes, but only to die hard cyberpunk/STALKER fans.\n\n\nTL;DR?\nIt's okay, it's rough around the edges but if you can look around the problems, underneath lies a really fun gameplay experience.","October 9, 2014","true","5.4"," 64 of 80 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","64","80","5","5"

It is Mentor and he has been drinking too much at the New Eden underground bar again. You can smell it through the odour sensor implanted into your cyber phone and hooked into your nostrils. He is rambling on about commander Rimanah again and keeps mentioning something about dream sequences. You lower the volume on your  cyber ear implants but can't get right, so you have to stand there frustratedly fiddling with it between 51 and 48 for far too long. You realise that it's gotten very quiet until you hear Mentor clear his throat. He must have asked you a question and is waiting for your response.  Asking him to repeat himself is obviously out of the question, so you begin to panic and try to think of a clever reply to satisfy Mentor.

It took me quite awhile to understand the basics of the game. Any ailiments you encounter remember to press C, it is a life saver.\n\nThe game is set in a futuristic cyberpunk world, with some very impressive levels, Great care and love was put into this games setting. Half of the time playing I would set there being in awe, the city levels in particular are gorgeous.\n\nThe gameplay itself is where the game really shines, nothing is more satisfying than cutting an enemy with a sword only for them to explode into pieces. Any enemy you killed gains you brouzoufs, which can be used for different upgrades or can be used for research to increase your stats.\n\nOne of my main gripe is the hacking part of the game, nothing about it was enjoyable which can lead to some frustrating encounters.

With out any doubt this is its STRONGEST POINT. I mean just look at the images, don't you want to know more about this world?\n\n- Headshots are extremely satisfactory.\n\n- Different endings, one of them is a secret one which can only be unlocked when you have reached all the differente endings which require a new playthrough each time (because you can't save). You won't understand any of them, as there's a lot of mysticism, allegories, philosophy and surrealism around them, but it is interesting to see the different theories people come up with in the steamhub.\n\n- New Game+ : you can (and should if you want to see the endings) play the game endlessly with all the augmentations/skills/weapons you have unlocked so far. Actually the player repeating the campaign is part of the campaign itself as you are supposed to be stucked in some cycle repeating itself that in theory only finishes with the secret ending mentioned before. Something like Groundhound day.\n\n\n\n*** Conclusion\nPlay this game if you liked STALKER, really make the effort of investing enough time to understand the mechanics because I guarantee you that it is worth it.\n\nI really think this game could have been MUCH better if it had been done slightly different, and I really hope a sequel is done sometime in the future which takes care of all these shortcomings.","January 8, 2015","true","17.2"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dongra/recommended/91700/","dongra","Dongra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dongra/","216 products in account","I don't think I have ever both loved and yet been so disappointed with a game before.  E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is a FPS/RPG hybrid that seems to have some inspiration from the original Deus Ex, but plays more like the quick Source engine shooters such as Half Life and Counter Strike you would most likely be familiar with. However, while the shooting and gunplay is very solid, the rpg side of the game is severly lacking and as you get further into the main story missions you find yourself with less and less variety in how you can approach situations in the game.\n\nCreating a character takes you to a small menu where you can mix, match, and reroll three genes that will determine your characters base statistics.  You essentially play as a sword/gun wielding cyborg samurai with an aggresive behavior and poor social skills. Once you create the character, the game starts you off in a dream sequince as you begin talking to yourself in a made up language and enter a portal to find yourselff lost in a cave with amnesia.  You'll progress through the cave where we will run into the first major problem of the game, the tutorial system.  The tutorial videos are rather poorly labeled, as an example: you will be told to look up the super jump tutorial in order to make a higher out of reach jump, but there isn't one by that name and you'll end up fumbling around in the videos until you do come across how the skill wheel works. Once you do manage to find your way out of the tutorial level, you return to the games HUB world and rejoin the faction you work for, the Culter Dei, and begin taking orders from Commander Rimanah, your superior.  You'll be sent to do various tasks in various environments that are fairly large in size and quite eye catching as well with varied styles from a large run down city to the surface of Mars.  Moving through these maps will be confusing at first but will be fine once memorized.\n\nEnemies primarily fall into three catagories, or so I would assume, humanoids, machines, and monsters.  Humanoids are pretty much your standard gun wielding baddy that fall into several factions such as the looters, Federation cops, Jian, etc, the machines are pretty much small turrets and gunships, and the monsters, known as the Meta-streumonic force, are primarily melee ranged little creatures such as imps, small aliens, werewolves, women clad in white, and the cyber demon from doom.  Most enemies are pretty fun to fight and add a decent amount of variety to the game.\n\nAs you progress you will level up your charcter and accumulate the games currancy known as Brouzoufs.  Each level up gives you skill points you can allocate into the eight primary skills your character has while the money you gain will be spent at the various shops for new cyber abilities, psi abilities, and weapons, used for research to unlock upgrades or stat bonuses, and to upgrade the cyber implants in your character.  While there are eight differnt stats to spend points in, you'll soon find out that the increases are very minor and specialized characters will find themselves having a difficult time.  If you wanted to play as a high strength melee character, a sneaky hacker who turns his foes on one another, or a mind crushing psi powered god you will be severly disappointed.  Melee will quickly become a series of deaths as you run out of stamina far too quicly when blocking enemy fire, hacking becomes less effective on groups and takes far too long to accomplish leaving you open to ambushes, and the harder foes are pretty much immune to psi abilities.  As you get to the harder missions in the game you will be falling back primarily on using gunfire to take down the strongest opponents.\n\nSpeaking of gunfire, the game has a decent variety of weapon catagories from melee, pistols, smgs, shotguns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, and heavy weapons each having two to four weapons to choose from.  However, a major issue with the weapon variety comes from how useful certain weapons become later in the game.  While you can get through the first four or so story missions using pretty much any weapon you like, you will hit a major standstill when you start to fight heavily armored enemies.  These enemies will force you into using specific weapons that use armor piercing ammo, which would be fine if there were more than just four to choose from.  To my knowledge the only guns with armor piercing rounds are one of the pistols, two of the snipers, and one of the heavy weapons.  I was playing primarily with shotguns and SMG's for most of the game, but there are no armor piercing shotguns and SMGs, so I was forced to use one of the starting sniper rifles in order to progress.  This is a major negative to me, as I was expecting pretty much anything I enjoyed using to remain viable throughout the game.  (Except for the Betty Boom sawn off shotgun, that gun is in its own league of bad which is a shame because I loved the way it looked.)\n\nCharacter interaction is pretty entertaining,  you'll find yourself talking to NPC's constantly.  The game has a standard choose your dialog option, and most responses are pretty goofy.  Hell, just the normal NPC dialog is a real joke in it's own right as you find many aggresive, dumb, depressed, or just outright insane characters through out the game to talk with. When it really comes down to it, everyone is pretty much a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game as I don't think I found a single pleasant person to talk to outside of Tobi.\n\nThere is a story, but I'm not even going to pretend to know it or explain it, if you buy the game good luck with that.\n\nOverall I really enjoy this game so far and will continue to keep playing but I cannot recommend it.  Most people will find themselves clueless with what to do at the start of the game and won't even get to my major complaints.  The game feels like a proper structure of a great game but clearly isn't finished.  Do not be fooled by the early trailers of this game, you will not be taking out groups in various ways as shown, you will eventually be shooting for the majority of the game.\n\n\nThings that need to be changed, in my opinon, to make the game into a proper or better FPS/RPG are as follows:\nViable playstyles for every stat choice.  If I want to go full melee, I should be able to.  If I want to stack hacking and hack every enemy and clear a mission that way, I should be able to.  If I want to use shotguns as my only weapon, I should be able to.\n\nStrength should also decrease the amount of stamina you lose per point when blocking and the damage bonus should be buffed significantly.\n\nWider variety in Psi powers and psi should have a chance to work on all opponents.\n\nAll guns should be viable throughout the game or at the very least one weapon from each catagory should have armor piercing.\n\nClass system should actually do something outside of get achievements, each class honestly should have either a special trait linked to them or some kind of passive bonus at the least.\n\nMedicine stat should not only increase your healing effectiveness but increase lethality when medkit is used on opponents.  Not being able to cloak around and inject enemies to death is a huge missed opportunity.\n\nLevel cap so there is a reason to build a character a certain way, I haven't tested yet but I'm certain it is possible to max all skills on a single character.  It would be far more interesting to have proper character builds instead of being a jack of all trades.\n\nStat penalties on death should be healed by an NPC for money instead of getting a research to remove and be immune to them.\n\nIt's a real shame but the game is most likely never going to be patched again as I'm certain the last one was two years ago and has now been abandoned.  ♥♥♥♥ I really wanted to say this was a good game but I honestly cannot, this game is not for most people.","December 8, 2015","false","135.3"," 67 of 93 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","67","93","4","4"

Your character has a web of stats, research, cybernetics, psionic powers and weapons to navigate. You can cloak to go invisible, turn enemies insane, spawn copies of yourself, and even teleport yourself INTO enemies and explode them from within.\n\nIt's beatifully obtuse. A relevant quote from your own character in the game is: 'There's nothing to understand! Nothing makes any sense.' The story is on a meta-level to end all meta-levels. By the time you've reached the true ending (there's three 'not-true' endings you have to complete before the 'true' ending), you won't know who you are anymore, or what's real, or isn't, or whether you ever really escaped your cycles of guilt.\n\nIt's beatifully insane.

The characters all seem to be batshit crazy, including yourself, if going by the dialogue is any indication.

Don't mistake this indie cyberpunk FPS for Deus Ex imitation, for it surely isn't. It has fresh ideas, vast well-designed levels, wide array of nice weapons, cybernetic skills and PSI powers and an interesting plot. The game is almost too ambitious for its own good, which makes it cumbersome at times and hard to approach. It has also some minor bugs yet to be squashed. But even with its flaws E.Y.E. is something very unique.The shooting is tight, the character progression is deep, the visuals aren't bad, and it's a hell of a lot of fun once you're able to jump 30 feet high, not to mention do everything else a cybernetic assassin is capable of.Taking into account the small development group and the price, I'm hard-pressed not to recommend this game as a must-have.Distinctive games like E.Y.E. are a rarity these days. Its colorful characters, good dialogue, entertaining non-linear story, and multiple ways to develop the main characters are enough to offset the shortcomings.","July 7, 2014","true","19.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","2"

A game which obviously has its flaws, but also something very special about its atmosphere which completely makes up for them. This is entirely subjective and you may not agree, but E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is such a game for me.\n\nCreated by a small, independent studio, it confronts you with a creative mix of countless cyberpunk and sci-fi works, sometimes even directly adopting certain elements from these references into the game. It lets you create and enhance a character to your liking and play a weird, complex story. Being set in a grim future full of darkness and deceit, the game contains all the staples of a good dystopian world.\n\nAs a member of a secret cultist society and elite warrior you are thrown into the world without any memory. Step by step, you progress through the story and learn more about the game's reality, or at least, you think so. You will soon learn that many things are not what they seem to be. Up until the end of the game, you will have many questions, just like the main protagonist. And if you are like me, you will take every chance to find the answers.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the game is solid: it features many classic projectile weapons (which are ancient by the standards of the time) and it has everything necessary to give you the typical shooter experience. But there is much more. Besides the melee weapons you have at your disposal, you can also make use of many PSI-powers which complement your personal play style. You can be a minigun-wielding juggernaut with near-impenetrable skin or a swift cyber-ninja with hacking skills and a cloaking ability.\n\nSome of the game's features are truly unique and turn out to be very interesting additions. For instance, if you are caught in the heat of the battle (or have a certain genetic predisposition) you can easily fall into madness which can manifest itself in five(!) different ways in the game. Besides your physical character, you have a virtual avatar as well, and can hack into computers or even people. But beware: Don't be too careless or your mind will fall victim to a counter hack and be possessed by a different digital avatar!\n\nThe missions you get can be solved in many different ways, depending on your decisions and actions. There is no obviously good or bad path. You don't even know what's part of reality. Or if there even IS a reality! As you may have noticed by now, the game will not hold your hand. It is a diamond in the rough. Sometimes you will have problems, you may not progress the way you intended to, but the game still marches on. There are parts of the game you won't understand, but the only thing you can do is to make your way through and just experience it. Indulge yourself in the raw weirdness of the game.\n\nE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy makes use of the Source Engine and looks accordingly. Not too fancy by today's standards, but not ugly, either. In any case, the graphics are definitely of secondary concern in this game. I'm absolutely sure that you can't truly appreciate the game if you don't read what the characters are saying (text only) and also invest some thoughts regarding the meaning of what is said and done. It's not a game to play if you want to relax after a busy day, but a somewhat demanding (and rewarding) piece which could be compared to a story-driven movie or novel.\n\nAll in all, the game's mixture of illusion and reality, science-fiction and mysicism, story and gameplay elements make it a memorable experience with great replay value. It is a unique experience which really stands out from the crowd.\n\nIn short: I love this game.","October 17, 2015","true","70.3"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","26","30","0","0"

I happen to love it, but can definitely find some reasons not everyone would agree with this.\n\nThe graphics aren't exactly cutting edge, but the world is really well designed and creates a really unique and interesting atmosphere that you genuinely enjoy exploring.\n\nThe combat is great. Wide variety of weapons, abilities, and powers to choose from. Want to control the fight from afar? Try the 2-scope sniper rifle. Like a bit of melee? Try dual wielding some bullet-blocking katanas. Powers can be used to help give you an edge as well. You can use them to enhance your armor, see enemies through walls, hypnotize them, create clones of yourself to aid you in battle, etc. Lots of options that you can tailor to suit your favored play style.\n\nNow here's where some people might lose interest. For one, this is not exactly an easy game. Not that it's too difficult, just is a bit complex. There are a lot of different mechanics to consider, creating a higher learning curve than some might want. Despite the fact that there are in-game tutorials, not much is explained to you which leaves it to you to discover how things work. If you don't mind dedicating a bit of time to trial and error learning then you'll be rewarded with a really great experience.\n\nThere's no save option, so in order to save your progress you have to complete the mission you're on. Some of the missions are a bit long, which can lead to some frustration if you're not able to dedicate the proper amount of time to playing and end up losing your progress.\n\nThe game wasn't translated very well so some of what the NPCs say just comes off as plain silly. Personally, I find this to be humorous and actually like the little quirk it gives to the game. But if you want your dialogue to be clean-cut then this probably isn't the game for you.\n\nOverall, this is a great game and if you haven't been deterred thus far then I highly recommend giving it a shot.","December 22, 2013","true","5.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","2"

I only give it a thumbs down because I can't really recommend it on good conscience, even if it is a guilty pleasure to me. Wait, I can recommend it as an example of what happens when a bunch of people on a forum start discussing their idea of a great game, then decide to make it a reality. They didn't quite have organizational skill to pull it off, but they definately tried. There are some good ideas in the game. Too bad there's twice the amount of bad ones. If only there was a 'thumb sideways' option.\n\nThe first comparison that comes to mind is Deus Ex. The setting is as cyberpunk as it gets. There is a plot in there somewhere and quite a bit of lore, but I'm not sure even the developers knew where they were going with it. See, the first thing I realized playing was that English was not the makers' native tongue and the translation is cringe-worthy. It doesn't help the game is full of features and stats that are poorly (if at all) explained. The game plays like an FPS but everything is defined by stats. Let's just go over the good, bad and whatweretheythinking.\n\nGood: There is no permanent death. You have a defined amount of tries to get through a given level before getting kicked back into the hub area and having to try again.\nBad: The game resurrects you right back in the same spot with full health but not full energy, so it's more than likely the same thing gets to kill you more than once.\nWTH: Dying can induce stat penalties that take a lot of grinding and resources to remove and happen randomly. Even if the cause of death was falling in a bottomless pit, which are common. Especially in the dark, non-combat hub area.\n\nGood: There is a comprehensive stat system you can set to either increase by what you do (ala Elder Scrolls) or by allocating points upon level-up.\nBad: Some stats are way,WAY slower to level than others. Hacking seems impossible to raise while not using guns in a shooter is challenging to say the least.\nWTH: Since using points a stat gets more and more expensive to raise, sooner or later you will succumb to autoleveling, where a level up doesn't really mean anything. Despite what I try, the real challenge is NOT ending up a jack-of-all-trades.\n\nGood: There are mechanics called 'karma' and 'mental health'. Going in the red on mental health can cause nasty side-effects such as being unable to attack, attacking constantly or just hallucinating a bunch. Needless to say these happen mid-fight :/ A high karma supposedly helps prevent these lapses.\nBad: The karma system makes no sense. Killing small vermin or clones of yourself is bad, completing missions is good. The dialogue trees give the impression of choice but don't seem to matter at all.\nWTH: At the end of the day, like most features the mental health thing can be cancelled out with an implant or some such.\n\nGood: More meaningful than stats are research items you get as drops from enemies. These do anything from stat boosts to unlocking new guns and implants to just making your shinbones unbreakable (yes, you can break both legs and hardly notice).\nBad: You never know what a given item does prior to researching and that takes time and money. A lot of research needs several unlocks before appearing.\nWTH: The research drops are mostly random, and many are ridiculously rare. A player can log 100 hours without getting a certain weapon unlock, for instance. Oh, and there's one or two red herrings with no benefit to them.\n\nGood: The player has a lot of tools at their disposal from a cloaking device to spells like cloning themself or making people fight for them.\nBad: These all use the same energy bar, which depletes very fast.\nWTH: Many times these are more flavor than a realistic alternative to simply shooting your enemy. The enemies always know where you are when you uncloak and the clone AI derps around.\n\nGood: While the story isn't that long, the player can build their character with random missions to their heart's content.\nBad: Everything costs money and story missions pay peanuts. Gaining access to new levels still requires passing them in story mode. There are some grind-only levels, but their mission is usually just to kill everything.\nWTH: The mission could be to find a briefcase that could be anywhere in the area of several city blocks. Or to keep a group of thick NPCs alive through an ambush (I have yet to succeed in that one).\n\nGood: The player can hack doors, turrets and even enemies instead of direct confrontation.\nBad: The hacking minigame is incredibly tedious and can take several minutes even at high stat. I was very disappointed I couldn't make a hacked sniper jump to his death.\nWTH: Hacking doesn't stop or even slow time around you so more often than not you click on icons and listen to annoying sound effects for minutes only to get attacked before you're done.\n\n\nTLDR edition:\n+looks quite nice\n+the atmosphere and lore is intriguing at first\n+a lot of venues to develop your character\n\n-plot is a grand illusion\n-gameplay quickly becomes endless waves of dumb but cheap enemies\n-random research drops\n-random death penalty\n-relies on grinding random missions over and over\n-the hacking minigame is mind-numbingly boring\n","June 26, 2014","false","91.9"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","36","49","0","1"

After a mystifying dream sequence, you begin in a limestone cave partially submerged in water, a red flare in the distance. Immediately, you recieve a transmission from someone or another, telling you to exfiltrate.\n\nIt is pretty obvious that a battle has occured within the cave system, however, your character is as clueless as you are. Immediately, you start asking questions. What was that genestealer-like creature that just attacked me? Who are these faceless "federals" and why am I fighting them? Why do all the thugs have goggles for eyes and cheap grenadier helmets from the 1800s?\n\nHonestly, not much is explained. The intro mission was oblique but confusing, and the exposition in the temple afterwards doesn't explain much either.\n\nVisuals\n\nI wouldn't really say anything positive or negative regarding the visuals. It was made in source; some areas are beautiful and finely detailed, other areas are wide open canvases with very little to satisfy one's gaze. Some areas, such as the temple, were vast but impractical, with enourmous brown spires that were massive but created too much empty space in the enviroments detail-wise.\n\nThe weapon models are exceptional, however, it is obvious most viewmodels/weapons were designed before the general motif of the game was accomplished. Whereas all characters wear contemporary "knight" armor, the player's  hands look like a ninja's from a Japanese cyberpunk anime.\n\nEnemies were mostly conglomerates of other creatures in fiction. It is clear that the bandits are modeled off of classical cyberpunks, E.Y.E. agents from WH40k, struems from Aliens and WH40k as well.\n\nStory\n\nVirtually nonexistent, hidden between sentimental cliches of science fiction and war. It was hard to tell if there was a deeper message shoehorned into the generic, easy-to-catch story of "this man did so-and-so, kill him" or "we need to insert on Mars, help us with the assault".\n\nThe dialogue mechanics were likely the sloppiest parts of the game. All characters read (no voice acting, save for the alien gibberish) like brosephs from gym, and did very little if not detract from the mood of the game. Emotional attachment to any character at all was rare (I felt this way for Mentor, since he was just such a nice guy). I won't say much about the ending, however, I disliked it.\n\nGameplay\n\nAs a shooter, E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is pretty solid. The weapon handling was decent, inventory system was simple but satisfying, and the open-choice system when it came to tactics was pretty solid. However, combat suffered from the Source issue of AI; all enemy AI is programmed to always know your location once they see you, and will follow the closest node to reach and engage you. Of course, this rendered conventional stealth tactics useless.\n\nThe grinding required to apprehend efficient gear is despicable and not enjoyable at all. Every mission followed a similar formula, in which you try to reach the objectives as fast as possible in the midst of the infinitely-respawning enemies.\n\nOverall Opinion\n\nE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy was enjoyable enough when it came to the sense of adventure it gave you going through each level, however, it isn't something I'd neccessarily play through again.\n\nAs far as reccomendations go, I do not reccomend this game; not out of spite, but because it's simply not for everyone. If you are able to get if for a discount like I did, it definitely is a steal.","January 22, 2015","false","11.0"," 64 of 106 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","64","106","3","1"

It has a neat cyberpunk atmosphere. You can hack into an enemy soldier's mind and force him to shoot his comrades. You can block bullets with a sword like you're in some cheesy action movie. You can augment features of your cybernetic implants a la Deus Ex to run faster, hit harder, resist damage, et cetera. The rest of the game is a pile of garbage.\n\nThe game is terribly short, and tries to make up for it by requiring multiple playthroughs. The single player story consists of five or so missions that don't take long to complete. You fight the final boss after a few hours and the game ends. On your first run through, the story is largely incomprehensible and completely nonsensical and only adds to the confusion you feel when the campaign abruptly finishes. The campaign is so short that there's no time to specialize your character, and even having enough money and experience to really explore the roleplaying elements of the game requires running through the game a few times. Sadly, it's very possible to beat the game without upgrading your character at all.\n\nYou don't need to buy augmentations and abilities for your character to customize him, though: you can choose what kind of armor you want to wear (heavy, medium, or light) and manage a grid-based (again, think Deus Ex) inventory. This kind of freedom would be welcome and greatly improve the game--if there were any point to it. The balance in viability between different styles of play and equipment is terrible: trying to play a stealthy, melee-heavy character is extremely challenging, while wearing heavy armor, lugging around a minigun, and swiss cheesing everything in sight is essentially putting the game on easy mode.\n\nThere are side missions that you can play to prolong a playthrough, but they kind of suck. There are two kinds: laughably easy and absurdly hard. They're over in minutes either way and there are so few of them that they barely serve to add content.\n\nIf this game had actual, fleshed-out roleplaying and multiple ways to approach combat and a story mode that couldn't be finished in a single afternoon then I would recommend it. But it doesn't. Hell, there are other glaring, game-breaking flaws I didn't even bother to explain in this review.

Although, don't expect in-depth RPG decisions, or a "Pacifist" way of playing the game.\n\nThat said, all the weapons handle pretty good, they are satisfactory to use, the segmented grid-like inventory system allows for diverse loadouts without becoming extremely overpowered, few maps, but big and plenty to do in each of them, and up to 32 player co-op.\n\nGraphics are what you'd expect from the Source Engine, nothing too impresive but looks great in some areas.\n\nDying, however, has almost no consequences. You don't lose Brouzouf (money), or experience, or anything really, just a few seconds while you respawn exactly where you died, the enemies don't even heal. You can respawn up to 9 times (upgradable), and after that, you only get a smack on the wrist by an NPC, telling you something along the lines of "You should really stop dying so much", and then you appear at the start of the map where you died with the exact same objective you were doing before you died, and you get your 9 respawns back. It's essentially what would happen if you quit the game mid-mission. There is a mechanic where you can get "permanently injured" if you die too much, but as far as I'm concerned, that happens so little, it's not worth taking into account.\n\nThis game is honestly a hidden gem, and will not dissapoint.","January 5, 2014","true","50.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Or, more likely, hate it, then love it.\nThis game is an embodiment of confusion. While the mechanics themselves are not that complex and opaque, the way they are presented makes understanding them quite a hard task. But once you get a hang of them, you suddenly begin to have loads of fun.\nThe gunplay is solid, and every weapon feels actually useful, although some are clearly outclassed by others (I'm looking at you, Rotten Mound). Apart from Betty Boom, shotguns here avert the classic disease of extreme spread and low range. Assault rifles all have a semi-auto mode, which immensely helps at long range. Then there is a pistol that can shoot through walls and disregard any armor you target might be clad in, an automatic sticky proximity grenade launcher, minigun (which is REALLY awesome), thermonuclear cannon with 10m blast radius and an ancient warhammer capable of killing almost any enemy in the game in one hit.\nArt direction is kinda all over the place stylistically, with classic cyberpunk tropes like implants, megacorps, oppressive government and violent anarchists in the slums coexisting with 40K-esque high fantasy stuff like psionics, the eponymous E.Y.E, metastreumonic force, ancient civilizations and necromancy. But in the end it feels vary wholesome and high in quality.\nThe story is something you have to experience on your own. It's very confusing until almost the very end, where you get the general idea of what's going on.\nCybernetic implants and psionics are VERY cool and VERY fun to use. Upgrade you cyberlegs and you'll be able to outrun a cheetah and jump a dozen meters high. Get the Dragon's Breath psi power and you'll be able to literally telefrag your enemies. Makes for a handy quick way to move across the levels, too.\nSpeaking of levels, they are vast and sprawling, full of little nooks and corners with extreme amount of detail everywhere. Although their size can make them somewhat tedious to traverse early on.\nDifficulty is completely customizable with half a dozen of default presets and a plenty of options which can be fine-tuned individually to suit your preferences the best.","November 9, 2015","true","79.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJustFateOfTheFoolish/recommended/91700/","TheJustFateOfTheFoolish","A.K.T.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJustFateOfTheFoolish/","357 products in account","E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is unlike anything you will ever play. Despite my relatively short playtime, it's one of the most memorable games I've played in a long, long time.\n\nE.Y.E. has fantastic world design, extreme depth in its mechanics, and extremely well done core game mechanics, but it's also user-unfriendly, unpolished, and some of the text appears to be some sort of almost-English language. It has more quality content than most games on the market, even full-priced $60 games, but for nearly every good piece of content in the game, there's some factor that just makes you scratch your head.\n\nBoth as a shooter and as an RPG, E.Y.E. have a very well-designed core. It allows you to build any kind of character, from a high-tech, heavily augmented super-hacker to a nimble assassin, a cloaked sniper to a heavily-armored living tank, from a berserker wielding explosive katanas to a psychokinetic mage who can telefrag people at will while your clones distract enemies. And each of these builds, and all the builds in-between, can be tuned and tweaked to your liking.\n\nThere are no class limitations or restrictions, so long as you can plan your stats for what you want to use. These classes are defined by your stats you gain by leveling up, your research you commit to with items you find in the field, and your cybernetic augments that you graft onto yourself as you progress through the game.\n\nHowever, despite the fundamentals of this system being brilliantly done, in practice, there are some builds which are far less practical than others. While being a mind-hacker or psionic mastermind may be very appealing, they are ultimately far less practical than a simple soldier with good guns, or a melee fighter with enough accuracy for an anti-armor handcannon. Fortunately, playing E.Y.E. as purely a shooter, with no bells and whistles attached, is still a great time, but this may disappoint players that were hoping to jump into a first run with one of these builds.\n\nMore straightforward builds will lead to a better experience for two reasons: difficulty of use, and utter non-information on the complex mechanics of certain builds. The difficulty comes from some builds giving you limited to no ability to directly fight enemies, leaving you with a lack of XP sources to improve yourself further. This is particularly egregious with hacking, as hacking an enemy takes longer, is less effective, and grants lower XP, and gives less money than just shooting the enemy in the first place would. And the greatest shame here is that almost every build in E.Y.E. is an absolute blast to play; it's a ton of fun. Some builds just don't give you the resources you need to reasonably progress like others do.\n\nThe other problem with certain builds is that they aren't well explained. The first sign of this problem comes in the form of a tutorial system that's better off ignored with how poorly implemented it is. The in-game tutorial shows you how to run, jump, crawl, climb ladders, etc., all things you should already know. But the fine details are left to videos in a menu. The predominant limitation, however, comes from extremely vague descriptions of items and abilities, leaving you to occasionally guess at what things do. When fundamental, build-defining skills can't be identified without being told, there's a serious problem. Fortunately, many of these issues are front-loaded, and after a couple of hours, explanation issues taper down to a tolerable level.\n\nSpeaking of incomprehensible content, the Research in this game is more of a crapshoot than anything if you don't look up a guide. Without researching it ahead of time, I couldn't tell you what my reward was for researching "UbiCosif Substance", or "Alpha Bio Optical Connex". According to tech trees, some of the research actually does nothing.\n\n================================\n\nSo far, this review sounds pretty harsh. I mean, it must seem odd that I'm recommending a game with such glaring issues, right?\n\nWell, the pros, in my opinion, outstrip the cons.\n\nThe world and levels are wonderfully crafted, with obvious attention to detail being put into the atmosphere of the world. The levels are extremely large, allow you to approach objectives in any way you can imagine, and are very non-linear, with each zone feeling more like a mini-sandbox than a mission in a campaign. And it accomplishes this with completely procedural enemy placements, and occasionally with procedural objectives, and it works so well.\n\nThe atmosphere is spot-on, with the entire world being filled with cybertech and dripping in environmental storytelling. In fact, the environments tell better stories most of the time than the actual story. While the graphics are somewhat dated, the designs are wonderful, and the game stands up in its own gritty, dystopian sort of way.\n\nThe gunplay is also some of the best the Source engine has to offer, with every weapon giving just the right amount of feedback. The sounds for each one are unique and have fantastic bass and reverb, with the gunfire being just as deadly as the sounds would entail. Additionally, there's variety without excess, and each weapon ends up feeling unique, like there's a role for everything you could take with you.\n\nMelee weapons are equally satisfying, and a nimble brawler can be just as entertaining, sidestepping blows and covering space rapidly to slash targets with dual katanas, or chopping up crowds with a sword that makes people explode. Even magic powers feel great to use, with skills that make enemies violently explode into blood fonts, or even the power to clone yourself, all backed up by equally great sound design. Even the aforementioned hacker can be engrossing in its own way, with a few well-placed hacks driving enemy squads into two warring halves while you simply watch from afar. And the hacking is very fun, and an example of a minigame done VERY right, with some strategy and quick thinking required to break enemy defenses.\n\nThe A.I. is also better than people give it credit for; on higher difficulties, enemies will be aggressive, flush you out with grenades, try to surround you, or even try baiting you into a bad position. It's not excellent, but when you crank the spawn waves to "Invasion" level, these small additions can really have an impact on your survival in the long-term.\n\n================================\n\nWhile the world is well designed, the plot is really fairly hit-or-miss. Some people love it, some hate it. It's very much a cliche storm, but it's so cheesy that I personally can't help but love it. You're part of a militarized secret society in a civil war fighting a totalitarian government, demonic supermonsters based on humanity's dark sides, and roaming bands of looters. There's at least three MacGuffins and up to five betrayals possible in E.Y.E.'s story, and it's fantastically stupid.\n\nOn top of that, the localization for this game is hilariously bad. While there is a fan patch that un-Engrishes the game, the stilted, strange speech and swear-storms the characters get into could add to or detract from the experience. For the most part, this doesn't interfere with gameplay, so I won't list this as a negative; it's more up to preference. In my first run, I was only stuck one one objective to "Realign the Parabola", and even that was solvable within a few minutes. For those that don't like the transration, fortunately, everyone speaks in a made-up verbal language that works well with the environment, so thankfully, nobody's vocalizing the dreadful text.\n\n\nVerdict\nWhile E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy should, by all means, be a very terrible game, all the things it does well are done exceptionally well. For some, the problems will be deal-breakers. However, if you're looking for a unique game that plays like Deus Ex crossed with F.E.A.R. on cocaine, and you're willing to stomach some extremely rough edges, then this game is absolutely for you.","May 24","true","59.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Did I?\nEveryone who did a playthrough will know what I'm talking about. So, my second time is still to come but I completed one complete possible storyline or how you might call it.\nSo what is this game like? [Note: You can still read my very first impression at the very bottom.]\nOne word that describes it - many might agree: "Strange." Well, that doesn't say much though it really is the case with this game. It has an overwhelming feel to it - this is the case for the writing, the style and the gameplay. Though you don't necessarily have to sink into this universe and can just scrap the surface (gameplaywise and storywise) I recommend to take your time with this game. It pays off. Much has been said so I will just list some things I find worth mentioning to give you an impression:\n\n- Art/Style: Set in a Sci-Fi-dystopian world with an asian touch - it feels like a...well...futuristic, steampunk chinatown universe at times.\n- Music: What shall I say, this creates atmosphere at it's best.\n- Gameplay: Confusing right from the beginning as it's a blend of FPS with deep RPG-similar mechanics. Your possibilities range from Research, to classic leveling up to some sort of skill tree etc. At the very beginning you can pre-customize your character in the way intended. It may be decisive if you want to choose a certain approach like stealth, hacking, combat etc.\nThe maps are huge and you get lost pretty easily - one might criticize that. Also the level design isn't the best at times. The campaign is loosely structured with somewhat missions - each has its specific main goals and possible side-goals you may want to achieve or not, you can progress though without caring. From time to time the interaction with the NPCs will let you or force you to make decisions that affect your playthrough experience.\n- Other feature worth mentioning: This game is "circular" in it's very best sense - multiple playthroughs intended, there is no real ending as there is no real end (storywise, gamewise). Replayability: 100%\n\n________________________________________________\nThis is a very very first impression comment on the game and I just want to share one thing with you guys because it's something remarkable for me as a gamer:\nIt was the first time after a long period of FPS-gaming time that holding a gun in my hands evoked some kind of feeling. It just felt fresh and astonishing and I can't explain why. Well, there is something more to it.\nThere has been a lot of talk about shooters and immersion and experience.\nImmersion - there you go.\n\n(I will elaborate on this after I progress in the game. For now - there has already been talked about the cyber-steampunk setting with the asian touch a lot as well as the soundtrack and so on.

As a bonus, I will try to make use of the text formatting that has been introduced by Steam in the meantime.\n\nIntroductionFirst up on that list is E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy (abbreviated as EYE from here on), an FPS/RPG crossover made by the relatively unknown ‘Streumon Studio’, which should sound familiar if you have played the Half Life 1 total conversion mod called ‘Syndicate Black Ops’. On a sidenote here: people have been notifying me that some of the games I write about are rather old and as such my efforts might not be read by anyone. I’m fully aware of this and it is no problem to me. Some games stand the passing of time well and others even manage to become more appealing as they age, a phenomena caused by nostalgia and the fact that this industry is being saturated by bad titles.\n\nMeritI would consider EYE one of the latter category. While it is certainly not ugly, I wouldn’t dare call it a beautiful game either. A disadvantage with realism as far as graphics are concerned is that they do not measure up to titles that release later on. Of course that’s an unfair comparison, but it’s one that will be made regardless. Games like World of Warcraft that go for the full comic book style graphics can sport ‘kiddy’ visuals for years to come, but has it done their setting any justice? Only a fanboy would concur. Instead, realistic graphics has to come with dramatization in order to increase the shelf like for the demanding gamer. The most obvious examples would be the brilliant bloom effects in Lineage 2’s Angel Waterfall, the gold shaders in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, or the blend of drawings with old graphics used in the Mount & Blade series. While EYE has constituted their theme pretty well, the use of some low resolution textures and models here and there can still break the immersion. That aside, it’s a very good effort that is very commendable, especially during the dream and certain parts of the HQ. In fact, in some parts it's quite extreme, think of huge power cables running through the streets and even fighting on Mars.\n\nThe strength of EYE definitely appears to be the character customization but the sounds and shooting mechanics are actually more fleshed out. At first this might seem like an odd thing to say as there are many powers and augmentations to choose from, however, as you progress through the levels you will come to find that specializing your character in a specific playstyle does not pay off. With the current state of the variables it is much more viable to build a generic tank/gunner as  the other powers are either too taxing or influence your character too little to make much of a difference in battle. My character is currently level 40+ and having failed to be a drone master – since every enemy in the game gets tougher and my drones only gained a one time marginal HP increase and cannot be replenished during firefights – I noticed that straightforward upgrades related to gun performance and health will give you better results. It’s rather sad, but I understand that these niche playstyles are uncommon so they are represented less.\n\nLast, but not leastIf you read my reviews before you will probably be wondering why I haven’t mentioned anything about the storyline yet, the reason for that is that I can’t. The storyline isn’t bad, just very complicated! I will really need to finish a couple more playthroughs to really get the gist of it.\n\nIn conclusionAll in all, E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is a well designed game assuming a setting that is underrepresented in comparison to other themes. If you enjoy cyberpunk then you have probably come at the right address, though keep in mind that the theme is anything but subtle and the customization could be better.","February 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","2"

That dream would be E.Y.E: The Divine Cybermancy.\n\nYou play as a psychic cyborg space marine who has the power to jump several stories in the air, turn invisible, hack computers, clone himself instantly, and much more. If you want, you can sneak around levels stealthily and backstab enemies, or you can put on heavy armor and blow everything up with a minigun. Enemies still overpowering you? Use your psychic powers to drive them insane with hallucinations. If none of those work, you can remotely hack any computer on the level, including the cyborg brains of humans, and then mind control everyone. Once you hack someone's brain, you can see the world through their vision and give them commands. They'll struggle against your control, but if you keep mashing the "attack" button then sooner or later they'll kill all of their friends for you.\n\nBe careful, because any of these techniques can be used against you too. Invisible assassins can snipe you. Psychic monsters can empty your sanity meter, causing you to see imaginary enemies and explosions everywhere. If you chose to hack an enemy, their computer can load a counter virus and blow up your cyberbrain.\n\nAs the plot develops, you slowly realize that your secret organization, the Secreta Secretorum, is wrapped up in a multilayered conspiracy bent on controlling all of society. Depending on the choices you make, you may learn that someone has been pulling the strings on all of the game's mysterious events, or you may discover that you're mind is being manipulated and nothing you've seen is real. Perhaps the entire game is only a recurring dream inside your character's mind. The truth may or may not be revealed in the end.\n\nI haven't even mentioned a lot of the other surreal aspects of it. Up to 32 people can play together in the campaign at once. About half of your dialog options will tell characters to ♥♥♥♥ themselves. Occasionally, after shooting someone, the game will inform you that you just killed a loving and caring daddy. You can use x-ray vision to shoot people through walls, make werewolves explode out of people, goomba-stomp people, deflect oncoming bullets with your katana, and at any time you can open a menu to research things XCOM-style. But even though you can assign a hundred scientists to analyze an eyeball you just found on the ground, you never even see a laboratory in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game suffers from many bugs and other issues which can make it frustrating for new players. It doesn't start you with any of the powers that make the game fun, and you have to grind for a lot of money to unlock them. Objectives often don't make sense, and the levels are huge, so finding the one thing you need can be frustrating. Even just navigating the main hub can be a chore. However, if you can get past all of that and enjoy the core of the game, then it's a ton of fun.\n","August 16, 2013","true","60.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hugh_Neutron/recommended/91700/","Hugh_Neutron","{RR} Yui Hatano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hugh_Neutron/","169 products in account","A lot of people say E.Y.E. is "flawed" and that is has "unrealized" potential. However, this implies that E.Y.E., bugs and unintended glitches aside, did not turn out the way the developers intended it to be. That's not really the case.\n\nI think a lot of misunderstandings  about E.Y.E. stem from the fact that a lot of people misunderstood what E.Y.E.is supposed to be.\n\nIf for some reason you really want to understand the mentality that spawned E.Y.E. and why it is the way it is, here's my suggestion. Install Half-life 1 and play it if you haven't already, then play a bit of Sven Co-op. Then once this is done, go install the HL1 mod "Syndicate Black Ops". This mod was actually created by the devs of E.Y.E. and is it's predecessor for most intents and purposes.  After that, go play E.Y.E. again. There is a good chance that E.Y.E. will suddenly make sense, and its intentions will probably turn out to be not quite as lofty as you might have thought.\n\nE.Y.E. is not Deus Ex, STALKER, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, and it was never meant to be. It sort of reaches in that direction but it stems from a different place. The notion that E.Y.E. was supposed to be like one of those games was shot down by the devs early on, but people wanted a game like that so badly they were willing to believe that it was one of those games anyway and so eventually they just rolled with it.\n\nE.Y.E. comes from an alternate world where games like Deus Ex, System Shock 2, and STALKER became huge successes and sold as much as CoD does in our world.\n\nIt has RPG mechanics, various tools, a hacking system, inventory management, leaning, and all the sorts of mechanics we associate with a more "sophisticated" game, but these are just a means and in this case they are not matched with "sophisticated" ends.  In this case, they are all here to further the objective of "killing tons of enemies" and "being a badass".\n\nE.Y.E. has respawning enemies because if they didn't respawn you'd run out of enemies to kill. Stealth is not fleshed out because stealth is not intended as a gameplay approach by itself, it's just another tool to help you kill more enemies, and in this case it works quite well. Hacking lets you do all sorts of interesting things, but it's also meant to be just another tool you use to be a badass killing machine and is not its own separate play-style. The cybernetic and magic themes are not there to provoke deep thought, they're there just for flavor and to cram in more abilities to make you a badass killing machine.\n\nIf that's not enough gameplay for you by itself then you're probably going to hate the game because that's what the gameplay is and for better or worse that's what it intended to be. The game was mad by and for people who find this sort of play to be satisfying.\n\nThe confusing plot that people like to speculate about is just the icing on the cake and excuse to have the sorts of weird locations and maps the game has. It has a story of course but again it's mostly there to justify sending the player to odd places. The game has magical werewolves and space stoner hippies, that should have clued people in that this isn't a super-serious plot or setting. There's a random guy in one of the levels who's depressed and you can talk him into incinerating himself. He doesn't exist to change anything, he's there for the ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles. That's a pretty good summary of how "serious" or "deep" the plot is meant to be.\n\nAnyway, there's my review of E.Y.E., interpret that how you will.","February 28","true","56.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

After validating, I've only had it crash once. Translations aren't perfect, and some of the words are just really hard to pronounce, much less know how to spell off hand. Though, this isn't really obstructive to gameplay, given you can easily figure things out if you think for a few moments.\n\nThe game won't tell you all the default keys, you're going to want to check those, as the tutorial isn't going to answer that for you either. The tutorials frankly aren't that beneficial, they'll give you the very basic, but fully employing something is going to take trial and error.\n\nActual gameplay wise... The game is great really, you're not restricted to just being the heavy armored titan who shambles along mowing down everything he sees. Sure, in the beginning you're going to be more or less locked into the basic strategies of, long range versus close range... But very soon, you'll be able to make yourself capable of stealth, tanking, hacking, and more.\n\nTo explain what I mean to those thinking of buying this game:\nThe game does have a stealth system. It's normally impossible to be stealthy unless you use the cloak implant that you can buy pretty early in. If you hit someone who hasn't detected you, you will get a pretty nicely sized modifier to your hit.\nHacking; is actually a very powerful tool in the game if you can get a few good strategies for it going. You can quite literally make your enemies turn against each other, ignore, and even defend you. You can take a glance through someone's eyes... Or you can flat out cause brain death by hacking a person. However, hacking isn't possible on all enemies in the game.\nThere's varieties of every type of gun in the game, each with a unique aspect. Just looking at melee, the Distortion Hammer is big, heavy, slow... But it causes massive damage, and it can work great as a shield (yes, you can block using weapons, bigger weapons are better at blocking). There's also the dual blades, which are fast, lethal, but lack the damage per hit and blocking power of the hammer. In short; you can play it light, quiet and quick... Or big, heavy, and monsterous... With any weapon really.\n\nYour "special" stuff doesn't come from killstreaks or anything like that, no, they come from two branches of specials, which are purchasable/earnable. Cyber Implants and Psy Powers. Implants are all purchasable, but psypowers; some are purchasable, others have to be earned.\nCyber Implants have mostly basic effects, improving your aim, hardening your skin, making you invisible to enemies, making you jump higher and run faster...\nWhereas Psy Powers... Are much more specialized. Creating tissue paper clones of yourself to shoot at enemies, turning ammo into health, health into energy, killing and teleporting to your target, among others.\n\nNow, the reason why I say that you should buy this game if it's on sale...\nIs that while it's well made in terms of creating an atmosphere, being unique, and giving you plenty to play with... The actual stuff you'll be fighting.. Is pretty slim in diversity.\nSentries, Scrabs, Jiang, Carnophage, Looter, Manduco, Synicle, Federal Cop, Special Force, Deus Ex, Interceptor, Kraak, Perigrum Forma, and Patrol.\nThat is every non-named in the entire game. Which as you can imagine gets pretty repetitive. Different weapons but pretty much the same thing.\n\nYou can configure AI, but most of the time, enemies seem to be great at finding, and shooting you even from long distances. Even on the lowest "reinforcement" spawn, you might find yourself swarmed with over a dozen of a single enemy, who automatically path towards you from their spawn point just a few feet away. Yes, that is a problem with the game, respawns of enemies are pretty bad. They'll spawn at set points, ones which can be easily memorized given they're largely just open space most of the time, and you can literally walk to that spot... Wait, and then take newly spawned enemies by surprise, mowing them down with ease.\n\nNot all gamestyles are that rewarding.\nIf you hack a lot, you'll find you're getting a disproportionate amount of XP to money.\nIf you sneak a lot (ghosting through missions, which is possible nicely enough), you'll find you're low on everything, given there's not much of a bonus to being unseen at all times aside from getting shot less.\nIf you raise a machine army of Scrabs and Sentries... Expect them to die. If a non-machine ally gets hit by one by accident (very easy given sentries are machine guns), they will kill your machine.\n\nAlly AI is pretty bad, you'll find yourself getting trapped in corners and in hallways by allies who don't realize you trying to walk through them is a cue to move out of the way... And often times, when they do move, they'll move just to get in your way again, because you found a way past them. They're also totally dumb in terms of vision and sound. If they didn't get shot, and they're not looking at whoever's firing dozens of rounds a minute... No matter how many times you get hit, they will not turn around to help you. Your only hope is to just pray they randomly turn in time to help you. Allies especially are pretty bad when it comes to getting in the way of you defending yourself. They are quite literally the last thing you want when you're using a sniper rifle at long range, as they won't hesitate to step in front of you right when you're aiming, or even shooting, causing you to have to move so they're not blocking you anymore... Or just kill them.\n\nAll in all...\n\nThe game is a great idea, it's got a great design... But the amount of small things that will make you go, "That's such a simple thing... How could they not get that right? Or at least fix it?" is pretty high in number.  The game does make you think though in terms of strategy, using your environment to your advantage, which is definitely it has going for it. But I digress...\n\nUnless you have played it before, or you have cash you're willing to gamble, or it's on sale...\nDon't buy it.\n\nIf you end up liking this game, chances are... You will LOVE it. But it really depends on who you are and what you look for in a game. It's not your typical FPS, it's not your typical RPG, it's not your typical anything really. It's a mash of several genres, and while I do love it, and recommend it...\n\nI do understand it's not for everyone; the environment/lore might be a turn off for people, or you might find it to enhance the experience. This formula works out for many aspects of the game.... And so like I said;\n\nIt's one hell of a game. Whether or not you love it, is on you.","December 15, 2014","true","78.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115503354/recommended/91700/","76561198115503354","Peter = Hell Jumper","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115503354/","80 products in account","While it may say 42 hours on record, my actual record in E.Y.E is 84. So I think I have enough experience with this game to finally review it.\n\nFirst off, I'm just going to warn future buyers that E.Y.E is a game that appeals to a very specific kind of player, generally players who are fans of the first Deus Ex from 2000's. I had to learn this the hard way after suggesting this to many of my friends only for them to judge the game as broken or unfinished. It's not for everyone, and even though I enjoyed this game I can understand why people don't like it.\n\nSo what exactly is E.Y.E? E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is a cyber punk FPS RPG drug trip published and developed by Streum. In E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy you customize your character(s) and shape them into different paths that the game has set for you (and no, you cannot customize your character's gender or body type, it's only on a stat level) The game has quite a learning curve at the very start of the game so when the game throws a needle in your face and tells you to inject yourself full of cybernetic Chi...You pick some traits that sounds cool only to find out you've made the worst character in existance.\n\nYou can also select different armor types for whatever playthrough you're going with, such as: Light armor, which allows you to run faster and cloak more effectively but very fragile and next to useless at the end game. It's good for a stealth or Psi run if you are sitting on a large amount of stamina, but that's about it.\n\nMedium armor, a bit slower than light armor but can take a fair amount of punishment. This armor is decent from early to mid game and sometimes late game depending on what role you went with. But chances are you're going to want heavy armor on mars.\n\nAnd finally Heavy armor, this armor is a little too strong for it's own good. It can tank massive amounts of damage and if you have a chaingun, you might as well be considered a living turret. There isn't a whole lot of mobs in early to mid game that can potentially stop you other than demons. The only flaw to this armor is it's speed, but when you look at the Heavy armor's benefits, it simply makes the game a whole lot easier to play.\n\nThe Plot  It's really hard to say what the plot is, or at least where it's going. There are several different theories floating around on the forums and none of which have managed to explain as to what in the hell is going on. You play as some cybernetic ninja/samurai/knight/zombie. And if that hasn't already driven you off then I congratulate you, you are perhaps more devoted to insane indie games than I am.\n\nYou wake up from some nightmare (or vision) only to find yourself in a cave cluttered with bodies and blood stains. You then recieve a message from your 'Mentor' saying you need to get out of the cave before the federals find you. Once you have arrived at the HQ you will get a lecture from your mentor about how you were captured and a reminder of the curent state of the proxy war with the two factions within E.Y.E, the Jians and the Culter.\n\nAfter your chat with him, you are greeted by some kind of floating metal box with a gun attached saying you left a message for yourself.  You learn that you have amneisa (obviously) and that there was a mission on mars that went to hell and back with you somehow in the mix of it.\n\nThat's pretty much the easiest to understand. But after that the story itself takes a nose dive into the chaotic storm that is insanity, leaving you with no idea as to what your objective is or why you are doing it.\n\nA lot of players claim that's what makes E.Y.E enjoyable, but I had to play the game in small sips because of the garbled plot. So you better like Source engine, shooting the same models of enemies over and over again, and grinding for research items because the story is not worth paying attention to.\n\nThe Game  I'm not going to lie to you, this game is a fresh breath of air in this MoBA/action shooter dominated industry. This game does a good job of creating a unique Cyberpunk setting despite being limited by the constraints of the Source engine. And if there is another E.Y.E installment, I would prefer it still used Source simply because it seems to work well with the game. You also have the advantage of anyone on a potato could play it.\n\nBut there are many problems with E.Y.E that make it hard to create an enjoyable experience. First of all the guns and the way they feel are horrible. This is once again, probably because of the Source engine because so far I have yet to play a Source game with satisfying gunplay.\n\nThe other flaw with guns is the progression (or the progression of this game in general) in which they are unlocked. The majority of them are already unlocked and most of the default weapons are far better than what you can purchase (excluding the power hammer and the Bear Killer) I'm not sure what the development was like for this game, but this is basic progression logic completely ignored.\n\nFinally the maps- The true problem with the maps in E.Y.E is just the emptiness, there aren't any civilian NPC's (no I am not counting the bandits as civilian NPC's) Without civilians walking around it just takes away the atmosphere. It's that hateful moment when you stop and think "oh yeah, I'm in a video game..." Hell, there's even a map called New Eden where you can run into apartments and quickly find out that there is no living human being in a single room.\n\nSpeaking of human population, if you aren't fond of the whole "women as trophies" thing then you are not going to like any mission involving bandits. Because a large portion of their quests involve stealing sex slaves or some rubbish like that. Ironically, there are no in-game female models, they are only mentioned....So as far as you know you're stealing nothing but a poor man's depraved wet dream. Have FUN!\n\nAnd lastly the multiplayer. The multiplayer is really disappointing simply because there are only two game modes and next to no population playing them. The first game mode is Battle Royale where you spawn in the map with a random selection of armor and weapons, there is also perma death so caution rewards. The next game mode is a little bit different, you take a spiked orb from one side of the map to the other with your team, so death basket ball royale to be frank. This game mode unfortunately only has about 2 or 4 maps and zero population playing it. So Co-op is really where this game's strength is, but I still consider PVP as content so I'm including it in the review.\n\nFinal Verdict  There is a lot more to cover but some of it could potentially spoil the game or turn you off completely. So my rating for E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is a 7/10. The game offers a lot of choices but ironically doesn't allow you to pick a side between Culter and Jians, or develop your character's personality. But what really ruins the experience is the plot itself. If the game kept a plot and ran with it instead of sending you off on a wild goose chase, I might have been easier on it. But that would have to be my biggest complaint with E.Y.E.\n\nHowever, E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy is reasonably priced at $9.99 and even lower on sales ($2.99 or $0.99) so if you don't enjoy it you won't be horribly punished by your purchase. But between the limits of the Source Engine and the lack of experience with game progression it's understandable why some people would call this unfinished. I cannot blame anyone for saying so, but I also cannot agree that this game is worthless. So a 7/10 would have to be the best I can award it without being too biased.","January 22","true","45.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There was one stage in particular that gave me a great deal of grief, but the elements were there, especially the hacking, and the story kept me interested too. It's true, the story will not make sense even if you do get the 'true' ending, but it's possible to piece together some idea of a story which has worked for games like Killer 7 or Hotline Miami.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/recommended/91700/","outlaw953","Metal Bison [33rd]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outlaw953/","263 products in account","With a very special thanks to RoosterTheRed for proof-reading this review, E.Y.E is a first-person shooter roleplaying game set in a futuristic society in which several factions compete for resources and overall control. You play as a custom character comprised of a chosen set of skills, races, and equipment; as with many other roleplaying titles, these attributes can be altered during the game’s course. Though complex in the beginning, E.Y.E delivers a fantastic overall theme that only enhances the gameplay and in-game decisions. This game includes solo, cooperative, and competitive play options, though it is recommended to play this game with friends or other individuals you know given the fact that the online community is quite scarce in number; this should not be too much of an issue since the base game presents a wide array of playability.\nHere are just a few things I found of interest in Blat-Blat: Sneaky Shiz (inside joke):\n\nRoleplaying Aspects - Within E.Y.E’s in-depth theme, described more thoroughly in a further segment) is the ability to generate and decide conflicts as a character of your choosing. There are multiple humanoid racial archetypes you can choose from, and three can be selected in any combination to grant favored bonuses; a guide is heavily recommended for new players deciding on what race or races to be lest their original tabletop, A.V.A, was reviewed. Beyond this elaborate statistics system in which players can assign skills more pertinent to their style of play by allotting points into such expertise as Hacking. As the player gains levels, they may apportion more points into their skills, and specific upgrades and abilities can be purchased if the player’s character has the prerequisite skill efficiency. Throughout the campaign there are many decisions that can be made to influence the remaining story or side quests, which causes the balance between the multiple existing parties to shift slightly. Another interesting topic is Research, which can be performed from the in-game menu at virtually any time. Research grants the player items such as the healing syringe, as well as additional lore and weapons.\n\nUnique Overworld - This title’s theme is widely regarded as steampunk, though I find it to be more reminiscent of Warhammer 40,000’s flavor. Regardless, it maintains a glimpse of a grim future, with rivaling factions, psionic powers, monsters, and magic. Character designs are engaging, and enemy forces are both laughable-referring to the forces with afros-and menacing at times. Scarabs-similar to Skull Servitors in Warhammer 40,000-and other technological advances blend nicely with the atmosphere since a given majority of objects can be hacked or modified. The overworld has a gloomy noir feel to it which amplifies the theme of warring parties while retaining individuality.\n\nGameplay - E.Y.E melds several interesting components together into one combat system which can be experienced in a variety of ways. Items are displayed in an overly of the character in a depiction as to what they can carry in a grid-based format; this generally means that you can bear as much as can be “on your person.” Gameplay is fluid, with varying forms of firearms and melee weapons at the player’s disposal to aide in eliminating hostiles. The previously described Research system also plays a vital role in weapon selection since weapons and items such as the Gatling gun and medical syringe, respectively, can be developed for use. Players are able to hack objects for certain gains such as opening a secret compartment behind a locked door, and are even able to be hacked back by the object they are targeting; it’s strange but highly humorous. Psionic powers can also be used in combat. Examples of this include creating multiple clones of the player, performing a devastating sprinting melee attack, transmuting all grounded items into health pickups, and passively increasing jump elevation. There are also several purchasable upgrades from venders which add new powers and improve known skills. All of these allow the player to develop their own style of play apart from the usual ‘kill everything that moves and forget anything else’ approach many other first-person shooters adopt.\n\nHidden Content - Though mostly prompted by side missions, there are many undiscovered bounties stowed around the map. One such is a treasure that few players have discovered-including myself-within the vicinity of a huge map. These objectives add a great amount of depth to E.Y.E, as well as replayability.\n\nTL:DR - E.Y.E offers an enormous amount of content for players who enjoy roleplaying games and intriguing lore combined with a variety of actions, upgrades, and choices in-game. This title does have its quirks in regards to certain features but its gameplay style makes up for this as a motley roleplaying experience unlike many. This title is highly recommended for those who pursue games that blend tactics and combat, as well as those how persistently go out of their way to unravel secrets.

Sadly this isn’t true. It’s combat heavy with constantly respawning enemies. The cloak runs out too quickly, the maps are huge with wide open spaces and not enough cover, to make stealth a viable tactic. The plot doesn’t make sense to me, partly due to a poor translation from the native French language resulting in NPC dialogue lacking proper grammar, and partly because allies give updated orders during missions while you’re too busy trying to not die, so it’s hard to concentrate on what is being said, and every mission becomes a case of just following the waypoint marker and shooting some guys or pressing a button without ever really knowing why. Yes, there are some complex character stats and abilities and the shooting is okay, but nowhere near as entertaining as Serious Sam for mindless violence.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turnipkingsteam/recommended/91700/","turnipkingsteam","masoN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turnipkingsteam/","40 products in account","Many people buy this game thinking they're buying a System Shock or a Deus Ex. Maybe a Borderlands or a STALKER. This is an incorrect assumption to make. It's true that EYE features many RPG elements. It has dialogue, branching paths, levels, inventory management, stores and side-missions. But this is all plays second fiddle to what EYE is really aiming for. It's not a Deus Ex as much as it is a Serious Sam. It's not a Borderlands as much as it is a Painkiller. I really cannot emphasize this enough, it's my belief that the majority of the complaints directed towards EYE stem from a false presupposition of what this game is trying to be. That is not the players fault though, because EYE doesn't exactly make these things clear.\n\nEYE is a mess.\n\nUnless you are a Dwarf Fortress player, EYE is likely to be the biggest, messiest game you are ever likely to see. Right off the bat it gives you a character creation screen which makes absolutely no sense to anyone beginning the game without first googling what in the hell you are looking at. The dialogue is either intentionally vague, bizarre and most of the time incomprehensible. You will be thrown into a world which appears to have some sort of lore and backstory but you'll be lucky if you ever understand a tenth of what is going on. When the game presents you with the tutorial level, many aspects of that tutorial will need tutorials themselves, and you will be confronted with a library of tutorial videos on how certain game mechanics work. Your body can be hacked and destroyed by doors and ATMs. Sometimes huge monsters will appear in the level and fire rockets in directions you didn't even know existed and you have to kill it. Sometimes you'll be tasked to kill a high ranking enemy and he will zip about the game shooting and cloaking tanking hits like nothing else. This game is primarily single-player, but you can have 64-player coop. You can buy spells and augmentations and guns and big hammers all with a currency called Brozouf which you seem to endlessly gain in areas where you are doing something for some reason for someone. EYE is a deranged and twisted mess of Syndicate, Neuromancer, Warhammer 40k and the entire personal drug stash of Hunter S. Thompson. And you know what? It's amazing.\n\nThere is no messing around with regenerating health, cover or killcams. You can go in fast and furious or heavy like robocop. The guns feel like they should. There is real impact when you shoot something. Enemies will go flying across the screen. You can teleport into people and laugh as they explode. You can hit people in the face with giant hammers and watch as they bounce off the walls. You can hack people. You can force push four-armed creatures into radioactive goo. You can block bullets with swords. This game can be anything you want, but above all it is satisfying.\n\nIf you get this game, it's imperative that you know what you getting into. If you want a cyberpunk dystopia with thought provoking dialogue and choices that mean something, I don't advise you to get this game.

Even the medkit can be used to overdose someone.\nHacking? use it to fry someone's brain or turn them crazy and make them attack their colleagues.\nMagic? Create a clone army of yourself and send them in to battle, or if you prefer the direct approach just teleport yourself "inside" your target enemy and make them explode.\nStealth? Cloak up, jump over buildings, snipe people or slit their throats (or crush them with a hammer... or crush them by falling on them super-mario style)\nGuns? Guns.\n\nAnd on the topic of guns, this game really brings home the bacon with satisfying weaponry. Admittedly there are no super fancy guns that shoot lightning and razorblades and fire and particle effects and ♥♥♥♥, but there are guns that will consume their entire magazine in a single trigger press because "Why only shoot one bullet when  you can shoot all the bullets?"\nThere are handcannons that can destroy attack choppers, machine pistols that will decimate entire squads of terrorists and melee weapons that can be used to not only deflect bullets but cleave entire swaths of would be enemies in two.\nEven the entry level pistols are very satisfying to use as you put round after round into the ribcages and craniums of your aggressors.\n\nTheme? Dystopian cyberpunk inspired by somewhere between the matrix (it's shame that movie never had a sequel), bladerunner, johnny mnemonic and pretty much every major sci-fi movie from the 80's onwards, it's a real melting pot of ♥♥♥♥ and at times you will even notice design influences and likenesses to cult sci-fi shows like Farscape and videogames like shadowrun (the Genesis version, i never played the xbox/PC version).\nIt is very atmospheric, and very well fitting. If you can ignore some of the now dated and chunky environments, but hey, the source engine can only be pushed so far.\n\nNow, story... Story is very difficult to explain in a simple review, but just be aware of the following: if you WANT a story, it is there, a full narrative of what's going on and who you are, but it is not going to hold  your hand.\nThis isn't CoD where it's straightforward "good against evil", this isn't Deus Ex with it's over-arching evil corporations and terrorists (although there are plenty of both in E.Y.E), and this isn't <insert generic RPG> where the protagonist undergoes Tom Cruise syndrome (He's a good <x> but he has his doubts, UNTIL FEMALE <y> CAUSES HIM TO HAVE A CRISIS OF FAITH, AND IN ORDER TO WIN HER LOVE HE BECOMES A GREAT <x>. no really, that's every tom cruise movie ever.) before eventually facing off with the nemesis antagonist.\n\ntl;dr? wacky off-form shooter with RPG elements and a batshit crazy plot with cyberpunk aesthetics.","May 21","true","205.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Even the weapons have several animation states!\n\nSounds are pleasing, and the soundtrack is VERY pleasing.  (Though, you will have to dig into the game files to grab the music.)\n\nMelee weapons, handguns, rifles, shotguns, high-explosives, and even a hammer.  Not to mention crazy psychic voodoo-magic.  Also you can clone yourself, and your clones will even level up based on your stats, as well.\n\nSome great, uh, voiceacting.  Trust me, you'll find it quite amusing at times.\n\nGameplay is excellent.  Hacking is a challenge, and the gunplay is satisfying.  Also, you can kill people by throwing hamburger boxes at high speeds and that's funny to me.\n\nStandalone missions to play outside of story mode even support randomized enemy spawns, and random-picked objectives.\n\nAnd to add to that, cooperative mode allows many players to play through the story mode seamlessely.\n\nLots of achievements, if you're into that.\n\n---------------\n\nThe downsides:\n\nA blast in singleplayer, but the game truly becomes a gem with friends.\n\nThe translation quality on ingame texts is.. err..\n\nIt can take some time to find the randomly-dropping researches, and money grows on your character a bit slowly.  Dying is EXTREMELY dangerous, as it can apply perma-debuffs to your character's stats.  That is, until you sink enough time and money into research to prevent them entirely.\n\nCommunity for it is a bit stagnant, and while custom maps are possible, pretty much none exist.\n\nMultiplayer PVP feels strange, and multiplayer itself has some odd bugs.  IE: Lives are shared across all players, meaning somebody dying multiple times can kick EVERYONE back to the lobby map.  Some maps even end up killing the host when a client dies in some areas.\n\nAll physics objects also effect other players, so you CAN kill someone else with a high-velocity object, even if PVP is disabled.  Oh, all NPC's (even friendly ones!) are affected by damage, so it's easy for one player to null-void the entire lobby map of NPC's to buy from.  Ouch.\n\nRe-playability tends to DIE after some time of playing it, but it has enough to offer to make you come back after a while as well.  (You'll probably get tons of hours through a single chunk of playing through it all, though.  Even more with friends!)\n\n---------------\n\nAll in all, great game.  REALLY glad I was able to play this, and hope you will too.","December 23, 2013","true","167.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

WTF, I can't even see them and I'm supposed to be a genetically modified super future super warrior.\nA lot of mechanics and upgrades come unexplained and dialogue is really bad, the NPCs will immediately turn hostile for things like "Hmm...Ok!".\nIt also has cool weapons and okay gunfight, but a nonexistent incoherent story, at times boring and wide level design. It's almost completely shooting based, but people call it an RPG...it has other not as useful mechanics.\nAlso with it being a source game it runs pretty good but some of the mechanics create unbeliavable lag, like "infrared" vision, which makes it useless on my machine.\nAnd the ending:\nIt was all you, it was all a dream, it just restarts the game","November 29, 2015","false","9.2"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

Anyways,\n\nE.Y.E. You're a stupidly wierd game.\n\nGood:\nThe gameplay is fun for what it is, and I never got tired of the cool factor of being able to block machine gun fire with my sword or being able to hack into someone's skull to make them explode. Couple of other gadgets you start with too, and you have quite a few upgrades and new guns you can get that may or may not be fun to use. It never really gets painfully hard either, which I consider a redeeming factor for this incoherent game.\n\nThere are plenty of free missions and locales that you can play, several fun to use weapons, pyschic powers, a campaign that doesn't overstay it's welcome, and an awesome atmosphere that is both tense and unsettling. The entire setting has a nice cyberpunk feel to it, and there's plenty of cool factor to spare.\n\nBad:\nIf you are expecting any kind of story to enjoy than good luck. Confusing English and a lack of explanation makes the story hard to follow at best. It doesn't help that the story plays with some insanity tropes as well; making things even more confusing. The rpg mechanics are worthless, and I never really felt like I became anything special aside from just a samurai guy. Some of the systems like magic/psychic power feels underdeveloped, and the insanity thing, which actually is an interesting mechanic for the game, can be removed by an 'upgrade'. As far as combat goes: the A.I. is ridiculous. One little detection can result in the entire enemy army walking in a straight line towards your location. There is also this weird critical hit/negative hit system, but I've killed enemies in one hit with a "Failed Attack" several times so I don't know what to make of that. Overall, The whole thing just feels marred by poor design choices.\n\nThe story is confusing as a story can get. The core rpg mechanics lack complexity. There are way too dang many large empty areas. A.I. is clumsy at best. And you'll probably go through the whole game without buying or upgrading anything. Don't expect to be impressed anywhere here; there's just a lot of boring trash beneath a paper thin shine.\n\nOverall:\nIt's a game you have to play simply for the experience. Just to play for the overall unique strangeness of the setting. To get sucked in to the weirdness of the story about a cybernetic super samurai who may or may not be insane. It has it's cool moments to help things a long too, and to say again, you start with a sword that can block pretty much anything and sets people on fire.\n\nBut, if you are expecting a solid experience then you probably won't be amused by this at all. The game requires you to overlook a lot of problems. If it were even a little bit better I would change my overall opinion here. But there is just nothing to guarantee you will like this, so that's why I would not recommend it.","January 11, 2014","false","37.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","3"

Yes, you´ll either love it or hate it, it´s a very unique game.\n\n<<<<<THE BEGINNING>>>>>\n\nYou are thrown into a world you probably wouldn´t imagine in your weirdest weed-caused dreams. You are a guy who lost all his memories (yes, this setting is very commonly used;). You make your way out of a dark cave, where you get attacked by the first enemy: a rather small two-legged red monster spitting fireballs.\n\nAfter some minutes in, you realize that somehow the cave leads to the very top of a industrial building used as Military base. You gear up: Double Katanas, Pistols, , Revolvers, MGs, Assault rifles, Sniper Rifles, do you want Armor? A light, medium or heavy one? Drones? Medipacks? Remote Turrets? Grenades?)\n\nYou then kill some old-fashioned fallout-like brotherhood-of-steel guys who decided to spend their free time and roam around in a lonely cold wet canal next to the building complex. Jump into the sewers, bash annoying punks there, get out, make an attempt to hack a door but fail desperately the first time, get hacked back by the door as you think\n\n"What am I doing here?!"\n\nAt this point, most people quit the game and uninstall it. E.Y.E makes it very hard for beginners to get into the mechanics, and you have to figure out almost everything by yourself. But after you get used to it, the game is definitely worth your time. There are 10+ unique designed open-world levels you can replay anytime with optional side quests and randomly-generated objectives.\n\n<<<<<GAMEPLAY>>>>>\n\nIt´s up to you how to beat the level, if you want to go rambo with a minigun, go sneaky with your crysis-like nanotek invisibility suit and kill guys with your bullet-blocking katana, hack enemy turrets  and control them, summon  allied ghostsoldiers, use drones and remote turrets, sniping using infrared vision, bribe NPCs,......\n\n<<<<<WEAPONS>>>>>\n\nThe weapon feel all pretty solid, there is a wide range to choose from. Every weapon has it´s requirements, but once you unlocked it with the in-game currency "bonzoufs", you can equip them for "free". Assault rifles don´t f**** around, they are single-shot at the distance, very accurate and can bring down the early-game enemys with 1-2 shots. Overall well balanced\n\n<<<<<GADGES>>>>>\n\nYou can choose from Medipacks, Remote ("Half-Life") turrets, flying drones, and Grenades.\nMany of these Items have to be researched before you can unlock them at your HQ`s.\nThe best thing is that besides your limited inventory space("System Shock"), there is no limit how many of what things you equip. So if you are a Rambo style player, you might want to get a nice Assault Rifle, double pistols and fill the remaining "backpackspace" with mags.\n\nItems do not cost something to equip, they only have to be unlocked, which gives you a lot of freedom since you don´t depend on money\n\n\n\n<<<<<STORY>>>>>\n\nThe Story is very confusing. There are no intro video sequences, you have to figure it out by yourself by either reading 30+ pages of written stuff in your HQ´s libary or search online for a fanmade story intro;). The story is poorly told, but not bad at all. Depending on your choices, there are different endings. (No "Mass Effect endings")\nThe replayability is very high, you can go on side missions, and if you roam around in the levels, there are may people to meet, things to do, equipment to get.... Almost every guy in the game has a quest for you, it´s up to you if you accept it and how you beat it.\n\nAlso, there are many strange things to discover in this weird world;)\n\n\nMy rating: 8/10, pick it up while on sale, not everybody likes the game;)\nAnd please don´t go in and be like "oh, there are soldiers shooting at me. F*** what is he throwing at me? DAAAAMN I got killed.... *uninstall*\nGive it it´s time! You didn´t explore the van Braun/Majestic 12 HQ´s in one day, did you?\nPS: read the beginner guides in the forum and play the demo (read them before playing the demo;)\n\n\n[If you think I have not mentioned important facts/ have suggestions to edit the review, please comment]\n\n-carrot/eM","June 30, 2014","true","44.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

If you're just starting out, you'll notice there is a fairly large and extensive RPG element despite this being an Action/FPS title. Do not be overwhelmed! This game is simply trying newer things and mixing up the genre a bit. You can use money you've gained to research new weapons, better abilities, and better cybernetic implants. Your character slowly becomes this god-like being whether you just want to run'n'gun or be more ninja like. Either way, what's infront of you usually dies. A very ambitious title.\nNot to mention that there are branching story archs.\n\nThe artwork and design is a well blended cluster of Warhammer meeting Cyber-Punk. The weapons feel heavy and powerful. The cities have smog and droopy colors. Everything comes together really giving the world this depressing "hell was already here" look.\n\nSadly, the Source engine begins to show it's age. That didn't stop the great map development or modelers though. Bugs tend to still pop up and physics can go haywire, but that has not stopped me from enjoying 200+ hours of entertainment. I bought this years ago and still enjoy it. Even if it isn't on sale, I would recommend this game. I can only pray for a solid sequel. I even see this on sale for $1 USD every now and again. Don't let the price tag fool you. It's way beyond a bargain (if you're willing to let go of what you already knew about the FPS genre).\n\nGet it.\nLove it.\n","July 4, 2014","true","250.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daspanda/recommended/91700/","daspanda","Xen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daspanda/","504 products in account","I'll be frank...this game has a lot of potential. Its only real draw to me is it's like Deus Ex... if Deus Ex was a horribly translated, pretty shotty source mod and hadn't been funded by some pretty large companies at the time. That being said, what there is to the game is fun. E.Y.E. boasts nice multiplayer, interesting leveling systems, a cool crafting system but is plagued with issues like limited enemies and the quickly dying out source engine. As much as source has brought us joy and happiness, it just isn't modern game material, even back in 2011.\n\nWith all of those factors in place, the enemies can be ridiculously easy, often running around randomly into tactically horrid spots. The hacking in the game is another game to its self, like a small RPG that is played in a minute or so. The Tutorials are also extremely lengthy, have no sound, and because of the communication gap caused by the games horrible translation, hard to follow. The story is told to you through your collegues and mentors since you for some reason have amnesia, which is one drawn out story mechanic this game could have done without.\n\nOverall the game is a fun tech demo, if source wasn't already out for almost a decade, I would have been wow'd by this. It's a good buy if you can get it for $5 or less, but definitely isn't worth the $10 price tag.","July 18, 2014","false","37.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This is why I love independent games.\n\nNot going to lie. This game is rough. It has issues. But you know what? It's easy to overlook because of how ambitious it is.\n\nIn this game you play an agent in a shadowy organization dedicated to fighting... you know what? I don't even know what the plot is. There's infighting in the organization. It's distracting from your true purpose of combating a corrupting force. There is background text that hints at a complex setting, though it doesn't have much impact on what you will experience in the assorted missions.\n\nThe plot itself is a complete head trip. And the ending gets really meta.\n\nIn terms of game play, it's a first person shooter. You get money and in between missions you can unlock items. You have a number of inventory slots on your person you can place those items in.  You gain experience, and levels, which you can use to improve skills.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EuroNumbers/recommended/91700/","EuroNumbers","Suule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EuroNumbers/","498 products in account","E.Y.E. is a hybrid RPG-FPS that tries to re-capture the feeling of Deus Ex using the Source engine and WH40k aesthetics. Does it work though? Partially. The stealth aspect is heavily nerfed in comparison to Deus Ex and most of the time you have to brute-force your way in, but still the game delivers what made Deus Ex good - freedom of approaching your objectives and battles. Add a layer of upgrades, customizability and good weapon selection and you have a rather solid gameplay.\n\nBut E.Y.E. is not an easy game. It will take at least 2-3 failed attempts to understand how to play it properly. Even with the cheat sheets, it's very easy to misunderstand basic concepts and utilities role. The difficulty ramps up very quickly and by 3rd level it's very easy to get overwhelmed if you're inexeprienced. But once you master the system, the game delivers an amazing experience in terms of many builds you can use. The three main systems - guns, hacking and spells can be used seprately or merged and more often you'll find yourself trying to find a fun build that is in line with your playstyle rather than making a jack-of-all character.\n\nOn the narrative side, E.Y.E.'s broken English and dialogue choices that range from a calm responses to psychotic threats of violence certain give the game a really weird flavour to it. Some of the messages you get in game "You gain Brouzouf", "My legs are OK" and "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T! Ultra-failed attack!" have become loved by the E.Y.E. community to the point that no discussion is complete without copious amount of Brozouf, checking your legs and making sure your attacks are not Ultra-failed. There is a story hidden behind that facade of poorly translated writing, but it takes a little bit to get to it. It feels more like a forgein film than anything in that manner - it's rough around the edges but ultimately it's enjoyable after watching it twice.\n\nIt's really hard to describe E.Y.E. - what started out as a clunky, buggy mess of a game with some patching and community turned into one of the "Must-played" cult games. E.Y.E. is an experience. A wonderful experience in the most psychodelic gaming trip you can ever imagine.\n\nI recommend it.","December 28, 2015","true","72.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","0"

Gameplay will make absolutely no sense at first. For example, enemies respawn on a timer and will appear literally just after a blind corner. Thus, there will never be an "all-clear", and thus you will find hacking to be a non-option without literal invisibility because most areas have zero hiding spots from the all-seeing armed thugs. If you can handle the repeated trial-and-error, the confusing text, and the dead ends of research (there's research that takes ten minutes to do IRL and costs resources but gives you nothing, you'll only find out which if you check the wiki or waste your time researching them) (and on that matter, research sometimes requires items  that are dropped by random mooks in a black case that blends in with their environment. Seriously?), EVENTUALLY you will find a game that is fun with satisfying weaponry and, near the end, wonderful and powerful skills. Most importantly, you can get one that kills and enemy and teleports you straight onto them so you can murder and teabag in one fell swoop.\n\nBut there's just so many bad aspects to the game. I can't say it should be bought for full price. Especially not on Steam where  much better games can be bought for less than ten bucks. I guess I can say it's worth it if you have plenty of spare time and don't know what to do with three bucks this holiday.","December 21, 2013","true","9.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Imagine a stoned Russian telling you a story mixing up many of your favorite sci-fi tropes. Elements from Alien, Deus Ex, Stalker, Doom, Roadside Picnic, and Half-Life thrown in. Sounds great and weird, right? Sadly, it's not.\n\nThe game consists of running through vast empty levels of dark brown and fog, instantly populated with waves of respawning enemies that will headshot you from across the map, or rain fiery death on you before you can turn around. And that's AFTER you crank both the difficulty and respawn rates down. Gameplay for every level is either "run over here", or "run over here and kill mobs".\n\nThe game has many elements thrown in - there's 2 or 3 stat systems (all poorly explained, all seeming to do very little), half of a vendor system (you can buy but not sell), psychic powers, and hacking. Great ideas, but not executed well.\n\nThe game is built on the aging Source engine. It runs more or less fine, it's just not worth it. I really wanted to like this one.

It doesn't seem to follow any of the usual rules of modern game design and ends up feeling very fresh because of it. But the weirdness is almost certainly going to cause the lowest common denominator hate it because, well, it's not easily accessible.\n\nThe setting is, as someone put it, a mix of Deus Ex, Warhammer 40k, Stalker and a whole slew of 1980's scifi films. Some of the maps would not look at all out of place in a Blade Runner game, for example.\n\nGiven how cheap the game is, especially when on sale, I just have to recommend it.

You have stats that benefit your melee damage, accuracy, hacking, run speed, Psychic powers, and so on. On top of that you can spend ludicrous amounts of money to get cyber body modifications or to preform research on artifacts which will boost your stats even higher. At a certain point you will be able to run at ridiculous speeds, turn your foes into a fine red mist with a cybernetic claymore, and backstab helicopters with warhammers.\n\nHowever there are a few places where it, debatibaly, falls short. There are a lot of bugs in the game, not including the ones that you can shoot. Even with an extensive ingame tutorial a lot of gameplay mechanics are somewhat unclear. Every character in the game talks and swears like a grizzled bandit, from actual grizzled bandits to your fellow psychic space illuminati assassin paladins. A karma and rating system that 'somehow' are intregal to gameplay probably. Getting shot in the face so hard that it breaks your legs, you get the idea.\n\nThe story is an absolute trip, even if you do get the final ending there's a lot that you probably wont grasp. With elements such as alternate/nonexistant timelines, internal conflict in past-present tense, and the psychic force of the universe lashing out in the form of monstrosities in retaliation to rapid cyberascension and the squelching out of other species. I honestly have no idea what's going on and neither will you. Shut up and gain brozouf.","December 22, 2014","true","37.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Divine Cybermancy is a FPS/RPG most comparable to Deus Ex gameplay mixed with Source engine physics, Warhammer 40K aesthetics and a story that's meant to be as confusing as possible.\n\nThe story revolves around power struggles. Between governments and rebel organizations, between different factions in the same organization, between members within the same faction, and ultimately power struggles within individuals. There are multiple endings and the player has a choice in what factions to side with or betray as well as how they want to accomplish the tasks they've been given.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix between an FPS and an RPG. You have stats and classes but how well you can point a gun still determines whether you will hit or miss. Your stats affect everything from your ability to use weapons to how prone to hallucinations your character is. It's likely you will be overrun by the amount of stats the game throws at you. You character has weapon/item unlocks, armor types, robotic implants, research, cybernetic upgrades, stats, and semi-permanent debuffs to deal with. Because each of these affects other stats in one of 4 different ways. using a guide isn't a shameful thing in this game when it comes to understanding mechanics.\n\nOne the FPS side of things it's pretty satisfying and in-depth too. There are keys to lean your character left/right, and they are used often. The guns are also satisfying, whether they're the default ones or higher tiered unlocks. Admittedly all of the guns are crazy accurate, even with a fairly low accuracy stat. Firing in bursts will keep most guns at a near sniper rifle accuracy due to this. Movement can be anywhere from ponderously slow to Arena FPS fast depending upon your equipment weight and your speed, with jump height ranging from a measly little hop to a 4 story leap. Psi powers are the only other thing to talk about and they keep with the weird over the top action by allowing you to literally make enemies explode into red mist before teleporting to their location or just letting a werewolf explode out of their chest and eat their friends.\n\nOverall, the game feels like a neon colored, futuristic Bruce Lee movie with robots, demons, robot-demons, afros, garbled English, confusing choose-your-own-adventure book plots ripe with betrayal, and werewolves. Considering it's often below the $5 mark how can you pass that up?","February 13, 2014","true","106.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There's nothing to compare it to, because there's nothing that it's like.\n\nIt looks Warhammer 40k-ish, but plays a lot closer to Deus Ex. The story is what you'd get if Tolstoi had just finished reading the Bourne series, if it was set in the Fallout universe, and he'd been mainlining LSD the whole way. I've played the game twice through, and I'm still trying to work out WTF is going on... but in a really good way... was I dreaming? Hallucinating? Jacked into the Matrix?! Also, WTH hasn't my character put his pistol in his mouth just to make it all stop, please, mommy!\n\nThe graphics are pretty reasonable, but the sound can get a bit repetitive and the voice-acting is... well... none of it's in English, so I've got no idea whether it's "good but intentionally odd" or just badly done. My only real complaint is that very little is explained. Don't even bother with the tutorials, they're utterly useless. Your best bet is to work it out yourself with some online research to give you a boost.\n\nAll in all, it's totally worth the price if you're looking for a fairly competent shooter with substantial RPG elements, and a massive dose of WTF that will leave you scratching your head for ages.","September 15, 2014","true","91.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The story also has a few different endings and meaningful choices. Cooperative and competitive multiplayer also add to the longevity of the title. Also, achievements.\n\nGameplay - Melee combat and shooting make up for most of the game, and are enjoyable once the character becomes stronger and the player figures a build that suits his playstyle. Blocking bullets with swords, dual-wielding, rapid movement and stealth are few of the many possibilities.\n\nMusic - Music blends in nicely without being distracting.\n\nSound - The sound effects are decent, just not extraordinary.\nBorba dislikes:Design - A frustrating early game experience due to lack of a better tutorial makes out for a terrible learning curve, relying on community guides and / or patience. Poor level design, with several maze-like levels that offer little in terms of navigation other than a waypoint without trail. Grindy at times, mostly because almost every mission throws dozens of enemies at the player, and keeps spawning them over and over, which feels like a cheap way to keep the player busy while chugging along the overly large and often confusing levels.\n\nGraphics - Cyberpunk with a touch of the occult, spoiled by Washed out textures that contrast with the better looking character models.\n\nInterface - Non-intuitive interface that will require time and effort to get used to, but will never feel right.\n\nNarrative - Poor writing and dialogues, sometimes even confusing, which is a shame since the game is pretty heavy on text. At times I had the feeling two completely different writters got their works mixed up.\n\nPolish - Bugs and lack of polish, such has having enemies spawn on top of you from a fixed spawn point, ability shortcuts not working and not knowing what researched entries provide until they are researched.\n\n\nBorba feels like the game can be either loved or hated, providing high value and replayability only to those who can dismiss its raw state and shortcomings. He didn't enjoy it too much though,playing through it fueled by little more than a spark of curiosity felt more of a chore than anything, and for this reason he can't recommend the game.\n\n5/10","April 26, 2015","false","11.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

For me, it's complete up to 70-80%, and looks more like a raw kickstarter project, than actually like a game.\n\nFirstly, about setting. It looks pretty awesome, story written good, but GOOD GOD HOW BORING IS IT. You have to read TONNS of text, with no sound reaching your ears except for in-game music(Which is not compared to anything, so you can replace it with Sabaton/Slayer/Marylin Manson/Elvis/etc., and it will still be OK). When you're out the first chapter of the game, you feel yourself playing old school text RPG, not modern Source-based FPS. I mean, in Fallout 1-2 was even a usable textbox, from where you were able to read comfortably. And what we've got here? Insane microscopical font. Need to click every single text message to get another. IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA, STREUM ON.\n\nSecondly, about gameplay. You saw that trailer, showing a lot of options, how to eliminate a single target?\nForget it. All you have to do is to pick up heavy armor, take your faithful stock minigun, and go ♥♥♥♥ everything in sight. I tell you, it works perfectly on ANY KIND OF AN ENEMY. Seriously, what the hell did developers even think of? I tried playing stealth - it's hard and painful, you get yourself ♥♥♥♥♥ by infinitely spawning enemies in ~2 min. I tried playing as silent sniper - it's not hard, but it still will heat your "lower back" part of a body, due to (Again, I know) infinitely spawning enemies, lack of ammo and no medipacks at all(They will come to use later, after several researches). And that thing works with every single available class in the game. They all have some minuses, which make gameplay nearly impossible. And then you pick up that "Heavy weapons" suit, and... Just ♥♥♥♥ everything in sight. Hacking system(Also nice idea, liked it), melee weapons, shotguns, etc. - no need in it. Just brainless rush to the victory. Looks pretty challenging, doesn't it?\n\nSo, to sum up: if I saw this game on kickstarter, I would probably fund it. Good fighting mechanics, fine idea, nice setting - looks good. But it's not on kickstarter! It's here, on Steam! I expected something around Deus Ex:Invisible War, but got unfinished fan mod.\nAnd if you buy it, you will see yourself constantly checking: "Did I really took it from Steam? Really?!

Spēles mehānika iesākumā ir diezgan patizla, jo daudzas lietas nav ♥♥♥♥♥idrotas, bet centieni tikt galā pašam bieži vien beidzas ar maķperemaķ izteicieniem. Tas attiecas gan uz sākotnējo personāža izveidi un tālāko attīstību, gan uz hakošanas sistēmu, gan uz standarta spēles pasaules mijiedarbību. Iesācējam būs grūti... un reizē arī sviestaini, jo WTF līdīs ārā katrā stūrī, tāpēc pirms spēles un arī spēles pirmsākumos iesaku aizčāpot uz E.Y.E wikipēdijas lapu palasīties.\n\nTad, kad spēles mehānika ir iepazīta un ir skaidrs, kā šiten viss strādā, var sākt jau izklaidēties. Hakošanas sistēma ir ... diezgan savdabīga, Pa lielam laušanas princips ir monotons - Shield -> Shield -> Overflow -> Attack un atkal no sākuma. Visnoderīgākā laušanas mijiedarbība ir Hack - ar to var hakot durvis, termināļus, tureļus ... un federāļus (vietējā policija). Hakot var no distances, galvenais, lai objekts ir tava skenera darbības rādiusā. Labākais stroķis - Motra SMG ar klusinātāju + E.Y.E "kloāka" (vietējā kibernētiskā neredzamība). Žēl tikai, ka pēdējā strādā līdz pirmajam šāvienam. Taču pielavīties klāt un uzšaut pa dullo kādam federālim vai lūterim nesagādā lielas problēmas.\n\nCo-op spēle ir vēl sviestaināka nekā single kampaņa, it sevišķi, kad savācās visi iesācēji. Tad labākajā gadījumā sanāk kārtīgi pašaudīties, jo 3 co-op biedriem ir ar ko noņemties - pretinieki spawnojas pačkās pa 4-6 gab. un ir diezgan neatlaidīgi un štengri, kaut arī visai pastulbi.\n\nPa lielam, 1 EUR (uz atlaidēm) tā spēle ir vērta, kaut gan labāk vispār pa velti. Grafika nekāda, skaņa nekāda, sižets marihuānas dūmos tīts, spēles mehānika diezgan dīvaina. No manas puses 6/10, kaut gan pāris dienas iepriekš biju gatavs likt krietni zemāku vērtējumu.","December 29, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bought the full game and, even though I'm only a few hours in, I already love it. I do advise you download a text mod that better translates and otherwise explains aspects of the gameplay mechanics and story, but regardless this game has a bit of a learning curve.\n\nLet's get one thing out of the way - this is a shooter first, with RPG elements. The general combat is pretty straightforward. The weapons are fairly point and shoot, but are affected by stance and the Accuracy stat. I haven't tried melee combat much since I'm more of the marksman type, but the swords do hack off limbs nicely. :D The nuance comes from the cyber and psi powers as well as the hacking, which are all governed by a surprisingly expansive stat system. Level ups occurr fairly often (my advice - use a sniper rifle and go for headshots as much as possible, lots of XP!), and there are a variety of skills to upgrade, in addition to new abilities to buy and upgrade, as well research projects to undergo which yield new items and stat bonuses. Point is, this system is much more fun to play with and certainly more fleshed out than other Role-Playing Shooters. It's closer to Deus Ex 1 than it is to, say, Mass Effect 2.\n\nBeyond the game mechanics themselves though, I find myself drawn in to the world. The mix of Templar-ish Culters with the Oriental/Samurai-like Jin factions of the player's organization is really cool, and contributes to a multicultural feeling that extends to the streets of the game's world, which itself is patrolled by ragtag-looking looters and the glowy-eyed stormtroopers of the Federation. As far as rundown, gloomy cyberpunk worlds go, E.Y.E. has it down pat.\n\nI highly encourage you to pony up the meager fee to check out this little gem. It has its flaws to be sure; understanding the world and history requires lots of front-loaded reading in the Temple archives, the A.I. isn't the best and you may want to remap some of the default controls, but in a sea of Source shooters, this 12-man effort stands above as one of the best. E.Y.E. Divine Cybermancy restores my faith that there are still people out there who appreciate a good single player RPG.","August 13, 2014","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It took me quite awhile to understand the basics of the game. Any ailiments you encounter remember to press C, it is a life saver.\n\nThe game is set in a futuristic cyberpunk world, with some very impressive levels, Great care and love was put into this games setting. Half of the time playing I would set there being in awe, the city levels in particular are gorgeous.\n\nThe gameplay itself is where the game really shines, nothing is more satisfying than cutting an enemy with a sword only for them to explode into pieces. Any enemy you killed gains you brouzoufs, which can be used for different upgrades or can be used for research to increase your stats.\n\nOne of my main gripe is the hacking part of the game, nothing about it was enjoyable which can lead to some frustrating encounters. If you failing hacking your character can be killed, so you have to watch your hp all the time.\n\nIf you can look past some of it's problem, you've got a real hidden gem on your hands.","March 26, 2015","true","43.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ever.\n\nWhy? Because it doesn't make any sense. The game deviates so much from the norm, that it would be impossible to compare it to any other game. It isn't really an FPS, nor an RPG, but it has some of both. The story is... satisfactory. It is one of the only games I've played where it hurt to follow the story, but this was only because of my previous experiences with games. Through a lens of a person who hasn't played a game before, the story is fantastic and deep. The rest is average. Playing with other people is semi-fun, servers are semi-populated, and the graphics are semi-good. My legs are okay.\n\nSo why is this a positive review? Well, first and foremost, I had to change my perspective for it. Not many games made me do that, but EYE: Divine Cybermancy did. Not that it was a good shift, nor a bad shift, but it was a shift. Next, there was little room for buyer's remorse from my dislikes. I got it for only $0.99, cheaper than chips (about half as much where I live), so value wise, it is great.\n\nIt is unpolished, has an overly complex story with little explanation, and most of the mechanics are left unexplained, but it wasn't BAD. In fact, it was an interesting game, that not only forced me to change the way I saw stories in games, but was a great value at the same time. For $9.99, the shift in perspective is not worth the price, but for $0.99, it very much is.\n\n7/10","March 18, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It may also subvert every wise word spoken against it, even mine.\n\nEYE is not a success, and it is not always fun. On optimized systems you can expect protracted load times and glaring proofs of the Source engine's age. Much is amateurish; little thought seems to have gone into refreshing whatever was borrowed from Source assets (namely physics and other special effects. In EYE, your hand is the Gravity Gun). And you may be unimpressed by the character models, and sickened by the abrasive sound effects and voices, and the ugliest browns and greens you've ever seen.\n\nYou will be tested. Here EYE hints that some of its flaws are not accidental, that they fit into a larger scheme. Perhaps you have played Pathologic, or STALKER, that other difficult game about acronyms. You have a suite of weapons with no clear utility and you will have to work for an hour to figure out which ones are useful. You have all sorts of abilities, but they are also spotty, and finding a way to even use them will take you at least one minute. You begin play with a rough idea that you can improve" by spending resources on various things, some of them new weapons, some of them abstract representations of the things you can do. You may or may not figure out a plot; you may or may not sort out an efficient way to become better using one of two unexplained single-player game modes, or to become functionally better (as in more skilled) using the insane multi-player game mode.\n\nWhen a game puts up one kind of road block, who would I be to assume its other obstacles are accidental? I would have to be some kind of games journalist. I know that I am no kind of games journalist, because all deep questions recede as soon as I do the thing EYE most enthusiastically invites you to do: commit thoughtless virtual murder using a toolkit too large for my IRL kitchen. I blew up a man with a handgun called The Bear Killer today. I then hacked a computer in his friend's brain and compelled his friend to kill their remaining friends. I then summoned three psychic clones of myself to kill the confused survivor. Some mutants came, and I murdered them, too.\n\nEYE: Divine Cybermancy gives you all of these gifts, but it taxes you. Somehow, this feels thematic: when it is as easy as Hell to disappear a million mutant men with a single shotgun, the real antagonist might be getting *into* it in the first place.\n\nI sense deep genius, and complex fun. EYE makes you compromise for pleasure. When you ask why it might, you see that it wants you to think - but only for as long as it takes to reload.","January 26","true","82.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Imagine Warhammer 40,000, but with more of an pseudo-oriental theme. In it; katanas, large suits of armour and mystical powers.\n\nWhile these are interesting, sadly, the game suffers in gameplay. It is based on Valve's Source engine, and so, like familiar games such as Counter Strike, the shooting system is very good. The guns are all *fairly* unique, and that is all well and good. However, the fighting is very boring. You basically fight waves of highly unintelligent A.I. which more-or-less throw themselves at you for a long time, chewing up your ammunition in a way that feels like it is being put to waste.\n\nI read some other reviews about this game which, to paraphrase, said the game put the player head-first into the deep end. Both in the story, and the class/leveling system, implying, or outright accusing the game of being convoluted and unfriendly to new players. In my opinion, these are nothing but excuses for laziness.\n\nI'll talk about the class system, since I don't feel like regurgitating the story (also, since I haven't finished it). The class system is sort of 'dynamic' in that it assesses the way you have attributed  skill points to your character, and then 'labels' it. You gain experience, and upgrade stats. The game also earns you 'Brozoufs' (money), with which to buy special upgrades. Everything is written down. If you don't know what something does, then you more than likely did not read its description. Moreover, if you still feel as though there is too much confusion, the game includes 20+ tutorial videos, and there exist game guides for stuck players. If, dspite this, you still need to complain about the difficulty of the game, then regrettably, you are only asking to be spoonfed.\n\nThe graphics are pretty dated-looking as well (as a result of its being based on Source Engine, no doubt), and this gives the game an 'outdated sci-fi' appearance, and that's sort of unappealing. But you know, it isn't the end of the world.\n\nSo, to summarise, the game is quite mediocre in important ways. It is an inexpensive game. If you feel the need to try something mildly original in concept, then I would recommend it, but do not expect something groundbreaking.","April 12, 2013","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great artwork (overally - models, textures, maps), atmosphere, interesting story and classic gameplay are big "pro's" of the game.

The game includes campaign and single missions with randomized objective's and enemy, both of these can be played in the multiplayer (which is great for "farming" \ "grinding").

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/recommended/91700/","TeenJackBauer","👌TeenJackBauer👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/","435 products in account","Positive\n+ Akin to games such as System Shock 2, Deus Ex, and other FPS/RPG hybrids, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy allows you to customise your character how you want, with a wide variety of cybernetic implants to choose from, and research to further power yourself up. Combined with solid gunplay (though the enemy AI may tend to idle around quite often and not get behind any sort of cover) makes the gameplay department quite enjoyable for the most part\n+ Utilising the Source Engine, the game may not excel in the graphical department, but it does manage to present a well-detailed environment, combining cyberpunk elements and a dark tone; topped off with great physics that complement the gameplay\n+ Adding onto the atmosphere, the music is certainly eerie and matches the quality of the visual aesthetic. This is probably one of the best aspects of the game.\n\n\nNegative\n- The biggest negative here is the games interface. Not only does it have a steep learning curve, but the supplied tutorials are lacking and don’t explain all of the necessary elements of the game very well. While I was able to get used to it in the end, there’s no denying that the interface makes it very hard to get immersed into the game due to how unintuitive and clunky it is\n- While the level design may be commended for being more open and spacious than the average linear FPS, the size of some of the levels actually ends up hurting the experience. Though I may have never gotten lost, it’s not very exciting travelling through the environments at a slow pace, combined with the fact that there is no real reward or gratification from exploring the empty levels; adding more secrets and hidden side quests would have made exploration much more appealing\n- One of the minor complaints of the RPG elements the game has is the fact that you will need to do a lot of grinding if you want to be able to buy/upgrade implants or weapons. You don’t need to upgrade or buy anything to beat the main story, but it’s unfortunate that you are required to grind for hours just to buy weapons that you may want to use, which means you’ll be stuck with the base equipment that you have in your starting armoury unless you go out of your way to grind for better ones\n- Lastly, the story is very poorly presented and convoluted; the dialogue especially is a pain to read through (which may unfortunately be due to poor translation). Though the game may have multiple endings, none of them feel complete or give a satisfying conclusion to the overall weak plot. The story barely strings together fully and feels like it’s tacked on rather than integrated well with the gameplay. The game is an okay length at 6 ½ hours (Normal difficulty), but there are only about 11 or so levels to progress through; however, playing the game in co-op could make the experience more fun.\n\n\nVerdict\n“A game marred by some visibly weak elements, E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy has both its high and low points.

E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is just that, a unique genre-blend that exceeds expectation in game design while unfortunately failing at presentation (spectacularly).\n\nE.Y.E Divine Cybermancy isn't a pretty game by an stretch of the imagination, its washed out low resolution textures, low polygon count, completely asinine UI, non-existant soundtrack, terrible voice-acting and translation will make many recoil in disgust.\n\nYet, it succeeds where many other games do not by providing a gameplay experience so unique and well-crafted that all these flaws can be forgiven. The blend of cybernetic warfare, stealth, first-person shooting and resource management provide for untold hours of replayability. Add on top of that multiplayer co-op and the game becomes a fantastic title well worth your time.\n\nThere is something incredibly visceral about running into battle, blocking bullets as they impact your swords, landing in a cloud of dust to unleash a power-attack at your helpless foes. Similarly, the same scenario can be played by hiding behind a wall and hacking the one of the troops, taking over his implants and making him shoot his own soldiers. Or perhaps, if you prefer the ranged alternative, unleashing a torrent of projectiles from your minigun while summoning the demons of hell with your psionic powers, warping the frail minds of your opponents as they collapse in their own excrement.\nE.Y.E Divine Cybermancy allows for all this, and more.\n\nThe haunted atmosphere fits perfectly with its setting and while it might not be the prettiest of games, it certainly is consistent in art-direction. Everything you encounter will be gritty, run down and punk, yet also etheral and dream-like. The world is empty and hollow, and it fits the theme incredibly well. As your body suffers, your mind does as well and you should be prepared to deal with the consequences. Sanity is a rare commodity in this universe.\n\nE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy offers an experience like no other, it is gritty, it is creative, it is unforgiving, and you will love it.\n\n-------\nRead more video game news, reviews and editorials at gatheryourparty.com","December 21, 2013","true","2.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The dark Hardcore Cyberpunk setting, music and characters all contribute to the overall feeling of the game and combined with the high difficulty, 64 player COOP multiplayer and the intricate RPG system this game is simply one of the best FPSs I've ever seen.. It has bugs, considering it was made by a very small team, and its translation is quite rough (though there are fan patches around that make it much better), but if you can overlook a few common glitches casuals can't take, then this game is a definite buy.

Она позволила взглянуть на киберпанк по другому, прочувствовать его. Признаюсь после темного киберпанка E.Y.E., в другие проекты той же направленности не шибко веришь. Действительно интересный сюжет, которые может отпугнуть на первой половине игры, но развязка первой концовки, заставила приоткрыть рот в изумлении. Но есть еще одна проблема связання с сюжетом, что бы понять всю исторю, вам придется последовательно пройти игру 4 раза!!! Да да, именно 4 раза, не у многих хватит терпения. Графически игра выполнена на движке соурса, не чего уж шибко великолепного, но дизайн локаций отличный. Саундтрек тоже вполне не плохой. Геймплейно игра немного странновата, на каждой локации, в которую мы поподем, практически всегда на нас будут переть толпы врагов, от которых придется постояно отстреливатся выполняя определенные задачи, не каждому такое по вкусу придет. Но есть такие уровни которые просто никогда не забудутся! Один из них - это уровень на военной базе с которой потеряна связь и, черт возьми, его атмосфера просто ложит на лопатки недавний Aliens Colonial Marine. Впринципе игра сугубо на любителя, для людей которые не боятся позновать что то новое.

E.Y.E. is rough around the edges, no doubt, but if you can look beyond its sometimes laggy multiplayer and occasionally sketchy english translations it holds some serious entertainment value, as well as a good story.  Although the storyline is pretty incomprehensible at first (ok, for the first 3 or 4 playthroughs most likely) there is a deeper meaning to it than meets the eye, even after completing all the endings.  The single player gameplay is fairly confusing at first, but there's several guides on the steam community that should help get you set up.  EYE claims to be a mix of RPG and FPS elements, and that it is, with a character creation and leveling system that's not unlike that of an RPG, and solid FPS gameplay on top of that.  The level design as well is very good, and personally I find that EYE has an atmosphere that very few games can pull off successfully.\n\nOn the multiplayer end, the game comes with four game modes:  Co-op Campaign, Co-op Missions, Battle Royal, and Team Artifact.  The two Co-op types are pretty straightforward, Campaign is the game's campaign mode with multiple players, and Missions is non-story missions set in the story maps that are fun to run through and good for gaining additional Brouzouf.  Team Artifact is a team-based PVP mode.  The goal of the mode is to take the artifact to the enemy's base, and score a touchdown.  Battle Royal is essentially an elimination PVP mode with random weapons, armor, and health.  Unlike Team Artifact, which plays best with at least 3v3, Battle Royal works well with any amount of players.  The server runs on SRCDS, and setting up a dedicated server if you are so inclined is a cinch, provided you know how to port forward.  Setting up in-game temporary servers is similarly simple, although again port forwarding is required to have your server visible over the internet.\n\nEven if you don't want to pay $10 for EYE at full price, it often goes on steep discounts during steam sales, so if you're patient you can pick it up for $5 or even less.  EYE is well worth the price, and if you can convince a few friends to pick it up along with you, you'll find a great Co-op and PVP experience waiting for you.","February 24, 2014","true","255.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

A special society trained in using psi powers and other high tech gadgets to accomplish their mission.  E.Y.E. is a top notch FPS/RPG game that allows for multiple styles of game play and plenty of character customization. You can go guns blazing, take the stealthy approach or even hack into your enemies and control their every movement. You are also in possession of a huge arsenal that carries machine guns, snipers, mini guns and even grenade launchers. With all these things at your disposal, you know this game has an amazing replay value to it. You can also go co-op with up to 16 players and wreck havoc upon the open world maps.

Kind of like a cross between Warhammer 40K (as has been said before), Blade Runner, Dune, Total Recall, Equilibrium, and probably a few other classics I can't think of right now, with a lot of original - and borrowed, stuff on the surface and underneath, including paranormal phenomena, cyberpunk and genetic body mods, hacking, genetic manipulation for basic skill boosts/affinities, and futuristic Rastafarianism. The quintessential Sci-Fi nerd's game, IMO.\n\nThere's a money system for investing in physical/cybernetic enhancements and weapons, and research toward the same, all funded by things like bounties, hacking bank computers, and lump-sum mission completion rewards. There's also a skill point-based leveling system with lots of options for specialization, e.g., stealth, brute force, finesse, faster/greater health/recovery, athletics/acrobatics, psychic control/telekinesis, hacking enemy machinery/weapons - even their  brains to do your bidding (but watch out, you may get hacked if they're better than you!), et al.\n\nSome say it tries to do too much. I like all of the things it does too much to agree. Granted, the dialogue seems to be poorly translated, but in a far-flung future, a significant change in vernacular isn't inconceivable. I think it adds depth, in that respect. Maybe it was deliberate. There's also a bit of a learning curve due to a clunky tutorial, but creating a couple of throw-away characters while practicing and figuring out what you like isn't at all uncommon.","December 21, 2014","true","191.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a bit difficult to grasp, but once you get rolling, (and this is all assuming you're a cyberpunk fan) you won't be able to drop it. The eerie and gloomy atmosphere is sure to immerse you completely, the fun, innovative gameplay is bound to keep you constantly searching for new ways to overcome a problem, and if all else fails - the randomly generated missions will always be there for a quick jolt when you're in a race with time.\n\nThe story is a marvel the likes of which I haven't seen yet. I read a lot of books, I watch a lot of movies, shows, but E.Y.E.'s incredibly complex, multi-dimensional, multi-layered allegorical presentation of consciousness was genuinely one of the greatest experiences of my life. As a matter of fact - I believe that the specific story (which I leave for you to figure out) is in its optimal medium; no book or song could ever transfer the atmosphere the same way this game does. The amount of thought I put into the thematic of the whole game, and the amount of time I spent trying to understand the underlying philosophical problems - both in the game, and transfered into real life - is unprecedented.\n\nAs many agree, if you're one in favor of immersive, drawn-out, atmospheric surrounding, and if you're a fan of the strange, -AND- an enthusiastic problem-solver, this masterpiece will become one of your favorites, too. The game offers too much of the three for anyone to miss them during gameplay, and is sure to have something for everyone who doesn't play video games just for the pure time-wasting aspect of it, but for the artistic value.\n\nAnd before you decide to opt out, riddle me this - "Are you lost?

Kind of like a cross between Warhammer 40K (as has been said before), Blade Runner, Dune, Total Recall, Equilibrium, and probably a few other classics I can't think of right now, with a lot of original - and borrowed, stuff on the surface and underneath, including paranormal phenomena, cyberpunk and genetic body mods, hacking, genetic manipulation for basic skill boosts/affinities, and futuristic Rastafarianism. The quintessential Sci-Fi nerd's game, IMO.\n\nThere's a money system for investing in physical/cybernetic enhancements and weapons, and research toward the same, all funded by things like bounties, hacking bank computers, and lump-sum mission completion rewards. There's also a skill point-based leveling system with lots of options for specialization, e.g., stealth, brute force, finesse, faster/greater health/recovery, athletics/acrobatics, psychic control/telekinesis, hacking enemy machinery/weapons - even their  brains to do your bidding (but watch out, you may get hacked if they're better than you!), et al.\n\nSome say it tries to do too much. I like all of the things it does too much to agree. Granted, the dialogue seems to be poorly translated, but in a far-flung future, a significant change in vernacular isn't inconceivable. I think it adds depth, in that respect. Maybe it was deliberate. There's also a bit of a learning curve due to a clunky tutorial, but creating a couple of throw-away characters while practicing and figuring out what you like isn't at all uncommon.","December 21, 2014","true","191.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The setting is also very unique with its "neo-midieval cyberpunk" aesthetic. However, the story is confusing and there are plenty of rough edges. Something to be careful of is that this game is very much a 90's game - it will not hold your hand, almost ever. Though at the same time, this game provides a rock-solid gameplay core and unparalleled custom mechanics. You can even tweak spawning rates, mob difficulty, and AI settings in the options.\n\nTo wrap up, get this game if you want to experience a very left-field, experimental take on FPSRPG core gameplay. I highly recommend you read wikis and other resources as you play, as they make discovering this game more enjoyable than going blind. Personally, I love this game just because it's not afraid of what it is - an extremely ambitious game with rough edges.","July 17, 2012","true","50.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/troublegum/recommended/91700/","troublegum","troublegum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/troublegum/","296 products in account","E.Y.E is far from perfect. It's weird, obtuse to the point of being frustrating and the dialogue often feels like it's been run through Google translate (Streum On are French, so it probably has). The weirdness is actually one of the things I like about it though. The grammatically flawed text not so much; Streum could definitely benefit from a native English speaker going through all the dialogue and making it less obviously written by someone who isn't.\n\nBut the weirdness works. E.Y.E comes across like a blend between 40K's Inquisition and one of the evil megacorps of Syndicate; with it's bizarre mix of psionic techno-magery, cyberpunk gadgetry and John Blanche-esque armour suits. It gets compared a lot to a 'fever dream'; and given the developer's stated enjoyment of H.P Lovecraft, this is not a bad comparison.\n\nE.Y.E's very openended and that can work against it for some - too much choice, especially with little guidance as to how those choices will affect you in the field, can be off-putting. You do have to read around the little windows and you sometimes have to live with a choice that might not have been exactly what you were expecting. Enemy levels can be a tad overwhelming, too. Freely re-spawning legions of mooks are a pain in the ♥♥♥ when combined with big, dark, labyrinths and vague mission briefs and this can make the side-quests (which are pretty basic; essentially retreads of levels you've completed with different random objectives like Kill X, Fetch Y), feel a touch grindy as you mow down two gangs of mooks only to be set on by two more as you reload and scavenge bullets from the corpses.\n\nSteam's recommendation windows are really too small - so, yeah. E.Y.E's interface and tutorials are almost ferociously unfriendly to those of us who've grown accustomed to the hand-holding of more recent RPG / FPS releases. E.Y.E leans more to the school of "Here, work it out for yourself." Which has been one of the big bones of contention about it for many. Purely for clarity; I mean good, old Syndicate, not the shoddy modern FPS with the brand name tacked on.\n\nBut it still feels fun; the guns work well and slicing and dicing the enemy with your psionic katana and blue-glowy psi-fist is still satisfying (see also the teleporting into other people to make them explode method). Although it's billed as an FPS/RPG, the RPG side of things is mainly a case of what numbers you put up on your character sheet, although there are plot twisty things down the line.\n\nMe, I like it. As has been observed, what other game lets you cloak and teleport yourself into the body of an enemy so that they explode?\n\nAlso, it's cheap. And has trading cards :gordon: Give it a whirl.","July 16, 2012","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shotgunmage/recommended/91700/","shotgunmage","Shotgun Mage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shotgunmage/","89 products in account","tl;dr: Good: The level design, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story if you're the kind that likes to speculate, and weapons not saddled by the need to be "realistic" or even balanced\nBad: They're not the smartest cops or looters. LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG loading times. The story if the storytelling style isn't something that you can't really appreciate\n\nWherever you go, whoever you side with, you will always Brouzouf. This insane first person shooter/RPG hybrid has one of the craziest stories ever written, where the story lapses in and out of coherence and continuity, yet still works very well. The enviroments are amazing and highly inspired, and massive. Quite a feat, especially with source engine. While there is one huge loading screen at the beginning of the huge levels, they are the only ones, there are no loading screens anywhere within a level, in the the massive ones like the Headquarters or Mars.\n\nEnemies look great, although their intellegence leaves a bit to be desired. One looter blew his buddy up after shooting him with his shotgun that he was aiming at me. Well, the first one shouldn't have stood in his way anyways. Enemy spawn can be a bit of a pain, too. New Eden has a spot next to some shipping containers that spawns Federal Police whenever you're not facing, even if you're facing away but standing next to the spawn point, they'll spawn. Then shoot you. Secreta help you if they have the dreaded Bear Killer. That would mean you have the demon gun too, though. You do have it, right?\n\nBrings up another point: the weapons. Dear God those weapons. A handgun that is an effective anti-air and anti-demon cannon. A minigun good against large groups of squishy Feds, Looters, and beasts, although not the best choice for armored enemies like Interceptors. A shotgun that goes further, so much further, than a sneeze. A katana that blows people up. Even the AK knockoff has an awesome feel for it. An SMG that has two firing modes: Full and Fuller. It all comes from the magical Armory of Holding in the beginning of each level that makes you feel like you're going through a candy store with a "all you can eat" coupon.\n\nSome minor complaints. Again the AI. You've probably already know my gripes so no further. Furthering the skill tree involves randomly dropping briefcases, in which those have randomly generated technology dropped, some of them being much rarer than others. You can find S.O.B 13 easy, though if you find Cybernecromancy, go ahead and buy a lottery ticket right after. It can be a pain to unlock weapons and technology because of this. If you play on the lower difficulties, it can also be difficult to gather enough brouzouf, cold hard cash, to fund research, cyberlimbs, PSI abilities, and most importantly: weapons. This is easily remedied by not being a wimp and cranking the difficulty up: Ghost usually has you swimming in cash, particuarly if you unlock the Bear Killer and go Dues Ex Machina and Interceptor hunting with it.\n\nThe AI I can forgive because the rest of the game carries it, and also because this game gets cheaper than a meal at In-N-Out during sales. The rest of the issues can be remedied or at least fixed with a bandaid by adjusting spawn rates and AI behavior. Overall, I highly recommend this game.

I reinstalled it today because I couldn't remember why did I give up playing it before. Now I remember why: the terribly complicated interface and its tiny writings. If you want to understand what's what, what's not and what's going on, you'll have to do a lot of reading, and I have to say, reading those tiny little letters in a greenish/grayish kind of environment involves a lot of eye strain... Now I realize that the name of the game must be a hint as to what you'll be in for, should you decide to play it. Now the gameplay and combat are alright, if you can look past the dated graphics. Overall, its an OK shooter with some RPG elements, unfortnatelly I cannot tell you more because as I said, the interface drives me crazy and I cannot get myself to like the whole thing because of that. For the price it normally sells (on sale today for 1,99), I'd recommend anyone to give it a try, maybe you won't find the same issues I did, and you'll get to have a nice experience.

One of the minuses of the story would be that it can be quite confusing, and to get the 'real ending' you need to complete the game 2-3 times or so. It can also be quite unimmersive, and might feel pointless.\n\nThe gameplay, and to be precise the combat is rather interesting, and some creativity can be put into the usage of certain combat playstyles. It's quite expansive, maybe not on a grand scale, as it'd be nice if there was a bit bigger weapon diversity, however I do believe that once you get into the habit of using one weapon it's not the easiest to get out of it.\n\nThe problem with the gameplay comes with the bugs in the game. If you do the wrong thing at the wrong time, you might end up bugging yourself quite a lot, however I didn't find any big game-breakers. I can, however say that there are bugs indeed, and when buying this game, be prepared to experience some if you play for a few hours.\n\nThe multiplayer's alright for a Source Engine game, but just don't expect miracles. It can have issues, and I'd definitely recommend setting up a dedicated server.\nOh also, it's dead.\n\nMy rating for E.Ψ.Ǝ. would be somewhere along the lines of\n6/10 to 7/10.\n\nI would extremely recommend picking this up on something like a 99 cent sale, or maybe even a 4-pack for a multiplayer experience, which can be quite nice.","December 23, 2012","true","50.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's why i love this game.\nE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is one of the best shooter RPG i have ever played, with a story set in a futuristic cyberpunk world and a plot full of mystery, with a gameplay that gives you great freedom of customization for your character with lots of ways to upgrade your character.\n\nAlso being the game set in a distant future, there are surely some features in the game that fits this age, like the hacking system, since everything is computerized (even your mind), that will let you get into particular objectives, control your enemies, rob some money and more.\n\nAnother feature of the game is the sanity meter, that is pretty much self-explanatory: you will lose sanity when you see too much strange or bad stuffs, or when your mental power is low, and when you lose too much of it, you'll start seeing and hearing random things.\n\nThe game has almost infinite replayability, with  different kind of "endings"  and extra missions that you can do for the different map models, or obviously to gain more money and experience.\n\nThe audio of most important dialogues is chinese, so better you put the subtitles on if you don't understand the language, to get something more about the game.\n\nFor the multiplayer, there aren't much people playing into the servers, but you can surely grab some friends to play the campaign togheter (i had to use the Hamachi tool to make it run and modified some stuff in the console, since the game is powered by the Source engine).\n\nThat is it. I loved the game once i understood how to play it and how to give a sense to the story, since  it's damn hard to give it a sense if you don't put together all the pieces of the puzzle, because this game is, infact, a puzzle game.\n\nEXTRA NOTE FOR WHO NEEDS: In the game's folder located into steam's one, you can find the soundtrack of the game: "Steam/SteamApps/common/EYE/EYE/sound/music". Here you'll find in order the tracks you'll hear during the game,  and the one named "qnJ"  is the most awesome one, that you'll hear for very little time during the game. You're welcome.\n\nEXTRA-EXTRA NOTE: Illuminati approves.","January 31, 2015","true","57.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an independant game, and it has it's flaws. The most noticable is it's badly trasnlated English, which makes the already confusing story even harding to initally understand. Aside from that, the other problem is some animation problems, making the characters move around in odd ways. Finally is the various glitches that come up during online play such as saves being corrupted and skipping levels entirely.\n\nPass all of this, comes an expansive world full of exploration and deep lore that with ability to be expanded on even further. The gun play is exremely solid, and while some items are not great choices, most guns are and it makes for interesting and dynamic class specializations. The melee is fair enough, though there is something to be desired when playing a ninja-like monk. The PSI powers are satisfying to use and the way the games handles hacking is challenging but fun. The RPG-like skill points let you specialze  in things like PSI or gunplay or melee and make each new character unique. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of RPGs, it's a unique experience that hasn't been matched by much other games.","March 17, 2015","true","81.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Decent game, has some really cool abilities and tech, along with some interesting weapons. Hardcore gamers only though as absolutly nothing is explained at all, and all of the tech, weapon, magic, etc. trees are highly complex and vague. For those who wish to figure out the best builds by trial and error until the lingo is perfected.\n\nI have read reviews that have said that the game started slow, until you get to a specific point but I found the game to be rather engaging immediately. Suddenly something crazy is going on around you, you have no idea where you are, how you got there, or whether there is actually a there. That answer gets solved fairly quickly but that may be (as of yet) the only one so far.\n\nThe only thing that I didn't find the greatest was the, as I said, super situational awareness of the enemy combatants. One bullet, one hostile encounter gone awry and suddenly the entire board knows that you are an enemy and begins to decend (in what seems like almost infinite numbers) upon your position.\n\nThe main reason that is a gripe is that the tech skills require a little mini-game to "hack" the enemy. It involves a simulated battle between you and the computer program of the target. No shooting here, just select commands and the mini-game follows through with a given task. Difficulty is based upon what seems to be toughness, or maybe standing (as in rank), of the enemy.\n\nI am a build a charecter game fan, so the endless menus and items that one wades through were of zero concern as the level of customization and just end goal bad-assery is just phenomenal. I mean I understand and even I would say that there was room for improvement with the interface. However, it was not the worst that I have experienced.\n\nSo far I like it, the universe filled with mystery and intrigue. People jockey for power and you are a tool in the hidden wars. Yet I feel like a participant where I trust who I may and kill those that cross me. Trust seems to be a valuable asset within the story. Who knows what suicide mission you might find yourself in next time.","July 29, 2012","true","60.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the minuses of the story would be that it can be quite confusing, and to get the 'real ending' you need to complete the game 2-3 times or so. It can also be quite unimmersive, and might feel pointless.\n\nThe gameplay, and to be precise the combat is rather interesting, and some creativity can be put into the usage of certain combat playstyles. It's quite expansive, maybe not on a grand scale, as it'd be nice if there was a bit bigger weapon diversity, however I do believe that once you get into the habit of using one weapon it's not the easiest to get out of it.\n\nThe problem with the gameplay comes with the bugs in the game. If you do the wrong thing at the wrong time, you might end up bugging yourself quite a lot, however I didn't find any big game-breakers. I can, however say that there are bugs indeed, and when buying this game, be prepared to experience some if you play for a few hours.\n\nThe multiplayer's alright for a Source Engine game, but just don't expect miracles. It can have issues, and I'd definitely recommend setting up a dedicated server.\nOh also, it's dead.\n\nMy rating for E.Ψ.Ǝ. would be somewhere along the lines of\n6/10 to 7/10.\n\nI would extremely recommend picking this up on something like a 99 cent sale, or maybe even a 4-pack for a multiplayer experience, which can be quite nice.","December 23, 2012","true","50.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But at the same time the cryptic story fits in with the rest of the game perfectly.\n\nThe game is set in a time where people who are barely human live in a universe that is barely alive, fighting for reasons that you can't quite discern, while being attacked by monsters that aren't quite real, and every time you think you are getting somewhere, you find yourself reliving the nightmare.\n\nIf you can get past the difficulty of getting multiplayer co-op to work, you'll find an interesting first person shooter RPG with unique guns and lots of control over how you want to play the game.","December 27, 2011","true","154.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"Give a french development team a copy of source. Tell them to develop deus ex meets system shock 2. And then give them a bunch of crack and red bull."\n\nIt is a role playing shooter that feels like a shooter more than an rpg. I could equate it to being a more action packed version of the original deus ex or system shock 2... prob closer to system shock 2 in terms of system, but its quite interesting.\n\nIts cyberpunk to the core. The story is about corporations hiring and cloning their own security force, which they cybernetically augment. There are multiple endings, each gives you a different psionic spell to cast. Get all 3 and you get a 4th super powerful one that will obliterate any enemy you come across.\n\nYou gain states, you research and use cybernetic augments like stealth, the ability to see through walls, jump higher, etc. If you die there are sometimes permanent stat losses that can only be negated through researching a lot of items.\n\nIts very hard to peg down why this so enjoyable, as its fairly insane in every aspect...

So much, in fact, that reviewing it is a challenge itself. So here goes.\n\nIt claims to be an FPS, and yet has a ton of RPG systems, including a DNA combiner with stat rolling. It has melee combat, which includes badass dual-wielding katanas (or dual-wield with guns!) and a ginormous hammer, and yet stealth doesn't work well, as they can spot you from literally a mile away (even when you can't see them yourself!) and you'll be easily overwhelmed by the insane spawn rate in certain areas of the game, with many of them having ranged enemies, and some with absurd amounts of health.\n\nThere are amazing (and balanced!) PSI powers in this game, including certain ones that you earn thoughout the game, and can really help you out, and yet you use PSI for almost everything in gameplay that isn't shooting or slicing, such as running, jumping, blocking with melee, and maintenance. Research and medicine are present and very useful (you can even overdose people to death with your syringe!), but good luck finding all the random drops that you need for actual research. Hacking also exists and can be pretty useful, whether to disable turrets or open doors and posess/destroy something or someone, but you may or may not like the system used for it and you definitely need to apply a good amount of skill points to be any good at it.\n\nIt has some of the most atmospheric and beautiful places and art style I've ever seen, but also many underused or even plain useless areas. It happens to be one of the most stable games I've played, with only only 1 crash during actual gameplay in my 20+ hours of game time, and yet trying to load certain maps after a few loads will frequently make your game crash, not to mention certain effect like Ultra Violence will make a successful load almost impossible, and the framerate is consistently awful in many places no matter what settings I use.\n\nThere's a fascinating story to be found, with multiple paths and even a hidden ending that seems more along the lines of Deus Ex, but first time players might find it extremely confusing until they play through it a first time and start checking out all the logs and getting info from other living beings. You can switch from Light to Heavy classes and use a crazy variety of weapons and gadgets, but not only do you need to level up your stats for dozens of hours in certain cases, you also need the large amount of money to buy them... the hammer is especially insane.\n\nThe game has a lot of replayability, as you can come back at any time into the maps and do side missions with random elements applied, special missions (custom maps) or jump online and play Coop or PvP with other players. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test multiplayer myself since the community is incredibly small, even after the summer sale, which is a real shame.\n\nI'd like to end this review by saying that, unlike what many people are claiming, I actually found this game pretty easy to get into. Yes, the story and the many systems implemented are confusing at first, but starting out in the Campaign and slowly finishing it will make things much clearer for you. There are also many tutorial videos integrated into the game if you need them, and the openness of the map and objectives make you feel more at ease, since you can tackle things the way you want to. Get past those first steps and you'll understand exactly why I enjoy this game so much.

You can hack enemies to either make them your ally or mess them up. The weapons are swords, axes, hammers, snipers, rifles, turrets, drones, clones, pistols, SMGs, etc. There is alot of varieties of abilites and weapons in this game. Also you level up by killing enemies, so you can raise up your traits. There is a research feature where you investigate a project while you do a mission, the point of that is that it unlocks weapons and abilities.\n\nThe story is really difficult to understand since the voice acting is in a different language and the dialogue and text just bores me...\n\nThe downside of this game is that it is very difficult as you progress in the game so you need to play with other players if you want to progress further.

It happens to be one of the most stable games I've played, with only only 1 crash during actual gameplay in my 20+ hours of game time, and yet trying to load certain maps after a few loads will frequently make your game crash, not to mention certain effect like Ultra Violence will make a successful load almost impossible, and the framerate is consistently awful in many places no matter what settings I use.\n\nThere's a fascinating story to be found, with multiple paths and even a hidden ending that seems more along the lines of Deus Ex, but first time players might find it extremely confusing until they play through it a first time and start checking out all the logs and getting info from other living beings. You can switch from Light to Heavy classes and use a crazy variety of weapons and gadgets, but not only do you need to level up your stats for dozens of hours in certain cases, you also need the large amount of money to buy them... the hammer is especially insane.\n\nThe game has a lot of replayability, as you can come back at any time into the maps and do side missions with random elements applied, special missions (custom maps) or jump online and play Coop or PvP with other players. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test multiplayer myself since the community is incredibly small, even after the summer sale, which is a real shame.\n\nI'd like to end this review by saying that, unlike what many people are claiming, I actually found this game pretty easy to get into. Yes, the story and the many systems implemented are confusing at first, but starting out in the Campaign and slowly finishing it will make things much clearer for you. There are also many tutorial videos integrated into the game if you need them, and the openness of the map and objectives make you feel more at ease, since you can tackle things the way you want to. Get past those first steps and you'll understand exactly why I enjoy this game so much. It's totally worth it!","July 6, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For a game that uses Valve's Source Engine, it's pretty neat. You take the form of a cyber warrior that is part of an organization within the shadows.\n\nThe gameplay is a FPS, but seems to have some RPG elements with it, too. You can hack enemies to either make them your ally or mess them up. The weapons are swords, axes, hammers, snipers, rifles, turrets, drones, clones, pistols, SMGs, etc. There is alot of varieties of abilites and weapons in this game. Also you level up by killing enemies, so you can raise up your traits. There is a research feature where you investigate a project while you do a mission, the point of that is that it unlocks weapons and abilities.\n\nThe story is really difficult to understand since the voice acting is in a different language and the dialogue and text just bores me...\n\nThe downside of this game is that it is very difficult as you progress in the game so you need to play with other players if you want to progress further. Another downside is that Streum On Studio seems to have abandoned this game and started another project game called "Space Hulk"...so with that being said, there is no one updating this game to iron out flaws and bugs.","July 11, 2014","true","96.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meloncommander/recommended/91700/","meloncommander","{cA} Melon_Commander","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meloncommander/","339 products in account","One of a select few games where the world and lore genuinely interests me. The world combines elements from things like Warhammer 40K, Deus Ex, The Matrix and is... absolutely weird, in the best possible way. The game has a stylish cyberpunk/ religious theme with some stunning level design (levels are huge too), particularly early on. The game is a pretty good shooter, guns feel good and the enormous range of unlocks, stats, researches etc. leaves plenty to be discovered. One of my favourite features is the completely customisable difficulty which includes factors such as enemy hearing radius, sight radius and respawn time. There are a few downsides, the game is pretty obtuse (although some, me included, might like that. There is no hand holding). Also, the game is pretty buggy and I suffer from frequent crashes and derps.\n\nTLDR: The game has problems, but if you like the orignal Deus Ex and enjoy themes from things such as Warhammer 40k, then this game HAS to be experienced.\n\nEDIT: One feature I forgot to mention is the element of persistence and the way your profile levels. It's pretty cool. You can also do secondary missions, which act like challenge maps, if you just want to shoot some enemies, or test new abilities. So far I have spent more time in the secondary missions than in the story missions.","January 15, 2014","true","22.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has some serious issues, it has flawed mechanics, unplayable classes, unbalanced weapons as well as a very strange story. But there is something about it that I love.\n\nIt has deep music, a very interesting plot. Scary elements as well as mind-screw abound. It also has the darkest techno-future atmosphere that I have ever seen. But it's a pig. Really, it's hard to love and easy to hate.\n\nIt is a game where you can go invisible and strike enemies with samurai swords. A game where you will have great difficulty completing on your first run and will be left wondering at the end what to make of it all.\n\nI won't lie it isn't a game for most people, it's very offbeat, very unclassifiable. But underneath all the poor gameplay and bad story-telling, there is something about it I like.\n\nIt has atmosphere. It's sombre, dark and sometimes scary. Darkened corridors where beasts could come at you from nowhere if you don't pay attention. Red alert lights flash while you thud your cyberboots around, looking for an access panel to hack to stop the damn defense turrets from targetting you. All while on an alien and completely inhoispitable planet somewhere in a distant future which is calous, cruel or downright ignorant to your plight.\n\nOr closer to home where cyber-punks fight the megacorp soldiers. Chinese writing sprawled in holographic advertisements accross walls. Tenement blocks under siege from monstrous creatures. The spawn of an alien force known as the metastreum. They are relentless, and they never stop coming. But you have a mission to complete, you can let the soldiers and beasts fight amongst themselves. It's the future and it's dark, just like it should be.\n\nThat is the atmosphere of the game. But ultimately, it suffers from too many set-backs to make it a good game, or even an average game. Really, it's worth no more than £3. And even then, only if you are a certain kind of person. Check it out on youtube to see what I mean.","December 1, 2013","true","43.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The mechanics are indepth but not buggy. The weapons are fun and a little OP on lower difficulties, but easily able to change the difficulty setting.\n\nThe artwork is gorgeous absolutely stunning. I can not recommend ths game more highly. It has a nice mix of RPG/FPS that isn't to far inclinded either way. There is almost a steam punky element to it, it is definetly a co-op game. I've had no problems at all so far, the only real negative i have for it. Is that sometimes it's a bit hard to see during the day, and the load times for joining a LAN is a little bit annoying. If you enjoyed Deus ex/ watch dogs you'll definetely enjoy this. It was a bargain at $1 but for me personally it was a $1 well spent.\n\nThe story line is very indepth and can take quite a bit to adjust to but, you can skip a lot of it if you just want to skip straight to the action. You can go all guns blazing but you may die a lot it does cause you to think about how you select your load out for each mission.\n\nAnd that is the great thing your not stuck with one class you can use all weapons and change if you come across an amoury in the larger maps, they are scattered and easy enough to backtrack and find. There is a steep learning curve but if you keep at it, you certainly get many hours out of it.","July 16, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When playing this, it felt like someone put Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, Shadow Warrior, Metal Gear Rising, Dishonored and Terminator into a blender, made a game out of it, and this was the result.\n\nA bit rough around the edges, the game doesn't do a good job of explaining itself too well since it just throws you in and expects you to make sense of what's happening. Basically, there's a war going between the human race and psychic aliens and the human race is losing. You're the lone survivor of an E.Y.E tactical force group and your job is find a way to defeat the aliens.\n\nUnlike other games like Dark Souls or Transistor which start off enigmative but provides some context as to what's happening without spoiling anything, EYE keeps to itself and doesn't share much about what about its world is about, and the complicated matters between the two in-game factions and the mediocre writing doesn't help either. Despite this, it has quite a lot of interesting lore and and the concept is reminisint of games like Half-Life 2 and System Shock 2, so I'll give it that.\n\nThe gameplay is interesting for the most part, but the lack of an actual tutorial level and having to watch 20-something in-game tutorial videos to actually understand how the mechanics and controls work is slightly frustrating. Character creation can also be a bit enigmative to use since none of the mechanics are explained at that point and by the sounds of it, the devs are just expecting you to pick DNA strands based on what race names sound the coolest. The gameplay itself is solid though. Being able to dual-wield katanas and using a minigun to blast through hordes of enemies at a time is very satisfying, and all the weapons feel fantastic to use, since they all have some nice power to them. The stealth mechanic is broken though, so don't even try it.\n\nI'd say the game qualifies as a flawed masterpiece and one of those hidden gems in indie gaming, but do your research beforehand and don't go into expecting a stellar story or one of those GotY stories. It's either a hit or a miss, based on your preference.","March 7, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Level and character design allows for multiple playstyles with a good variety of weaponry and psi powers (basically magic). Artstyle is nice and pays homage to its inspiriations rather than ripping them off.\n\nThe only downside I've really found is the low population.

It has great combat and story. The XP system has a lot of potential.\nUnfortunately, the save system is BROKEN. BROKEN. It only saves after (some) major missions, so if you save and quit halfway through a mission your XP is in tact but you have to start from the start of the mission the next time you play. Keep in mind that the missions are about and hour and fifteen minutes each. It's a real grind to play. If they had a simple quicksave or manual save the game would be great. Also note that the maps are HUGE for sourcemod. They aren't huge in a good way though. Sprint eats up your power and there is a lot inbetween objectives. Reinforcements sometimes respawn right behind you and score a quick kill, taking away a ressucitator, which take a lot of work to get.

Amazing world-building and lore with tons of attention to detail. Gameplay is great and the fps and rpg elements don't intrude/distract from one another. Hacking is well-designed and feels like an extension of the game instead of a silly minigame. Level and character design allows for multiple playstyles with a good variety of weaponry and psi powers (basically magic). Artstyle is nice and pays homage to its inspiriations rather than ripping them off.\n\nThe only downside I've really found is the low population. The multiplayer is extremely fun but there are very few people on (the most populated server I found had 5 people playing, and the few others had 1-2).\n\n","October 30, 2015","true","24.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/91700/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nE.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is an indie cyberpunk first person shooter RPG developed by Streum On Studio, you will find many dark themes within this game, and alternative story paths that you can take. E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy was released in 2011 and uses the Source Engine.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You start Divine Cybermancy by jumping right into the game and you find yourself a part of a complex story of a war between two main factions: Secreta Secretorum and the federation. You're allegance has already been set to help the Secreta Secretorum, however your loyalties are caught between two important figures: Commander Rimanah and your Mentor.\nThere are a number of secrets and alternative choices you can make throughout the game to different endings, some of which let you chose different factions.\n\nGame Play: Just thinking "how do I explain the game play of this game" gives me a headache. That probably should speak volumes for itself. The controls utilize standard FPS controls, and then throw in some "Jedi Force Powers". You start the game out with very little explanation about what any of these skills do, you're expected to figure them out for yourself.\nThere are 3 status bars that you need to watch: health, energy, and ethics. Obviously, once you run out of health, you die. Energy is used for your special abilities (Force Powers). If you run out of the Ethics bar, your character go insane for a little bit, firing uncontrollably and the screen gets really blurry.\nEven after playing through this game, and looking up information on it, I'm still not 100% sure what everything does. Safe to say, the game is a mess... but it was a fun mess to play for a few hours.\n\nAchievements: After 28 hours of gameplay, I have 42/100 achievements. At this point, fellow achiever should be saying "ouch". Most of the achievements are based on RNG (Random Number Generator).\nThere's a whole list of achievements for "kill this type of character". While that might look easy and simple enough, there is a chance table for if the creature you kill was actually that "class". To make matters more difficult only certain creatures can be certain classes.\nThere's also achievements for getting different objectives or quests within the game, different weapons, kills with different weapons, learning new spells/force-moves and other misc. achievements.\nIn other words, if you're hoping to get all the achievements, brace yourself for farming against the RNG-gods.\n\nPrice: E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy is priced at $9.99, I personally picked up my copy of the game while it was on a 90% off sale. I recommend others do the same. However, Streum On Studio is an indie company, so they definitely can use the support.\n\nConclusion: Now we come to the conclusion, and the real question is "Atratzu, did you enjoy playing the game?" And the answer is "yes, yes I did." While the game is complicated, messy, and at times unforgiving, I enjoyed playing this game, and will probably return to it and try to mop up more achievements.","May 11, 2015","true","28.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is confusing. This game is hilarious. There's a lot you can say about this game, and honestly, it's hard to find what to say. And that's a good thing, because if there's so much you want to tell to someone who might play the game that you can't fit it all in a review, then it's definitely a good game. To describe why this game is so good, allow me to abridge my 100+ hours of experience in it into a short story.\n\nAs I began the game, I had no idea what I was doing. The story was so convoluted I laughed it off, I had no idea how to regenerate hp, and the menus were almost unitelligible. The entire effect was compounded by the french to english translation, which while not poor, has some funny errors. Nevertheless, I picked up a katana that zaps people so hard they explode and went huntin'.\nAfter playing through the campaign once, hitting level 15 or so, and still feeling completely brainf$&%d, I tried out the multiplayer, joining up with my friend soon gaining a taste for blood in laggy katana combat and hilarious multi kill OHK man portable nuclear launcher shootouts. Sure, the multiplayer wasn't balanced, but that doesn't matter when you're having so much dang fun. Playing even more campaign and missions, I soon began to wonder about the gameworld itself to some extent, learning the names of creatures and weapons. And, while at first blush EYE appeared to be nothing more than a meaningless gibfest of dirty space rasta pirates and future holy space warriors with BIG ZAPPY KATANAS, I suddenly comprehended the extent of this game's universe.\nFast forward to where I am now, #1 ranked active Battle Royale player and almost level 10 in all cyber part stats, and I still don't know everything about this game (and that's not stemming from the fact that I haven't played enough campaign!) Everything in this game has an intrinsic meaning to the complex and psychological storyline, and it seems the more that I figure out about the games protagonist, the more I want to know (and fervently hope for a sequel.)\n\nThis game is chock full of anything you could want from a videogame. It's got all the explosive gibs and schlock you might want from something senseless and violent, but at the same time it has a storyline with a depth that rivals some of the most thought provoking games of this generation. For 10 dollas, you can't go wrong.","January 29, 2014","true","141.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sipsublast/recommended/91700/","sipsublast","just","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sipsublast/","122 products in account","An interesting game with bad execution due to a low budget and inexperienced developers.\n\nThe game feels like a Source mod. (partially because it IS running on the Source engine)\n\nThe story itself is interesting, but at times I felt that the character dialogue was written by an amateur or a fan fic writer.\n\nThe UI is rather clunky at times and looks bad in some places due to bad usage of text color, text font and overall spacing. Not to mention, the game has received multiple updates and yet a certain bug (UI text not updating often) is not yet fixed.\n\nSome weapon/power sounds feel unsatisfying and the voice acting is weak.\nThe use of stock Source engine sounds break immersion as well.\n\nThe mapping is horrible in certain areas, not to mention that some of the maps perform badly on a considerably high-end PC. (some might say that this is because the engine is outdated or that designing a large scale map in the Source engine is hard, but I beg to differ, as I've seen outstanding maps done in Source mods or by single mappers.)\n\nThe weapons are rather out of balance - at the start of the game, you have access to 2 weapons in most categories, and most categories have 1 COMPLETELY superior weapon to the other. Why bother adding 2 weapons if there are no trade-offs at all and you start out with 2 weapons in each category with one of them being completely superior to the other?\nNot to mention the SMGs are COMPLETELY inferior to every other weapon in every single way.\n\nThe graphics are bad as well. The textures on some objects are low resolution, the bump maps on some weapons are bad and some world textures are not that pleasing for the eye either.\nWhat I did like is the depth based depth of field shader (which I haven't seen in any Valve games) and the holographic sights, but even then, it's something you see in most modern games.\n\nThe game's difficulty is strange. The starting mission is easy as pie, yet the moment you get to play the first mission, you get your ♥♥♥♥ wrecked if you're not experienced at FPS games. (luckily that's not the case for me)\nThis game will NOT hold your hand. It's very brutal and unforgiving. If you're a CoD kiddie, don't expect to like this game.\n\nThe RPG elements, on the other hand, are nicely thought through and there are a lot of things to level up and unlock, which is very good.\n\nThe gun play is robust and satisfying, although it's really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying to die because of the good ol' Source engine's physics ♥♥♥♥ing up by blocking your movement because you bumped into a prop and got stuck in it while you're getting shot at.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game a 4.5/10. I'd say that this game is a flawed gem, and if it had a bigger budget and more developers, it'd be an amazing game.\n\nLastly, I have to admit that despite it's flaws I fell in love with this game.","June 1, 2013","true","31.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Would I buy it for $10? Eh. maybe. The game is entertaining, and even though it says co op, you may end up having a lot of issues with co op.  Me and my friend did, and there are guides all over the web on how to fix it. But with those kind of guides I'm always the kind to mess them up. But, those guides are not by the devs, and they never did anything to fix the issues. So, dont expect to play co op. It ran alright with Hamachi (thats how you spell it right?) but I noticed I was lagging considerably while playing with Hamachi. I dont know if it was my friends connection or mine, although I was the host of the server. His connection wasnt the best at the time, but we havent tried recently. Everything else though, is entertaining, and I think worth the play alone. Although, Im the kind to be playing Borderlands alone.\n\nOverall I recommend it, but if you're looking for a fun co op game, I do not recommend.","September 5, 2015","true","42.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Now I like Dark Souls, but at least Dark Souls follows certain rules and conventions. This game is just all over the place. The real 'prepare to die' experience starts here!\n\n-Objectives are often vague, and while venturing around a large map trying to figure out how to get to the waypoint feels like a nice touch of exploration, it's ruined by the respawning enemies (see below).\n-Damage is way too high (even on Easy), and a grenade in a tight corridor is effectively a death sentence.\n-The fact that enemies respawn means you'll often be attacked from behind just when you thought you'd thoroughly cleared the area. At least you can always run back to the mobile armoury for ammo...\n-The grammar and tone of the dialogue feels like it was written by a high-schooler who averaged Ds in English.\n-Can't make heads of tails of the plot. The story beginning with an amnesiac protagonist thrown into the middle of a civil war / political coup (is that what's happening?) doesn't make it much easier. I've heard of 'in media res' but this is ridiculous.\n-WHY ARE THERE SO MANY ENEMIES, I TURNED THE RESPAWN RATE WAY DOWN, OH GOD THEY'RE ALL OVER ME\n-Stats and classes are also a little tricky to figure out. I'm sure they do something, but I don't really feel any different after multiple level-ups.\n-Occasional difficulty telling which doors can and can't be interacted with.\n-Reloading causes you to waste any unused bullet in the current magazine (WHAT the ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥). Add in the fact that there is no automatic reloading when you run out of bullets and you will choke in almost every single high-pressure situation.\n-Some odd level geometry causes problems with movement here and there, particularly when moving in and out of vents or past deceptively small-looking bits of rubble/pipe/what-have-you.\n\n+Saving up for upgrades and equipment is a nice incentive. You get currency bonuses for high-performance combat (headshots, backstabs, etc), so you get rewarded for not just spraying and praying.\n+The style of clothing, technology and - in some cases - architecture is pretty cool.\n+Some levels contain posters of hot girls with guns.\n+The melee weapons all look really cool, and the ability to defend against projectiles makes them HUGELY useful.\n\n+/- what language is everyone speaking and why\n\nMaybe I'm playing this game wrong, but honestly, it just feels bad and unenjoyable to play. 4/10, would not recommend.","November 13, 2015","false","3.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Like Serious Sam, Duke 3D and so on before it, the entire game can be played in coop.\n\nThe not very long campaign has a few branch situations, and in general mission objectives are slightly flexible as to which ones you complete and how you go about it, so the game has a whole bunch of replay value. You can play as many playthroughs as you want with your character.\n\nThe game isn't afraid of being hard and making you die, and as there's semipermanent (i.e. not easily fixable) death penalties eventually, it also strongly encourages playing well.\n\nBe aware that singleplayer and multiplayer campaign progress are saved separately in your character file, so you cannot start a game on your own and continue with others (unless you start it as a MP game and play alone). One player is the campaign host in multiplayer, this is separate from the actual server host.\n\n(There's also competitive MP nowadays, but I don't think anybody's ever played it.)","August 2, 2011","true","45.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","9"

That's just side missions on Normal difficulty. This game truly knows how to tell you "♥♥♥♥ YOU" the most harsh way possible.\nBut oh wait, it has a higher difficulty? Not just that, on it's highest difficulty you'll die before you even see that cloaked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the other side of the map.\nOther than that, it's a highly enjoyable game if you really get into it and ignore all of the faulty parts, like players twitching like druggies in co-op mode from time to time... or weapons making zero sense at some points... or your hands completely mismatching your suit... But hey, it's a Source game from 2011 and it's low budget, so chill out.\n\nNo wonders it has an asian mode difficulty level though, because everything in the game is asian as ♥♥♥♥. The first character you'll meet, who actually has voice acting, will start talking gibberish. Good thing there's a massive translation text in the center when they talk though. Every single thing like an ancient scroll or hologram on a computer will also be asian or in a binary code which can't even be translated.\n\nHacking in the game is pretty simple, but it can be annoying as hell at times.\nYou have 5 options in hacking : "Attack", which deals damage to your opponent's virus, "Mask", which reduces your opponent's virus' damage, "Scan", which weakens their virus' shield, "Shield", which hardens your virus' shield, "Overflow", which trades some of your shield for some damage points.\nEach action in hacking takes time, and you can only pick one at once, so choose wisely.\nAlso you can't protect yourself while hacking, so good luck trying to hack a bank dispenser while being molested by 10 semi-invincible guys with miniguns or a massive robot-demon-imp-cyborg-thing that has a cannon machinegun, which will probably instakill you.\n\nGladly, stealth is an option in this game, which is great... for those who want to focus on that. However, you can also be a heavily armored terminator or a crazy monkey with a gun if you want, it's all up to you.\n\n\nUseful tips for this game :\n\n-Never ♥♥♥♥ around in the HQ/sanctuary when you're near friendly NPCs(and don't kill Jians, despite them being complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to you). Even jumping onto someone's head off a certain height will make everyone mow you down.\n\n-Play on "Normal" or "Easy" diffculty if you don't want to get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Don't experiment with weapons on high difficulty, just go straight for the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and overpowered gun ever.\n\n-Be ready for sp00ks\n\n-Don't let anything hack you unless it's for the achievement, especially in combat zones.\n\n-Don't be too trigger happy, some NPCs are friendly in campaign mode. Even a creepy ♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing monster that's hidden in a wall.\n\n-Don't challenge heavily armored minigun guys with your sword.\n\nOh, and remember I said this game is asian af? Yeah, also every character has blank white eyes and your mentor is an animated armored statue with a golden head.

If i can sum it up in one word it would be: "weird".  In the distant future secret cults dress as medieval knights. Maps are dark and unimpressive. You can barely see half the time, flashlight is close to useless(never seen worst flashlight in a game). 99% of the time you re not sure what to do. Mediocre level design with repeating campaign: start from point A go to point B, return to point A several times, get stupid "success" briefing. game over.

Main menu and loading has some stupid "artifact number (blank) screenshots which bring zero to the story.

I was left uber unsatisfied by this game. It did help me understand one thing though: indie games (as in non-professionals) will always suck balls, they simply will.

I had to run like a sissy while my character fired his weapon uncontrollably at shadows and hallucinated explosions.\n\nIn another, I accidentally got caught in crossfire between some allies and the enemy forces, and my character freaked out and hallucinated that my allies were the bad guys.\n\nI tried to hack a security console and it hacked me back.\n\nI overused my psionic powers and my head exploded.\n\n---\n\nThis game does have issues. If you like to have allies (this game lets you conjure them with sci fi magic), you'll find they get in the way quite often, especially in cramped areas. If you head back into an area outside of that area's mission, you'll find that enemies are set to respawn very frequently, which is not everyone's cup of tea. You can tweak the AI settings and respawn rates in the options menu, but not quite enough for some areas. As many people mention, the English translation in this game is poor, but there's a community-made patch that fixes most of that. Sound quality can be hit and miss, but on the whole the gunplay sounds satisfying. Sadly there is very little voice acting in this game! The bulk of all interaction you'll have with NPCs is done through text.\n\n---\n\nIf you're willing to deal with that and you want a game with excellent gunplay, hardcore RPG mechanics, and inventory management, that overwhelms you with options and makes absolutely no apologies for its learning curve and occasionally brutal difficulty, pick this game up. If you're unsure whether this is your cup of tea, I encourage you to at least watch a Let's Play and check out the demo. This game will definitely be sucking up a lot of my time.\n\n6/10 without community grammar patch, 8/10 with.","August 10, 2014","true","125.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't expect to be able to follow the storyline without outside sources as all dialogue in the game is written in some language not yet seen to humankind and risen from the deepest pits of the nine hells. Also, some of it is in French and untranslated.\n\nThe Storyline:\nEYE's storyline is incomprehensible. None of it makes sense, and it isn't supposed to. There is an underlying storyline that is impossible to notice without venturing into the dark pits of the EYE forums that is only discernible if you manage to understand the dialogue which would require some form of extra-universal 10th dimensional being to assist you. The main storyline revolves around you, a futuristic Cyborg-Templar-Inquisitor. Your character is a member of a Templar-ish space wizard order who recently fractured and now theres also Ninja Space Wizards as well. You mainly fight against 'The Federation' a type of dystopian space government that has no real motives or beliefs behind their actions, and you're never told why you're attacking them. You also combat space-werewolf lizardmen xenomorphs called 'meta-streumonic creatures.'\n\nMost of characters you meet are prone to excessive bouts of mood shifts and are generally mentally unstable. Also you have amnesia, and people get mad when you ask them about things your character should know, but that you donts because its never explained to you. Your character also has a wife, who is mentioned once, but never again, and is never seen. The final boss fight makes no sense and I have no idea why I was even fighting him. Also, there are Space-Jamaican Pirates on Mars.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you're told that some captain sent his wife into the forbidden place and she was executed as result. That captain was you. Then you went insane because you basically killed your wife. None of the events in the game actually happen, and your character is actually just living some kind of screwed up nightmare which kind of explains why nothing in the game makes any sense.\n\n10 / 10 would recommend\n\ntl;dr  version:\n\nyou gain brouzouf\nyou gain brouzouf\nmy legs are OK\nyou gain brouzouf\n","February 20, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Like a tabletop, you need a little reading, friends and patience to get the fullest out of this game.\n\nConceptually, EYE is basically Deus Ex meets the Imperium of Man. You've got some pretty good gun play, mixed with tabletop conventions like having skill points, rolling critical hits and critical misses, and permanent stat reductions for dying in an embarrassing way.  Like Deus Ex, you can run and gun or stealth your way around the environment, but more akin to tabletops you can also hack other enemies and machines to do your bidding or even be a psychic cyber samurai.\n\nAs far as I can understand it, the story takes place in a distant far flung future where everything and everyone is computerized to the point where there’s almost no organic madder inside anybody anymore. You work for EYE, a secret agent army working for a mysterious megacorp, fighting against everything from other megacorp armies to the feds (who look like Helghast) to lawless bandits by various means of sabotage, subterfuge and sometimes strait up pop’ in dudes.\n\nThe entire game can be played in coop for up to 4 players (It’s actually 32 players, but good luck with that) and should very much be played like that. Think of it like D&D, one wizard venturing forth isn’t all that great and pretty hard, but if you have a party of four with varied strengths and weaknesses, you can overcome your enemies as a team.\n\nThe game may seem overly complex and janky at first, but as you learn your way around and excuse the ♥♥♥♥ translation, you’ll have a blast with having cyborg ninja adventures with your friends. Just be careful not to overdose.\n\nHere's a mod for a better translation\nHere's a guide on character generation and mechanics","December 30, 2013","true","20.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The combat is very solid and is fused with RPG elements in an interesting way makes it one of my favorite games to play when I'm tired of other things. You are given the choice of several play styles as well, like focusing on psionic powers, hacking, guns, etc.\n\nNow for the not so good stuff. The story can be rather confusing if you don't do any research into it from the wiki or some other source. After a while this game turns to a grindfest to obtain more levels, money, and research items so you can unlock other equipment. The UI isn't the best either, being rather small and sometimes buggy. Some dialogue that you recieve after completing an objective criticize the player and can be confusing on whether you did it correctly or not. Some enemies are extremely strong early on in the game, so don't count on completing this game in one life. There is more I could probably say, but I can't remember all the details.\n\nThis is a great game to play, don't let it's rough appearance convince you otherwise.","January 7, 2014","true","100.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Play as a rambo character and become overpowered first before specializing in hacking or psi powers.\n\nIf games were like alcohol, EYE is like a terrible-tasting and mysterious throat-burning whiskey that also makes you hallucinate and you have no idea what is even happening, but it is awful and amazing at the same time. The balance of the game is absolutely horrendous. Stealth, hacking and psionic builds will be hard-pressed to gain any experience, money or leverage at all; If you are not a ghost-in-the-shell holocaust murder agent you are the equivalent of someone with an english major.\n\nThe only way to make money or gain experience efficiently is to kill hundreds and hundreds of enemies or speedrun side missions, which could take up to an hour. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly huge and are designed to be labyrinths. The maps are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LY XBOX HUGE. It takes maybe 5 minutes to run from point A to point B, where dozens of high-level enemies constantly spawn close to you and make it impossible to catch a break or to heal yourself. Always upgrade your cyber legs.\n\nThe AI is actually kind of smart and very vicious; they will throw grenades, rush you, corner you and flank you for any chance they get; when there is a 6-story tall cyberdemon only inches between you and a foot soldier, you are still enemy number one. If you dislike constant long-range combat, modify it such that enemies will only notice you at shorter distances and you'll have an easier time with both stealth and gunplay.\n\nBesides all of that, this game has an overwhelmingly chaotic atmosphere, very well-done dystopian aesthetics, and swarms upon swarms of enemies that present a constant threat and danger throughout the game. The developers crammed so many elements into the game that an invisible rambo super-fast armored gunslinging cyborg ninja who hacks into people's brains, uses psionic powers and jumps 6 feet into the air is UNDERPOWERED.\n\nCons: Bad translation, incomprehensible to the layman, horrible balance, STUPIDLY GIGANTIC XBOX HUGE MAPS (I cannot stress this enough), no tutorials, a few bullet sponge enemies and a punishing autosave system.\n\nPros: It will all be worth it if you want your head to explode from all of the chaos. I still have PTSD from the Mars mission. This game leaves me wordless to say what really went on in my mind when every element culminated into blasting down helicopters and cyberdemons the size of grand canyons left and right.","February 15, 2014","true","43.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The RPG-like mechanics aren't just a skin-deep stat system though; you will see improvement with each level up as well as access to new skills and equipment. It doesn't end there though, as you will almost constantly be in the process of researching items and technologies that may improve stats, unlock equipment, or allow you to upgrade biological enhancements. These upgrades cover ever part of the body from head to toe, such as increasing weapon accuracy by enhancing your eyesight, your ability to hack and use psychic abilites by altering your brain, or allowing you to run at breakneck speeds and jump ten stories high by cybernetically modifying your legs.\n\nPossibly the greatest thing about E.Y.E is it's unique and fast gameplay, which allows you to play however you want. It's entirely possible to complete the game without ever being spotted by a single enemy due to the large array of skills and items you can use, and you can ever beat the game without ever even coming in direct contact with opposition due to the game's JRPG-style hacking minigame. In the minigame you have the option to attack, raise your defense, raise your attack at the cost of defense, lower your target's attack, or lower your target's defense. This real-time strategy game can make for intense matches against high level AI, resulting in hacking that could last minutes. However it can be said with the exclusion of mandatory events, that you will never need to hack anything at all, which is what really shows that with E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy you can play however you want.\n\nIf you want to be a hunter killer that focuses on large enemies and let allies take on fodder, you can. If you want to talk your way through situations and hack a powerful unit to annihilate any opposition, you can. If you want to charge head on with swords and hammers, clearing large squads in seconds, you can. The limits are almost non-existant with E.Y.E which can warrant hours upon hours of gameplay, albeit a fair amount of grinding to gain access to better technology.\n\n(TL;DR)\n\nOverall, E.Y.E is a game you definetly cannot pass up. Although it has it's fair share of flaws and a barebones attempt at teaching the player anything past the complete basics, once you pass that initial learning curve you're on track for one of the most inspired and creative games of the past few years. An excellent gameplay system that incorporates the best of both the first-person shooter and roleplaying worlds, as well as a fresh cyberpunk story with multiple endings and a deep, intriguing history of events make E.Y.E Divine Cybermancy a must play game, especially for it's low (and often discounted) price.","January 12, 2015","true","84.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A brilliantly atmospheric and characterful game, EYE's world is not fine and dandy. From offering to relieve potential business partners of their heads to encouraging a man to commit suicide, you play with the lock on the door between mean and downright vindictive. Of course, the rest of the world is waiting for you to open the door; spirit werewolves, federal soldiers, bandits and giant cyberdemons are amongst the various enemies you can face in this game.\n\nYou can use a number of means to go about this game; from straight up rifle combat, heavy weapons use and melee to stealthed sniping, hacking and psychic prowess, there is no singled out method by which one can complete missions. A particular air of revelation is about EYE, making it one of the most enjoyable FPS games I've ever played.\n\nThe worst thing that could be said about this game is that the translation from French isn't always coherent. Some of the menus are less than intuitive and there isn't a lot of help moving between interfaces. However, personally I reckon the slightly broken English adds something unfamiliar enough to the game to make it feel more alien a world.","December 20, 2013","true","88.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most likely they're expecting it to be a different type of game, but it's basically an RPG style mod for an FPS game. That's what it is and what it's supposed to be. In my opinion it's pretty successful at this.\n\nThe main problems with the game are relatively minor, like the font size is too small for modern displays and there's no way to increase it. There are some other minor UI type issues that basicaly seem to stem from the fact that it's an FPS engine mod being sold as a game, and from the fact that the game is a bit dated.\n\nThe art style in the game is great though. It's basically a combo between the Necromongers from the Riddick movies and the usual cybrpunk stuff (hacking, implants, etc.) The overall level design isn't amazing but it isn't too bad. (It sort of looks like maybe someone designed the levels without too much regard to what quests would be in those levels or how they'd work, then the quest/mission content was added later.) So the levels don't naturally lead you toward quest objectives, but this could be good or bad depening on whether you want your hand held or you want a more realistic experience. (Quest markers exist, but they don't necessarily lead you easily to a waypoint because the actual path you need to take to get there may be kind of convoluted. However there is a "spell" that does pathfinding toward the next quest marker.)\n\nIn short, it's a unique RPG FPS game with a few rough edges in the UI, and it's kind of dated at this point, but it's cetainly worth picking up especially on sale. If you want CS:GO don't buy it, but if you want a uniqe FPS RPG with a cyberpunk psionic necromonger type theme and don't mind that its an older game then do buy it especially since it's inexpensive.","August 16, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It doesn't explain much of *anything* to you, and every inch of language that attempts to explain stuff to you is poorly translated.\nAnd I adore this game.\nIt's an FPS/RPG/I have no idea what to call this kind of game, and it is extremely difficult. I have yet to understand what I'm doing, but that's the best part - the learning curve is so insane, that *if* you manage to figure it out, it will most definitely be satisfying. And "satisfying" is what this game is, in a nutshell - every single thing you can do in this game is satisfying. Firing a pistol is satisfying, summoning 3+ clones of yourself to kill people for you is satisfying, teleporting inside people to make them expload is satisfying - everything is satisfying. This game is well worth the $10 they are asking for, if only so you can teleport inside poeple and cause them to explode (note that this is hard to achieve - everything costs insane amounts of money, which can be hard to get).\n\nP.S. Running is for the weak. Get big, strong, heavy armor and tank all the shots. At least in the beginning, when you're still trying to get money.\nP.P.S. If you really want to survive, have multiple play styles. I have a "money-making side-mission" play style (tanking everything), and a "main-mission, having fun" play style (moderate stealth with snipers and psi-powers).","July 17, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

IN ORDER TO PLAY WITH A FRIEND, YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD HAMACHI, HOW ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IS THAT?\n\nIt doesnt even recognize a 2012 dedicated video card(650m) so i had to force it to use it, instead of intel 4000 which it picked by default.\n\nI didnt like it one bit. If i can sum it up in one word it would be: "weird".  In the distant future secret cults dress as medieval knights. Maps are dark and unimpressive. You can barely see half the time, flashlight is close to useless(never seen worst flashlight in a game). 99% of the time you re not sure what to do. Mediocre level design with repeating campaign: start from point A go to point B, return to point A several times, get stupid "success" briefing. game over. Story is half-way ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at best even though the game the game "invites you" to read the history leading to this point, i could barely care less. Main menu and loading has some stupid "artifact number (blank) screenshots which bring zero to the story. Game is uber hard on easy and you die often. there are like 20 skills and 4 different ways to research things, however all of them require money which comes hard to get. Forgot to mention, that when you die, you not only die, but have a pretty high chance to get fatal wound, or something, that decreases your overall stats. I can write a lot more about this indie game however time lost forever.\n\nIn a few words:\n-uninteresting weapons\n-boring and stressful(nothing interesting to do, but also very hard)\n-dull story(i am polite here)\n-really weird world/character models\n-ton of different stats and abilities which lead to the exact same pointless result which brings 0 satisfaction\n-Absolutely nothing in this game makes you feel "involved" in whats happening. Honestly i played for 5-6hours total and 100% of the time I was like "when is this going to finish, i cant take it anymore"\n\nThe only reason i bought this was cause i wanted to have something coop to play with my pal from Sweden, cause we both quit dota and were desperately searching for a game to play together. I was left uber unsatisfied by this game. It did help me understand one thing though: indie games (as in non-professionals) will always suck balls, they simply will. Nasty, greedy corporations are in for the money and exactly for that reason they will strive to create good games.

As it was only a few dollars and it seemed like something new to play that I might start up every now and again for something new. Starting it up the graphics weren't anything to be thrilled with, but if it's a good game you don't have to have HD textrues. Plus, for a game type like this it's not really needed or the most important quality.\nNow I want to preface everything in this review with the simple fact that I only played it around an hour of the game.\nThis game when you first start it up starts to seems like it's one of those games that slips through the cracks and is a hidden gem. Though right after it started to try and teach me how to use some of your basic special abilities I was confused. As what it tells you to click and where to go doesn't always match up with what you need to do. So you just get a view of all of the massive amount of skills/abilites you can have, without having even any solid knowlage of how to use the basic skills. This doesn't even include the charcter creation section where you choose what three gene types you want to splice together with a vage idea of what atruibutes fit your play style. Then when the tutorial promp pops up to have you click the video for what it wants you to do. What it tells you to do isn't the same as what the video is called so you spend a few moments guessing and hopping you click the correct one.\nSo, once you get past the tutorial and actually start to kill people it doesn't hold your hand on how to get to the objective. Which I actually liked, but there where so many options that it just kinda felt like none of them were fully fleshed out so to say. As if there were too many ideas just thrown together when ended up with something stand alone, but it's so much at once you don't know what you are doing or how some skills work. As well as feeling like everything was half finished before they added on new features and abilites.\nThere is also the issue that it really likes to lag and glitch from time to time which happens much too frequently to be something that I can just ignore and keep playing. As it got to the point a few times that it just kept me from doing anything.\nAlso, there are so many menus to go though that it feels more like it was made for a console/controler then a keyboard with the ability to lessen the amount of menus. By menus, I mean menus with in menus. Not just a lot of seperate menues.\nOver all, this is a really intresting game and you might like or even love it. Though you will really need to devote time to this game to figure out how everything works, but I couldn't as there were just too much meh feeling about it.","July 4, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Like a tabletop, you need a little reading, friends and patience to get the fullest out of this game.\n\nConceptually, EYE is basically Deus Ex meets the Imperium of Man. You've got some pretty good gun play, mixed with tabletop conventions like having skill points, rolling critical hits and critical misses, and permanent stat reductions for dying in an embarrassing way.  Like Deus Ex, you can run and gun or stealth your way around the environment, but more akin to tabletops you can also hack other enemies and machines to do your bidding or even be a psychic cyber samurai.\n\nAs far as I can understand it, the story takes place in a distant far flung future where everything and everyone is computerized to the point where there’s almost no organic madder inside anybody anymore. You work for EYE, a secret agent army working for a mysterious megacorp, fighting against everything from other megacorp armies to the feds (who look like Helghast) to lawless bandits by various means of sabotage, subterfuge and sometimes strait up pop’ in dudes.\n\nThe entire game can be played in coop for up to 4 players (It’s actually 32 players, but good luck with that) and should very much be played like that. Think of it like D&D, one wizard venturing forth isn’t all that great and pretty hard, but if you have a party of four with varied strengths and weaknesses, you can overcome your enemies as a team.\n\nThe game may seem overly complex and janky at first, but as you learn your way around and excuse the ♥♥♥♥ translation, you’ll have a blast with having cyborg ninja adventures with your friends. Just be careful not to overdose.\n\nHere's a mod for a better translation\nHere's a guide on character generation and mechanics","December 30, 2013","true","20.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I just turned a Cybernetic Wizard/Samurai/Soccer Player into mulch with my two-handed exploding claymore. His friend wasn't lucky either; possessing him with my superior hacking software, I just had him march into a room full of friends and unload his shotgun. Behaving like some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of Deus Ex, Ghost in the Shell, and Warhammer 40k, E.Y.E is one of the most bizarre and genuinely entertaining FPSes of our time. Research new abilities, mechanically augment your body, learn powerful psychic powers and hack bank teller machines and eldritch abomination's faces, it's all up to you! E.Y.E offers a wide array of playstyles and choices for the player and there's always another method to explore. Feel free to explore the world in your own way and become the biggest, baddest technosamuraihackerpsion the world's ever seen either alone or in co-op with your buddies! Aside from some translation and UI issues, E.Y.E becomes a really fun game once you get used to it (See Deus Ex) and once the ball's rolling you'll find that it's hard to stop. Make sure to look up a few beginner guides if you do buy it, though. Several mechanics are somewhat nebulous and you'll have a much better time if you know what everything does and why you were killed by your medkit.","January 6, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The combat is very solid and is fused with RPG elements in an interesting way makes it one of my favorite games to play when I'm tired of other things. You are given the choice of several play styles as well, like focusing on psionic powers, hacking, guns, etc.\n\nNow for the not so good stuff. The story can be rather confusing if you don't do any research into it from the wiki or some other source. After a while this game turns to a grindfest to obtain more levels, money, and research items so you can unlock other equipment. The UI isn't the best either, being rather small and sometimes buggy. Some dialogue that you recieve after completing an objective criticize the player and can be confusing on whether you did it correctly or not. Some enemies are extremely strong early on in the game, so don't count on completing this game in one life. There is more I could probably say, but I can't remember all the details.\n\nThis is a great game to play, don't let it's rough appearance convince you otherwise.","January 7, 2014","true","100.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's an FPS/RPG with an emphasis on character creation.  It's set in a dark cyberpunk world filled with shadowy organizations and questionable loyalties.  And it is also out of its flipping mind.  It's janky, it's flawed, it's woefully over ambitious, and it's some of the most fun I've had with an FPS/RPG hybrid since replaying STALKER Shadow of Chernobyl.  A work of mad genius?  Perhaps not.

I really want to like this game, but I think it misses the mark.\n\nOriginal:\nI haven't got the remotest ****ing clue what is going on in this game. And not in a clever, mysterious, well-crafted-world-where-not-all-is-as-it-seems way, which it's clear the devs were trying for. Even overlooking the english-as-a-second-language mistakes, the writing is utter garbage. Too many factions and characters introduced too quickly and making no apparent difference to what's going on.\n\nI have amnesia and don't know anything about my situation, yet I have opinions and memories about various characters?\n\nMore importantly, I don't understand the gameplay mechanics and there's very little explanation. You need to remember the briefing dialogue, because despite there being a high tech character UI it doesn't record dialogue and the objectives it does record don't give you any idea why you're doing them if you don't remember the details.\n\n\nThis game is a mess. It wants very badly to be a blend of Syndicate, Deus Ex, and possibly Fallout's Brotherhood of Steel. It doesn't succeed. There's probably a good game somewhere in there, but there's so much mess that should have been stripped out or implemented better.\n\nNot explaining anything in game is not a substitute for cleverness.

I can't think of another game which is, by turns, as awesome and awful as E.Y.E.

So at the end of the day the game's RPG pretensions are for naught: no matter how many upgrades you buy or how many times you level up the game still plays like an amateurish, unfinished, sub-mediocre Half-Life 2 mod.","April 9, 2012","false","18.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

The dialogue reads like a child whose second language is English wrote it; overly simple and full of mistakes. This GREATLY affects immersion. Immersion is kind of important in a story-driven/RPG game.\n\nSpeaking of the dialogue, it's text-based and a ton of reading. If I wanted to read a badly written story, I'd pick up a book by whoever wrote 'Twilight'. Despite that, the premise is good from what I read on the store page; it may not have been half as bad if the translation were better and the dialogue less childlike.\n\nThe graphics are good but devoid of anything interesting or much that's interactive, there is a lot of empty space to trudge through.\n\nUI and UX are an absolute mess. If you want to play with a controller, forget about it. You won't be able to access most anything via controller besides cycling through weapons, using the weapons, and pausing the game. Though you can control movement with a controller... Everything else (picking things up, hacking, dialogue, accessing UI, etc.) must be done with the keyboard, so it's simpler to stick with the keyboard/mouse combo throughout. I feel there is way too much going on with the various menus, it was not intuitive whatsoever and took too long for me to grow accustomed to.\n\n0/10 -- I found no redeeming qualities, even the low price I paid. In an RPG I want to INTERACT, be a PART of and guide the story. None of those things were possible for me here.

Normally, when a game is listed as having Partial Controller Support, it is mostly playable with your controller and only occasionally requires you to use your mouse or keyboard.  This is simply not the case with this game.  There are far too many required functions to be able to map them all to a standard controller, so you will need to use your keyboard so much that even attempting to use the controller just seems pointless.\n\nAgain, I realize that this isn't  an issue for a lot of PC gamers, but I feel like those who, like me, prefer to play their games wilth a controller will be disappointed with just how hard it is to play this game with one.

Fact is, it's not that the concept is bad (although gun-toting samurai in space seems pretty random) it's that it's executed so poorly that the game is simply impossible to play. Don't buy this. It's not even worth the $2 it costs at 80% off. It's terrible. TERRIBLE.","January 10, 2014","false","4.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Even with loads of point in hacking everything but doors take way too long. The respawning enemies patrolling around the level will spot and unload into you before you can hope to finish. Regular things are a chore to hack. Even with 50 points in hacking I had trouble opening a ventilation shaft in a later level, necessitating several runs of spamming the shield and attack options for minutes on end.\n\nLike blowing things up with your mind? EYE fares much better here, but the stat requirements for the most powerful psi-spells meant that after wasting many points on hacking I had to resort to heavy grinding to be able to use them before the end of the campaign. By the way, dont even bother with the methods listed in the grinding guides on the community hub, a custom map "cm_farm_alpha23" will get you your brouzoufs/xp much, much faster, without the infuriating and frequent stat penalties incurred from falling down a hole on the Minos map.\n\nCybernetic implants will be familiar to any Deus Ex player and do what they need to, however if you wish to use several of them as well as psi powers your quick actions menu will be overloaded, and the psi-power selector is far too cumbersome when you are switching between over five powers in the heat of combat. The clunkiness of the controls is made worse by the actions menu leaving the flow of game time at its normal pace, and that weapons are assigned hotkeys based on the order you last added them to your inventory, leaving you stumbling to find your medkit when you have a sliver of health left. Deus Ex easily had a far better system of weapon/skill hotkeys, 11 years before EYE was released.\n\nEverything is poorly explained. Game is listed as having co-op, but it only works if you and a friend are willing to jump through many hoops. Dialog sucks, bad english and criminal surfer gangs abound. Many dialog trees have half the options end the conversation and initiate combat, while redundant the hostile option switch in the order of responses, seemingly to punish people skipping through text. Weapons all seem pretty fun but prepare to grind if you want to use the biggest and baddest ones within your first campaign. Enemy and ally AI is abysmal, humans will stop the exact spot they see you and fire their semiautomatic weapons without end. Mutant enemies will run into your bullets single file. Levels are apparently designed to have you drain all your energy sprinting around.\n\nIf you come to this game with low expectations and dont bother with hacking, it might be worth buying at 90% off. Otherwise stay clear of it.\n\n4/10","December 25, 2014","false","26.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game has a great art style, decent sound design, and decent graphics, everything else is pretty much a mess. The game explains itself very poorly and has a cluttered UI that makes getting into the game a pain. Random things seem to happen with seemingly no explanation such as going insane, losing karma, killing yourself, and so on. The combat is fairly clunky as well, with enemies who have vision that covers almost the entire map which makes stealth nearly impossible, along with the fact that enemies will spawn infinitely after one has been alerted leading to endless shootouts that keep you from getting to your objective in a timely manner. On top of that item management is a pain, you have to go into an inventory menu, toss out your weapon, then walk over to the weapon you want to pick up in order to pick up a new weapon, and managing your ammunition requires using that same time-consuming menu. On top of that the game punishes you for things like using a healing stim and forces you to go insane (Literally). Beyond that the controls are mediocre at best with having to use the enter button for things like picking up ammo or climbing ladders, even leaning has a massive delay and sometimes simply doesn't work. The game itself is rather tedious with most missions simply being go from point A to point B while trying not to get killed by the army of goons inbetween. If you've got the money to spare and absolutely nothing better to do, go ahead and buy it, but it's not an easy game to get into, and you'll have to look past a lot of bad aspects in order to enjoy it.","May 15, 2014","false","7.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I would expect something like this when i was playing 15 year old games. Levels are huge and empty and just feel confusing as someone with multiple personality disorder would design.\n\nLevel design is not the only thing that is 15 years old - user interface is also something out of 90's. To open an inventory, you have to hold down C, drag mouse down, let go of C, select inventory from full screen of text and other stuff. There wasnt a way to bind a key to the inventory. Why would you design it like this?\n\nRespawning enemies. What were they thinking? I am just curious how the playtesting was, because this makes you constantly out of ammo and makes the stealth almost useless. Aside from the fact that AI's basically have unlimited sight nor does the level design support the stealth.\n\nThings that are good:\nText is good. It is well written. I enjoyed reading the background lore, but when you are not reading, the levels jump from one location to another and you have no idea what's going on.\n\nConclusion: 15 years behind in level design, UI design and gameplay design. That's a sunken boat that even interesting text could not save. I do not recommend this game. Only buy this if it is on sale and try the demo before you buy.\n\nPS: I am probably a minority expressing this opinion of this game.

The gameplay itself is rather clunky, too. I've no interest in playing a RPG that doesn't allow me to save my progress whenever I want, or that has checkpoint saves so far apart that it literally would take hours to reach each one if you chose to opt for sidequests. For that matter, I've little time to play anything built on the Source engine. It's decrepit; the graphics feel like late '90's, and player interactions with the environment feel decidedly antiquated.  Finally, why is the game so dark? It's really freaking dark! In the same vein as Doom 3.\n\nTL;DR: Bad save system by design and old engine leaves this one for the hardcore nerds who have LOTS of time to blow off.","July 28, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Don't expect to be emotionally invested in this game, because both the story and the mechanics are both so poorly presented as to be incomprehensible. There might be a really great experience hidden somewhere beneath the broken tutorial system, the completely uninteresting characters, and the mediocre environment design, but this strictly amateur work is turning me off from digging any deeper to try and find it. Forget about "polishing" this, what this title needs is to have the finish stripped, the paint sanded off, and to have the entire user experience reworked from the bare metal.\n\nYou can tell that a lot of work has been put into the foundational elements of the gameplay - the damage/HP/healing system, the level-up system, the different abilities and weapons, and even the hacking mechanic - but it's all presented in a bland way that makes me think the team got bored with making this game halfway through and decided to phone it in as soon as the levels were designed and the largest bugs in the gameplay were ironed out.

There's not really a story, just the all too classic, "Here's you. You're in a world, now play!" The game is really complex for people not used to the large array of keys to press just to do a single action. The co-op is just some maps and you're randomly assigned a task or set of tasks to complete, not really that fun.\nKilling Floor is a better game that just throws you in the world and lets you kill things, it's less complicated, and leaves even less to be desired considering the vast amount of content. Seriously, just buy Killing Floor.\nPROS: Source engine looks decent, game concept of a dystopian cyber-world with swords as well as powerful firearms is cool, dismembering enemies is fun.\nCONS: Violence level is turned down 10 notched when playing even multiplayer even over LAN, game is much to complex for newcomers, you don't really want to keep playing to get used to the complexity, the world isn't very inviting or interesting, combat is copy-paste of too many games, not enough to do, leveling up doesn't feel rewarding enough, too bland of graphics, needs more content.","July 2, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
