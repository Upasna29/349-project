Behind its attractively retro flair, complete with simulated bulbous low resolution Cathode Ray Tube display, stylized chiptune music, and sprite graphics, is an unforgiving test of pure reflex. The more you think while playing this game, the worse you'll do! There are only three buttons you need worry about: Right, Left, and Pause. Humorously, pausing the game takes it to a simulated blue screen of death, also providing you with the means to exit the game (pressing start again), causing the screen to warp and snowcrash.\n\nWhile individual mileage may vary, I find that the wide variety of animations that Kung Fury can unleash to represent your simple one-button attacks to be amusing enough to completely override any semblence of boredom in the otherwise extremely simple concept of the game's mechanics. Its simplicity borders on elegance, or perhaps even meets it, as I do not believe they could have added anything to the game that wouldn't somehow damage the experience.\n\nIt boils down to this: enemies run at you from either side and you must attack them as they get close. Most are one-hit mooks easily dispatched, but as play progresses tougher and more complicated enemies arrive--ones that require frantic combinations of right and left attacks to take down, as more and more foes flock and swarm in an attempt to overwhelm you. And overwhelm you they will.\n\nYou can take three hits and then it's game over, to start again. There are no power ups, no way to heal yourself, no way to expand your character's capabilities, no other levels; this game is just You, Your Reflexes, and the High Score. Maybe it's not the most immersive experience in the world, but without a doubt it's one of the purest executions of a game ever expressed.\n\nThe fact that it's so aesthetically polished--not MERELY poor graphics but an entire suite of stylistic touches like glitches, rendering artifacts, all meant to evoke the limited hardware capacities of ages gone by--makes the whole experience an unexpected treat. Give it a whirl; you don't have anything to lose! ...except for maybe two bucks. But I humbly submit that it's worth that much.","May 28, 2015","true","6.5"," 185 of 202 people (92%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","92","185","202","22","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saucex4/recommended/373180/","saucex4","sauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saucex4/","533 products in account","TLDR; Bottom-lineThis game is a Simplified Side Scrolling Arcade Spectacle Brawler. You only have two buttons: Left-attack and Right-attack. The main mechanic is virtually identical to One Finger Death Punch, but in Kung Fury you only have  ONE MODE and ONE STAGE. If this is too little content for you then don't bother. If you want more variety, take a look at One Finger Death Punch. If you liked the movie and want to play as the badass Kung Fury though, this game is still pretty damn fun. I say this game is worth the asking price of $2.\n\nSample Gameplay\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=454796042\n\nMechanicsThe game is a simplified 2D side scrolling brawler. You have two buttons: [L] Left-Attack and [R] Right-Attack. If enemies come from the left, you hit Left-Attack, if they come from the right you hit Right-Attack. The most common enemy will die in one hit, but other enemies require different combinations of [L] or [R] to defeat. For example the German officer requires you to hit him twice; the blonde girls in white require you to hit them three times in an alternating fashion (From left [L][R][L], from right [R][L][R]).\n\nAs for controls you have the choice of using the keyboard keys [A]/[D], or [<-][->], or mouse left-click/right-click. Controllers are also supported, with all the buttons on the left bound to left attack, and all the right buttons bound to right attack. You cannot rebind the keys as there is no options menu.\n\nGraphicsKung Fury is a hyper-stylized 2D side-scroller with an older 1980s pixelated art-style. The viewing area of the game is presented like an old arcade cabinet with a non-flat CRT monitor. The presentation of the game is meant to match the theme of the movie, so if you didn't like the movie or the old CRT look then chances are you won't like the game itself.\n\nStoryGo watch the movie.\nThe game itself does not have a story, but in order to appreciate this game I recommend watching the movie. It's FREE!\n\nAs a side note the game is based on one particular fight scene in the movie, where Kung Fury fights from right to left (side scrolling).\n\nPC Master Race IssuesThere is no options menu. You cannot rebind your keys (though there are a fair amount of default bindings to choose from), and you cannot change your resolution or anything else. The game defaults to fullscreen, but you can change it to window mode by pressing [ALT]+[ENTER]. This is sparse to say the least, and if you are particularly sensitive to missing features such as an options menu, then don't waste your time.","May 29, 2015","true","14.6"," 70 of 83 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","70","83","4","6"

It was fantastic with a simple-to-learn and hard-to-master style of gaming. After spending way too much time playing this game, I had discovered that while I had broken the 2 million point barrier, I had also broken my hand and was controlling Kung fury with my mind powers. While I had experienced some discomfort after getting past Kung Fury's 250,000 points on the leaderboard, I then felt a minor tingling sensation and found that I had not only been bitten by a cobra but also struck by lightning after being shot in a pool of battery acid. I should have known not to play like that but I read on the internet that it would improve my game and as we all know: if it's written on the internet it must be true.\n\nDoctors could have reattached my hand easily but I thought, "Why not go for cyborg hands?" So I did. I'm still learning how not to kill anything I hold with my new robo hand so I decided to type with my feet.\n\nSeriously, though, how do you not have a public leaderboard for a game like this?","July 12, 2015","true","36.7"," 80 of 102 people (78%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","78","80","102","85","1"

To start with, this is a two-button game. No I don't mean two buttons like Super Mario Brothers, I mean two buttons: left-attack and right-attack. Enemies approach from both sides, and all you have to do is press the corresponding button to kill them. Your goal? Get a high score. The average game of Kung Fury lasts a minute or two, and it requires only a few seconds to figure out how everything works.\n\nBut you want to know something? Despite it's simplistic nature, this is a pretty good game. Kung Fury is all about getting into The Zone and establishing a rhythm. You know about the The Zone right? It's that place you go to where you feel untouchable. It's like gliding in-between billions of bullets, shredding innumerable enemy forces, or in the case of this game, landing dozens if not hundreds of attacks with perfect accuracy at a rapid pace. This is a very focused game, so the simplest mistake is costly. You're only allowed three hits before death and each hit rips into your precious multiplier bonus. Worst of all, taking a hit pulls you out of The Zone. You're about to high-five zen and then suddenly...back to reality...and reality sucks hard.\n\nSince there are only two buttons, your efforts should be focused entirely on your enemies. There are multiple types, each requiring a certain number of attacks before they're killed. There aren't really any recovery frames, so you're free to hit the attack button as much as you want. Of course, if you miss an enemy, you're left wide open (this also depletes your multiplier). This is part of what being in The Zone is all about. You're constantly judging the effective distance of your attacks, the type of enemy, and keeping a mental count of the # of hits/button-presses required to dispatch them. Sometimes it helps to memorize specific button combinations, so you can pull them off immediately on particular enemies. Whatever the cases, this entire process must be handled at a constant rate, and you're given micro-seconds to breathe.\n\nIn my experience, this isn't a game that lends itself well to extended play. I usually play Kung Fury until I best my high-score, then move on to another game. While it sounds sensible to keep playing to further improve on that score, it's more effective to quit while I'm ahead. Due to the design of the game, there's a high chance I'll press one too many buttons, or slightly mis-judge the distance of that one enemy, and lose. Repeated failures will lead to burnout. My advice is that once you get that great run, stop, do a little fist pump, then play something else. This is a game you'll want to keep around, even if it's just to get that jolt of action to start your day off right.\n\nIt's fair to say that Kung Fury: Street Rage lacks in content, especially compared to the similarly-designed One Finger Death Punch. What you get for your 1.99 is a well-crafted action game with nice aesthetics. This is a quick-fix piece of disposable entertainment, with its long-term value hidden in acquiring high scores as well as giving your gaming-ability a serious workout. It's an altogether solid tie-in with the short movie (which is also entertaining, aside from a weak 2nd act).\n\nCheck it out sometime.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 22, 2015","true","1.3"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","32","34","5","0"

What was once just a simple survival score attack game, now has an arcade/story mode, and more playable characters! Either they had already planned to add more, or they listened to the fans and reviewers and gave us more, like playing as the other characters! Even getting the original actors is a huge bonus. Same great witty lines just like the movie.\n\nI never even knew they did this till I felt like playing this game again and saw it with my own eyes. Once again I suck at this game, but had a BLAST playing this again. Still love that damn smexy soundtrack.\n\nIn Arcade Mode, you progress by completing waves of enemies to get to the boss fight. I was skeptic on how the bosses would work, but they worked out real good. Instead of being stuck where you could only attack and not move, you move by holding the buttons, which you need to dodge the boss attacks before he becomes vulnerable to you spamming the attack button to lower its health bar. Very cool. As you complete the section, you get to play as another character and do it all over again, but each character plays a little different, and the boss fight being different as well.\n\nKung Fury plays your normal press a button to use your amazing kung fu skills to obliterate your enemies. Can take 3 hits before you die.\n\nHackerman was the hardest for me, and could not pass his level in arcade mode. You have a "HACKING" bar you have to fill up by targeting enemies till it fills up, then you can blast everyone at a distance with his hack gun, which kills everything in 1 or 2 hits. Can only take 2 hits before you die.\n\nBarbarianna is by far my favorite. She plays in a 5 hit combo style. Your first 4 hits are a melee and build up the combo, then your final 5 hit is the mini gun, which kills everything on which ever side of the screen you click on. Can only take 2 hits before you die.\n\nTriceracop plays much like Kung Fury, minus the kung fu and uses guns to shoot the enemies in the groin, but has slightly more range, and a lot more health. Can take 5 hits before you die.\n\n\nSome people claim that this got worse? They say that the controls are not as responsive as before, but honestly I didn't notice anything.\n\n\n\nIf this game wasn't a must buy before, it most definitely is now with the extra content, and for only $3! You can't go wrong with it.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?! DO IT! DO IT NOW!\n\n\n---------------------Original Review---------------------\n\nI tried to beat Kung Fury's Highscore... Couldn't even make 4th.\n\nIf you enjoyed One Finger Death Punch and enjoyed the Kung Fury short movie, this is a great pick up! The game is a little lacking in content, and I do have a few wishes to be added into the future.\n\n1. A character selection? Maybe let us play as the other characters that are standing in the back? It would be super cool to see different moves that the other characters could do.\n2. Let us buy the Soundtrack? I want this soundtrack in my life.\n\nOtherwise, fun game. I hope they improve on it and make it even better.","May 31, 2015","true","1.9"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","31","35","2","3"

This game is NOT for everyone, many will find it boring, repetitive, tedious, which it is...  With that said the game truly is a martial arts kung fu game of discipline for those who want a challenge.  There is no changing backdrop or level and not many enemy types watcha see in the previews on the store page is watcha get.  Being that the game is cheap and movie free, buy the game for you, for friends, family, its a good gift because people like gifts, the game works and its repetitive but its fun even for a hot minute which is really all that matters.\n\nFor those who accept the challenge to become a ninja, prepare to test those reflexes.  Gameplay is similar to one finger death punch where you only attack left and right.  Unlike OFDP, the player moves slightly meaning the attacks can be calculated by the player adding more strategery.  Also there is only attacking left and right, no special moves, nothing.  The goal is to get a high score.  Mastering this game is possible, the more its played the more discipline the player gets just like real kung fu the better they get at the game.  Try it out, when playing at first it feels boring, or annoying the score doesnt go up.  But just like Kung Fu the more its mastered, those scores keep going higher and HIGHER!\n\nKung Fury Tips:\n1.  Find the keyboard, mouse, or controller combo that works best for you.  Alot of keys, mouse buttons, and controller  functions all perform the attacks, find which are quickest for you to be a more effective super ninja.\n2.  Count the number of hits diff enemies take, memorize their move pattern like the white nazis.\n3.  Plan attacks ahead of time to keep track of hits in diff directions.\n4.  Do NOT let the enemies clutter one side then you cant tell how many hits to throw.  Stay focused as a Ninja, know where the enemy is to strike at them with FURY!\n\n(Buy this game to support the movie, who cares the price!)\nRating:  4/10  Value:  $1.99\n\n","August 6, 2015","true","6.0"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","27","35","2","1"

But, like those old arcade games, this one has something intriguing that will make you come back again and again.\n\nSo, what is it that makes the game interesting?

True, it is just a simplified "One Finger Death Punch" clone, but it's really brilliant in its own way. Kinda shows that there is not much need for graphics, lore or deep characters when planning to make an entertaining as well as motivating game.\n\nBasically, you just slaughter endless waves of enemies by pressing attack left or attack right. It's not even a "proper" beat 'em up since you cannot move on your own - instead hits kinda target and connect automatically (this can be kinda weird at times when a lot is going down, cause the game targets other enemies than you do as a player). It's really barebones and simplistic at first, but as soon as the game throws in enemies that can take more than one hit and switch sides upon getting attacked - this game suddenly opens up and becomes a whole lot less stupid. All of a sudden you realize that you gotta get into the rhythym of the fights and that there might be even some sort of tactics involved. Why is that? Because this game is all about score - in order to achieve a high score, you need to keep that combo going. How do you keep the combo up? By not messing up - basically meaning flawlessly murdering endless amounts of enemies until you got that 200 hit multiplier going. And let me tell you, getting high scores in this game feels REALLY GOOD! You might remember that scene from the first Matrix movie when Neo suddenly "gets it" and brushes off the attacks from the Agent? That moment is basically what Kung Fury: Street Rage is ALL THE TIME. You get that big ♥♥♥ multiplier and the BIG POINTS, you will feel like a right badass. Your hands start taking over and your brain takes the backseat and phases out while the screen explodes with red hot death and epilepsy-inducing flashes of white. This is what I dig about videogames.\n\nKung Fury is simplistic but challenging enough to be a worthy successor to glorious arcade games of the past and at just two measly bucks it is an absolute no-brainer. In just 4 hours I had more fun with this silly little movie-tie in-throw away-title than with a proper release by some big ole publisher.

The original game was a beautiful classic, a perfectly oiled machine.  That game isn't available anymore.  The best way I could describe it is, originally you had a PC game, and they replaced it with a mobile port version of the game.  How else can you explain the game running worse than it used to?   And I'm not talking about fps, I mean the game feels inferior while playing it.\n\nThe character you control doesn't handle as well as it once did, the game is not as fluid and responsive as it once was.  The character's perfect responsiveness to your button pressing was the whole point, and that was ruined.  These issues were really really bad when their big update first arrived and people reported and a lot of people including myself noted that we were unable to achieve scores even a quarter as high as we usually did due to poor control responsiveness and other odd shifts to gameplay.  The developers have been slowly trying to fix these issues piecemeal, but so far I still don't feel they have managed to completly repair what they broke.\n\nThere were a lot of calls for bringing back the original game, at least as a classic mode.  I notice that those forum posts appear to all be gone, though I don't know if they were deleted or simply are no longer accessible from being a couple months old.  Needless to say, all cries for a classic mode were ignored, and the developer passed out some free keys to some smartphone port game in hopes of silencing things.\n\nI paid money for a game and felt I had gotten more than my money's worth.  Then the developers took that game away and replaced it with something inferior, and while it's close, it's still deep in the uncanny valley.  I can't recommend to anyone what is still just a pale imitation of what was once here.","March 3","false","13.7"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","5"

Here is how the game adds depth: As you can probably guess it does so first off buy increasing the number of enemies coming at you from right and left, second of all, there is quite a variety in enemy types; Some simply need one or two hits to take down; other are more complicated. There are enemies that doge around so you need to quickly press the right direction. Missing makes you vulnerable, you slide forward out of position for a moment as you recover, unable to attack. Some enemies are metal, taking a lot of hits forcing you to focus on them and the other one hitters simultaneously. These are just a few examples as the game does a nice job with variety and there are more types than just those I listed. That was the most surprising part for me. On top of the cool music, and combo tracker, there is only one mode (which makes sense), and nice retro feel (they nailed art style and the cool feel when you load up the game and the announcer goes: 'KUNG FURY!').\nYou loose not because of BS but because you feel you really messed up on timing or because you panicked when seeing a tricky enemy combination and you spazzed out on the buttons, missing, and leaving yourself vulnerable. You have three hitpoints. I have not gotten far enough into the endless mode to see if you ever regain health. Lets find out together! Worth the price. Really fun and simple yet very deep game.\n\nADDED NOTE: The controls are basically hitting the arrows left or right or the keys (A,D), or the mouse keys. But you can combine to spread your hands out. Exampled: Use 'A' for left attack and use 'right arrow' for right attack. Which I like a lot","June 1, 2015","true","4.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

When I saw this game on Steam after justing watching Kung Fury (mind blowing btw) and saw that it appeared to be a homage to Double Dragon/Streets of Rage, I honestly couldn't click through the buying process fast enough. Then when the game started and I was greeted with the retro style Game Intro and Demo Mode, I knew this was going to be awesome. But then came the realisation that there are only two controls to this game, attack left or attack right. Fairly disappointing as I was expecting to be able to freely side scroll along the streets fighting bad guys, but once I'd got over that initial let down the game is still enjoyable. The gameplay is pretty addictive and the simple controls make it perfect to have an idle bash at when I need to kill some time.\n\nFor the price I paid for it I wouldn't say I feel ripped off by the game, although if any new content or further development did happen down the line then that would be appreciated (doubt it will happen).\n\nIf you're looking for a Beat'em Up in the purest sense of the term then this is your game.","May 31, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Story mode with waves and boss fights where you play as each of the 4 characters in turn. Expect memes and references from the 70's. I prefer this game to "One Finger Death Punch", it simplifies the formula even more, has far superior presentation, and lets you play as a female viking complete with bikini armour, battleaxe and minigun.\n\nYou should also check out the free movie, It's one of the best things ever.","May 21","true","1.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have two attacks - left and right. That's it. No movement, no special power ups. Just manage your attacks as best you can until your three lives run out, and hope you can make a dent on the High Score list.\n\nThe aesthetic is awesome - the game plays as if it were on an older arcade cabinet, complete with scanlines and slowdown. The music is nothing too great, but they did include a 16-bit version of one of the songs from the movie (the game's trailer plays it about 12 seconds in - its a good track!)\n\nThere's not much else here. Sadly its a shallow game at its core, but overall its a fun time-waster that will push you to reach first place, which is no easy feat. A great homage to games of past, and definitely a great way to spend a couple of bucks to support those who graced us with the Kung Fury movie.\n\nHere's to hoping for more games in the Kung Fury series. Well, I need to head back to the office. Looks like it's gonna be a hell of a lot of paperwork.","June 21, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Gameplay follows a formula similar to One Finger Death Punch except much more simplified and with a smaller variety of enemies and with a very fitting 80’s arcade game cabinet look and feel. You’re probably only going to get an hour or two tops out of KF: Street Rage, but for only $2 it’s well worth picking up and much cheaper than if you were to play it in an arcade.\n","November 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Still the game turned out to be actually pretty fun albeit a bit barren in terms of modes and gameplay in general. Basically it's a One Finger Death Punch clone but without the cool campaign mode... or the online leaderboards... or the nifty power ups and upgrades... yeah, its as barren as it gets (I don't think there is even a way to customize the controls or even use a gamepad).\n\nStill the 80s vibes are awesome, the music is pretty rad, and of course you get to be Kung Fury, the best renegade cop of the last 30 years.\n\nGameplay wise, if you haven't played One Finger Death Punch, the game is quite simple. You have a left side attack and a right side attack. Enemies come from both sides and you have to kill them before they hit you. Three hits and you are dead. Simple as that but quite addicting, especially in small dosages.\n\nGiven the price of admission, give the game a chance.

Its mechanics are similar to OFDP, with the exception that the attack area is not visible. The addition of a story mode and extra characters really revived this game, that until December 3rd only had endless mode. All these features, along with the FREE short-film, make this game a must-have on PC. Why on PC? Because it has a mobile version too, for free. But the story and character expansions are way too expensive than the PC, not recommending it. The only downside is that the story is kinda short, and it only has friend leaderboards. Leaving that aside, I'd definitely recommend this game 10/10.

So addictive, so basic, so much fun!

And when it comes down to it there are elements like timing and understanding enemy movements that bring the game out of the "too simple" realm.  In fact the game is rather difficult.

You feel like playing on an 80s arcade machine. Even the quitting menu looks like a BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) and I very much appreciate this level of detail!.\n\nBUT unlike OFDP it gets a lot more confusing a lot faster. With time there are spawning so many enemies that are running up to you that your character gets kinda buried under all the kill animations and you loose track of him which in turn gets you hit.\n\nI like the game though. In my opinion it's worth the money and at the same time you support the makers of the awesome movie. So it's a double win in my book but if you found OFDP already confusing and repetitive this game might not be for you.\n\nEdit: After playing it more I have to say that it's WAY more frustrating than OFDP. Can't play for too long in one session as I'm definitely gonna break something at some point.","May 31, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's also a shame there just seems to be the one stage...but again, it's only like 2 bucks (Give or take ;) )\n\nEDIT: Well the game has been a big update (And I was pleased to get the updates without having to purchase them as a DLC, props for that!). Not only did that they three new playable characters from the film (Barbariana, Hackerman and Triceracop) but they also added a story mode.\n\nSo I've not been able to get past the 2nd stage of the story mode, but I only just started today.

This wouldn't be a problem if it would allow me to mute the music without muting the whole game under volume mixer. Yes I did say the music is great, but I still would like to listen to some of my own music while playing this.\n-The flow of the game isn't as good as OFDP. When ever you attack it sometimes feels like your character is frozen for a split second but the enemies can still move.(This might just be me from the conditioning OFDP has put into me)\n-Less content than OFDP\n\nIf OFDP was a 10/10 (WHICH IT ISN'T) Kung Fury: Street Rage would be a good 7/10 compared to it. So take what you think of what you would rank OFDP and do the math I'm too lazy to tell you how to do.\n\nIf you are looking for a game like this I suggest getting OFDP over this. Only if you are going to put more than an hour or two into the game. If you're only planning on playing it a couple times a month at max I highly recommend you buy Kung Fury: Street Rage instead.","June 10, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","2"

It does nearly everything better (save story), but since gameplay is king, this just doesn't quite cut it.\n\nThe pacing is very slow at first, and since the punishment is harsh for failure (back to the start of the wave!) get ready to lose your traction a lot.\n\nThe 'hit zone' for where you won't miss isn't clearly marked, so you'll whiff until you decide to just punch enemies as soon as they touch you.\n\nGot as far as the first boss battle, which suddenly and under duress introduces the new mechanic of movement, so suddenly that which caused failure (pressing buttons at the wrong time) is necessary to win. Muddied an already squishy gameflow.\n\nEnemies also approach you in weird ways, so you end up missing sometimes when they decide to possibly change sides(?) behind you.  After getting to the Barbarian (Stage 2), and getting repeatedly disheartened by the pacing, quit and went to OFDP, and suddenly found everything that was missing in this game.","February 16","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It is now insanely hilarious! I would now call this a more complete game compared to before. Is it worth full price? HELL YES! The developer really should be supported in this case. I mean they could have done something like many other publishers, like releasing the characters as separate purchaseable DLC, but they did not. So this game is a MUST BUY!\n\nEDIT 2015-06-10\n\nLike some others, I initially bought this game only to show my appreciation for the free and awesome movie. But man, if you haven't played a game of this genre/mechanics before you might be in for an @ss whopping surprise ... literally. In fact I counted my @ss being handed down to me over 650 times.\n\nSo you're playing on this street with Hitler's henchmen coming in at you left and right. You just so happen to have only two buttons to press to defend yourself ... left and right arrow keys. But there is an incredible amount of things to learn from button combo's to timing presses. So it goes something like this:\n\nGas Masked Soldier = 1 hit\nArian Moustache Guy = 2 hits\nShaolin Chick = 3 hits (left, right left OR right left right)\nMechanical Robot = 4 hits\nRed Ninja = WTF??? Major distraction!\n\nIn essence the game overall is addictive. Even the music is as addictive as Hotline Miami's soundtrack. It's also great in the way that it's a game you can just load up and play with each round lasting (for me) about 2 mins and then exit it really quickly. It isn't feature rich like with options, but that isn't a problem imho. One of the best $2 I've spent.\n\nNow I feel like I have to justify myself, this recommendation is a testimonial to say I must stop playing because it's addictive. It's important to make that distinction. I'm not playing for scores :D I never did. My highest personal expectations was left back from 40,000 to 70,000.

It is now insanely hilarious! I would now call this a more complete game compared to before. Is it worth full price? HELL YES! The developer really should be supported in this case. I mean they could have done something like many other publishers, like releasing the characters as separate purchaseable DLC, but they did not. So this game is a MUST BUY!\n\nEDIT 2015-06-10\n\nLike some others, I initially bought this game only to show my appreciation for the free and awesome movie. But man, if you haven't played a game of this genre/mechanics before you might be in for an @ss whopping surprise ... literally. In fact I counted my @ss being handed down to me over 650 times.\n\nSo you're playing on this street with Hitler's henchmen coming in at you left and right. You just so happen to have only two buttons to press to defend yourself ... left and right arrow keys. But there is an incredible amount of things to learn from button combo's to timing presses. So it goes something like this:\n\nGas Masked Soldier = 1 hit\nArian Moustache Guy = 2 hits\nShaolin Chick = 3 hits (left, right left OR right left right)\nMechanical Robot = 4 hits\nRed Ninja = WTF??? Major distraction!\n\nIn essence the game overall is addictive. Even the music is as addictive as Hotline Miami's soundtrack. It's also great in the way that it's a game you can just load up and play with each round lasting (for me) about 2 mins and then exit it really quickly. It isn't feature rich like with options, but that isn't a problem imho. One of the best $2 I've spent.\n\nNow I feel like I have to justify myself, this recommendation is a testimonial to say I must stop playing because it's addictive. It's important to make that distinction. I'm not playing for scores :D I never did. My highest personal expectations was left back from 40,000 to 70,000. Having said that I'd like to point to another recommendation: sauce recommends","June 9, 2015","true","24.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","2"

And i also thought this could be fun game. At first it is fun to pile through enemies right and left (there is only two buttons in this game, same as arcade machines). But after trying like 10 times the story mode (and getting a pretty high score in the endless mode) i can't go by the same spot and can't progress through the story (if there is one). It is just gets too hard very fast. yeah, i'm that bad at quickly bashing two buttons apparently. But i hate games (no matter how simple they are) which pump the difficulty so high in the beginning of a game (and what's next? i won't be able to finish it anyway probably). So, can't recommend it.

How does it play? It plays like one of those dance rythm games at the arcade where you need to step on the arrows as they fall, except with a bit of a twist. Only 2 buttons instead of 4 or 8, and enemies instead of falling arrows. But the different 'types' of enemiesis what makes it interesting. Because of the different enemies the game goes from being "hit (direction) button as enemy approaches" to being "read the situation and handle it accordingly". You really start having to think how you need to handle different combinations of enemies as they approach and pulling off a large combo and getting a high score feels really satisfying.\n\nBUT: the range of your attacks feels too short at times and it feels overly punishing, and I swear the female Nazis glitch and attack faster in certain situations.

Low budget turned from the weakness into the strongest point of the project. No one really expected much from Kung Fury, so he director didn't even try to compete against Hollywood, etc. His production is on completly diffrent level and that's why it was successfull. Same thing here. They couldn't make another Witcher, so they took one, simple gameplay mechanic and focussed on it. In the result we have small, simple and cheap game which is addicting as hell AND....\n... worth recommendation. :)\n\nPS.

There's literally two buttons, and those are used to attack on either side of you when enemies get in your range. The more attacks you do without missing or getting hit, the more delicious points you rack up. Simple stuff.\n\nExcept not really.\n\nEnemies start off hilariously easy. You'll be punching through time travelling nazi skulls like cake at the beginning. Soon enough one punch won't take down certain enemies. Then certain enemies will teleport on the other side of you, so you'll need to respond with a sweet roundhouse, then punch them again when they teleport once more. Then you'll fight robots that take a ton of hits. Then you'll fight kung fu masters who teleport like four times! It just adds onto the insanity that is Kung Fury.\n\nSoon enough you'll start being a kung fu master. You'll learn the combos to take down each enemy, executing them in half-second and you watch yourself tear through each enemy. You'll be so aware on what's on both sides of you you'll grow a third eye just to watch your character punch, kick, shoot, and deliver justice to each and every last enemy.\n\nOnce you take your three hits, you start over and try to beat your scores. I keep coming back for mor justice delivering each time.\n\nTL;DR: It's like One Finger Death Punch but with better style and a super rad soundtrack.","June 12, 2015","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Timing is everything to this game, from kickass combos to the survival of you character. A very fun game to deserves a recommendation despite it's flaws.

To get a really high score you'd think you could kinda cheat but just staying clear of danger with your misses by even with that you would have to memorize the direction you would need to miss on what enemy, so your better of just remembering the combination of button presses/directions you need to defeat each enemy, and even with that, you need to get the timing down.  After five to ten mins my best score was about 12k, when I tried to cheat the system and button mash, my best score was around 7k.

"One Finger Death Punch" style: 1 button to attack on right, 1 button to attack on left. Some enemies takes more than a hit to be killed and you need to be synchronized to do combo chains. The game is very hard, you can only take 3 hits and enemies are fast and numerous.\n\nInteresting layout: you fight nazis/kung-fu nazis/ kung-fu nazis robots and it's with an arcade machine style. The music is great.\n\nThe game has a short life span (1 endless mode) but frankly i'm glad to give my money for such an amazing movie.\n\nCan't wait another one, closer to the movie !\n\n\nN.B: Maybe they could have done something deeper/better.

Surprisingly highly addictive trying to beat my record and master it as it speeds up.\n\nWhat did I like about this?  Firstly, it captures the look and feel of games I played in my childhood.  Looks, sounds and feels like an old-school arcade game.  Music, design, moves... everything.  Well crafted to recreate the experience.  For the whole Kung Fury experience (movie and promotions) their attention to detail, design, look and feel is phenomenal.\n\nCool dodgy 80's arcade music, combos, timing and the greatest cop of all time... it's a lot of fun.  And for the price... anyone who complains should take a long hard look at what value they bring to the world.  These guys have brought the past back to life for the same cost of a quick arcade game.  Fun, fast and yeah.  It's a basic arcade button, masher, combo and timing driven game.  For any child of the 80's it's a must!\n\nIt's awesome.  I love it and have had a ton of fun with it.  This is my first review on Steam because I want to support these guys for delivering an innovative passion project to the world.\n\nSo if you're thinking about it, just do it.

They did a great job here. What sold me on this one was how gameplay rewards quick decision-making, punishes redudant mashing of buttons and the beguiling depth in quickly assessing the opposition in terms of "how-many-hits-to-bring-em'-down", mixing it up and keeping it fresh with gradually introducing more advanced enemy-patterns as you reach for higher scores.\n\nIn short, bang for your buck (especially seeing it only costs you a wooden nickel).\nGIT EET NAO.","May 31, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Upon some pondering I decided to get it and for my 90 eurocents (the rest was covered by my Steam Wallet) I am quite satisfied! The experience is quite fluid from the start to the beginning - no annoying and endless company logos at the beginning, you can jump into the game with a simple click and get down to business - no tutorial, just "figure it out as you go" approach. I like that as this the game you want to play, when you have like a 5 minute break from something and get pumped by adrenaline-filled gameplay, groovy music, and satisfying visuals and sound. Yes, there is not much content and that is the biggest disadvantage as it leaves you hungry for more - more moves, more characters to play, more enemies, more backdrops etc. But...for 2 euros/dollars it is a steal, especially if you like the movie that is free... In a sense, you might see it as a tip for seeing the movie :)","June 1, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There is no tutorial, it simply drops you into the game and you are expected to learn as you play. Luckily, it's only two buttons (your mouse), so even if one has never played OFDP, it's extraordinarily simple to understand. Like its predecessor, KF: SR is very easy to get, but difficult to master, and this provides a short game with a little more replayability, as well as the radical high score table.\n\nLike the movie it's based on, Kung Fury: Street Rage is short, but so sweet. I very highly recommend it, even if you haven't played One Finger Death Punch. Especially if you haven't played One Finger Death Punch. It's an arcade-sized romp that is too fun to pass up.","June 10, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's about all you really need to know about the game itself. I loved One Finger Death Punch, so why am I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about this one?\n\nThe. Controls. Don't. Work.\n\nI know, that sounds ♥♥♥♥ing impossible in a game that uses two buttons, but they don't work! I just installed the game and I can only make Kung Fury attack to the right. I can also only go down in the menus, not up, and they don't wrap around. I've tried every key on my K70 and nothing works.\n\nWhat's that? Change the bindings at the options  screen? There isn't one! (There might be one hiding somewhere that you need an up arrow to get to, but the main menu has no options.) No graphics options, no control options, nothing. So for my money I basically have a two button game where only one button works. Amazing. Utterly astonishing. I'm a programmer by trade - how inept, lazy or non-existent does your QA team have to be that you can't get the left arrow key working in a game that only uses the arrow keys??\n\nI Googled it, others were having the problem, and they were told to wait for a patch. That was nearly a year ago, and naturally the topic has now been locked because trying to get developer support for your games on Steam is like trying to ♥♥♥♥ a spinning fan.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game, go buy One Finger Death Punch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/storminator16/recommended/373180/","storminator16","storminator16","http://steamcommunity.com/id/storminator16/","526 products in account","A lot of effort was taken by the Swedish developer to make a game that harken back to our arcade playing days, even capped by a 30 minute, super cheesy 80s inspired "movie" that accompanies this affair.  A fine presentation is there to entice you to believe this game is going to be an enjoyable experience, much like Far Cry Blood Dragon.  However, the movie and game starts out great but whimpers by the time I realized "oh, this has gone on too long".  A lot seem to enjoy the simple game play but it's too simple and forces the game to lack any depth whatsoever.  Too much time was spent on presentation with the lack of trying to make a decent game.  Instead of going with a tried and true formula, the game goes with a 2 button masher for moving left/right w/attacking at the same time.  Not sure why moving UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT plus 1 button attack and 1 button for jumping couldn't have been part of this game's equation.\n\nI can't recommend this even at the cheap price.  Again, too much spent on presentation but there isn't much of a game worth playing here.  I would 99% never dismiss a game at this low price point but this game wasn't what I expected.  Hoping this review keeps anyone from making the same mistake.","July 23, 2015","false","0.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","5"

Considering its catchy title, its based on a movie called "Kung Fury," which you're better off watching instead. See that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg\n\nThe graphics and music are very enjoyable and resemble a lot of cheesy 80s flare. The 1 downside that hurts the game's replay factor, is its controls. Enemies come at you from left and right. And you fight them by pushing the control stick towards them. You have no control over the moves you make and the enemies get rediculously harder in a very short amount of time. This all leads to a lot of cheap deaths and dozens of rage quits.\n\nThere isn't much to this game aside from an interesting premise leading up to believe that this game will be an beat 'em up. But when the game actually came out. We're given an awful stick fighter game.  Avoid this game at all costs. Just because its cheap on Steam, doesn't mean its worth it. You're better off playing better games that use their potential well, like Final Fight and Streets of Rage. Heck, watching the Kung Fury movie is bette than this. 2.5/10","September 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebitingcat/recommended/373180/","thebitingcat","thebitingcat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebitingcat/","75 products in account","Updated for Arcade Strikes Back: Story mode, voiced by the original cast with new dialogue, and a plotline! It's no longer just going for the high score! New characters to fight with - Barbarianna, who can clear a side with the chain gun every 5 hits, which is awesome; Hackerman, whose ranged weapon knocks back as it charges for a continuous double-damage combo (which often results in wild flailing back and forth as the most effective means of combat); and Triceracop, who...um...seems broken.\n\nYou see, Triceracop uses his trademark crotch shot method of attack...with guns...that has the effective range of Kung Fury's normal attacks. I don't know, maybe he's going for a 100% shot to crotch ratio or something and relies on a close range target... However, the guns have a knockback to them, pushing Triceracop backwards. This is fine, until you encounter the wave of kung-fu women who swap sides when hit. The knockback is strong enough to where you can shoot three times in the same direction and still hit them, but not 100% reliably; and you can still alternate your shot directions to hit them... but not 100% reliably. So when the wave of 8 of these women show up (with 2 robot legs) somewhere around the 3rd wave, if your recoil pushes you to the other side of one of these women and your combo breaks, you get stunned, take a hit, and are suddenly surrounded by multiple women (normally a good problem to have) each one having the potential to break your combo if your recoil puts you in the wrong spot to hit, forcing you to take another hit. The game generously provides Triceracop with more hearts than any other character in the game, which makes it feel like the designers were aware the game mechanic caused unavoidable hits.\n\nOriginal Review below:\n\nWatch the short film, then get the game. The movie is 20 minutes of your life well spent. If you play the game 8 times it pays for itself. I mean, arcade games still cost a quarter per credit, right? A genuine arcade feel to this beat-em-up, with surprisingly in-depth technique for a game that uses only 2 buttons. It's a sort of rhythm of the battle thing - go too fast for the action and you'll end up missing the next enemy and take a hit; go too slow and you'll be surrounded quickly and take a hit. The rhythm fluctuates with the density of enemies and their health. You must be the master of the rhythm of the battle if you want the high score. Wait for the enemy to approach, then buffer your inputs so that no time is wasted preparing for the next enemy. Also digging that retrowave soundtrack.","May 29, 2015","true","8.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In case you didnt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS5P_LAqiVg < Watch it here first before reading forward).\n\nNext to this you can easy compare the gameplay with "One Finger Death Punch" to be honest (you actually can even use left/right mouse to attack and not only left right arrow keys) just as arcade version.\n\nThe game self is not bad made really, you can play it more or less (like the real old 80s arcade games) just for fun in the break times. Its also pretty difficult and also fun to play, Yea it is even harder than One Finger Death Punch.\n\nBut why i gave it a down vote?\n\nIts not really that the game is that bad really and i even guess with 2$ its a fair price if you play it "just for fun" (just to compare: One Finger Death Punch are 5$ and has more stuff inside wile Kung Fury are 2$ and is more a weaker (but harder) version of One Finger Death Punch...).\n\nThe big problem i really think is that this game doesnt live up the expectations of the movie it is really based on. Just using the left and right button is not that "cool" like in the movie even if the animations are well made, after some minutes you will also see it maybe gives not more than 5-6 attack animation-loops.\n\nIf they really would be live up the expectations of the movie, they could do it better and make, at least, a more "Streets of Rage" or "double dragon" styled game play (if they wanna stay in retro-like beat´n up games).\n\nAs i said, its not a bad voting coz its a bad game, its a bad voting coz this game doesnt live up the expectations...\n\nI maybe will still play it sometimes if i like to but honestly, to live up the expectations from the movie they should do a better game...\n\nSmall edit:\nI also got some messages about "how can i dare to write that review":\nHonestly guys, right now the movie will be hyped like hell (which means not its a bad movie but what is maybe 3 month from now on later huh?) and everyone says "this movie is cool!", looking on steam, they made a game, bought it and maybe play it only 20 minutes. Thats it.

I guess? The point is, there's not much meat to the game, and no reason to play more than once for about 10 or 15 mins, because by then you have experienced all the game has to offer.\n\nThere's no incentive to play any longer, at least if the game had cards, you might find a reason to stay in it, but there's not even that.\n\nOne could argue that the game is cheap, and thus not worth complaining about. I of course could respond that at any given time, there is a game on steam cheaper than this and far more enjoyable.

Much like OFDP, you start out fighting some basic enemies who only take one hit, and then mix in other enemies who take multiple hits and occasionally dodge to the other side.\n\nThe problem is, I'm not entirely sure the developers ever played OFDP - or if they did, they didn't take the time to understand what made OFDP nearly perfect.\n\nSee, the key insight that OFDP had is that there's a rhythm to kung-fu fights; there's an ebb and flow, a flurry of action followed by a moment of quiet. This game doesn't have any of that; it goes at the exact same rhythm forever.\n\nAnd that's completely aside from the fact that One Finger Death Punch took the concept significantly further than this game has, with unlockable skills, weapons, boss fights, and special attacks that send you leaping across the battlefield.\n\nIf you already own One Finger Death Punch and want to know how this game is different, go play Blind Survival mode with no skills enabled, then:\n\nPretend there's no weapons\nPretend there's no boss fights\nPretend the game refuses to be played in a window\nPretend the screen flashes on every single strike, which honestly made me feel kinda sick\nPretend there's no casual racism (which is probably the only upside)\nAnd you'll have an idea of what this game is like.\n\nI'm not saying this due to some misguided idea that this game is "ripping off" OFDP - I'm actually very happy that another game's picked up on the ingenious mechanic. I'm just disappointed that this game is strictly worse than One Finger Death Punch.","May 28, 2015","false","1.1"," 13 of 47 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","13","47","0","2"

Similar style.\nTwo-button side-scrolling combat game here.  Press one button to attack an enemy on your left, press the other button to attack to the right.  That's it.\nSimple?  Yep.\nEasy?  Nope.\nThe whole point is to build up your combo attack chain as high as possible to get the high score and clear the level.  If you miss, your combo chain resets to zero AND you leave yourself open to an attack.  If you get hit, you lose health and your combo chain resets to zero.  You need Jedi-like reflexes to do well with this game.  I can't even get past the second set of levels (where you play as the bad-♥♥♥ Viking babe).  You will automatically switch characters every few levels.  Each character has slightly different attack animations, but the gameplay remains the same throughout.\nCharacter and level design are based on the short film "Kung Fury" which I highly suggest you watch.  You don't need to know the story to play this game, but the movie is a really funny spoof that pokes fun at everything from the 1980's.","March 15","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this, loved it, saw that it was a clone of One Finger Death Punch, bought and played that, came back to this shortly after. I found this much more satisfying. Much more satisfying death animations. It's more simplified but relies more on memorization of the different enemies than on reading their characteristics on the fly, allowing you to much better mix a large number of enemies into a single flow without taking damage, which is important since you can only take 2-3 hits before game over. If you think One Finger Death Punch is a little over-complicated at times, you'll find this one very addictive.","February 16","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not sure but I believe the objective is pretty much to score a long string of combo attacks so you can get a high point score. Think about the part in the movie where the hero fights a bunch of Nazis although your in a  street enviornment it pretty much is that scene relived in a street setting. The controls are beyond basic 1 button left another button right attack. I hate that you can't move at all unless you punch. You pretty much punch back and forth to move. You get 3 hits & you die. It's kind of cool but I get bored of left right left right attacks and just end up quitting the game after I die a few times. Hey it helps pass the time it was a cheap game that emulates the Arcade feel in a way. It's a good way to support the movie & pass some time. All in all I wish something would happen like getting an extra life, new enemies after some combos scores, or some type of reward for having a long string of combos. It's a never ending brawl the same Enemies come at you non stop enjoy :)\n\nEnemies\nI've only seen three Enemies\nNazis in mass amount die in 1 hit\nBlond Nazi dies in 2 hits\nSome nurse looking girl in white reappears behind you after 1 hit to counter you from behind\nMore show up as your score goes up\n\nI hope they expand it in an update I so wish it can be fun but I wish there was a way to have more levels with different enemies or high scores should earn you more life a full life bar something... it seems pointless because your not really fighting for anything other than combos that just get your name on a score board. Like I said its good for passing the time I just challenge myself to try & see how long I can get a string of combos to go without missing or dying. I'll play the game for like 10-40mins on average. It's just 1 unbeatable level punch back and forth until you die thats it. I don't regret buying it at all I just have a short attention span with it but I'm glad it supports the movie with the revenue.","June 20, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CAIDENROX/recommended/373180/","CAIDENROX","[IS™] Ninja Brian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CAIDENROX/","149 products in account","This game is based on one of the greatest non-serious movies I have ever seen and is also one of the greatest games I have ever played. Gameplay breaks down into two buttons; left mouse (or arrow) and right mouse (or arrow), even though it is so simplistic, the execution is perfect. All you are doing is killing Nazi's with your fists but it gets more complex as you play for example, the most common enemy is a Nazi wearing a gas mask, they die in one hit so they are easy to kill. Next up is a Nazi with blonde hair, they take two hits instead of one. After that you have Nazi women - and once they are in the mix, ♥♥♥♥ goes down - they take three hits to kill but, once you hit them they quickly teleport behind you meaning if you hit them from the right, they end up on your left ready to attack so, you must react quickly to hit them again by switching sides but, like I said before, they take three hits so, they will end up behind you again. After the women comes the Nazi Robots. They take four hits but, if you are not quick to destroy them, they will jump back and gang up with other enemies. There is no other strategy against them except to kill them as quickly as possible. The last enemy I have encountered is a Red Ninja and he is special because he is a robot and a woman combined meaning when you hit him, he will teleport behind you and on the second hit, he will jump back and gang up with other enemies.  The Red Ninja takes five hits and he kills me everytime I face him. In order to make this game more challenging, the developers added a health system for you, you have three hit points and no way to regenerate them (at least not from what I have seen). The entire point of this game is to get the highest score possible and it is a challenge to even get onto the leaderboard. If you like beat em ups with simple controls and want a challenge, buy this game now.","December 1, 2015","true","17.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Similar style.\nTwo-button side-scrolling combat game here.  Press one button to attack an enemy on your left, press the other button to attack to the right.  That's it.\nSimple?  Yep.\nEasy?  Nope.\nThe whole point is to build up your combo attack chain as high as possible to get the high score and clear the level.  If you miss, your combo chain resets to zero AND you leave yourself open to an attack.  If you get hit, you lose health and your combo chain resets to zero.  You need Jedi-like reflexes to do well with this game.  I can't even get past the second set of levels (where you play as the bad-♥♥♥ Viking babe).  You will automatically switch characters every few levels.  Each character has slightly different attack animations, but the gameplay remains the same throughout.\nCharacter and level design are based on the short film "Kung Fury" which I highly suggest you watch.  You don't need to know the story to play this game, but the movie is a really funny spoof that pokes fun at everything from the 1980's.","March 15","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is fun.\n\nKung Fury did what it set out to do pretty handily and that was to spoof over-the-top 80's action movies.  And they made it free to watch!  So what more can you do to support these people?  Why not throw a couple dollars their way and get this cool 80's coin-op spoof as an added bonus.\n\nOn the surface, the sprites, backgrounds, and effects are spot-on, easily taking me back to Battletoads or Double Dragon and things of the like.\n\nThe controls and gameplay are super simple and the action can get overwhelming.  I'm admittedly not that good, but the Hi-scores give me a solid challenge to constantly ram my face into like a brick wall.\n\nSince I bought this game, they recently added three more playable characters, each with their own playstyle, and a story mode (complete with boss battles) with spoken dialogue that's every bit as humorously poorly delivered and written as the movie (and it seems like they retained their original voice actors, or at least really good sound-alikes).  Definitely good for a laugh.\n\nIf you enjoy admittedly stupid humor and/or pushing the limits against all odds for that high-scoring run, I'll highly suggest Kung Fury: Street Rage.","December 10, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wholeheartedly recommend purchase of this game, the devs listened and expanded the gameplay and it is now SO worth the price.\n\nMy review marks this game as recommended, but there's a qualifier. It's only recommended if you want to support the fantastic people at Laser Unicorns who released an awesome free movie. If you have not watched Kung Fury, go check it out.\n\nNow, about this game...\n\nI own One Finger Death Punch and the mechanics in this game are the same. Unfortunately, this game has many flaws compared to OFDP, but priced at 2$ and done in retro arcade style. I know if I had seen this in an arcade I probably would have dumped 2$ into it and not been able to take the cabinet home. Having said that, quick list of pros and cons.\n\nPros\n- Based on Kung Fury.\n- Supports Laser Unicorns.\n- Reasonably priced.\n- Easy to learn.\n- Good retro style graphics/music.\n\nCons\n- No reach indicator. (No indicator at all when/if enemies are within range of attack)\n- No consistency when hitting enemies (may hit other enemies if they move too close, messing up combos)\n- Too short of a "next attack" window (OFDP does this well, when you kill an enemy you have a brief slowdown to attack next enemy, KF:SR has little to no next attack window)\n- Flash on hit (distracting)\n- Multiplier based scoring, with punishing drops in multiplier for misses and taking damage.\n- No variety, what you see on title screen is entirety of game.\n\nWith those cons, the game doesn't amount to something I would recommend, but at its price point and given that it supports Laser Unicorns, I do recommend it to anyone who really enjoyed the movie and would like to support the creators. Just don't expect a lot of fun in this title.","August 17, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You mean just like tetris, pacman and many many other games that opened the doors for whatever we have today? This is precisely what this game is, in my opinion, a door opener.\n\nBoth the game and the movie are helping to light the path for the creative minds that do not have deep pockets but still want to bet in their creations and may or may not be afraid to poke their heads out to take the bullet. This game indeed does not have much content to offer, but I look at my purchase like an investment for possible future content to be created. Who knows? Other playable characters, new moves, game modes and, my personal favorite, another game in the future, classic side scrolling beat'em up where I may play as triceracop and shoot people in the balls and call Thor and his epic pecs to annihilate nazis as a special.\n\nIt's a cheap game that may give you quite some time of fun and that sends a message to the creators of Kung Fury and everyone behind the production of the movie and this game: Go ahead, brothers and sisters, keep on working, I'm interested in what you're creating, go ahead and give me more.

You should buy that instead.  It has better mechanics and less bugs.\n\nMore In-Depth Review\n\nTake One-Finger Death Punch.  Now remove about 75% of it, and replace stick-men with sprites that have 3-4 attacks in total each.  What you've got left is Kung Fury: Street Rage.  It's not even really graphically superior because of that broken old arcade-machine look they implemented, which gives me more eyestrain than nostalgia.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch lets you configure your fighter by selecting 3 skills from a large selection and they all impact the game significantly.  There are also a variety of enemies with different abilities.\n\nKung Fury: Street Rage has 4 characters.  One standard (no abilities but is the best because said abilities are janky), and then three others with two things that set them apart.  So already a lot less selection than OFDP in terms of variety.  For the most part, you're going to want to stick with the standard as the other three have either crippled health, mechanics that can throw off your rhythm, or both.  Your enemy selection is down to 5 types - standard 1 hit, standard 2 hit, 3-hit dodger, stanard 4 hit, and one guy that takes 5 with a different pattern.  Compare to OFDP which also has a 4-hit dodger, 4 hit standard, brawler, type-switching boss, wackloads of special moves, and a  variety of distinct styles of play.\n\nOFDP has helpful guides and information on its screen.  Kung Fury does not.\n\nOFDP has some really nice musical tracks.  Kung Fury does not.\n\nThe only thing that Kung Fury has that OFDP doesn't is a unique boss mode, and that's implemented so poorly it's not a positive thing.  While the core of OFDP is about elminiating positioning and button mashing in favour of precise timing, the boss mode suddenly has you moving about and mashing buttons to survive... but the collisions aren't handled well at all (which is terrible considering the whole 2-button game play is about precision) and the last boss fight was prone to bugging out.\n\nAll this could be forgiven if it weren't for the fact that OFDP is already a bargain at full price and offers a lot more game.  By itself it isn't terrible, but considering there's already a game out there that does everything this one except it does it better, bigger and came out first... just get OFDP.  Street Rage won't offer any new experiences.","January 8","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You need to press Enter on your keyboard for any choice you make. This needs to be corrected on the store page.\n\nThe game itself is just OK. I loved the movie and thought I should support them by buying their game. I knew what kind of game it was beforehand but I thought it would be a bit better. It's very simple in its gameplay and it's quite hard to play more than a minute or two before starting over. Graphics are good enough and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI would have given this game a 6/10 if it were not for the false information that this game has full controller support. Because it's not labelled right, I give this game a 4/10.\n\nAt 1$ while on sale it's ok but it's not worth more than that.","January 10","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not cool, but still a nice game.","February 5","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
