Have a max lv toon and here are the basics about this game\n\nPros:\n\n- Aesthetically pleasing. the game looks nice and has a large variety of monsters\n\n- Engaging combat. Its a lot of fun and quite challenging in later levels\n\n- Plenty of Variety in the game as well\n\n- Dozens upon dozens of awesome mounts!\n\nCons:\n\n-Horribly Unbalanced. Cleric is god in PvE. they have the highest damage out of anyone by an absurd amount AND they are the best healers in the game. And certain builds for PVP just laugh at everyone else since they can 1 shot other players with spammable skills. there is no balance nor will it be a thing anytime soon.\n\n-Daily Limits kill the variety. The game has a ton of variety but because of the daily limit ON EVERYTHING *there is 1000 mob kill limit on a map and 3-5 instance limit* it makes the "variety" feel a lot smaller then it really is.\n\n-Incredibly boring grind for last quarter of the game. Do you like killing about 30 bosses and 1000+ enemies and doing about 50 quests for a whopping 10% xp? well thats too bad. since if you want to lv in a reasonable amount of time thats how your daily grind will be.\n\n-Need to abuse the Auction House or Pay real money to be able to afford half the features. A lot of the stuff on here is not cheap and sadly quests/mobs don't give nearly enough to afford any of them. So you are left praying that one of the bosses you kill for your daily limit drop a rare drop which you can sell for 3x what you will earn doing every non repeatable quest in the game\n\n-End game PvP is awful if you do not play hardcore everyday/pay real money for upgrades. there will be many times where you join PVP only to have your entire group 1 shotted the second they pop out of the teleporter with pretty much nothing you can do about it.\n\n-Stuck with starter pet foreeeever. By the time I hit lv cap i wasn't even halfway to unlocking a different class with your little pet. so unless you pay real money don't read the pet customization because that will be dissappointment.\n\n\n\noverall its a really cute fun action MMO. but while it is chock full of what seem like awesome features the more you play the more you realize that almost all features are average/below average at best and its entire package just comes to a MMO that tries to do a bunch of stuff but doesn't do it any better then many of the MMO's out there","December 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 604 of 784 people (77%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","77","604","784","38","27"

I was wrong.. this game is super fun, catching a bunch of these dragons things, monsters, they are pretty cool! I think this game is fun but there are some problems i can point out that I hope the dev team fixes..\n\nPros:\nDoesn't drain your bank account\nAddicting gameplay\nSo many mounts and monsters to capture\nAlot of missions, gear, areas, to get, and explore.\nThere are many many more things I can point out on the pros, but lets get to the cons..\n\nCons:\nShadows that are buggy, they appear for 1 second and dont, they just keep going on and off, it is very annoying to look at while playing.\nAlso, buggy graphics, you can sometimes see throught the map.\nI do play on full max graphics and get great frames but the graphics bug my eyes because of the unpolished graphics.\nAlso, map is buggy, it is also choppy, <-- (i would make it smooth)\nThe entire hub, or shop area is full of spammers in the chat, people just spamming websites.\nThere are a few nit picky things I can put on but those could be fixed easily.\nAnother thing I would like to address is the spawning issue, the spawning issue is INCREIDLBY horriable. When I am fighting a enemy, in half way in the fight, the same mob spawns again, and if i hit it, it will attack me! This contiues on and on over and over, I would reccomend setting the spawn limits to atleast 30 seconds each, because it will kill you if you keep hitting the same mob over and over!\n\nOverall concept/rating of the game is 7.7 . It does seem low, but if you guys fix the cons, I will make it a atleast a 9.1.\n\nThank you for reading my review, and I personally feel this game is incredible and has many possibilities, do play this game! I encourage you!\n\n\n!!IIF ANYONE GETS MAD AT ME WITH A BUNCH OF CONS, REMEMBER, I SUPPORT THIS GAME, THIS GAME HAS LOTS OF POTENTIAL, IM JUST POINTING OUT THE MISTAKES SO THEY CAN MAKE THE GAME BETTER !!","December 7, 2015","true","21.8"," 180 of 216 people (83%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","83","180","216","19","0"

(imo)\n\n- Decent action combat and pvp battles.\n\n- Pretty good party system featuring server wide recruit broadcast and the ability to warp all members to you regardless of channel.\n\n- Great boss battles, some requiring you to run and destroy objects that are giving the boss almost inpenatrable defense and damaging auras all while dodging attacks that take half your health in one hit.\n\n- Leveling is extremely easy. anyone who says otherwise is not even qualified to be a casual.\n\n- Hunters Archive, the ultimate end game goal, collect everything to earn an epic mount, title, hall of fame on the website and about 1500$ in fortune gems and upgrade items.\n\nanyways I have heroic bosses to fight and can't waste anymore time on this review, (despite all the limits) its a great game try it.\n\n\nps. abandon your level grinding mindset, do the main and side quest, then before you know it you will be 2 levels away from max without even trying or using EXP boosters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotharaxe/recommended/356330/","lotharaxe","Lothar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lotharaxe/","36 products in account","Another entry in the X-Legend series, published by Aeria Games, Dragomon Hunter is X-Legend meets Monster Hunter.\n\nFor anyone who has tried Eden Eternal, or Aura Kingdom, being the last one available in steam, this game features the same repeated formula of the "series", with a point and click MMORPG, with a linear story usually based on heroes rising to fight an evil that is corrupting the land and the ones living on it.\n\nIn Dragomon Hunter, the hero(ine) is an aspiring Hunter that wishes to enter the legendary Falcons, a group of mercenaries, hunters, adventurers, scientists, people of all kinds, that are responsible for hunting down, taming and protecting humanity from the infamous Dragomon, fierce monsters that populate the planet.\nYour mission as a newbie is to complete all the missions given to you by your superiors, kill tons of monsters, and try to save the day. Simple isn't it?\n\nCompared to previous games of the company, the game lacks in ambientation, with Aura Kingdom certainly being the epitome of a polished environment, having every single map has its own personality by being properly explored. In this game maps are merely background for the extensive quest grinding, and the feeling of disposable environments is only reenforced by the fast questing system that exists in the game.\n\nImproving from previous games however, the characters presented in the story are far more appealing, and constantly reappear in the story, forming a sort of family bound with your character. The Hoppalongs also present the most hilarious personalities and moments of the game, differently from what some reviewers that didn't even play 1 hour of the game say, the dialogues are actually worth reading.\n\nPlaying the game itself is quite enjoyable, until you realize that it is taking too long for new skills to appear in your hotbars, and combat is becoming monotonous. Then you reach level 20 and you skills literally double in ammount. Then you stop complaining. The combat, by the way, is far more active than in previous titles. AI and difficulty wise, nothing new. Everything is pretty much dumb, except for bosses that can pose some unexpected challenge sometimes.\n\nAn addition to consider for Anime fans, this game offers actual Japanese Voice Acting, both in NPCs and characters. They are all Anime quality, well done as expected.\n\nThe real joy of the game? Mounts and Weapons.\nEvery single monster of the game can be a mount, given you actually drop it, and collecting all those monsters can be quite fun. And from these very same monsters, the materials you drop can be used to craft the craziest, sexiest and sickest weapons I've ever seen. Weapons that are ACTUALLY USEFUL. Crafting equipment that is more useful than dropped ones! Can you believe it?!\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to people that either played X-Legend games before, or are willing to play ANY kind of MMORPG as long as it is a MMORPG, because there isn't really anything appealing to the average public in here.","December 10, 2015","true","51.5"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","27","36","2","2"

While it is visually appealing, a few things rubbed me the wrong way.\n\n1. no true open world (you leave the city by way of copters or portals)\n2. quest/character interactions that are way too long and throw you out of the game. I caught myself reading the quests in the beginning, then quickly clicking through them as the text was 10+ pages long.\n3. anti-bot measures. This is honestly what annoyed me most of all. I get bots are a problem, but asking me to put a code into a captcha after only 30 minutes of play ruins the immersion and really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n4. ads in-game for the game itself. This only happened once, but while I was playing, a video trailer of the game played while I was trying to pick up a quest.\n\nI'd love to keep playing them game as the controller support is nice, but the above just ruined it for me. This is the MMO you'd let your little child play, but not good for veterans who have been playing MMOs for years.","May 8","false","2.0"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

I haven't reached max level and I usually don't spend money on F2P titles, so I can't tell if you need to spend money when you reach endgame, but I didn't feel the need to spend a single dollar while playing so it's always a good thing.\n\nCombat is dynamic (pretty much every mob uses AOE attacks) and it's actually playable with a controller.\n\nIf you like Animes and MMOs, you'll have some fun with this one.","December 2, 2015","true","9.8"," 60 of 98 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","60","98","7","2"

It is an Action MMORPG with lots of movement needed to survive.. especially as cloth user.\nTheir classbalancing is quite okay and cloth users can gather more stats due to the low deffence, which results in some leather users going clotharmor for more burstdmg.\n\nPay2Win?:\nNO... while Aeria Games games are likely to be p2w this one realy is not.. their cashshop is quite expensive but you can get everything realy cheap for a few gold or in their gamblebox/Gamblegame (Falcon Fortune).. a role only costs 30/40g and you can get them through events, buying, dailymissionboxes and co.. a good Falconboard can give you even more rolls than you invested... I ended up having casharmor, mount, wings and a few bags for solely 2$ (and those points i even had from other games left.. so basically no money spent)   cashshop worth over 200$ for simply a few rolls without having to pay anything.. could have bought the rolls with gold aswell..\n(Gold in this game is like gold in most other mmos like DN/WoW.. a propper endgame item can give 20k++ aka enough rolls for going all out...)\n\nPvP:\nTheir Arena is somewhat ballanced for max level but totaly unbalanced for lower lvls as you get matched together with max lvl (50) players arround lvl 40 onwards and they can pretty much onehit you. But this is negotiable as you don't have to play PvP before max level you know?\nBesides those flaws there is a PvP Arena where you use your Dragomons to fight and this one is balanced whatever level you are.. also the Battleground (up to 500vs500 fractionpvp) is playable with lower levels.\n\nPvE:\nThere is a daily limit for Daily/Boardquests (30) and Huntingquests (25) [TIPP: Always max those out and once you get to a mainquest where you have to do one of those, it will reset the whole limit automatically]\n\nThe leveling part goes smooth until arround lvl 37/38 where you have to do a few dungeonruns (or wait for dailyreset) to level up to 40 to continue with the mainquest.\nFrom lvl 44 onwards there will be another gap until lvl 50 where you have to level without Mainquest, however Ranchbosses give an incredible amount of extra exp and together with the 30 dailys and 25 Huntmissionslimit you can get at least 1-1.5 lvls a day, making the leveling feel rewarding.\n\nParty Dungeons realy are something for a party.. A level 40+ can hardly solo a lvl 28 partydungeon with more than 1 Dragomonboss (Netherrealms) alone due to lack of hp.  Therefore it stays challending.\nThere is a difference between "Normal" and "Hard" dungeons - hard are realy hardcore.\n\nYou can get Dragomons by grinding mobs or doing Dungeons, each Dragomon has a chance to spawn an Egg where a Dragomon can be in it.. Bossmobs even give battledragomons you can use in PvP and Ranchpve (Ranchbosses)\n\n\nMusic: 8/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nDifficulty: 8/10 - early is quite easy while it gets harder and harder but softens to the end once you have fitting Dragocites (gems)\nStory: 7/10  It is realy hilarious... but kinda odd aswell... good.. but seen way better\n\n\nTotal: 8/10\n\nPro:\n- Battlemechanics\n- Music\n- Gaggs\n- Tradingcards (while you have to spend to get them, you can sell them for quite a lot to get cheaper points overall)\n- Many collectives\n- No Pay2Win\n- Chibistyle <3\n- Cute\n- Fast support\n- Many events (be it spending or regular ones)\n- Perfect game to wait for BlackDesertOnline :P\n- Time consuming <3\n\nCon:\n- Daily limits seem restricting at some points\n- PvP only balanced for lategame, no tierque like 30-39, 40-49, 50\n- Sometimes big downtimes due to logginserver having problems\n- Time consuming <3\n- BOTS! SPAMMBOTS! ARRRRRGH... you can ignore them with one click though.. it's a common problem in F2P games... every game has them... (thinking about B&S that had goldsellerbots first day headstart... lmao)\n\nNeutral:\n- Aeria Games... might ruin the game in a long run as they did with other games (WolfTeam and co)","February 2","true","129.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","1"

The game might be all "chibi-kawaii-esque" but the gameplay is decent. The combat is pretty action filled from what I have played so far, sometimes so filled you lose sight of whats really going on in a battle but really, that doesn't hurt the game considering the much more common alternative of mmo combat just being downright bland. All of Dragomon Hunters art just pops, and it makes the game fun and relaxing to play.\n\nTo go into more details though, Dragomon Hunter has four playable classes each with a specialization selectable at level 30. The classes are cleric, a hammer and fist weapon user, scout, a dual blade and rifle user, mercenary, a battleaxe and greatsword user, and finally the mage, a staff and horn user. as far as combat goes I have been leveling a cleric and I am really liking the animations and skills you get to use when swinging around the absurdly large hammer weapons that are more often than not larger than your actual character model.\n\nAs for the titular  Dragomon, they are what you are trying to collect in Dragomon Hunter. The Dragomon are monsters in the world that after defeating you can tame and capture as pets, mounts, guards, etc. There are tons off these monsters in the game, so certainly you can try to hunt them all. You will see people riding all the exotic looking Dragomon all around the cities and the wilderness, each one looking as cute and bizarre as the last.\n\nWhile there are tons of details I have not covered in this review, like story, professions/crafting, and dungeons, I think I have given you a pretty good idea of the kind of thing you are in for. If not I know there are already plenty of other really great reviews out there where you can read more about the game. as for me, I am just glad I had a bit of fun.","December 5, 2015","true","5.2"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","24","35","3","0"

I adore the Japanese voices that you can set if you want to!\n\nThe graphics are pretty cute, especially the dances are great. The gameplay is similar to previous games of the same dev but the fact that every monster you kill can give you a mount is nice. If you're not so much into fighting, you can go fishing or play with the Dragomon on your Ranch. You can also breed them though I am still trying to figure that out!\n\nThe Dungeons are nice but a bit small in my opinion. Still it can be good fun to just mob them and try not to die while killing your mob. I'm not much into PvP so I haven't tried that yet but I heard they just got some war-arena or so where you can fight a lot of people at once by joining a faction.\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty neat and definitely worth a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluecorvid/recommended/356330/","bluecorvid","BlueCorvid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluecorvid/","29 products in account","I want to start by saying that it looks like most of the "Not Recommended" reviews on this game are basically just saying, "I thought this was Monster Hunter but it's not, not recommended." And??? I don't know where people got that idea??? It doesn't look or sound (in the description) like Monster Hunter at all??? lol wtf\n\nI would recommend this if you're looking for a fun little MMO to play. The graphics are very nice, the gameplay was pretty fun, the monsters are cool-looking. Nothing mind-blowing, but it was fun and cute. Beat up a monster and sometimes you'll get it as a mount! That's it. Other than that, the usual class-based MMO play. (Except that you get a dodge roll, which is always a plus in my opinion.) Okay. I can dig it.\n\nThat said, I'll probably go looking for a different MMO to play. This game has a lot going for it, but it seems like in a lot of quests, you can't bring your party with you, you have to go alone. That would be fine, except that the quest doesn't say anything about having to go solo -- you just walk into the dungeon and then spend 15 minutes trying to figure out why you can't see your buddy. We want a game to play together, not one that surprises us with solo missions every other quest. So it's not for us.\n\nThe controls were also a bit of a pain. WASD movement and your skills are on the number keys at the top of the keyboard? Am I supposed to use click-to-move in the middle of combat? N...no. I had to change the controls. It didn't seem to want to accept any input from JoytoKey either, which was really weird -- I've never experienced that in any game.\n\nThe last thing I want to talk about is the premium content. In the hours that I played, the only "pay to win" scenario that I encountered was a quest where you had to buy the quest item from the premium content store. The intent was probably to have a beginner quest to show you how to use the item mall (since I did a little poking around and it seems that that and a follow-up quest int he same line are the only quests in the game to do such a thing), but at face value, it seems like a scam because the game never tells you that is its intent.\n\nThis game has some transparency issues. Just tell the players what you're doing and they'll be less put off.\n\nAll things considered, if you're looking for an MMO, this is one I'd recommend.","January 10","true","5.4"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","17","25","5","0"

Looking at the reviews on steam, it seems to be a "you love it or you hate it game" with reviews being 50/50. I noticed a pattern, however. It seems the people with the least amount of hours invested leave lower reviews... And to that I say, maybe you should give it another shot.\n\nPro's\n-this is the first game that I have literally not hated grinding. Leveling speed is reasonable, however, and i believe end-game will be worth it.\n-So many goals! Achievements! Collections! I love it. Serioisly, I absolutely love a game that gives me goals to accomplish.\n-The number of ways that you can increase your stats is unbelievable... It makes things a lot more interesting.\n-Hunting for baddies.\n-I really love the art style, but I know this is a con for most people. Anime-chibi themed mmo's don't typically do very well outside of asia.\n\nNotable Con's for me, but not totally game-breaking:\n\n-Captcha's in-game. I understand why they do this, but I can see how it will be an issue later on. I mean, they only give you a minute to respond. And if I am in combat, it's kind of annoying. Atleast you get 10%+ exp upon completion?\n- Limitations. Only 1000 monsters per day (which isn't very hard to do imo), each dungeon can only be completed 4 times per day or so, sometimes you run out of quests to do. This is also done to combat botting, but I feel that this punishes actual players more than anything. They can still bot regardless of this implementation.\n-There needs to be more of a tutorial with the dragomon system.\n-Grind. Lots of it. This is without-a-doubt a con for most people.\n\n\nThis is all I could come up with for now, but I will update as I go. I have really enjoyed spending my time on this game because there is so much to do. While I did run out of quests at level 28 and had to figure out another way to gain 2 levels; it wasn't too horrible and I found other things to do.","December 8, 2015","true","87.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","13","18","2","0"

Aeria Games doesn't usually impress me, but that's not the case here.\n\nI had a few rough patches at the start, but the game jumpstarts quickly. It is a genuine amount of fun and I think I'll play it a little more often.\n\nDragomon Hunter allows the player to take on a role of a warrior whose job is to kill monsters. That's it. However, this is much cooler than it sounds. With 4 starter classes, players can choose from the getgo, what their fighting style is. Although, you cannot change this once selected, so choose your class wisely.\n\nThe hunting itself is some great fun too. All of the monsters have an interesting design, and you have the ability to unlock ridable versions of these monsters. So if you grow attached to a specific beast, rest assured that you will soon be riding off into the sunset on their back, with a bit of effort.\n\nThis game is very cool, though I do have some gripes. Personally, I don't enjoy the friend system. Partying up with friends is fun, but you are never sure how long it will take to find them, should they go astray. That being said, a system in which friends can teleport to their buddy's side would be a welcome addition.\n\nAlso, the limited classes and the inability to have multiple classes on a save file are a bit annoying, but I get the point that you are one affiliation per save file.\n\nFinal Verdict: An MMORPG is a difficult game to market these days, but this one brings something fun to the table, and I can easily see myself playing it more\n\nFinal Mark: 3/5","December 5, 2015","true","23.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

If you are true anime fan and like RPGs, you will have good time playing Dragomon. Best part: you can play with original Japanese voice-over if you want to (and I even recognize some of the voices from anime series lol).\n\nFrom the features, I especially like the collection aspect as you can put every mount and costume obtained from the game in your Archive which then gives you rewards and stats boost. Havent played too much PvP yet as I want to level up first but I saw there are several arenas available (duel, 3v3, 5v5).\n\nThere are some annoying things in the game (f.e. you drop a lot of different stuff so your backpack fills up quite quickly; you can drop the 5-slot backpacks in the game which helps but still it's kinda annoying to organize all the things) but nothing that would stop me from playing for now. You can buy items in the game but I haven't noticed any signs of pay to win yet (but let's see after I start with PvP).\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend the game if you are into slashing and smashing stuff (dynamic combat ftw) in a cute anime world :)","December 2, 2015","true","5.8"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","23","38","3","0"

The first is that, starting out most stats seem to be pretty high numbers.  I'm only level 12-13 and I've already gotten 5k health, and do tons of damage as well, and I'm only a cleric.  I feel like they should've toned down the stats, not really a fan of doing uber amounts of damage or having such a large healthpool, especially when so early into the game.\n\nThe other issue I have is the chat system, even when you change the chat filters, you still get spammed  by "system" and "announcement" messages, and there is no option to resize the chat box either.  On the upside you can move them around, as with most of the UI elements.\n\nMy third issue is that you can click the text in quests and it auto targets and moves you to the location.  Any MMORPG that has auto travel like this, tend to not be worth playing, and definitely makes me want to play this game less.\n\nOverall I'd rate the game a 6 or 7 out of 10, would be higher if you could resize the chatbox and a few other UI changes, and if they removed the auto moving option.","January 19","true","6.8"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

Its a cutesy , semi action/tab select/ mmorpg with the inspiration taken from monster hunter. This game definately deserves a chance, and download as a casual off MMORPG. Something to play while having a sip of beer and watching Netflix, but not really a take me away from reality type of game.\nThe biggest gripe I have is the UI, and the not so social online aspect. In MMOs it warms my heart to see conversations being carried out on general chat, as toxic as they can sometimes be. But in this game all that can be found are bots selling there wares. The game makes use of a stall system which causes users to set up shop and abandon there toons in the middle of town, which can be a bit fustrating. Allot of the pitfalls common in Eastern MMOs, this game seems to have...but one thing this game definately has is potential. I hope to see the devs, cleaning the UI up a bit and improve the targetting system, so that this game is more fast paced and immersive.\nGive this game a try, its free and its pretty enjoyable.","December 8, 2015","true","4.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Since I also like Pokemon and Monster Hunter, this game looked like a great crossover. After quite a few hours in the game, I can tell that if you like MMORPGs and Dragomon, then this is a cool game for you. If you're into Monster Hunter, don't let yourself tricked by the name: Dragomon Hunter is not at all the same type of game.\n\nNow, for guys like me who like MMORPGs and anime, this is quite a cool game. The concept of taming and collecting the Dragomons you fight is  well thought, it brought a nice Pokemon feel. I like the Dragomon farm, there are many collectible items to look badass while riding your Dragomon and fighting big bosses. Only problem to me is that it's a tad too easy. I haven't fought yet the big endgame bosses, but mobs and small bosses are super easy to destroy. I'm not so much into PvP here so I can't tell if it's good or bad, I'll let the specialists debate on this topic.\n\nSo overall I recommend despite some problems the game has. There are not many anime games like this, so I forgive the flaws.

The game is not pay to win in the least and more focused on work hard to win, they do not offer any cash items that will break the balance of the game..it's all based on your skills and what gear you bring to the battle! I've even made class skill videos on them! I hope they help out all the new players that love & enjoy this game as much as I do!

Some might call that too easy but its nice for when you wanna do other things while moving (inventory managment, etc).\n- Can be a bit grindy later on, but its not something to groan over. (The way you get most monsters is by farming mobs for their mount/monster item anyway)\n\nGraphics\n- Cute and bright, typicall chibi style.\n- Monsters have a nice variety\n- A lot of armors share the same look on your character, which is kind of a let down.\n- Characters look good and stylized.\n\nSound\n- Music is ok, most tracks are looped.\n- Even with the Japanese voice cast, you'll still want to mute all VO. I'm a dub guy so I natrually turn on English, but both VOs get pretty annoying. You're character only says one line during combat and it'll get irritating if you don't turn it off.\n\nInterface\n- UI isn't that complex. It lays everything out nicely and easy to find.\n- The Ranch is the only feature that introduces itself, but leaves it up to you on how to it works.\n-  Bag space is very limited, you'll have to make use of your bank A LOT.\n- Yes there is a item store but it's pretty much useless to the core game. ( Unless you count that one quest that needs to buy something from there to complete it)\n\n\nOverall\n\nThis isn't a bad game, this isn't a great game. This isnt the next F2P masterpiece, this isn't some cash shop heavy pay 2 win. This is just a simple and casual anime MMO for those who enjoy something just to have fun every once in a while.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/356330/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Once upon a time, in an age before Pokemon, mons and humans did not live in peace.  The threat the various mons posed could not be understated - a herd could destroy villages and damage cities!  Of course, humanity, being the benevolent heroes that we are, devised new and better ways to beat the mons into submission.  The future is uncertain, but it will be bright.  I say this after having beaten a wierd dragon-walrus hybrid into a stupor and having intimidated it into being my mount, while having defeated another dragon-walrus and used it to impregnate my sword with the ability to better defeat other mons.  My name is Aurron (because I'm original), and I am a Samurai who owns things.\n\nDragonmon Hunter is Pokemon meets World of Warcraft, with emphasis on and the problems conferred by the latter.  It's a cute, brightly-colored MMORPG that has some great ideas.  For instance, every monster in the game is a prospecitve mount.  Every monster can be hunted for 'Dragocite' gems that you can use to customize gear.  Most monsters' drops are actually useful!  And best of all, few weapons are shorter than 125% of your character's height!\n\nWhat's to love/not to love?  Well, I'll tell you!\n\nWhat Works\nFirst things first - the hand-holdiness of the game.  While I understand why other reviewers are leery/just plain sick of it, I actually found some of the 'hand-holdy' features to be useful, because I have time limitations and often skip quest text.  That being said, there are problems that I will get to in the What Doesn't Work section.  The point is, most of the hand-holdy features are annoying early on, but properly used they can improve the experience, which is always nice.\n\nThe game is Free-to-Play, yet, I think it handles this very well compared to other F2P titles.  There are some pay-to-win elements; collecting stuff provides passive stats, so not buying custom outfits or weapon costumes will mean that your stats are lower than a buy-hard.  However, the game doesn't require you to buy anything - most games where you don't buy, you pay for it by taking longer to do everything.  This game, you mostly face bag space limitations, which is omnipresent in MMORPG literature.  I wish more F2P titles handled the business model as well as this one.  I might actually A) keep playing, and B) buy something (probably some 10-slot bags) as a result!  Who'd've thought!?\n\nSo, I finally get to the graphics, which are really well-done, and most of all, well-optimized.  My somewhat old PC handles the game with few lagspikes, and with some features like Depth of Field and multisampling turned on.  It's nice to play a game that isn't too taxing on a somewhat old PC for a change - and, a game that looks good doing it!\n\nMore mechanically, character moves.  You have exactly eigh moves for your class, which you can customize.  You can customize further after Lv.20 by choosing a secondary weapon that changes your moves.  For instance, my Mage, PrettyPwny is a nuker with a staff, but instead becomes a controlling-supporter with a War Horn (which also makes her attacks musically themed, to boot.)  There aren't too many 'strategic cooldown' moves unlike other MMORPGs out there, and I find it nice that all abilities are directly useful.  Another great idea.\n\nWhile there are more, the last one I want to draw attention to is the PvE experience.  There are some really satisfying missions in this game, and even more satisfying boss fights.  While they're nothing too hard (don't stand in stuff on the ground), they feel great due to tight controls, interesting if relatively unvaried monster designs, and making the fights beatable, but requiring the player to pay attention.  The game provides potential difficulty that is mitigated by practicing paying attention.  Skill > Gear...usually.  I find that a really great principle for a game you play with others.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work\nBefore I get into this, something I want to note is that all my 'what doesn't work' notes are the 'dark side' of things I noted that do work.  This game is notable because it has generally great ideas underlying it.  However, the high-level problem this game has was something I said: this game has all of the problems that World of Warcraft and Pokemon have.\n\nFirst, hand-holdiness.  I'm OK with the hand-holdiness because that's not the core problem this game has.  The real problem, is that this game throws stuff at you - big numbers, lots of text, changes where you are and what you're doing nearly constantly.  You never have time to really get a good footing with this game.  The reason the hand-holdiness is there is to make the game more manageable, which it does.  That is not a good thing, though.\n\nFix: I suggest the developers pay attention to the early experience, particularly in 'the noob zone.'  Let players have a few more opportunities to fight monsters early on and become familiar with the controls and interface.  This is something World of Warcraft did well, actually - all of the starter zones can be completed within 30-45 minutes if you don't know what you're doing.  The point of those zones and the pace of levelups is to let the player feel alright with the controls and UI, before throwing execution challenges at them.\n\nSpeaking of UI, it does not scale well, physically or intellectually.  Good UIs work well 'small', if you consider 1366x768 small.  I don't think the developers of this work do - it seems like it would handle better at any larger resolution, but bigger resolutions would be better.  As far as 'intellectually', let's be honest - there is a lot of useless stuff on-screen.  Sure, you can hide some things, but early on you see a lot of things you just can't make use of.  While this is standard for the MMORPG genre, it's disappointing in a game that otherwise puts effort into accessibility.\n\nFix: Consider your UI design more carefully and the concept of 'progressive disclosure' - don't show things until they're needed.  Final Fantasy XIV does this really well, and would be a good role-model for this young MMORPG to take cues from.  Physically, redesign the UI for a smaller form-factor, probably 800x600 resolution - if you can't play this game on a single monitor, windowed, while reading the wiki or reddit, you've got usability problems.\n\nAs far as business models, the 'pay-to-win' stat boosts being conferred for collecting things you can only get via paying, I find to be a Very Bad Thing™.  Your business model is so well-concieved and even-handed, that conveying stat gains for buy-only costumes comes off probably exactly as you intended - something you think is harmless, but due to the fact that it's a key consideration in min-maxing, will eventually earn you 'pay-to-win' accusations, because we gamers are rational, forgiving folk.\n\nTo fix this, remove stat bonuses from the collection system for buy-only costumes and weapon costumes.  Offer these as decorative things are intended - an inherent way to assert your own in-game identity, not another thing to min-max.  Alternatively, why not sell the game for a flat price and give us some things off-the-bat?\n\nLastly, the PvE experience.  This game starts off with a lot of instanced bits to make things easier to understand, which I applaud.  What I don't applaud is how shallow the 'exploration' maps are.\n\nFix: More exploration!  Gotta beat 'em all!\n\nThe TL;DR\nThis game is a good, if inexpert, MMORPG.  It has room to grow, but it's far from terrible.  The ratings of 6/10 I find a little low - I'd rate this 7.5/10.  If the dev team works on the UI and presentation, and removes the opportunity for 'pay-to-win' whining, this game can get the better marks it deserves.  It's enjoyable, a definite thumbs-up, and worth your time to play.  Do so!\n\nI'm going to go beat up and mount some dragons now.","February 2","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll start with the biggest things:  The monster hunter style gameplay and using the dragomon to fight other dragomon.\n\nThe monster hunter gameplay is somewhat there, monsters strike anything in front of it, and so do you in melee range.  The main problem with this is that when you attack your rooted in place and does not give you enough time to get away from being attacked, and right around the 30s lvl, that is an important thing cause the mobs start dealing quite abit of damage that can stack quickly.\n\nThe using dragomon to fight other dragomon (as advertised in their video) is not even possible and you can only use your monster pets in battlegrounds after getting an extreamly high rating.  Even using them is risky as when you die using them they permamently die, which throws all the hard work you put into them away.\n\nThere are some good things I like about this game though, the fishing aqua lords quick time events are really nice way to keep you on your toes.  When you do get a chance to ride monsters they are pretty epic feeling (with the exception of 1-2).  I also like the idea of aquiring titles and leveling proffesions giving you stat rewards.\n\nThere is one other main problem that this game shares with Aura Kingdom (made from same company) and that is so much daily stuff to do that it litterally takes hours to get threw.  For example a lvl 29 character (me) took about 4-5 hours to do all dailies available, which is INSANE!!!  There is the argument that you do not have to do them, but to get the stat boosts to keep up with higher leveled areas makes it more manditory than it should be.\n\nAll in all, I feel like this game is still incomplete, like it is in it's alpha stages.  I really wanted to like this game it had alot of promise, but there is just so much negative that I cannot overlook.","May 28","false","22.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You companion, a Hoppalong, is not only adorable but he is also one badass bunny who will help you fight the monsters all over the game.\nThe game play is pretty straight forward, with a good amount of quests for a newly launched game, and what seems to be regular updates and new content.\nOne other cool thing is the Japanese voices that can be set as default. You can recognise some popular Anime characters (and it’s pretty cool to hear voices from Naruto, bleach or Hunter X Hunter!)\nFor a F2P game, the balance is pretty fair between the paying players and the other ones and that’s always a thumbs up for me!\nSo yeah, I recommend this game :)","December 5, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Targeting is absolute aids, even when it comes to abilities. Last ♥♥♥♥♥ thing is that the game can get REALLY repetitive once you start reaching level 20, like it just becomes dull.\n\nGame = Great\nMounts = Cool concepts\nClasses = Variety in the four that are available.\nThis game is a Win/Win regardless of how you decide to play, although they really do need to have a few more tips for beginners as I wasted all my upgrade pamphlets on upgrading some daggers, the game never noted that guns were a viable option at level 20 for scouts.\n\nI think this should be worth noting that the game is entirely free to play in every aspect - The game can be played Solo if you wish and rarely have I needed someone to help me with a boss, as they're all relatively easy to dodge.\n\nIf you don't mind Anime or RPG's, go for this.\n\nEdit: I should also remind those that are about to download this: Spam-bots are frequent in this game, so if you get mail in-game, it's not from your waifu.\n\n\n","December 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","52","17","33","10","0"

Which is why i'm glad it's in "beta" apparently, means you can fix the problems.\n\nThe gameplay is fine, it's basically World Of Warcraft where you can (almost) tame any creature you face.\n\nWhen you get a mission, you can click on the mission and your character can auto walk to wherever you need to be. THIS IS AWESOME. THIS SHOULD BE IN EVERY MMO.\n\nAll the walking time in MMO's sucks, when it's a linear path and you aren't really exploring anything. But this game autowalks you if you want it to to any objective, even if you have to fast travel or access a portal or what have you. The game does it for you. I LOVE this. It makes it so much easier to get to the meat of the game.\n\nCombat is essentially just like any mmo, you mash number keys to use attacks/abilities.\n\nThis game has a huge ausio problem, as in, half of it is missing. Theres no sounds in fights which makes the game feel empty, unfinished, and boring in long fights. You don't really hear or feel the impact of your attacks or the enemies attacks. You'd think audio like that wouldn't really make a difference but it really does. This is a major annoyance as it makes it very easy to get distracted and want to do/play something else.\n\nFor some reason, the mouse is always present despite using the mouse to turn the camera. This is a huge sin of game development, If you've ever played a first person shooter and your mouse is still visible you KNOW how annoyingly distracting this is. In a game where the camera is entirely controlled by your mouse movements having the mouse pointer visible really really sucks and pulls you out of the game, you feel like you pressed a button to show the cursor BUT you didn't. It's just always there. It needs fixed, really badly.\n\nThis game has a great feel to it, and could easily be one of the next MMO greats. It just has a bunch of stuff that really needs fixed/added.\n\nI think the community backlash is due to the fact you called this a "Beta" which means "Very close to being finished", you can't call it beta when it's missing a ton of SFX and your mouse pointer is constantly showing.\n\nI'm certain Aeria have made a few MMO's already without these problems. So just do what you did in the last games you made, they were fun!\n\nTL;DR\n\nI would recommend this, but don't play it now, play it when it's finished. The Mouse pointer is constantly displayed and it's missing a laod of sounds.","December 8, 2015","true","0.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clowdnein/recommended/356330/","clowdnein","Stourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clowdnein/","52 products in account","On the outside this looks like a childish and possibly p2w game. It's not. The only thing childish about it is the Chibi design. It includes solid and responsive combat that gets increasingly difficult and dynamic, many dungeons with legitimate mmo themed mechanics, a large variety of classes and monsters (each of whom you can get as a drop to ride as a mount, tame, and make pets out of).  There is a wealth of cool gear and character cuztomizations as well. A lot of which is accessible without heading to the cash shop which is IN NO WAY PAY TO WIN.  The cash shop itself is great and has easily obtained in game points you can gain and use to buy most of the items as well.  If you have the time you can grind, if you have to work a lot you can buy the costumes its a fair and non game breaking cash shop as the combat itself is satisfying.  The community can be all over the place like any MMO but the game itself does not take itself particularly seriously and this leads to some laidback adventures with friends.  One thing that holds many people back from enjoying the game is the limit of dungeons and quests per day.  I personally find this to be a great way to get players to gain experience thrugh the many activities in the game as there are are more than a few!  If you go into this game and end up saying theress not a lot to do: Ask for some help because you're missing something. The game has such a high focus on detail you'll be blown away. Its easy to see the developers were thinking about player convenience (I.E. You will never get lost as you can click you quest objective to run there.) The game also inclues some great rpg aspects as well like stat points, some surprisingly good story writing, dialogue, and flavor text.  I encourage you to try this game even if you feel apprehensive at first look as it can actually be quite satisfying without spending a single dime (though you'll probably want to support the game once you have as much fun as I have). 50 hours so far and planning to keep playing as my feel good mmo alongside some other more adult themed ones!\n\nTLDR: Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n-Multiple ways to play the game: Action mmo, Classic mmo a la guild wars 1, hybrid action/classic, and top down click to move a la Diablo. Even has controller support with a run to quest button.\n-Solid Combat\n-Many Classes\n-Stylized and Enjoyable Artsyle\n-Monster Hunter meets Pokemon\n-Rewarding although simple crafting\n-Well done Jap Voice overs\n-Strong/Classic RPG aspects\n-Good dialogue\n-Family Friendly\n\nCons:\n-Gold must be spent wisely\n-Activity Caps bad for people who like playing 1 character only\n-Bots are pretty obvious (keep to themselves only affect the economy really)\n-A couple of irritating quests that you need to do to get rid of\n-Time will fly by way too fast\n-The cash shop stuff is super cool and you'll want to spend money (the in game stuff is just as cool but if you're a spender beware...)\n-NEED MOAR DRAGOMON NAO (gotta catch em all right?)","March 14","true","284.5"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","5","10","2","0"

Aeria Games.  They publish all the garbageware MMO's from Japan, Korea and China.  These garbageware MMO's cost the developer only a few million dollars to produce most likely but rake in 10 times that in microtransactions.\n\nDon't take my cynisism as to mean I don't enjoy this game so far.  It is mindless button mashing using a tab free targeting system.  You can use tab target, but don't necessarily need to.  There is no auto attack. You will be mashing the 1, 2, and 3 keys nonstop.\n\nAs for the aethetic....it's anime characters in a childish motif.  They have huge heads and wild hair.  If this turns you off then DONT download this, because it's everywhere.  The colors are vibrant however and the cell shaded graphics do have a certain appeal when they aren't bombarding you in the face.\n\nAs for these standard Asian MMO's, you can click the quest text to auto run to that location.  Most of the Asian MMO's have this mechanic.  This makes the game a mindless grind fest from one quest to another.  Just click the quest and you ride there with no input from the user.   This game is the epitome of casual.  Once you get to the quest area, there are mobs randomly placed around.  Nothing new here.  We've seen this all before in COUNTLESS MMo's.\n\nI'm still playing the game because it's a nice time waster and the microtransactions aren't shoved down your throat.  I gave it a thumbs up because it's not a terrible game.  You get what you pay for.  This is a standard freemium game that can cost you thousands of dollars if you let the game inside your brain.  It is certainly playable without paying a cent.  From what I've read, there are no pay wall's for content.  So take from this what you will.","December 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The fighting style is amazing. It has great mechanics, easy controls, and the sensitivity option was handy due to the fact that I am very slick and need precise and fast reaction to help me out in combat, weather it'd be a dragon, a reptite, a baby, or another player.\n\nThe storyline is quite quirky, but also makes me giggle from time to time. The dialogue is very bland and more of it is explainig what to do then an actual story, It is still very cute. (I have not FINISHED THE STORY)\n\n\nThe graphics are the cutest part. They kept me in a mystical and fantasy world where I could imagine fighting these beastly dragons. The art style was very anime, but kept and medival and magical feel to my eyes. Every second of the game I was glazing my way through glourious maps, stopping to admire the scenery that the developers have put together, the lighting was just on spot.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the character design, because all the characters are adorable little beings if I say so myself. You have the option to pay for cosmetics, but you don't have to, you can earn them in-game, and good looking weapons.\n\nThe whole concept is like any other mmorpg. Go around, kill things, collec tthe stuff, deliver it, visit places, do it again. What can I say? Classic is always good, and I love me some classic MMORPG style action!\n\nThe game is completely free to play, but you of course have the option to pay for perks. But not at all do you need to do this.\n\nI'd rate this game 9/10, mainly because of the storyline portion.","May 6","true","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The other players have all been incredibly friendly and helpful and there is always someone else there to help if they see you struggling with a dragomon! The quests are incredibly punny and the fact there is the ability to skip through the large amounts of talking that take place before and after each quest is definitely a plus; it does not hinder the storyline at all if you do not sit and read it.

The Pvp is alright and needs a little work.\n\nI highly recommend this game to fellow MMO players. id give it a 7.5/10\n\n","December 3, 2015","true","94.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The online servers are quite busy and it lagged my computer a little however I'm glad I did't let this put me off playing! The quality and gameplay is really enjoyable. This game could be played by anyone of any age and if, like me, you're quite a completionist and like to have a seemingly endless amount of tasks to complete then this game is definitely for you! The other players have all been incredibly friendly and helpful and there is always someone else there to help if they see you struggling with a dragomon! The quests are incredibly punny and the fact there is the ability to skip through the large amounts of talking that take place before and after each quest is definitely a plus; it does not hinder the storyline at all if you do not sit and read it. Overall, I have little complaints about this game other than Elysium being quite a laggy place to be due to overcrowding around the Hunter's League bullitin boards.","January 27","true","149.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So the graphics are good, the tutorial is.... odd? However that isn't what bugs me about it, you have no basic attack. Your movements are restricted to your mouse while attacks are restricted to your number keys. Which is weird. They don't tell you in the tutorial how to adjust your camera, so you have to deal with it until you figure it out. A top of that you get pick your rewards for missions. Sounds cool right? BUT you can choose something you can't even use. So what's the point? there isn't one. Just screws your character over if you don't pick correctly. So anyway, yeah, in the like 30 minutes I played it, that's my review. Good game but needs work.","March 5","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","5"

Oh but it has Pokemon things too?? You don't do that!!! You just don't do that!!! Monster Hunter is a fun game because it makes you feel powerful and the monsters are memorable and fun to fight, each with their own moves and tactics to take them down using you wit, your weapon's skills, and the environment around you. Pokemon is fun because it gives you lovable characters you can use to fight with as well as clever movesets to outsmart your opponent. This game doesn't have that. It has an isometric view with weapons that ALMOST come close to the Monster Hunter weapons (Being a lancer in Monster Hunter, I thought I'd try the lance guy, but he was so fast! And you can't sheild and attack at the same time! I know, they're different games and stuff, but COME ON!!! If you're gonna make a game based off of a game that's making MEGA bank in Japan, then at least copy the moves and the weapons right. And don't try to tell me it's not based off of them because partsw of the titles of the original games are in the title of this one.), a total lack of environment usage, and what basically amounts to Black Dragon, Red Dragon, Purple Dragon, Cyan Dragon, Mauve Dragon, obviously I'm making stuff up at this point but you get it, monsters that aren't memorable. I gave this game the benefit of the doubt, but it was no better than I expected. The Practice Dummies were even shaped like the Great Jaggi, and upon further playing, I discovered that a retextured Great Jaggi is in the game, but it's called a Sunburst Raptite.

So i did this 7-8 times now, and the zone can only be enter 5 times a-day, and i have netflix on my other screen, so i also tried waiting 30minutes or so, with no luck.

Nobody answered me.. well there was this one person who said and i quote (haha). I really don't care much about that or the community in this game.. i just wanted to get this main-quest done, so i could move on, but i guess not.\n- If you can get past this quest, and don't care about a game that should be socially active, but isn't.

You're simply forced into using auto-walk or spend a lot of time to see where to go.","December 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","1","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serneum/recommended/356330/","Serneum","Serneum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Serneum/","857 products in account","TL;DR:\nGame isn't like Monster Hunter. Got a Blue Screen twice in the hour I played and I've never received a Blue Screen on that machine before. Clicking quest objectives will walk you to where you need to be, which I have mixed feelings about. There is at least one (optional) quest that requires you to open up the web shop and buy an item with real money.\n\nReview:\nI wanted to like this game, I really did. The videos make it look like a chibi/anime Monster Hunter. That's false advertising for what I played. Maybe the game changes once you get further in, but I'm not really willing to give the game any more of my time.\n\nTo start, I had an existing Aeria account that got banned for violating some terms of service. The thing is, I haven't used my Aeria account since the release of Shaiya, which was around 7 years ago. I went through the process of recovering my account which took several days. I finally got access last night (12/5/15) and started up the game. I was able to start the game, which then crashed during the very first video before I even hit a server select screen. Subsequent attempts to start the game resulted in a browser window opening up that said "Success" and then would not proceed any further. After a few more attempts, I finally got in the game.\n\nOnce I picked my class, named and designed my character (and companion), the game threw me into a tutorial. No big deal. But that's where I noticed the game had action bars like any other MMO. Already a bad sign for what I thought was Monster Hunter. Granted, those expectations are probably my own fault. I completed the tutorial and was greeted with a video for the game. Cool, a trailer for the game in the game. I continued questing and realized that I didn't need to button-mash 1 for my first skill. Instead, if you hold it down, you just keep attacking. Between that and being able to click on objectives to walk to them and sometimes complete them, the game practically plays itself. While it's nice to be walked to an objective sometimes, it felt like the game didn't care if I actually had to play it at all.\n\nAs I continued playing, I realized that I was skipping all of the quest text. None of it mattered to me. I also noticed that I was progressing ridiculously fast. I don't know what max level is, but I was at least level 15 within 45 minutes or so. I quit playing when I was presented with a side quest where the objective said I should open the web store and buy some Dragomon Medicine. The item costs 199 AP, or $1.99 in real-world money. Yes, a quest that requires you to buy cash shop items exists. I didn't stick around to find out if more quests were like that.\n\nPros:\nIt's free\nYou can find items that let you ride the monsters you kill\nLooks decent if you like chibi/anime styles\nThe game will show you paths (and follow them) when you click on quest objectives\n\nCons:\nGame crashed at startup once\nGame couldn't be started at all for 10-15 minutes\nGame caused my computer to blue screen twice within an hour\nThere is at least one quest that can't be completely unless you spend real money\nAssets/textures were flickering on the main screen quite often\nCombat is extremely simple\nAdvertisements for the game are in the game\nPlays like an MMO (mobs show red areas where their attacks will hit)\nThe game will show you paths (and follow them) when you click on quest objectives","December 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

First there was no hook! As soon as I began it was dull and very unimpressive, granted I've not played much. When I got to the first town it was a cluster ♥♥♥♥ where I couldn't tell what was what. The graphics are nothing to write home about either. Being an MMORPG You would expect more diversity in the characters but there's only four classes and no species. When you're trying to pick the colour of everything there's only two colours that are good for the eyes, two for the bunny, and a few good ones for the hair. The music was repetitive and not good at all. Finally the frame rate felt like absolute ♥♥♥♥.

The art style is fine for some, not my cup of tea but I can understand the appeal. The gameplay is ok, a bit stiff for a game that's touted as an "Action RPG" but it does the job! For me however the biggest issue by a country mile is the controls. Your evasive move is tied to you global cooldown which is very inaccurate as to when that is up. So you execute your move, see a big smash coming in and are stuck to idly waddling to the side until the game finally recognises that you've been smashing the evade key so much it's now several miles closer to the core of the planet. Not only that side-strafing is something that only exists in your imagination. You can switch the control method to having a crosshair, to which you'd think it might switch your basic attack and dodge to your mouse buttons. You know, like a normal and sane person might do. NOPE! You get an interact button on your mouse and that's it. Whilst yes I'm sure alot of this could be fixed by rebinding the keys, but honestly the default configuration was so hopeless I didn't want to spent the eternity required to refine it myself.\n\nAgain, the concept is grand, Monster Hunter for the masses on the PC. Top stuff! But I feel like the people who designed this game got their Monster Hunter inspiration from a 4 year old explaining their time with MH. There aren't any real hunting choices to make, you get straight upgrades, you don't go on any seriously dangerous hunts, there just isn't that thrill you get when hunting monsters. Sure you could make them your mount, but that just isn't the same as skinning them for a shiny new hat... or maybe that's just the psychopath in me?\n\nGranted I only have an hour on record, so I can't really talk for any of the end-game content. But if a game can't hook you in an hour, should you really spend another 40 to find that hook? Somehow I feel like that's a bad idea.\n\nIf this had been made by genuine MH fans and players, kept out of the hands of Aeria Games (and likely any of the other F2P vomiting developers/publishers) and given that little bit of tension it COULD have been fantastic. As it is, it's just a disappointment.","December 4, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

And then you expect us to actually deal with your crappy support for a ban appeal? No bloody thanks, i'll just make a new account.\n\nIt's a bad sign when you manage to inrage your potential customers before they can even reach any gameplay.\n\nAnd then you find out that the game it's self, unfortunately, is excruciatingly dull at best. 5 hours in, level 20, and it still feels like it's a giant tutorial.

They dont work with IP blocks, and other protections a game should have, your personal info is sold to third parties just for their own interest.\nThey are extremely good at masking their flaws, till you realize that you have spent time and money on a game that is not worth anything.\nBe warned!","December 6, 2015","false","4.8"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

I downloaded it, and made an account, and a password. I used one familiar since I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. Then the game asks for a SECONDARY password.....really paranoid much aeria?\n\nThis was a number combo, and I didn't want to do something generic like 123456, so I instead used a visual pattern not paying too much attention to the actual numbers because again, wasn't sure if I was going to like this. The game immediately asked for the password again, and provided a whole new layout for the numbers....why?\n\nSo I went to reset. It tells me to go to their web page, which doesn't give an option in the profile to reset, you have to search around, only to be given a form that asks a few questions (and if you didn't memorize everything about your game characters, you're going to run into issues... luckily I never got to even create any....) Then the form simply closes after you hit "submit" to a page that says "thank you". Nothing else. No "we need to review this" or "your password is reset", nothing.\n\nSo I go to try to log in again, and not a f-ing thing happened besides me wasting my time. No reset, nothing. What the hell is the point of the SECOND password, and why the hell would you make it ridiculous to reset it?\n\nF- this game, it is being deleted, and I will NEVER play any other game by this company ever. Oh, and bonus, they wont let you delete an account after it has been created.","April 11","false","0.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

I remember seeing this on the aeria games launcher before it was released, so here is my opinion of it:\n\nPros:\n\nFairly easy to play (not confusing like some other games)\nA decent difficulty, increasing the farther you go into the game (I like this aspect, others may not)\nThe armor sets are not too difficult to make, may require lots of grinding later on though. (Im fine with that)\n\nCons:\n\nLater on, leveling up takes weeks if you don't grind like hell. (trust me, it's not fun)\nThe companion doesn't have any customization options that don't cost money or days of grinding.\nEventually, you can't find any quests, so you have to go to the boards to grind, and there's a limit for those, which sucks.\n\n\nThat's about it! I would get this game! 7/10 for me!","March 27","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not a huge fan of the cutesy anime art style, but the gameplay more than makes up for it.\n\nIt is very similar to Monster Hunter, except it is more of an MMO. There is partial controller support (you can do all the combat, just some menu stuff requires the mouse). There are 100 different "Dragomon" aka mounts to collect. Crafting is simple, but it's cool to have it there. There are tons of quests. Lots of players. People can't chat until lvl 20 so that cuts down on spam. Leveling is pretty fast though, doesn't feel grindy. There is fishing. Optional (arena) PvP. It's definitely more of an action RPG than anything. I really enjoyed it. Time to go back through a lot of mixed games to give them another try. I really don't know what people's problem with this game could possibly be. Sure these games aren't for everyone, but that doesn't make it bad by any stretch. I killed 2 hours playing it before even realizing it, and even though it's 3 am and I need to go to bed I really want to play more.\n\nIt's free, give it a try, what do you have to lose? I'll update this if I find out it's pay to win or something, but as of now I highly recommend it. It would be worth it with a price tag, so the free to play is just gravy.","February 8","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is an MMO-RPG where you fight monsters and recruit them as transportation. The monsters do not help you in combat but help you move faster. It is nothing like pokemon or dragon hunter. you just battle monsters for people who give you that quest. All it is, is an MMO online game like ESO,WOW, or Defiance. It is just another fun MMO theirs nothing wrong with it. Dont listen to the people who played the game just to review it, listen to the peoplewho played the game to enjoy the game. The graphics are good, and the controls for combat are different but good as well. I ENJOYED THE GAME!

But there a few things I wish would be changed/be fixed.\n\nFirstly, I don't particularly like the camera angles. I wish that the camera would stay behind your character at all times instead of having to press Q to move it in a circle. It gets very tedious and annoying. I would think it would be a small thing and easy to fix, but I can't say because I havent made a game before.\n\nNow I do understand that this is a fairly new game with updates and maintenance regularly. Secondly, I wish that things would be explained better. Now not necessarily the quests, because those are explained quite well, but I mean more of things like the ranch, its purpose, refining, evolving, etc.\n\nThere is a final thing I hope gets fixed but i'm not quite sure what to call it. Its where things "clip" through other things, for example, when i stand still (by the way I am a Mercenary) my axe clips through the ground or my hair might clip through my head and it just makes me lose feeling and attachment to my character.(I also thinks it just looks stupid.)\n\nI also want to mention that I have the problem where the main quest doesn't show up and then later it does for some reason. Not sure if its just me, or everyone. But overall this an amazing game that has a wonderful future. I hope these things aren't looked over and will be addressed. And if you are looking for a fun new free game this is wonderful. Seriously play it right now!","December 12, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Not to mention the fact that half the time your mount clips on some wall and the pathfinding just bugs out.\n-The combat in this game is poor as well, you pretty much just need to hold down the "1" key and it will kill any monster for you. If you're injured, stay out of combat for around 5 seconds and you will heal from near death to full (way to fast and easy).\n-Game camera doesn't rotate automatically or with arrow keys, it can slowly rotate with "Q" and "E" but more quickly with the mouse right click and drag (it is actually painful to have to keep doing).\n-In-Game pop-ups are a common thing, you get bothered with a pop-up message of something you already did earlier in the game. Here's the catch, it doesn't check to see if you are in combat or not before showing up. These messages don't seem to have a direct way to close them, I THINK I may have closed one early by double clicking it(I say think because it had been up for around 30 seconds which is when the others auto closed).\n-When doing something for the first time, such as crafting armour, the games instructions are actually more intrusive than they do good.

Possibly because it borrows from a few different games, including Monster Hunter. I kind of like the cartoon-y look of the game, though I do wish it was more like the various artwork for the game and some of the cinematics.\n\nThe game unfortunately fails where it needed to succeed, the combat. The combat is very boring. Your character moves to your target automatically. You really just need to face roll the keyboard to fight. If the combat was like Monster Hunter or GW2, the active combat feel, then it would have been a lot of fun to play.","December 26, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can just click on your current objective and you will autorun to the location. I find it a nice change of pace compared to any new MMO where you can get lost VERY easily and then give up because you have lost interest trying to find 1 NPC in a crowded city.\n\nPros:\n-Controls are easy to learn\n-Graphics and design are sweet\n-Easy naviagation (just click on your quest objective and you will autorun there)\n-ALOT of things to do\n-Fun and challenging\n-Enough bag space (for now)\n-All runs are instanced so game is very quick to pick up and put down (no running around looking for stuff and wasting time)\n-Not centered around Microtransactions\n\n\nCons:\n-Some might find the autorun feature too easy, not appealing\n-Anime style might not appeal to most\n\nThis game is a Monster Hunger clone, right down to how the rare monsters appear (if you play monster hunter you will know when you see it).\n\nI would highly recommend TRYING this game, I was skeptical at first but I am hooked and am excited to what the game is like at max level.","December 14, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An example being, I cannot attack in front of me if I am targeted onto something, my character will run over the thing I am targeted to until I am within range, to me that defeats the purpose of making an action based fighting system and not just a “click to auto attack”.\n\n*on a side note, this game has proper ultra-wide support (3440x1440), although I noticed that sometimes the water will clip though the ground making the area appear flooded, I don’t know if that has to do with the game its self or the resolution.","December 25, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Want to go to the location of the quest? click the white text and you'll be automaticly driven to the location. For me, thats a con because first: the world isnt THAT big that you would get lost (and you have the frikin minimap for pete's sake) and second: in the main city there are some zones where you will glitch because the auto-moving system forces you to go close to the walls.\n-Quests. Now, i know that quests aren't easy to make, but come on. On about level 20, 30 and 40 you will get a quest saying "Reached level 30/40/50". What does it mean? well, it means you will have to do repeated quests over and over again just to get to the desired level, so you can continue with the story. And when i say repeated quests i mean you will want to do bosses, since they give out the most exp per quest completed.\n-Small game. I know this came out on the end of last year, but 60 hours in and im already level 42 (as the time of this review of course). Now, on this game, you have 2 types of levels: Level (the normal one), being max level 50, and Hunter Level, being max level 75. They both level up together, no specific quests for any of them though.\n-Unbalanced PvP. In this game, there are 2 types of PvP: battlefield and arenas. Arenas are "capture and defend tower" style in 3v3 teams. Battlefields are classic 5v5 battles. Now, first of all, it takes a lot of time for a match to start, after queueing up you'll wait about 10-20 mins before it starts. And second, you must, and i do mean YOU MUST reach max level before playing PvP. Or else, you'll get in the arena and die constantly, because everyone else is max level and they will focus on you, since you are the weakest.\n+/- (this can be seen as a pro or a con, your decision) Mounts. In this game you can get mounts by 2 ways: farming and being lucky enough so the monster you are farming drops an egg with a permanent mount of itself; Or by farming bosses that give you "dragomon points". Dragomon points can be used to buy a mount you want if you have enough, so you don't spend time farming that monster. You can also buy mounts from regions you still haven't visited.\nNow, you can also get boss mounts, which are basicly mounts you get from killing bosses (OHH IM A GENIUS HOW DID I FIGURE THAT OUT HUH?). The only problem is, first the bosses only drop mounts on hard mode, and second, those mounts are only usable in PvP, and if you die in PvP riding the mount, you lose it. The only way you can get a boss mount to walk around is by paying real money and buying it in the in-game mall. Also, did i mention the drop rate for the egg itself its low? Don't even get me started on the permanent mount.\n\nOVERALL\n\nOverall, i recomend this game for those who are starting to enter the world of MMO's. Its a fun little game to pass time too, ive had a lot of fun with it, the combat is not the best, but it feels fast and fluid. Veteran MMO players won't probably like this as much, but i don't know. The game overall looks nice and has a nice idea. It needs some tweeks, but its a fun little timekiller and a good beginner's MMO for those starting to play this genre.\n\n\n\nWhat, you want a 1-10 score? Fine... i give this game a 5/10.","February 1","true","62.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for being a guy with a tiny storage of 9GB open, this game then opens that. It's not just that aswell, It's a very nice based game.

Nothing, they seems to contribute in nothing.\n\nI does not know how I survived 5 hours playing that game, but I hope I does not have a nightmare due to this\nAlso, another fact, the game have unskipable cutscenes, being that the true intro of the game only comes at level 18, aka after 4 or 5 hours of gameplay.\n\nThe leveling is fast until level 15, then it suddenly slowdown like as it takes ages to level up.\nThe black screens are back, but they are not as frequent as on Aura Kingdom, but they are still annoying.\nThe Aura Kingdom's and Eden Eternal's quest that requires you to buy a cash item in order to complete it is also in this game.\n\nCopied this text from my conversation to a friend, this mentions most of my experience in the game.\nI thought at first that the game is bad, but now I am sure that it is bad.\nThe only pro I found is that they seems to have implemented an Anti bot system, that does not seems to work against the bots.","December 15, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
