Would buy for 5 bucks any day.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSince this review has gotten popular, I decided to add to it.\n\nTrials is a unique game. Its a race against time, and is a ton of fun but can be very very challenging at some times. The controls are well done, and the bikes and tracks are all made well and the difficulty of each track is organized in a fair manner. Usings the controller works best with this game, in my opinion. The multiplayer isnt too active, but if you can get 4 friends over for some local trials races, you will have a blast, I guarentee it.\n\nThe only downside to this game is that it uses uplay, but in my opinion, there really isnt any other game out there like this one, so it is worth it.","November 28, 2013","true","91.7"," 103 of 136 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","103","136","2","11"

Some may even call me a b***h, and I'm totally fine with that. This all means that when games become super hard I generally tend to turn them off and do something that doesn't make me want to smash my face into a concrete slab. This game however, is incrediably rewarding and keeps me drawn in. I have unlocked all the tracks in both sections of the game (Trials HD, and Evolution). I in no way would ever concider myself a "good" trials player. Look up videos of folks pulling off Extreme traks with 0 faults, and you will know what god looks like. The reason that this game doesn't get frustrating, is the amazing physics system. I have never once felt like the game cheated me out of landing a partifuclar obstacle. Everytime I fail I know it is my own fault and the only thing standing between me and the finsih line is skill, not luck. This brings me back again again and again. If I have 20 minutes before I head to class to play a game, this is almost always what I chose. I try my hardest to get a gold medal on whatever track I chose. If I suceed, I feel like like the worlds biggest bad a** all day. If I fail, I'm no frustrated, and all day I'm thinking about what I need to do different to reach my objective.\n\nI love the fact that the online multiplayer allows you to use whatever bike and ride on whatever track you want (irregardless of weather or not you have unlocked that content in the single player.) This provided hours of enjoyment as me and my bestfriend tackled Extreme tracks knowing damn well we barely had the skill for Medium tracks. This system actually improved our skill quite rapidly and I'm all for it. I wish more games would allow players to access all content from the get go.\n\nI've never written a review before, so excuse me if this was all rambling, but this has become one of my favorite games of all time and so I felt it was fitting to share my opinion!","November 2, 2015","true","39.5"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","1"

It's a movie that has gotten rave reviews and you are pretty much know you're going to love it.  You get your coke, popcorn, and gummy worms and head to an aisle somewhere in the middle of the theater; it's your favorite spot.  And the icing on the cake is your smoking hot girlfriend is with you and equally excited for the movie.\n\nHowever, you notice that a few rows in front of you, there is an overweight, greasy guy that's breathing heavily and constantly picking his nose.  He has an obnoxious laugh, he slurps his soda really loud, and every now and then he lets out a smelly fart.  Initially he is kind of distracting, but after a while you learn to block him out of your mind; you are not going to let this guy ruin the best movie of the summer for you.\n\nWell, Uplay is that smelly guy, except much less offensive, and Trials in the summer blockbuster.

A handful of bikes change up the pace a bit as you progress, but by and large the game remains unchanged in its mechanics from start to finish.\nThat isn't a knock, though, because over time you'll learn various new techniques to help you overcome the ever-increasing challenges of the tracks to become a champion.\nA handful of mini-game type tracks, tournaments, and themed tracks keep the game fresh, and striving for Gold (or even Platinum!) medals in tracks will keep you coming back for a long time. In addition, there's a multiplayer mode where you can compete against your friends on a series of tracks to see who gets the best time. It's barebones but fun, and though uPlay is a significant hassle, it's worth it for the zany antics and rush of competition.\n\nOverall, Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is a great game that combines two well-regarded games (Trials HD and Trials Evolution) into a fun package that gives you as much back as you put into it. Some people say there are optimization issues, and indeed on some later tracks the framerate will dip wildly into the teens before climbing back to a playable framerate, but overall it's a good port.\n\nI give it 8.5/10 stars and hope to see future Trials games hitting PC, because I'll be there for the ride.","January 13, 2014","true","27.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","3"

I'm running it with a HD7970 and an i7 3770k so it runs well just because of the brute force.\nMy laptop on the other hand has a decent high end i7 (for a laptop) and a HD8870M and I can't even run the game on low settings in 680x480 (for reference, the laptop can run Battlefield 4 on low sort of okay in 1080p) without having lag.\nOther people have problems with the game not starting at all or crashing frequently.\n\nEDIT: Track central is now fixed and works just as well as it does on Xbox 360, removed the "it's not working very well part".\n\nIt also has DRM in the form of uPlay, which will start when you try and start the game from Steam. It was pretty terrible in the beginning but seems to have improved a bit over the year (still would rather not have it). uPlay also handles the multiplayer part of the game if you want to make private games with friends and that part is incredibly broken too. Pressing invite from the in-game friendslist just crashes my game and I'm one of the lucky ones that it's the only problem I'm having with it.\n\nTo sum things up I would recommend the game if I knew it would work properly, but with all the problems it has it really seems to be dumb luck wether it will work. The infrequent patches haven't done much to remedy the situation in the last few months so I honestly cannot recommend it when it's so broken for a big portion of the people that bought it.","December 30, 2013","false","744.2"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","24","34","0","5"

You are tasked with getting across each level as quickly and with as little crashes as possible. Looking at some screenshots of the game you may think it is an action packed racing game but in reality it is about overcoming various obstacles in your path by using careful precision. Keeping your finger on the acceleration key will make it far more likely that you will crash in a spectacular fashion unless you are really skilled at the game. You can crash as many times as you like and still get a bronze medal as long as you cross the finish line but to unlock more levels to play you will need to go for gold or at least silver. The fewer times you crash and the quicker you get to the finish line, the bigger your reward will be. Aside from medals you will also be rewarded with cold hard cash which you can use to customize your rider and the bikes in your garage.\n\nYou will automatically unlock new bikes the further you get into the game and they all have different ways of handling. Some may be heavier and slower while others will be fast and very prone to flip over if not careful. Handling aside, each bike you unlock is a straight upgrade to the one you were using meaning that you are unlikely to use those bikes ever again. There is one bike called the Micro Donkey that is unlocked by completing any track without crashing or leaning though for the life of me I could not accomplish this so I have no clue as to how the bike is. Customizing your bike and rider is solely for aesthetic reasons and has no effect on gameplay. You can color each part of your bike individually, making it look like you painted your bike with whatever spray paint you could find in the dumpsters if you so desire. As for different parts there are very little to choose from so most bikes will look the same minus their colors. Same goes for the rider, not much clothes to pick from though you can color him however you please.\n\nStarting off you may be wondering which of the two games you should start off with but it doesn't really matter as you will have to constantly switch between the two as they are tied into each other. Whatever medals you earn in either will count toward your total to unlocking newer, harder tracks so you will have to play through both game's easy tracks in order to unlock medium difficulty ones. You can use the same bikes, same rider and the gameplay is exactly the same so it is very seamless, making it feel like one giant game. With the combination of two already decently sized games you will have a ton of content in this edition of the game. Trails HD no longer has its original soundtrack unfortunately and instead shares Evolution's soundtrack for some reason. Evolution also has a setback in that its DLC is not available for the PC which is really unfortunate since they were very fun. This version is by no means awful but I would suggest getting them on the Xbox 360 if that option is available to you.\n\nPort quality of this title is solid, ran well and I've experienced no glitches or crashes. Most people's issues seem to be with the added Uplay DRM. It runs far smoother than the 360 version especially when there are lots of explosions going on, which is a large portion of the time. It being a 2.5D game means that the explosions going off in the background can't harm you and are there to look cool. You can only move to the left and right of the screen though when you are sent hurling off your bike after a crash you can fly face first into objects that can't normally be interacted with. It is a small unimportant detail but it never gets old sending your poor rider spiraling off the course and directly into some explosives. There is no gore or blood, he will just ragdoll into objects while occasionally letting off a very goofy scream. Trials does not take itself seriously at all and it is always tongue in cheek about things such as the descriptions for the levels that are often times references to movies or other forms of entertainment.\n\nIt is goofy, it has respawn points littered seemingly every couple of feet and you can respawn as often as you want but Trials is by no means easy. It may start off as seemingly easy and boring but it will quickly kick off the training wheels, leaving you to fend for yourself as it giggles making you slowly drive your way over a row of highly explosive barrels. These insane, nonsensical things it puts you through is a huge part of its charm and in no time you will be riding through a WW2 battlefield, a floating island full of giant stone golems and a haunted castle to name only a few. You never know what to expect next since the theme of each level varies so greatly and so does the level design. Even after you think you have mastered the levels near the end of the game you will be able to earn a 4th platinum medal which require 0 faults and little time wasted. They are by no means necessary as by the time you unlock the ability to earn them you will have already unlocked all the levels, they are just there to add replay value and earn bragging rights.\n\nAfter reaching the extreme difficulty tracks I'm just happy to get through a track and couldn't believe when I managed to get a silver medal on an extreme track even if I have played Trials since 2009. A neat feature incorporated into the game is the ability to view other player’s replays to see exactly how they got on the leaderboard and learn a few tricks from them. The community can even use the built in level editor to upload their created levels which are often time as good or better than the professionally made ones. It is a pretty powerful editor and I have seen the game turned into a First Person Shooter which was pretty mind blowing but honestly not that fun. There is tons of user created content to go through however the PC version has their own community that is separate from the Xbox version. That is really unfortunate since the Xbox version has been out much longer and has some amazing user created levels. Nonetheless what is here is typically pretty good and you will not be running low on tracks to play anytime soon.\n\nAside from your typical tracks you can play through a variety of “Skill Games” which massively change up the core gameplay with crazy ideas such as attaching a rocket booster to your bike, riding on ski gear or flying a UFO. They are very creative and a ton of fun to play through a few times though they lose their appeal quickly. If you are low on medals they can be a lifesaver since they are usually easier to get gold on and there are a ton of skill games to swift through. The other mode is a simple tournament that has you riding through a gauntlet of tracks in order to gain some medals. Each track has their own leader-boards where you can compete against friends and strangers as well as a feature where you can upload your playthrough of the level directly to Youtube. There is just so much content to the game that you'll likely be playing it for a long time if the gameplay is to your liking. A demo is available on the Steam store page which is rare for a PC game but much appreciated and allows you to see if this is your cup of tea before buying. If you have the option of buying these games on the Xbox 360 I would suggest getting them there as Trials HD would feature its original soundtrack and Trails Evolution has some really cool exclusive DLC for it. If not, Trials Evolution: Gold Edition is still jam packed with content and is a very unique, addicting game that everyone should give a shot.","February 16","true","9.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

I Originally got this because it was only 5 dollars as the Winter sale was going, Which i later find out that 5 dollars was a great deal for such a great game like this. Trials HD and Trials Evolution was Originally on Xbox Live Arcade, I used to play Trials HD alot, although i never played Trials Evolution, until now. Trials Evolution Gold Edition is basically Trials HD and Trials Evolution in one game, which is great. Now here is what i have to say about it.\n\nIts a Great Game, it has Great Graphics, Great Enviroments, Great Challenging Tracks, And Great Challenges/Minigames. Although the game looks amazing, It kinda Lags on my computer, but you can always change that by the Options of course.\nI often find myself Trying to beat Tracks without dying, which takes Lots of Restarting to do. There isnt anything better than to see Gold Medals on most of the Tracks. As Far as the Gameplay goes, Its Wonderful, Although the Controls arent the best, they are still ok, once you Get Used to them. The Music isnt that good, it wasn't as good as Trials HD's Music.\n\nThe Track Editor is a Really nice feature to this game, It Lets you make your Track anywhere you want in this Huge Open Area, Along with Nice Ambience. It takes alot of Practice to actually learn to make a Track, but once you get used to the controls, Its actually really fun.\n\nAnother Amazing Feature is Customization, You can Color your Bike, Buy Parts for it, And you can also Buy Clothes and Color Clothes for the Biker. How you get Money is, You just play Tracks, and Getting Medals is something that gives you alot of Money as well.\n\nOverall, I Find this game to almost being one of My Favorite games I own on Steam. Everything about this Game is pretty much Golden (Thats pretty Ironic) and for that, im going to Rate 9.5/10.","January 3, 2014","true","129.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Practice makes perfect in physics based games like this and the satisfaction when you finally get a Gold or Platinum on Hard or Extreme is unrivaled. The graphics and levels are fantastic and the skill games are very fun. It is a hard game to put down once you start playing. You really need a controller for this....actually two because you'll most likely break at least one joystick while trying not to faceplant.","March 16","true","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Trials is one of the older racer platformers but i gotta say if does it very well indeed. In this game you need skill and you`ll need to cross that finish line but hell, does it fell good when you do. You can also costomize maps, create your own and try out other peoples maps and if had a few that are VERY fun. Then alsoyou can costomize your character, race long enough get pionts and unlock amazing things like TE:GE wallpaper to even a space suit. Then as a bonus, you get multiplayer 1v3 for a total of 4 players compete with or against your friends show off your ride and even get user created content on there race bmx`s to anywhere your mind takes you.

By the time of writing this review I have only created one track using the editor. Once you get used to how making a track works it will get easier the more you make. Some of the maps can be very long (15 minutes) and some can be very short (30 seconds.) If you ever get bored with the main places then you can go download player made maps. There are a ton of them and you will not get bored playing them. If you rage very easily I do NOT recommend this game but, if you have patience and is not easily enraged then I do recommend this game.\n\nAlso, there are very little graphics settings.

If you waited for this as long as I did, then it's everything you hoped it'd be. Higher resolution textures and gaming specific to the PC version (it's in beta, so it's not perfect yet), and MORE than 30 FPS (I know, right? "Wowww!" you're thinking, I totally get that) make it instantly better, in my opinion. It's crazy, extremely crazy side-scroll racing fun. And you can play it with 3 other friends or go up against randoms in various race mode types. If you've waited for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ XBOX exclusivity of this game to expire, well... get this damn game, because it has.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smeeeth/recommended/220160/","Smeeeth","Handsome Squidward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smeeeth/","157 products in account","Trials Evolution on the Xbox 360 is my favorite video game of all time. I am ranked around 6000th on the overall leaderboard, and have devoted over 4 days of my time to getting platinum on every track in the game.\nThis PC port, however, is severely lacking. If you haven't used it before, the UPlay interface is atrocious, and its pitiful that Ubisoft requires their 3rd party software for all their games. The menu navigation is clearly designed for controllers, as sometimes you click things, but other times you are required to use the arrow keys (not WASD, arrow keys only) to navigate the menus and then hit enter to select. To be frank, if you are not playing with a controller with analog triggers, you are not playing the game correctly, but for those who don't have them they should be able to navigate menus effectively with a mouse.\nDo NOT buy this game if you do not meet the RECOMMENDED requirements (if you have any doubts, give the demo a try). As a 360 port, this game was built to run on certain hardware, and if you don't have the hardware, it will perform VERY poorly. For some reason, the game engine is tied to a 60 fps framerate, and if you dip below that (believe me, if you don't meet the recommended requirements you will not reach 60 fps) the game suffers from severe stuttering, rendering it unplayable for some. With limited graphical settings to mess with, this isn't a problem you can fix, and it doesn't seem to be a problem Ubisoft or RedLynx is willing to address.\nIf you meet the recommended requirements, you should absolutely buy this game. It is a perfect blend of developed gameplay with great arcadey elements with great online leaderboard integration. The multiplayer has some problems, but the mere fact that they let you play user-generated tracks with your friends makes up for it as far as I am concerned.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smeeeth/recommended/220160/","Smeeeth","Handsome Squidward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smeeeth/","157 products in account","Trials Evolution on the Xbox 360 is my favorite video game of all time. I am ranked around 6000th on the overall leaderboard, and have devoted over 4 days of my time to getting platinum on every track in the game.\nThis PC port, however, is severely lacking. If you haven't used it before, the UPlay interface is atrocious, and its pitiful that Ubisoft requires their 3rd party software for all their games. The menu navigation is clearly designed for controllers, as sometimes you click things, but other times you are required to use the arrow keys (not WASD, arrow keys only) to navigate the menus and then hit enter to select. To be frank, if you are not playing with a controller with analog triggers, you are not playing the game correctly, but for those who don't have them they should be able to navigate menus effectively with a mouse.\nDo NOT buy this game if you do not meet the RECOMMENDED requirements (if you have any doubts, give the demo a try). As a 360 port, this game was built to run on certain hardware, and if you don't have the hardware, it will perform VERY poorly. For some reason, the game engine is tied to a 60 fps framerate, and if you dip below that (believe me, if you don't meet the recommended requirements you will not reach 60 fps) the game suffers from severe stuttering, rendering it unplayable for some. With limited graphical settings to mess with, this isn't a problem you can fix, and it doesn't seem to be a problem Ubisoft or RedLynx is willing to address.\nIf you meet the recommended requirements, you should absolutely buy this game. It is a perfect blend of developed gameplay with great arcadey elements with great online leaderboard integration. The multiplayer has some problems, but the mere fact that they let you play user-generated tracks with your friends makes up for it as far as I am concerned. A robust track creator will keep the hardcore fans content for years to come. Its a shame that this version is bogged down by poor controls, UPlay, and a general laziness in porting the game engine.","December 27, 2013","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's got some decent graphics, amazingly diverse settings, fun customisation (if you're into that), but the real shiner here is the gameplay. There's four core controls: accelerate, brake, lean forward and lean backward. It's a case much like Tetris back in the day: amazingly easy to learn, but infuriatingly hard to master. The first few levels will see you holding down accelerate and just soaring through the levels, but once you hit mid-game, you'll start sweating. It's amazing what a diverse collection of manoeuvres you can pull off with such simple controls, and everything in the game is tailored so that you can clearly see your objective, but it's up to you to see how you'll get there. It's just marvelous to really feel yourself becoming procedurally better as the game becomes harder in tandem.\nIt's got some fun score-based minigames which make good use of the game's physics and gimmicks, and a multiplayer that's great, at least when it works and there's people online.\nThe level editor deserves a mention. It's mind-boggling to see what some people can conjure up from it. I'm no designing whiz, but having a look and play through some of the community levels, it's clear that it has some great potential, and some people even manage to make all new gamemodes in it. Consider this when you are doubting to buy this, since you're practically buying a king-size DLC map-pack with it, adding to the already impressive amount of levels in the game.\n\nDo not doubt to buy this, just do it.","December 25, 2013","true","16.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're a completionist trying to get Gold medals (or better) on every challenge, you will be brought to actual tears.\n\nThe Uplay client is horrible in practice and is unavoidably required to play the game. This isn't a Uplay review so I'll keep this short, I would highly encourage disabling Cloud Sync in the Uplay client to ensure your saves aren't being mucked around with. I lost an entire day's worth of progress and had to redo a dozen or so of the more difficult challenges because of syncronization issues I experienced (Jan 2014). Luckily I had a semi-recent backup of my save stored locally.\n\nOnce you get past that, you'll find Trials Evolution to be about as much fun as Pooh would find rolling around in a tub full of honey. It isn't without issues, but the overall experience is cerebral, there's a level of maneuverability that becomes essential for success - a symbiotic relationship that grows between you, your bike and it's rider as you learn from your mistakes.\n\nThere are moments:\n\nFlying through the air on a dirt bike at full speed, gliding smoothly over a ramp to accelerate at just the right speed, narrowly avoiding instant death by eeking out one final backflip just before landing on the other side of a gap otherwise insurmountable;\n\nClimbing up nearly vertical walls, hopping across elevated platforms above a pit with no floor from a stopped position, loop-de-looping into and out of a loop-de-loop of loop-de-loops.\n\nIt's magic, and what makes Trials Evolution worth every minute of agonizing failure.\n\nA couple of final notes:\n\nSome of the menus are confusing and don't always appear to behave as expected. I was disappointed by the lack of an option to restore my bike's colours to factory defaults for instance. Other things like customizing your bike's individual parts appear inaccesible if you're playing with a controller (you can use a mouse to click on parts displaying a wrench icon to access these sub-menus). In a sense it doesn't feel like the project was fully presented as a product for PC users but rather a quick port.\n\nPart and parcel with the above point, setting up a multiplayer game doesn't need to be this silly. Not only are you navigating in-game menus, you're also fumbling between overlays!\n\nTexture pop-in is as bad in this game as it was for Halo 2 (xbox) at launch. Just about every stage suffers from it (especially at the start of races) in addition to the occasional slowdown. Pretend the slowdown is (intentional) dramatic presentation and you're golden.\n\nThe music is in your face and obnoxious: Who commissioned a rap about how badass playing a game about dirt biking is? Some might like it but I turned the music volume almost completely down after about 9 hours of play time - my brain just couldn't take it anymore.\n\nThe developers appear to be fairly open to patching the game so hopefully some of the kinks are worked out in due course.\n\nBottomline: I'm in no position to tell you how to spend your money, but if I'm coming over and you've got Trials Evolution, I'm playing.","January 21, 2014","true","52.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It isn't without issues, but the overall experience is cerebral, there's a level of maneuverability that becomes essential for success - a symbiotic relationship that grows between you, your bike and it's rider as you learn from your mistakes.\n\nThere are moments:\n\nFlying through the air on a dirt bike at full speed, gliding smoothly over a ramp to accelerate at just the right speed, narrowly avoiding instant death by eeking out one final backflip just before landing on the other side of a gap otherwise insurmountable;\n\nClimbing up nearly vertical walls, hopping across elevated platforms above a pit with no floor from a stopped position, loop-de-looping into and out of a loop-de-loop of loop-de-loops.\n\nIt's magic, and what makes Trials Evolution worth every minute of agonizing failure.\n\nA couple of final notes:\n\nSome of the menus are confusing and don't always appear to behave as expected. I was disappointed by the lack of an option to restore my bike's colours to factory defaults for instance. Other things like customizing your bike's individual parts appear inaccesible if you're playing with a controller (you can use a mouse to click on parts displaying a wrench icon to access these sub-menus). In a sense it doesn't feel like the project was fully presented as a product for PC users but rather a quick port.\n\nPart and parcel with the above point, setting up a multiplayer game doesn't need to be this silly. Not only are you navigating in-game menus, you're also fumbling between overlays!\n\nTexture pop-in is as bad in this game as it was for Halo 2 (xbox) at launch. Just about every stage suffers from it (especially at the start of races) in addition to the occasional slowdown. Pretend the slowdown is (intentional) dramatic presentation and you're golden.\n\nThe music is in your face and obnoxious: Who commissioned a rap about how badass playing a game about dirt biking is? Some might like it but I turned the music volume almost completely down after about 9 hours of play time - my brain just couldn't take it anymore.\n\nThe developers appear to be fairly open to patching the game so hopefully some of the kinks are worked out in due course.\n\nBottomline: I'm in no position to tell you how to spend your money, but if I'm coming over and you've got Trials Evolution, I'm playing.","January 21, 2014","true","52.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Getting only Gold medals is going to take you a long, long time. The goal of Trials is to get your motorbike to the other side of the track as fast as possible and, if possible, without falling. The tracks are 2.5D, so it's all 3D but you'll be riding in one direction. Like I said, it looks simple, and it starts off simple, but gets hard really fast and certain tracks will take you hours, maybe even days, to master.\n\nThe tracks, by the way, look awesome and are cleverly made. The game in general looks pretty sweet, but it does suffer from the occasional FPS drops, without good reason. Messy, but forgivable.\nRestarting a checkpoint or track is pretty much instant, which is important for a game like this. You'll keep playing and playing until you won that one bike or finished that one tournament. It's really addictive. In a good sort of way.\n\nI'd gladly recommend Trials. It's a game anyone can enjoy, even if it's for just a few tracks.\n\n[Rating: 85/100]","May 10, 2013","true","7.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

I was addicted to Trials HD on the Xbox Live Arcade when it released in 2009. The game felt like it was meant to be played on a controller, since you like you had more control over your bike. It made me sad when I saw that Trials Evolution was only coming to the XBL once again since I jumped to the PC platform at that point, and I was tempted to buy it regardless of minimal play time on Xbox since I enjoyed Trials HD so much. I am SO glad that I waited to buy it, because you are getting two games for the price of once! This version includes the tracks from Trials HD as well as the fresh ones (though they haven't added the DLC tracks from Trials HD.) I tried playing the game with the keyboard, and it just didn't feel right since I played Trials HD on X360. If you like racing games, then definitely pick this game up. It's a blast to play with friends, and has a really awesome track creator.","March 7, 2013","true","34.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game is based alll around timing and precision so when these factors are broken to begin with it is nigh impossible to play and extremely aggravating.\n\nThe game also uses a clunky uPlay DRM launcher, not a massive issue for me, but yet another stepping stone unfortunately.\n\nBefore buying do a search on the forums and discussions to see if there have been any fixes for the game yet as currently it is in an unplayable state for many.","January 7, 2014","false","26.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Regardless of if you can tollerate uplay or not uplay is a plague, uplay ruins gaming experiance and uplay takes advantage of Steam. Either stick to uplay or rely on Steams DRM. uplay games on Steam are going to be the death of Steam.\n\nIf you can overlook or tollerate uplay restricting your access to your games constantly thehn this is great buy.

I've enjoyed playing trials since it was a little flash game on miniclips. I was eager to give this new game a try since it has been exclusive to the xbox. Overall it's a great game, the underlining mechanic is still solid and very enjoyable, the addition of the skill course where you do silly stuff and eaaily access user generated content makes this feel fresh. However, the included Uplay DRM is terrible, you have to make an account with Ubisoft, the game load it everytime you play and instead of steam achievements and cloudsave, Ubisoft decided to do it themselves. Most of the time the cloud save works but I've had instance where it didn't save my progress (only lost 1 or 2 track). Achivements are useless since no one see it and it burry in the terrible UI. The worst thing about Uplay though is the unresponsiveness of the server, the game attempt to save your score after everytrack and it can take anywhere from 5 to 30 s because it has to sync with the server, it basically killed the momentum of the game especially when you just want to jump right back in. User generated contents are awesome but it also very slow and laggy to browse and download. I have to sadly give this amazing game a no for recommendation. If Ubisoft come to their sense and get rid of the terrible Uplay this game is a must own.","January 2, 2014","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let's go through the reasons why.\n\n1.  The graphics - Okay so the graphics aren't terrible, the problem lies in the game engine.  You'll have to force your video card to run at full throttle if you have a modern graphics card.  For whatever reason this game will not trigger full utilization of my graphics cards.  Another huge problem is that textures pop in and out, from blurry to sharp.  Objects will pop as well.  This makes this game very irritating to play since you need to see the things in front of you in order to know how to approach the next jump.  This brings us to our next problem.\n\n2. The camera - I understand that this is a console port, and like every other crappy Ubi console port it suffers.  This was evidenced in the graphics and is also apparent in the view with which the game is presented in.  It's essentially like a 3D version of the NES classic Excitebike where the view is from the side.  However, the viewing angle is schewed a little more toward 70 - 80 degrees.  This is very annoying and does not allow you to complete many of the levels on the first attempt.  Granted the levels are divided into segments via checkpoints which you can "reset" to when you inevitably crash.  Which brings us to...\n\n3.  Level Design - Get ready for some of the most repetitive gameplay ever, with only very small variations on the gas / lean / jump theme.  Some levels have some humor to them, and at the end of every track your guy dies in assorted fashions, but the novelty wears off.  Some of the levels are just plain infuriating, having predetermind events that affect the layout of the course, often with varying results.  Speaking of varying results...\n\n4.  Physics - Or complete lack thereof.  I still can't figure out why your bike sometimes will act as if it has weight to it like a real motorcycle, yet other times its as if it is floating on a single point that refuses to stabilize.  For example, you can land a jump and your bike seems to be planted and you can give it gas and it responds as it should.  Another time you can land off that same jump and your bike is almost uncontrolable and just wants to flip backwards no matter how delicate you apply the gas.  It makes no sense and ruins the game very easily.\n\n5. - Controls - Quite possibly my biggest complaint with this game.  So you control the balance of the bike with gas, brake, and lunge/lean.  I say lunge/lean and not just lean because there is no way for you to gently lean your bike forward.  Any bit of input toward the right results in your rider thrusting his face over the handlebars.  Which interferes with blancing landings and climbing wills since this motion will pull your back wheel off the ground and usually results in an endo.\n\n6. - Uplay - Is a joke.  If you've ever had to use Uplay then you understand.  Whats the point of buying the game on Steam if we're forced to use Uplay?\n\nSave yourself some money and go find an old copy of Motorcross Madness.  That is a much more entertaining game and is over a decade old.  Oh and textures won't pop in and out...","January 12, 2014","false","20.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My older PC, which could play many last generation games such as this with high levels of detail, could not play this game.

Now before you disagree let me explain...\n\nIt isn't that the game itself is bad, it isn't. BUT THE GAME DOESN'T EVEN RUN ON STEAM! It runs on Uplay, another gaming hub made by ubisoft. Because of this, you have to create a seperate Uplay account and install Uplay to even get it up and running.\n\nAfter you get into the game, very few user made levels will load for you. The game itself is great though, so it's really a shame that it has so many issues outside of the actual gameplay. Sometimes, after crashing during a run, the game will say that you have a new personal record even if you have made it much further than that run. You could even crash on the starting line and get a record! This causes a ton of wait time as you have to wait for the new best time to process and save before restarting the level.\n\nThe MAIN problem that I had was that even after exiting the game and completely closing Uplay, steam still said I was in game. This is a MAJOR issue. There was no way to take myself out of the game, and this made it impossible to play another game on steam or even close steam. Even going to the task manager and ending the application didn't work. Only restarting my computer finally took me out of the game and that simply cannot happen every time you want to play Trials. That's just a terrible port.","December 26, 2013","false","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let's go through the reasons why.\n\n1.  The graphics - Okay so the graphics aren't terrible, the problem lies in the game engine.  You'll have to force your video card to run at full throttle if you have a modern graphics card.  For whatever reason this game will not trigger full utilization of my graphics cards.  Another huge problem is that textures pop in and out, from blurry to sharp.  Objects will pop as well.  This makes this game very irritating to play since you need to see the things in front of you in order to know how to approach the next jump.  This brings us to our next problem.\n\n2. The camera - I understand that this is a console port, and like every other crappy Ubi console port it suffers.  This was evidenced in the graphics and is also apparent in the view with which the game is presented in.  It's essentially like a 3D version of the NES classic Excitebike where the view is from the side.  However, the viewing angle is schewed a little more toward 70 - 80 degrees.  This is very annoying and does not allow you to complete many of the levels on the first attempt.  Granted the levels are divided into segments via checkpoints which you can "reset" to when you inevitably crash.  Which brings us to...\n\n3.  Level Design - Get ready for some of the most repetitive gameplay ever, with only very small variations on the gas / lean / jump theme.  Some levels have some humor to them, and at the end of every track your guy dies in assorted fashions, but the novelty wears off.  Some of the levels are just plain infuriating, having predetermind events that affect the layout of the course, often with varying results.  Speaking of varying results...\n\n4.  Physics - Or complete lack thereof.  I still can't figure out why your bike sometimes will act as if it has weight to it like a real motorcycle, yet other times its as if it is floating on a single point that refuses to stabilize.  For example, you can land a jump and your bike seems to be planted and you can give it gas and it responds as it should.  Another time you can land off that same jump and your bike is almost uncontrolable and just wants to flip backwards no matter how delicate you apply the gas.  It makes no sense and ruins the game very easily.\n\n5. - Controls - Quite possibly my biggest complaint with this game.  So you control the balance of the bike with gas, brake, and lunge/lean.  I say lunge/lean and not just lean because there is no way for you to gently lean your bike forward.  Any bit of input toward the right results in your rider thrusting his face over the handlebars.  Which interferes with blancing landings and climbing wills since this motion will pull your back wheel off the ground and usually results in an endo.\n\n6. - Uplay - Is a joke.  If you've ever had to use Uplay then you understand.  Whats the point of buying the game on Steam if we're forced to use Uplay?\n\nSave yourself some money and go find an old copy of Motorcross Madness.  That is a much more entertaining game and is over a decade old.  Oh and textures won't pop in and out...","January 12, 2014","false","20.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My older PC, which could play many last generation games such as this with high levels of detail, could not play this game.

I've enjoyed playing trials since it was a little flash game on miniclips. I was eager to give this new game a try since it has been exclusive to the xbox. Overall it's a great game, the underlining mechanic is still solid and very enjoyable, the addition of the skill course where you do silly stuff and eaaily access user generated content makes this feel fresh. However, the included Uplay DRM is terrible, you have to make an account with Ubisoft, the game load it everytime you play and instead of steam achievements and cloudsave, Ubisoft decided to do it themselves. Most of the time the cloud save works but I've had instance where it didn't save my progress (only lost 1 or 2 track). Achivements are useless since no one see it and it burry in the terrible UI. The worst thing about Uplay though is the unresponsiveness of the server, the game attempt to save your score after everytrack and it can take anywhere from 5 to 30 s because it has to sync with the server, it basically killed the momentum of the game especially when you just want to jump right back in. User generated contents are awesome but it also very slow and laggy to browse and download. I have to sadly give this amazing game a no for recommendation. If Ubisoft come to their sense and get rid of the terrible Uplay this game is a must own.","January 2, 2014","false","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't worry this game doesnt use directx only features, it just limits you to 1280x720 if you can only support DX10.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS.

Unfortunately not only does it use Uplay which is annoying for anyone who hates third parties and account that need to be created. But Trials Evolution developers have decided that the graphics card that millions of people like myself use are "inferior" and if we have that graphics card we can not play. The graphics card I talk of is intel which is a popular brand and is perfectly fine running other games I own. If you do use Intel graphics card do not get this game because it will resemble being on LSD. A stupid choice by the developers that means everyone in my situation that has bought the game is unable to fix the problem without spending an insane amount of money on a new graphic card. Thank god I got this lump of **** in the sales.","December 26, 2013","false","2.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Was waiting to acquire this game for quite a while cause I loved the first one and it's such a mess, performance wise. It's complete garbage, hot garbage! It's obviously a non-optimized console port, from the Xbox 360 era, you can clearly notice it from the first slideshow of a playthrough. I can play all kinds of games old and new, and this game plays like crap. If this was some sort of turn-based game, well... performance wouldn't be really much an issue but being a Trials game it requires precision, fluidity and smooth framerates at all times and all of that is missing. Plus it's ridden with u-caca, that p.o.s. DRM platform by Ubisoft, it's even more intrusive and bothersome here than it is in the acceptable and enjoyable Driver: San Francisco game, for whatever reason.\n\nI recommend to skip this game and instead just get Trials 2: Second Edition, it's still fun and plays really well.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Uplay is EXTREMELY BUGGY and in some cases won't work at all, and if Uplay doesn't work, neither will Trials. They ARE working to fix it, but I don't think it will be any time soon.\n\nNext, Trails is a poorly ported Xbox360 game, so they are STILL doing bug fixes. Even on the highest end computers it will have a jitter effect, because the game is locked on 60 fps (Which is good if it's on a console, not if it's on a computer.) They ARE working on a fix, but I doubt it will work the first try so it will be a while before they get it sorted out, if at all. For me, the jitter effect is small enough that the game is playable, but it still annoys me.\n\nHere's why you SHOULD buy it:\n\nThe game is amazing, the graphics are great for such a simple game, and the customization in the game is astounding. The game can be a lot of things, it's not just a motorcycle game, there are plenty of options to choose from. The online gameplay is really smooth, and connection problems don't seem to be an issue from what I've seen. Singleplayer has tons of gameplay put into it, and it does have a level of difficulty, but not enough to leave you stuck. It makes sure you are putting some effort into it, though, which is very nice for a game. It certaintly isn't a waste of money, and I'm sure it will be expanded on and improved, especially with bug fixes and whatnot.","June 12, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I purchased this game already for the Xbox 360 when it came out and had a great time with it. Since I loved it so much I bought it a second time so I can play it on my PC. I made a mistake thinking I'd get the same experience with this version.\n\nUnfortunately it was a $20 poorly invested. This is a shantily put together PC port. Despite my machine having more than enough power to run this game, I can't even get this thing to run at my monitor's native resolution (1920x1080). I've done research and found this has to due with cards that can't run DirectX11. Only the thing is, my card DOES run Dx11, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nEven so, running it at a vastly lower resolution, the game is still choppy, ugly and unplayable. Throw in the fact that you have to run this crap using Ubisoft's crappy Uplay software, I find it extremely difficult to recommend this product to PC gamers.\n\nIf you own a console, buy it on there.

It's wonderful. It's not about going fast and getting to the finish line, it's about finesse. It's one of those games where you may have to replay a section a million times to get the best times for a gold medal, but it never ceases to be fun while you're doing it. I picked it up because it somewhat reminded me of the time I spent playing Excite Bike on the Nintendo. Those were very good times, and this game delivers the same caliber of enjoyment.","May 10, 2013","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mostly buy arcady games only if they have multiplayer, and this one was taged as multiplayer & also had multiplayer listed in its features. so when i tryed to access multiplayer i started getting Errors: "steam is not connected for some reason" & "could not connect with Uplay"... so after a few port forwardings (nothing unusual ) i tried again, now i got live content in the lobby but when i tried searching ,ultiplayer game... it got stuck in an endless searching quest for player, that never yielded results. so i figured eather there are no player at all in multiplayer, because they all got fed up trying, or something is seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up with the netcode of this game.\n\nSo putting behind the non existing multiplayer... the game itself is freaking awsome. its that game i used play in my schools library when i was a teenager, onlly much more fun. The game is hillariously funny trying new concepts with this classic retro platformer, introducing stuff beyond just motorcycling, you have fuuny stuff like sky jumping, and funny missions like launghing yourself trying to fly with two cardboards attached to your hand. the ragdoll animations are hilarious. i find my self LOLing a lot in this game. its intense and fun. i highly recommend it for its single player campaign which will provide you with hours uppon hours of fun. Its a high production value on a classic retro game which everyone loves.\n\n8/10","December 1, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As everyone says, this is way better than "Trials Fusion", I can give pros about Trials evolution in so many perspectives and ways! For example.......\n\n-You can really feel the weight of the bike once you lean back and fourth, and I really like that realism!!\n\nEVEN LITTLE THINGS MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE, SUCH AS......\n\n-The layout of the main screen and the missions selection.\n\nALSO HOW MUCH CONTENT IS IN A GAME, SUCH AS........\n\n- Trials Evolution has over 100 challenges and carrer missions (that i know of) to play.\n\nAND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THE FEATURES THAT COME WITH THE GAME, SUCH AS.........\n\n- Multiplayer - Best Experience, Played with others\n- Track Editor - You can customize a world to your likings, AND SHARE IT!\n- Indoor AND Outdoor Environments - For the most realism in a 2D bike game :P\n- Bike AND Rider Customizations - (Again) Customize your character AND your bike to your likings\n- Global Competition - Compet with others' (ghost AND global scores on the Maps you play)\n\nAND A KEY FEATURE NOT REPRESENTED IN THE "Key Features"......\n\n- You can - Replay AND Upload - EVERYTHING what happened before you died on a certain map. (Included in Multiplay AND Singleplayer)\n\nIn Conclusion: Trials evolution is the game for you, IF all these have reached your expectations, or just buy it, its only $19.99.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkXDragon/recommended/220160/","DarkXDragon","[Titan] Dark X Dragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkXDragon/","879 products in account","I bought the PC prequel to this game, Trials 2, in a Steam sale years ago and it was one of the most dangerous purchases I have ever made. It is in my nature to get addicted to incredibly hard and frustrating skill games and it is one of the best. I have very little bad to say about that game.\n\nThe sequel moved to 360, which was really sad and upsetting that they ditched the fan base that supported them. After a few years, they announced the return to PC which was good news! It uses Uplay which is fine but I would prefer that it didn't. I would prefer full integration with Steam friends.\n\nThen it arrived. I started playing it. I got addicted again. I was 100% most of the game. I hated the game but couldn't stop playing it. Most of this came down to the horrible bugginess of the game. It would have huge FPS drops and jitter. The black and white level is almost unplayable. In a game that requires accurate timing, the bugs required me to mess up over and over again. The replays were also useless and didn't work properly.\n\nI will move away from the bugs to the actual gameplay.\n\nI much prefer playing on keyboard. Some of the harder levels with really steep inclines clearly were more designed for a controller but are possible with keyboard after pain staking trial and error.\nThe dynamic camera in the game is frustrating, I much preferred Trials 2 static side on camera. In this game, it is common to have blind jumps that you have to memorize.\nThe one level that is 18 minutes long (If I remember rightly), is horrible. I don't like having to repeat a level that long.\n\nOtherwise, this game is amazing. The level designs are great. Controls feel satisfying. 100% this game is incredibly hard and equally satisfying and I did get very addicted.\n\nI will say I do recommend this game but it is a gamble with the bugs. If you have an older graphics card, I imagine the gamble is higher.","March 22, 2013","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is probably the only game by Ubisoft that made me not slam my face into my keyboard. The game makes a pretty good first impression. You click play and some kickass rock n' roll music fills the main menu. After customizing your rider with a variety of colors, it's time to hit the track!\n\nThe controls are very easy to master: arrows keys. That's it. The game feels like those old Flash games with the little biker trying to get to the other side of the screen. There are 2 campaigns to play, one consisting of a variety of motocross (and non-motocross events that don't even involve a bike) and the other campaign taking place in a warehouse full of explosions, and you're driving in the middle of it. The difficulty of this game creates a wonderful challenge for such a simple game!\n\nThe game engine seems to work somewhat well, and the level editor even allows you to make more than tracks with motorcycles. For example, there is an entire campaign consisting of random minigames, one involoing making a metal ball roll down a pipe. There are glitches in the game like the bike floating on top of track instead of the wheels fully touching the ground and falling through tracks, but they are rather rare. The Steam connection breaks when you try to enter multiplayer, but quick matches work fine. Downloading the game also requires downloading Uplay (Ubisoft's version of Steam that is a pain).\n\nIn conclusion, this addicting game is fun to play, but the normal price is way too high. The game seems to only be a good buy when I got it at the Holiday Sale.\n\nI'll give it an 8.5/10\n\nStay tuned for more reviews!","January 7, 2014","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no other game out there (or atleast done this good) in this genre, and Trials just also happened to hit the nail on the head. The physics doesn't make it seem like your floating about space, and the graphics are just good enough so that they don't detract from the gameplay. However, this game is not completely flawless. Trials, which was originally made for the Xbox Live Arcade, really works well on Xbox with the analog sticks, but not so much on PC. At times, the arrow controls seem a bit unresponsive, and brings out the other big issue; rage. It's not the developers fault, however, but I am just warning you that there will be some form of rage once you get to the harder tracks. Overall, it is a good game though, and I would recommend this game.","April 5, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kinda. Not really. Well. Anyways, it's dissapointing, but only as a port. Ignoring the lie that is "Gold Edition" you have probably THE best racing game ever. No, really. This game is a Redlynx game, so it's harder than titanium and is really less about racing and more about platforming with a bike. The environments are varied and DANG are they beautiful. There's also a really good multiplayer mode that leads to hilarious fun. The game will take a while to complete, even longer to get gold on all tracks, and if you want to 100% it then give up if you're impatient. It cranks up the difficulty 10X from the first game (yes that is possible) and allows for much easier track sharing, so you can have almost impossible tracks to play that probably took 7 years straight to make. But god, are they beautiful. In fact, the only problem I can find is that it's really CPU intensive. Now, as a port..... well. The options are good, but for a "Gold Edition" it lacks the expected DLC and there is no compatibility with the 360 Track Central. However, you do get the entirety of the original first game, which is actually a really nice touch, but honestly the original game wasn't exactly expensive, so having the DLC come with the gold edition and having 360 compatability would have been pretty nice. Anyways, I would give it a buy, and then buy a stress ball or 2... thousand.\n9/10","February 13, 2014","true","24.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is in my nature to get addicted to incredibly hard and frustrating skill games and it is one of the best. I have very little bad to say about that game.\n\nThe sequel moved to 360, which was really sad and upsetting that they ditched the fan base that supported them. After a few years, they announced the return to PC which was good news! It uses Uplay which is fine but I would prefer that it didn't. I would prefer full integration with Steam friends.\n\nThen it arrived. I started playing it. I got addicted again. I was 100% most of the game. I hated the game but couldn't stop playing it. Most of this came down to the horrible bugginess of the game. It would have huge FPS drops and jitter. The black and white level is almost unplayable. In a game that requires accurate timing, the bugs required me to mess up over and over again. The replays were also useless and didn't work properly.\n\nI will move away from the bugs to the actual gameplay.\n\nI much prefer playing on keyboard. Some of the harder levels with really steep inclines clearly were more designed for a controller but are possible with keyboard after pain staking trial and error.\nThe dynamic camera in the game is frustrating, I much preferred Trials 2 static side on camera. In this game, it is common to have blind jumps that you have to memorize.\nThe one level that is 18 minutes long (If I remember rightly), is horrible. I don't like having to repeat a level that long.\n\nOtherwise, this game is amazing. The level designs are great. Controls feel satisfying. 100% this game is incredibly hard and equally satisfying and I did get very addicted.\n\nI will say I do recommend this game but it is a gamble with the bugs. If you have an older graphics card, I imagine the gamble is higher.","March 22, 2013","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have very little bad to say about that game.\n\nThe sequel moved to 360, which was really sad and upsetting that they ditched the fan base that supported them. After a few years, they announced the return to PC which was good news! It uses Uplay which is fine but I would prefer that it didn't. I would prefer full integration with Steam friends.\n\nThen it arrived. I started playing it. I got addicted again. I was 100% most of the game. I hated the game but couldn't stop playing it. Most of this came down to the horrible bugginess of the game. It would have huge FPS drops and jitter. The black and white level is almost unplayable. In a game that requires accurate timing, the bugs required me to mess up over and over again. The replays were also useless and didn't work properly.\n\nI will move away from the bugs to the actual gameplay.\n\nI much prefer playing on keyboard. Some of the harder levels with really steep inclines clearly were more designed for a controller but are possible with keyboard after pain staking trial and error.\nThe dynamic camera in the game is frustrating, I much preferred Trials 2 static side on camera. In this game, it is common to have blind jumps that you have to memorize.\nThe one level that is 18 minutes long (If I remember rightly), is horrible. I don't like having to repeat a level that long.\n\nOtherwise, this game is amazing. The level designs are great. Controls feel satisfying. 100% this game is incredibly hard and equally satisfying and I did get very addicted.\n\nI will say I do recommend this game but it is a gamble with the bugs. If you have an older graphics card, I imagine the gamble is higher.","March 22, 2013","true","57.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is unplayable due to constant stutters at a consistent interval, they even persist within the UI. I can knock the settings to 640x480 windowed and all effects disabled and the same framerate and stutters exist. I repeat the framerate is unchanged from 1080p AA advanced effects to 640x480 windowed! The quality of this console port is unbelievable! All I want is a refund but Steams policy is clear no refunds are issued. Thanks alot Ubisoft/Steam for still offering this game in a highly popular flash sale while it's unplayable and obviously without the support of the developers Red Lynx. Worst part is it was like this from beta to full release and all patches ignored the problem and all devs gloss over the issue even though the fans called them out. I uploaded a video to show, its much worse In realtime and it creates even worse input lag.

Trial Bike was the game that was fun to fail at just to see those amusing ragdoll physics. Besides that, it consisted of the player attempting to get their rider across a two dimensional course. Trials Evolution is merely an extension of this experience, but in a much more polished and intriguing format.\n\nThere are two modes; career, as well as online and local multiplayer, all of which have a level of depth that was not realized in the free yet fun to play Trial Bike. Career mode sees your rider climb the tiers of your motorcycle licencing system by running test courses for D, C, B, and A class licences respectively. After you complete a licence, you get to participate in a series of tracks that will test the skills you’ve learned while progressing through your licences. These tracks range from beautiful back country vistas to more classic settings like warehouses and construction sites, each are beautiful in their own way. The game has just built on the foundation that its predecessor has laid, not losing its identity along the way. The level of fun you will have while playing Trials evolution are doubled from Trial Bike, with the inclusion of stellar graphics, a fitting heavy alternative rock sound track, and a deep level of rider and bike customisation. You can also play player modded tracks that can often offer a higher level of challenge. Another thing that is charming in its own way is the way that your rider will shout “YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!” and exclaims in other ways that’ll put a smile on your face while you pull off big airs and flips.\n\nTrials Evolution Gold Edition on the pc is a dream both visually and in terms of playability. Keyboard and gamepad work perfectly, and it’s likely that you’ll be maxing out all the graphical bells and whistles while maintaining at least sixty frames per second on a decent rig. While playing split screen multiplayer one player can use keyboard controls while the other uses the gamepad. If you have two gamepads then both players can use them.\n\nTrials Evolution Gold provides a unique driving experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the world of videogames, provides a tremendous amount of good old fun and is a beautiful thing to look at. I urge you to pick this up on Steam or Uplay at full price or if there’s a sale going on even better. Even if you’re not into motorsport in the slightest you will not regret buying this for the hours of fun you’ll receive out of it.\n\n10/10\n\nAlso note that sometime early in the second quarter of 2014 (April 24th) the sequel will be released: Trials Fusion, which promises more of the same but with upgraded visuals I hope, and a whole slew of new tracks set in various settings not featured in this installment such as deserts snow peaked mountains and what looks like futuristic cities. You can pre-order it now if you know you want it.","April 11, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Perfect difficulty curve, great implentation of leaderboards and friends' times and razor sharp controls lead to a real 'just one more go' experience. Also includes a great track editor to lose even more hours in. On the negative side Uplay is a bit of a pain, the frame rate very occasionally drops and the multiplayer tends to reward speed over finesse which is in contrast to the single-player mode. These are tiny gripes though and I can't recommend this game enough to any one with a pulse.","February 27, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no other game out there (or atleast done this good) in this genre, and Trials just also happened to hit the nail on the head. The physics doesn't make it seem like your floating about space, and the graphics are just good enough so that they don't detract from the gameplay. However, this game is not completely flawless. Trials, which was originally made for the Xbox Live Arcade, really works well on Xbox with the analog sticks, but not so much on PC. At times, the arrow controls seem a bit unresponsive, and brings out the other big issue; rage. It's not the developers fault, however, but I am just warning you that there will be some form of rage once you get to the harder tracks. Overall, it is a good game though, and I would recommend this game.","April 5, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uplay is EXTREMELY BUGGY and in some cases won't work at all, and if Uplay doesn't work, neither will Trials. They ARE working to fix it, but I don't think it will be any time soon.\n\nNext, Trails is a poorly ported Xbox360 game, so they are STILL doing bug fixes. Even on the highest end computers it will have a jitter effect, because the game is locked on 60 fps (Which is good if it's on a console, not if it's on a computer.) They ARE working on a fix, but I doubt it will work the first try so it will be a while before they get it sorted out, if at all. For me, the jitter effect is small enough that the game is playable, but it still annoys me.\n\nHere's why you SHOULD buy it:\n\nThe game is amazing, the graphics are great for such a simple game, and the customization in the game is astounding. The game can be a lot of things, it's not just a motorcycle game, there are plenty of options to choose from. The online gameplay is really smooth, and connection problems don't seem to be an issue from what I've seen. Singleplayer has tons of gameplay put into it, and it does have a level of difficulty, but not enough to leave you stuck. It makes sure you are putting some effort into it, though, which is very nice for a game. It certaintly isn't a waste of money, and I'm sure it will be expanded on and improved, especially with bug fixes and whatnot.","June 12, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is probably the only game by Ubisoft that made me not slam my face into my keyboard. The game makes a pretty good first impression. You click play and some kickass rock n' roll music fills the main menu. After customizing your rider with a variety of colors, it's time to hit the track!\n\nThe controls are very easy to master: arrows keys. That's it. The game feels like those old Flash games with the little biker trying to get to the other side of the screen. There are 2 campaigns to play, one consisting of a variety of motocross (and non-motocross events that don't even involve a bike) and the other campaign taking place in a warehouse full of explosions, and you're driving in the middle of it. The difficulty of this game creates a wonderful challenge for such a simple game!\n\nThe game engine seems to work somewhat well, and the level editor even allows you to make more than tracks with motorcycles. For example, there is an entire campaign consisting of random minigames, one involoing making a metal ball roll down a pipe. There are glitches in the game like the bike floating on top of track instead of the wheels fully touching the ground and falling through tracks, but they are rather rare. The Steam connection breaks when you try to enter multiplayer, but quick matches work fine. Downloading the game also requires downloading Uplay (Ubisoft's version of Steam that is a pain).\n\nIn conclusion, this addicting game is fun to play, but the normal price is way too high. The game seems to only be a good buy when I got it at the Holiday Sale.\n\nI'll give it an 8.5/10\n\nStay tuned for more reviews!","January 7, 2014","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
