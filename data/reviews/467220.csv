Good all round fun! I must say i got hooked from when i started my first game, the game is very easy to pick up and using a controller is recommended.\nYou have a Jet pack and your mission is to make your way through the puzzles to the exit and escape.\nThere is lots puzzles to keep you amuzed. You have to use Switches to turn off lasers , Teleports for the obvious , Keys to open the exits and there is also Gems to collect.\nEach level is very similar but they add more twists each time to make it harder and keep you addicted to finishing each level. I think it was 8 worlds total and im only finished the first 2.\n\nThe game is very well built, i could not find any glitches in my time playing it. {Thumbs Up!}\nI would recommend gamers who like this genre give it a go, it def' will not dissapoint.\n\nPros:\n~ Good gameplay\n~ Good graphics, Sounds\n\nCons:\n~ Time will dissapear as you get hooked!\n\nOverall: 8/10","May 22","true","5.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The graphics are retro, but for it’s type of games, which basically were in the begging of the video games industry, are well-designed. The textures are fairly alright. The atmosphere takes place in 8 different areas, each one of them having 8 levels, where they are getting bigger and bigger as the levels are increasing. The audio is well-chosen for this kind of genre. The music is pretty nice as well, it’s very suitable to the game. The gameplay is very simple: fly around the maps, collect a maximum of 3 stars, collect as many diamonds as possible for rewards, throw bombs at your enemies and don’t run out of ammunition very fast. You must reach the end of each level, you must get the required key to firstly open the gate, you also need to travel through portal,  which will lead you to certain places, the maps can get a little confusing because of many portals. The controls are badly optimized, even the mouse is not available, and the keys aren’t put well. You should change them like the following: W – flying up, A – flying left, D – flying right, R – throwing bombs. These are the controls that I used, they are enjoyable and easy-to-click. The engines are alright, I haven’t met any bugs, crashes, screen freezes or frame drops. This game works even with low-performant computers, as the store page says, making it accessible to any gamer. The mechanics are retro, they aren’t something complex. Everything moves on a definitive distance, and comes back in the same point. Overall, it’s a pretty nice game for those who are into retro games and not only.\nPositive Points Pretty nice retro-style graphics\nPretty good SFX and soundtrack\nFun and relaxing gameplay\nMany types of enemies and collectibles\nMany levels to explore (around 64)\nColorful and diversified areas to explore\nPortals make this game even more surprising\nThis game will make you to retry levels which you didn’t get 3 stars on, making it even longer\nMany Steam trading cards available\nDiamonds can offer you bonus improvements on the overall gameplay\nNeutral Points Achievements would make this game more challenging\nMultiple difficulties available would also improve the game\nNegative Points The ammunition for bombs should be more at higher levels\nThe controls are not well-optimized, the mouse isn’t even programmable\nGeneral Ratings\nFeature	Rating	Graphics	70/100	Atmosphere	75/100	Audio	65/100	Music	70/100	Gameplay	68/100	Story	ㅤN/A	Content Quality	70/100	Content Quality	72/100	User Interface	50/100	Controls	45/100	Engines	70/100	Mechanics	68/100	Price Tag	78/100	Personal Rating	67/100","May 20","true","2.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

There are 8 unique and different worlds with 8 levels in each of them, so 64 levels in total. You can choice between 2 heroes, but its just change color, blue or red. As game have word "bomb" in name, easy to guess there many bombs here. Throw them into enemies - a fun activity, really :D If you dont like default controls, like me, you can change it in settings, but only works for keyboard, not for mouse. And Dyna Bomb have a lot of power-ups, what help to complete level more faster. I want only 1 thing: localization for Ukrainian and Russian languages. Maybe in future updates we can see it :) So Dyna Bomb is great game to play, can recommend it","May 13","true","2.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Well this game have some of that vibe but more slow. You have to pick up some Gems per level to complete the level. There are some extra challenges per level , the game mechanics are simple, you can fly and throw bombs to the enemys. You receive 1 hit and you die , so watch out or you have to redo the level thats the dificulty part. You can buy some power ups for the level in the store or play in the slot machine.\nOverall the game is not too long but enjoyable.","May 18","true","3.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/recommended/467220/","underpr1","Undersniper1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/","1265 products in account","Product received for free\n\nThis is a 2d puzzle adventure, action game. Have many addictive things begining by his anime and humor art style toward his sound work. His controls of left-right arrow for movement, jump/jetpack and bomb make the game smooth. This game is very attractive it's looks as well as his gameplay. May require a slighty movement quick fingers and mind because there is limited time. Is perfect to kill some time playing a few hours anytime. It feels a game well done and complete without glitches or things that prevent play well. His framerate is very good and stable. there is a nicely anime background screen with sound but you can mute with more options around. Even in the main menu there is roll to gain one useful treasure/skill between them are seven. Each roll worth 1 x 200 gems each. Useful power ups are ready to use with your gems in game for complex or hard maps. Also you may choose between boy or girl player.\n\nMy experience playing some difficult maps I had to deal straightening the correct sequence to move forward as teleporters confuse you and you managing to where you go and where you come from. It's a bit difficult to explain until one plays himself and realizes. It is a game that looks simple but sometime may give you some hardwork. When collecting treasures around the map may you run out of time and die or just get killed because enemies come in unexpected places. I really like that each level that challenges you to play better. I would recommend this game 10/10.","May 24","true","18.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've played a couple of hours and its very fun. But first, the trailer look pretty bad. It look like it run at 15-20fps, this game doesnt deserve a trailer like that. Hope the developer will fix this!\nBecause this game is really fluid and run very well~ (I wont run fraps for this one, but its a +60fps on my hd intel)\nThere is a least 10 differents languages, its an effort to notice.\nAt the beggining, tutorial is a bit invasive, a screenshoot with all the explanation should be a better way to explain the mechanism of the game.\ndont forget to use the combinaison alt+tab to play fullscreen. (i've played windowed for a couple of round...)\nThe animation of the characters and ennemies are very well done, polished graphics.\nBe patient and explore a bit and you'll find your way in no time (its not a very difficult platformer but you need to learn some level design.. yeah I've die a lot during the first couple of round..no shame in that ^^ )\ntips: try to keep some bomb to avoid some bad situation! teleporter send you to some ennemies spot sometime!\nControls is pretty good and responsive. Another request: Add an option to play with a gamepad? And steam cloud to save game.\n\nBut for the price, this is a very good game~ hope you'll enjoy it!","May 19","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Despite a couple small glitches, the gameplay is solid, it offers a good challange that scales at a good pace, and a good amount of variety with it's eight worlds to play through.
