What greeted me instead was an almost childish flower-picking simulator with the most gorgeous artstyle I ever saw.\n\nAnd I didn't mind.\n\nI bought this game, like some other people, because of the screenshots, and the promise of reliving some of the charm of the games of my childhood. I'm not normally a person who cares much for graphical fidelity in games so long as the gameplay is fun, however in this case? Quite the opposite. Something about the graphics style just makes me innately happy whenever I look at it. It puts my mind to rest for a while, which as a person with depression and anxiety attacks is a bloody godsend. The entire game is very colorful, vivid and nicely stylized, with very fluent animation, adorable little details and an overall just... happy feeling to it. It's easily one of the best-looking games I've played in my life, and it does so not through polygon count, but clever, passionate stylization. Don't get me wrong, though, the models are still pretty high quality.\n\nWith the graphics out of the way, though, let's address gameplay. This is where I initially felt cheated by the storepage claiming such close resemblance to the Zelda and Psychonauts games. I imagined adventuring, clever puzzles and dangerous trials. What I got was "Flower Picking - Collector's Edition", with the 'Collector' being quite literal. This is a game about collecting things and smashing pots. Collect flowers. Collect money. Collect conversation. Collect Collectibles. Every so often you'll fight a spirit, where the term 'fighting' is used much in the same way the term 'Discussion' is used for having a 12-year-old squeak into their microphone online in your FPS of choice. The spirits run away from you, because apparently a 16 year-old hipster florist apprentice is more dangerous than a mystical, 7 feet tall nature spirit with magic powers. Once you've caught up to the spirits, the fighting is technically a long, randomized QTE. They grow flowers from their backs. Sometimes they're good flowers, sometimes they're bad flowers, sometimes they're bombs. A button hovers over them and the game wants you to press the button that hovers over the thing which won't harm you like a parent presenting three hot stove plates and a plushie to their three-year-old and telling them to think fast.\nOccasionally the gameplay is broken up through quests you get from talking carpentry accidents that more often than not involve walking to a specific place or talking to a specific person. Sometimes you need to defeat a certain spirit, which you would probably do anyway sooner or later.\n\nWhat makes the quests, and the game in general interesting are the conversations. Despite the childish flair of the game, the writing is actually enjoyable for the most part, offering some casual humor around every corner. The characters are all quirky enough, and while not exactly believable, are enjoyable to interact with and had me talking to them over and over again to see more conversational options. Whether that was because I actually enjoyed the quirkyness of it all or simply because there's not much else to do I'm not quite sure, but it's lead me to finishing the game and doing so with a smile, so whatever it was, it worked!\nOn account of the writing, however, and the general presentation, in this case of the main character, I'll have to give a bit of a cringe-warning:\nThe game likes its references. Which is all fine and dandy, many games do it, and to great effect, usually in the form of little trinkets hidden here or there, or a quest resembling the story of a classic. Lili has a slightly different approach to that in some points, "slightly different" meaning "IN YOUR FACE". The game enjoys repeating how much of a gamer the main protagonist is, and how much she knows about casual video game trivia to the point where it had me sit in my chair, squeeze my legs together and groan.\n"Look at us!", the game keeps saying, "We're gamers just like you, haha! See? We played some video games!"\n"Alright, that's cool!", I replied with a smile and went on with my business.\n"Oh hey, did we mention how much we love gaming? Hey, we're just like you! Gamer bro fist, haha!"\nAlright, game, I get it. You guys made a video game, I kind of figured you'd probably have played one or two before.\n"Hey look at how much we know about games! Man, games, am I right? We love games so much. We should hang out now because you play games, too!"\n\nOne last thing to consider before a purchase is the length of the game. I've completed the game with all sidequests in about 4 hours. It's not a terribly long game by any stretch of the imagination. You can beat it in a single afternoon if you're so inclined, and there's little reason to go back to it afterwards unless you just need a breather from grey reality and want to delve into a colorful, gorgeous fantasy island again.\n\nAll in all, however, it's a minor itch and completely ignorable. The game, while about as casual as a stroll through the park on a sunny spring day, was still enjoyable and while I would not recommend it for the full price, it's certainly worth a look on sale. Whether you're feeling down or just long for something lax to play while listening to a podcast or letting the day fade out, it's sure to put a smile on your face if you don't mind an experience that's more focussed on presentation than gameplay. It's an immensely impressive starting project for BitMonster and I'm looking forward to their next games already.\n\nPS: BitMonster, if you guys could make another game with the same art style but more engaging gameplay, I would love you forever.","November 4, 2014","true","4.1"," 333 of 342 people (97%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","97","333","342","28","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/recommended/266490/","mikeoliva","Motoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/","4613 products in account","Lili is a short, casual, visually exceptional 3D adventure game that's heavy on atmosphere and charm but light on story and variety.\n\nPros:\n- Visuals are gorgeous. It does not look at all like a mobile port and has some of the best visuals I've come across in an indie game.\n- Fully 3D world that you can wander around in at your own pace.\n- Nice atmosphere. The island is populated with lots of whimsical characters and the game oozes charm.\n- Non-violent, suitable for children old enough to have a fair degree of reading comprehension but also accessible for adults. (I realize this may be a con for some who are looking for a more meaty sort of game)\n- Unique. It's a bit different than pretty much everything else out there.\n\nCons:\n- Not the greatest value considering the price to length ratio. I like short games but $20 for a few hours play feels a bit steep to me.\n- Game play is rather repetitive. You do the same few things for the entire game, namely collect items and play the same sort of quicktime mini game in lieu of actual battles. This is somewhat forgivable given the very short length of the game however.\n- The 4 zones are small and there's not much interaction with the environment.\n- Story is rather thin and there is no intro; you just get plopped in.\n- Only partial controller support. The developer states full controller support is in the works. At present you can run around the world, collect items, check your map and talk to npcs with the controller but going into menus and playing the mini game battles requires keyboard and mouse.\n- Full controller support has now been added. Sort of. They basically did a virtual mouse pointer that the left analog stick controls but it feels very shoehorned in as an afterthought rather than controls designed around a controller. Control directions in the UI still don't reference the controller when you are using it either.\n\nNeutral:\n- RPG elements are quite lite. That's not a con. The game is what it is, but calling the game an "RPG hybrid" while not technically incorrect, may give an inaccurate impression. There's some very minor leveling and skill progression but don't expect hitpoints, skill trees and such.\n- No voice acting. The game is fine without it but I feel it would have added that extra bit to draw you in even more. Also it would allow for younger children to play. As non-violent games are somewhat rare, it seems especially suited for young children but the amount of reading creates a bit of an age barrier.\n- Feels like a missed opportunity in some ways. The visuals and atmosphere are excellent and the game well done as is, but part of me feels like it could have been so much more with more variety and length.\n- A couple of aspects still feel like a game created around touch input, namely the mini game where you pull flowers which is a major part of the game. Also the level up menus with the big wide buttons to hit and just the general sort of largeness of the UI. These do work just fine with a mouse though.\n- The battle / mini games on the keyboard and mouse have a totally different feel than on the controller. The former has a more tactile almost Angry Birds type of feel with pulling while the latter feels more like DDR. I'm not sure which I like better. They're very different.\n\nI enjoyed Lili for what it was, a unique, short, charming and visually stunning adventure game but part of me wished it to be more than it was, that it were much longer, the quests more complex, that Lili had companions, there were more choices etc. The game does end leaving future adventures for Lili a possibility so perhaps a sequel could be based around the PC platform from the beginning this time and more complex. It's a fun possibility to contemplate.\n\nThis isn't to say that Lili is incomplete. It's not, it's just a short and casual game. Sometimes it's nice to have those as a break or when you don't want to get into huge commitment with a new game.\n\nThe $20 price point I feel is a bit high for the short length of the game but if this sort of game appeals to you I'd recommend it when it goes on a sale.","May 11, 2014","true","5.7"," 364 of 378 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","364","378","0","8"

I've never had such a fun time collecting flowers and strange garbage from chests in a long time. Just don't go into this expecting Zelda-like combat or something similar to Banjo-Kazooie. You're simply plopped onto a charming little island that can simply be described as something out of a dream.\n\nHere's a Quick Look video to see what the game is like, since it's hard to describe with words. But if that's not your thing, then just read my quick and concise review below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/E2t3cuWZZs8\n\nI'll begin by describing the basic mechanics of this game. You play as girl named Lili who is an explorer, and she comes to the island to collect flowers for a report she's doing. You get these special flowers by finding spirits--basically human logs with masks--straddling onto their backs, and plucking white flowers that pop up on their backs until you reach the red one that you need. A fun little mini-game that's somewhat challenging if you're going for the best rank. The other things you'll be doing to progress the story are exploring the village, talking to the inhabitants, and generally exploring for neat things to collect.\n\nBut what makes this game so charming? The game's art style is truly breathtaking. It makes the game's main feature of exploring even more enjoyable when there's so many interesting things to see. I even enjoy scaring away birds and laughing at the rainbow turds they leave behind occasionally. Even talking to the local inhabitants is a joy. They have no qualms making fun of themselves and enjoy pointing it out to you. I found it very refreshing to actually WANT to talk to every NPC and find out what their story was. Not many games can pull something like that off.\n\nOther neat features the game has is the ability to chose how you want to upgrade yourself. You can choose to upgrade your speed, grip, or stealth however you wish to suit the playstyle you enjoy. You can also purchase upgrades in a wide range without much restriction. Personally I chose to get a map and key early rather than items to help me fight spirits since I just like exploring more. But if none of that is your thing, you can also just unlock different color swaps for Lili to make her look even more adorable. The choice is yours.\n\nHowever, this game does come with a few negative.\n*I found a game-breaking bug early on. I had collected all of the flowers on the map before hitting up the trainer, who wanted me to collect 5 FRESH flowers. And since none were left, I couldn't progress the game. (I've found out another work-around for this is just quiting and loading your save again. However, I still think it's an issue if you have to do such a strange thing just to continue the game, so I'll leave this as a negative.)\n*Because of the above, I also found out that there isn't multiple save slots. I had to delete my old game if I wanted to start fresh.\n*There isn't an voice acting besides the occasional "Hi" and what not. While it's not really a big deal for me, I'm sure some people might not like the fact a game with such interesting characters in it aren't voiced. It could've added a lot more to the experience if they found voice actors to bring more life into this already vivid and imaginative game.\n*While you can use a controller to play this game, it hides the fact that you can use it. And unfortunately, you can't even use the controller to play certain parts of the game. Sometimes you have to use the mouse to click off the screen when you collect a new relic. Or when you mount a spirit, you have to switch to the mouse real fast to play the mini-game.\n*Some people may take issue with the price of the game since it's cheaper on the iOS. However, you're not getting the same experience as you will here, and you can always wait for a sale. But still, I'll list this as a negative just so people know.\n\nBut even with those few minor negatives--and I say minor because it was only the beginning of the game where I had to start over--I highly recommend anyone to pick up this game if they want a laid-back adventure with good humor. This game makes me feel like a little boy again. I was just curious about everything, and it's been a long time since any game has done this for me.","May 9, 2014","true","7.0"," 125 of 147 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","125","147","0","4"

You're going to explore the different locations of the island and try to free the creatures from the bad mayor.\n\nThe locations are divided into semi-large hubs, which you can explore, find collectibles, hidden chests and solve smaller quests. The locations have a broad variety and do look very different and have their own charme.\n\nThe graphics and artstyle are very beautiful in my opinion, which is a great strength of the game.\n\nThe overall gameplay is rather simple and casual though. There is not much "puzzle solving" involved, you rather run around the island, explore the locations and stumble upon secrets without a bigger challenge.\n\nBut even if the gameplay is quite simple, i had my fun with it and enjoyed playing it.\nThe main storyline is rather short, i guess, though you do have some collectibles and achievements which might keep you busy for a while.\n\nI'd also recommend this game for a younger audience, as it's rather easy and casual and violent-free.\n\nThumbs up!","October 3, 2014","true","9.0"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","58","63","0","2"

It's a mini game that was intended for tablets and phones, but still translates decently to mouse controls and is easy to pick up. Various challenges are thrown in when picking the flowers, like prickly thorns to avoid and timed bombs to fling off.

It was successfully ported to steam and is developed and published by BitMonster, inc.\n\nYou play as Lili, a young protégé of her father (who is a professor), who is sent to a mysterious island thought to be abandoned long ago in order to collect rare flowers for a project. It turns out, the island isn't abandoned as she had thought. Throughout the island are tree spirits, who have taken over the ruins and installed themselves as the leading caste of the place. Beneath them are the wooden constructs they have built to live in servitude.\n\nYou are... in a way, thrown into the wooden constructs rebellion, as their champion, undermining those dirty wooden spirits every chance you get by ripping the flower blooms right off their backs and creating mass hysteria among the elite of the island.\n\nPros + Graphics are very beautiful, and although childlike, are exceptionally polished. Being that it was originally a mobile game, it is not surprising that most of the funds went towards the graphics.\n+ While the world of Geos is relatively small, the game boasts a few areas, all of which are beautiful, and blend seemlessly together into the larger picture.\n+ The game has "easter eggs" in the form of collectable hats which pay homage to some of the most popular and iconic games in the video game industry.\n+ You get to vandalize things. Yup, you get to break into locked houses, break vases, steal flowers off other beings backs. And it's done in a way that makes the entire thing look innocent.\n+ The game allows for small character customizations in the forms of different styles of glasses and outfits.\n+ Most of the achievements are easy to beat. In my first play through of the game I had 83% of achievements unlocked.\n+ The game has no excessive language, which makes this game perfect for children, while still mantaining an enjoyable atmosphere for adults.\n+ The game is optimized for full gamepad/controller support, and is easier to play with said controller.\n\nCons - The game can get pretty repetive very quickly, especially when aiming for the 1000 vases and flowers achievements. Be prepared to kick vases over and pick flowers for quite a long time.\n- Limited voice acting. When I mean limited, I mean limited; most of the time all you hear are random sounds the characters are making instead of actual words.\n- Little replayability other than to attempt to unlock 100% achievements. While there are different modes to the game, the story is so linear and there are no choice and consequence type of scenarios within the game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game is one of the best ported games that I have played on Steam. Most ports are make it or break it, and the transition to PC was done smoothly. The addition of the full controller support is nice, as it made it easier for me to enjoy. The graphics are stellar, and one can easilly tell that the developer spend most of the money on the 3d models.\n\nThe storyline, although rather linear, is solid for the most part, and stands out as one of the few games with RPG elements that does not have a gorey combat system to it. Instead of actual fighting, you climb on the back of the tree spirits and pluck flower blooms while wrestling them to stay on them until all flowers are picked. The non violence of this game is refreshing.\n\nThe faults I had with the game are not complete dealbreakers to me, and I can easilly recommend this game to those who enjoy light RPG games... HOWEVER... I strongly advise any interested in this game to get it on a sale.","June 20, 2015","true","8.5"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","41","48","3","0"

There's a conscious, snarky kind of wit to it at times that I think is one of the major strengths in this game. It's very much aware of the type of game it is trying to be and I've always had a fondness for games that break the fourth wall so there's definitely no complaints from me about that. I love it. Give me more of it.\n\nLili? I actually really liked her as a main character. One of the main reasons I kept playing was to see what kind of sarcastic, funny little thing would come out of her mouth. The rest of the characters as well (and there are a lot of them that you can talk to) were great fun and I loved going around and talking to all of them. This is definitely a game that made me want to explore.\n\nThat being said...the actual premise of the game was pretty grating and got boring way too fast. Almost the entirety of the plot is made up of what is best described as a mini-game where you pick flowers off of villain characters. It's something that I can see working well on an iPhone game but as a computer game it is a little obnoxious. Even the side quests really amount to nothing more than open up a chest that is easily found and return the item in it to the person who mentioned it offhand.\n\nThe in-game menu can use some work too. Your quests/side-quests are listed in the most basic manner without really giving you information about it. And honestly, it's just...clunky and awkward looking.\n\nYou can tell a lot of love went into this game and I can see it easily becoming something wonderful but at the moment it's just in an awkward place between iPhone game and computer game and it suffers greatly for it.

If you still think you want it, go ahead, but don't say you weren't warned.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful, the world is beautiful, the character and object designs are really nice, and there's even a hint of a decent plot in there. So where did it go wrong?\n\nWhen it comes down to it, this 'game' is pretty much a flower-picking simulator. You can have as many textures, shaders and polygons as you like but when your core gameplay consists of picking flowers off the backs of tree sprites, you have a problem. Had this been a 3D visual novel or a point and click I'd probably be able to give it a straight thumbs up, but I just cannot get over that fact that this game's core 'gameplay' element is flower picking. People compare this to Zelda, but it's nothing like Zelda, there's exploration but there's no real puzzle element to it, no tools or weapons - just free roaming, talking and flower picking.\n\nI get the impression that this 'game' was made by a 3D modeller to show off their work rather than someone who makes video games. This is one of the massive downsides of modern game making tools, anyone with next to no experience in making games can create a game, but because they don't have experience it falls very far from the 'masterpiece' they are dreaming of. It's like a paint brush, in the hand of an artist it creates masterpieces, in the hand of a child it makes a mess. This is almost the opposite of that - give a 3D artist the tools to make a game and they create a beautiful work in which not much happens. This game proves definitively that games should be and are much more than just good graphics.\n\nI can't bear too much of a grudge because I got it on sale for about £3, but I feel like this 'game' is something designed to sit down and gaze at lovingly rather than actually be played. Whoever did the art for this game is definately a true artist, even better than the artists for lots of popular, well selling titles. But whoever came up with the gameplay should either spend a long time evaluating what they think games are about or just not be allowed to manage gameplay at all.\n\nAll in all it's pretty tragic really, because this game could have been a real masterpiece. Instead it just leaves me with a very empty feeling, somewhere between admiration and regret, like a beautiful rose being picked before it could bloom or a promising young life cut short thanks to a tragic accident.","April 11, 2015","false","0.7"," 68 of 95 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","68","95","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/266490/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Wow, the graphics for this game are just adorable. Colorful, cute, plenty of detail in the environments and (mostly) sharp textures.\n\nBut gameplay wise you can tell it was designed with mobiles in mind, because there's a mini-game where you have to use the mouse to pluck flowers and the gameplay and story are rather shallow.\nThe player has to find red flowers by chasing spirits and solve mini-quests ('quests' would be too big of a word, since they usually take a couple of minutes to complete), among other things (like plucking white flowers and opening treasure chests). That's all there is to it really. There isn't much to do, except for a couple of small sidequests.\n\nYou can also level up the character in several ways, but these character upgrades are mostly useless because I didn't seem to experience much of an improvement. Experienced gamers in general won't find the gameplay difficult anyway. There's no health bar, you can't die. The only thing that can happen is that you get thrown off the back of a spirit and even then you can try again without any problems. And there are also potions that you can use to speed up your character, make her invisible or that allow you to throw a bomb in order to stun enemies.\n\nLili Child Of Geos also isn't a long game. I was able to complete it in 2-3 hours. Which was more than enough because the gameplay becomes very repetitive after these couple of hours.\n\nI still think the game is worth the money, if only for the beautiful graphics and for the first few areas. And who knows, maybe they can flesh things out for a possible sequel, make things a bit more interesting ? I'd like to see one, in any case.\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","May 15, 2014","true","6.5"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","35","43","0","0"

After playing through the first two areas (so far), I must say I am very pleasantly surprised! The art is very nice, as I expected, but the detail is far greater than I expected. Such a lovely atmosphere! The world they've created is one that I am thoroughly enjoying exploring. You can tell a lot of love went into this game just from looking around.\n\nBut enough about the wonderful art. If I had to classify this game I'd say it's a point-and-click with some (very limited) RPG elements and quick time events.\n\nThe game's story is... well, it's silly, but it's interesting enough. The humor is where it really shines. From conversations to item descriptions, this game has a lot of laughs packed in.\n\nGameplay is a bit rough. I feel confident in saying that this game was made with touch screens in mind, so the controls are a little clunky and the "battles" can be tricky--after all, you only have one mouse instead of a handfull of fingers. Still, you'll get used to it pretty fast. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and I can usually get 3 stars (the max number) on my first try, and I am by no means a hardcore gamer. I've only played the first two areas, though, as I said, so it will presumably get harder. Still, I'm sure this will be a turn-off to some, so I feel the need to mention it.\n\nNo major glitches so far, just some camera twitchiness when you talk to people as it switches from "world view" to "conversation view", and once where I could read a sign through a wall.\n\nMusic is adequate. Nothing to write home about, but works well with the atmosphere and isn't irritating.\n\nSound effects are good, but the random dialogue bits (the game isn't fully voice acted, but sometimes people will say a few words of their text) are sometimes odd. Such as Lili saying "Hello!" when she's actually saying goodbye in her text... or just randomly in the middle of a conversation. What up with that, Lili?\n\nAll in all, I am pleasantly surprised and really enjoying the game. Do recommend.","October 29, 2014","true","2.4"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

The game itself is a charming little piece of entertainement, but after reading the steam-description i just expected something completly different. I would not say that it's an RPG ( but some might call it one); To me, it just doesnt look like an RPG, more like a game that's made to have some points an RPG needs while beeing a mix of puzzle, minigames and collecting stuff. For example: You get something like a "Skilltree" but it doesn't really matter where you put your points, since you won't get any new abilities. As I said, the game is okay, its colorful, it cheers you up when playing it, but it is not what steam promises you.\n\nThe game itself is, as i said, a mix between puzzling, running around, minigames and collecting stuff (a lot of stuff). If you're into that, you'll be just fine, but if you hate spending too much time running back and forth while collecting items that add absolutely nothing to the game, then you'd might regret buying this.\n\nThe Graphics are pretty good, but I was told to have low standarts. The Characters are lovely designed and you can feel that the developers really cared about every single friend or foe you face throughout the game. However, the story is rather basic. I don't want to spoil anything, so just let me say this: The story feels like a weak version of another game (if you know what i mean.. you probably don't.) There's just not much depth in the story, you spend way too less time with the characters to really get into it. When I first saw the game i kind of expected a heavy story, so i was a little disappointed. But again, not every story has to be deep.\n\nThe gameplay is very repetitive, but this does not matter that much because the game is rather short. Just let me tell you, the "quests" you get sound all the same, you have 3 items you can use and every "battle" is exactly like the one you fought before.\n\nOverall Lili; Child of Geos is a game to play when you don't want to start a biiiig, looong game with a deep story. Its a game you choose to play when you have little time but still want to enjoy a good game. I personally give it a thumbs down because it is a fine little game, but nothing like you'd expect after reading the description.","May 10, 2014","false","2.9"," 134 of 220 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","134","220","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/266490/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","Oh, Lili, where have you been all my life? It's hard to argue with anyone that might label this as a port of a casual, mobile, kid's game; you'll play as a young woman on a field trip wandering around an island, picking flowers, making friends and not really being challenged all that much. But while all that may be true, to be so reductive is to a do a great disservice to an amazing hidden gem of a game.\n\nThe most obvious strength of Lili: Child of Geos is its visuals, as there's a glowing radiance emitting from every individual pore of the world along with everything that populates it. But what's less obvious is the writing that backs it up. I feel like the dialogue in a lot of games is there merely to facilitate moving the player to the next objective or set piece, and I guess that's fair enough since actual game play is typically going to be the feature that gets top billing while the story is little more than connective tissue to form vague context for your actions. However, I think people sometimes forget gaming is an entertainment medium, and there's lots of other ways to entertain besides pure play, a fact this game thankfully does remember and arguably makes its greatest triumph.\n\nThe story is a strange mix of being playfully throw-away and surprisingly thoughtful and philosophical. Lili travels to the island of Geos in search of its unique floral life as part of a final school exam, but once there finds it is inhabited by Spirits and their workforce of slave Constructs. These large, wooden homunculi must tolerate the bullying whims of their masters lest they cease to exist upon failure to serve their purpose. I probably make it sound much heavier than it really is, but it does at least dabble with notions of free will and life choices and prioritising the things that are really important to us, which are bigger issues than most titles will ever dare to approach. As it transpires, these Spirits have the most exotic flowers, which also gives them their power over the Constructs, setting the scene for several hours of roaming Geos searching for Constructs to help and Spirits to deflower.\n\nGeos is made up for four medium sized districts that are unlocked sequentially as you rid each one of its Spirits. The game and its world may not be huge, but that just allows them to focus on populating it with beauty as every inch of the environments are lovingly crafted with a wondrous level of detail. In many games you'll find yourself wandering into some stranger's house and find the entirety of their personal dwelling is made up of a table and a few chairs, or maybe a bunk bed and a fireplace if they're lucky, that sort of thing. I love how every single house in this game looks properly lived-in, with bedrooms, kitchens and even bathrooms, which really sells the illusion that this is a real world being inhabited by real people... or wooden slaves and freaky tree spirit things, in this case. I really wish more games would take the same effort to make the peripheries of the world just as interesting as its core like this one does.\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to game play, that's where I'd probably have to admit the game is at its weakest. You'll spend the majority of your time here either picking flowers, smashing vases, looting chests, talking to people or ambushing Spirits, with the amount of time you spend on each of these things pretty much depending on the type of player you are and what you decide to make your goals for this game. There's no combat as such, and you can't die, the only real challenge being trying to jump on the backs of the game's 50 Spirits and playing rodeo with them as you pluck their flowers off. Otherwise it's all a very leisurely affair, the only other complication being upgrades to help make your plucking experience a little easier.\n\nSo, yes, it's kinda short, it's arguably shallow in some areas, and it isn't massively challenging, but there really is so much warmth and charm and personality exuding from every part of this game that I feel like it more than makes up for any other shortcomings. Lili herself in particular is the very embodiment of this as she's an incredibly lovable foil to the rest of the cast and a perfect example of a well-balanced female lead that's entirely capable in her own right rather than lazy developers falling back on sexuality to sell a character. I think there's still great depths of enjoyment to be drawn from Geos, and especially from Lili herself, and I can't wait to join her again on her next adventure.","October 4, 2015","true","14.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

An lushes island filled with friendly characters called Constructs. You play as Lili, a girl who traveled to the island to find rare flowers for her school project.\n\nDuring your stay you will find out that the friendly constructs are being oppressed by the spirits, and mostly the Mayor of the island who is also a spirit. It is you job to help these constructs out and collect flowers and other collectibles a long the way.\n\nWell i will leave it at there story wise, cause we would not want to spoil to much. While the game originally came out on the iOS, it does not feel like a mobile game. The graphics look amazing and you get really sucked in to the world of Geos. There are 4 parts of the island you can explorer, each with their own unique look and feel. You are free to explorer the island as you wish, and help the inhabitants of the island.\n\nGameplay wise you have to collect flowers and find loot on the island. You go around explorer and kick open chests or break vases, while also grabbing every flower you can. For people that are really into collecting items, and exploring every nook and cranny of games, this would be a must have for you. Picking flowers can also be done by jumping on the back of spirits and plucking all their flowers of their heads, to find the rare red flowers. A fun little mini game to spice things up with a bit of action.\n\nThe 4 hours i spend so far in this game have been awesome, and i really like the experience of it, by doing something different and bringing the story in a funny way across.

Ten if you intend to complete everything. No no, it's not a problem and sometimes I appreciate a short game. Then again, because there's a template of mobile game, you can immediately notice it. The gameplay revolves around fighting enemies with tap and drag combination mechanic - a pretty much suitable one for mobile. Not to mention the simplicity of the puzzles for game progression. Well, after all, this is aimed for casual game, so if you want more challenge forget it.\n\nMoreso, there is no voice acting and so it's kinda annoying to see 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hmpphh' being used all over the maps. This is for me a major negative score for Lili.\n\nStory is... err... very forgettable.\n\nThe Developer took care and added gamepad support. Most of the times I'd use controller whenever a game supports it, but for Lili I'd rather go with KB/M - much quicker and precise that way. The control schema I used was WASD/MMORPG-like, and it was smooth enough for the whole time I spent here.\n\nStill, for a buck I spent on it, I wouldn't complain. I got my money's worth (after all I've beaten the game, that's an... achievement by itself), and I'm sure you would also if you can find a bargain elsewhere.

There's no real combat, in lieu of that there's a minigame where you run after spirits (or take them by surprise using enviromental cover / invisibility potions), climb on their back and try to grab their flowers.\nIn defense the Spirit grows thorns and bombs. You have to press the buttons that are attached the flowers (more flowers) and to the bombs (less explosions in the face) whilst avoiding the buttons attached to thorns (because they're thorns).\n\nIt's not the deepest minigame ever, and you'll be playing it a lot, but there's a charm to it too, as there is to the entirety of the game.\nThere are 4 gorgeous areas in the game, a beachside town, a night-time town, a forest and... another town. They are decently sized, and filled with a variety of constructs to befriend and help out with little quests (~3-4 per area).\nAmong the way you'll be collecting flowers that grow around the area, smash pots to find gold and items useful for the mini-game, use keys (also found in jars or traded for flowers) to explore sealed off areas and find treasure chests containing a sizeable amount of gold and a Lore Item (collectible with a bit of backstory / reference).\nThat all sounds great, so what's the catch? The game is short, and you'll be doing just the things written above. An area can be cleared in ~20-40 minutes, clocking in the total game length at roughly 2 hours.\nOther than that there are some technical hiccups, mostly related to achievements not triggering but I also got stuck a few times where the objective didn't tell me the correct next thing to do. Some of the older reviews actually mentioned problems so severe they had to restart to continue, this has since been patched out but it's still not the most flawless piece of code.\nIt was done by a team of five people though.\n\nSo, to summarize:\nPro:\nGorgeous world and presentation\nGreat protagonist\nGreat secondary characters, both 'good' and 'evil'\nA plot that keeps you entertained\nCons:\nShort, like really short\nTechnical hiccups\nSomewhat monotonous\nAll in all I'm super happy I picked up this game, and I look forward to what the developers will come out with next.\n\nMara.","August 7, 2014","true","5.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Of course, flowers collecting goes first, then we have talking with inhabitants of a tiny world (which, by the way, looks just wonderful), then goes pots smashing, chests smashing, taking away flowers from local antagonists.

Actually, that's all.\n\nOn the one hand Lili: Child of Geos is rather simple, but on the other hand a player, familiar with its essence, doesn't require anything more as the game is very unobtrusive. You don't need to do anything else except pressing a couple of buttons. You should just launch it and admire the fabulous design and stunning graphics, greatly improved in comparison with the mobile version.\n\nConsequently we have a beautiful exploration game, perfectly suitable for children and for those players who don't have enough free time. However, if you are a hardcore gamer, then consider your choice carefully, because it is quite possible that you will have to buy something different.\n\nAs for me: I played the game on my tablet and now I look forward to complete it in Steam and earn some achievements which, by the way, are rather easy, but will take some time.","August 9, 2014","true","2.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","6"

The island is full of life, its characters witty and charming where I couldn't help but laugh at some of the dialogue that was exchanged.\n\nWhere its similarities between Zelda lie are based around the Islands and town hubs which you would find in a Zelda game.\nImagine taking those areas from Wind Waker and putting them on this island. The exchange of dialogue is something you would find straight out of a Zelda game. Don't expect voiced characters but instead small sound bites like "Hi", "Bye" and other gasps throughout the dialogue.\nDon't expect to be crawling dungeons and having a boss fight. This is not where its comparison with Zelda lies.\n\nThere are lots of Easter eggs to discover throughout the Island in treasure chests that reference some classic Nintendo games. Another character will throw some Video game trivia at you, asking you to guess what game it is referencing. "Praise the Sun".\n\nHats can be found in treasure chests and by doing services for the locals. Masks can be unlocked by beating Spirits.\n\nAs a collectathon it has similarities to Banjo-Kazooie. Achievements are awarded for smashing pots, finding treasure and picking flowers.\nFighting in the game is composed of hopping on the back of a Spirit and attempting to pluck flowers from its back while they put obstacles in your way such as thorns and bombs.\n\nThere is currently only partial controller support, with the mouse really only needed for the Spirit fights and closing menus. I'm sure adding a button binding for B to close menus will soon come in an update. I am unsure how Battling the spirits with a controller will work though. Its interaction seems more suited to a mouse or tablet, although the developers have said in the forum they are working on full controller support.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend the game if you grew up playing Nintendo games like Zelda, Banjo or Mario.\n\nWhile there is no platforming involved, a mixture of all these games can be found in Lili: Child of Geos.\nThe graphics are just downright gorgeous and full of colour. The music sounds like something that belongs in a Zelda game.

In Lili’s case, though, “fighting” is replaced with a minigame where you ride hectically running spirits and pull flowers from their backs (it makes sense in the context ^_^; ), which requires some precise clicking but not hard overall.\n\nIn regard of game’s length, completing the game will likely take you some 5 - 7 hours, depending on how through you are with exploring everything and completing achievements.\n\nThe Island of Geos is a small place, with only 4 areas to explore. However, what little of game world there is, is thoroughly detailed: every place is unique and each of 4 areas, despite being a part of the same island, has very distinct feel to it. It is complimented by beautiful graphics, which makes exploration of the game world truly enjoyable.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple lovely game to relax with, there is a good chance that Lili is just what you need.

I enjoyed it much more the 2nd time, even though I thought it would be a chore to play through again. The characters were still amusing, the art and model work were still beautiful, even the 'fights' were more enjoyable than they were on the first playthrough. I have no idea why this would be, perhaps it's because I knew what not to expect from it 2nd time round. (I didn't really want to make my review any longer, but since my first impressions kind of sat on the fence, I thought it only fair to update it.)\n\n*edited as I feel my 'not so good  things' list was worded a bit more harshly than intended, also added to the good things list*\n\nGood Things:\n+It's beautiful, no doubt about that.\n+The character models are really well done.\n+You can collect stuff. (Hats and pets and masks are usable.) (Lore items are useless they just go in to a collection page, but the descriptions can be fun to read.)\n+Some of the dialogue is very humorous, and I have genuinely laughed out loud a few times, which I think is quite rare in most games. The humor feels very natural and not at all forced.\n+some of the quests are well thought out and very enjoyable to do.\n+most of the characters are quite memorable. I quite like the information fish.\n+Haven't come across any bugs at all, it's as well polished as it looks. (UPDATE: achievement bugged for the locked doors)\n+ Rematched 'fights' will spawn the opponent in the zone you're currently in.\n\nNot so good things:\n\n-My number one in this list has to be the motion sickness.\nThere's currently 2 choices of camera movement ...\nfps style is bad if you suffer from motion sickness.\nmmo style is better but the camera still swings enough and there's a motion blur to the sides when you turn that may make you feel ill if you have this problem. Sometimes Lili runs into things you weren't expecting and the camera can stop in a nausea and dizziness inducing way, so if you're one of those people affected by this I'd keep in mind that this may be a problem for you before buying it. For me this is ok to play in short bursts.\n\n-you can buy 'new' outfits, but they're not new, they're just recolors of the original one, which given the attention to detail in the landscape and models made this a bit disappointing when I first came across the shop, although I do find it hard to imagine Lili wearing anything else.\nPerhaps if there was another area of body customization like accessories (bangles, necklaces, leggings, face paint, belts, hair accessories etc) even the same outfit but a patterned shirt, logo on the shirt, butterfly on the shorts....anything, instead of just being recolored, and ideally, for me, these items would drop with a fairly low drop rate (instead of being bought) to make vase kicking and the associated achievement more fun.\nThere wouldn't be that much work involved in altering the mesh to turn the shorts in to a mini dress either, which I think would quite suit Lili. (edit: I see at the very end you unlock an outfit that is exactly this, which is a shame since it probably means we'll never see this mesh recolored or retextured since it's a "special" item.)\nI'm a fan of loot and stuff to equip, what can I say :P\n\n-"Fights" are unique, but I don't enjoy them as much as I enjoy the quests, and since my play-time is limited due to the motion sickness, I've taken to ignoring them at this point (which isn't as game breaking as it sounds) and just doing the quests instead. I'll get them done eventually just for the achievements and the masks they drop (which are wearable) if you beat them with 3 stars.\nI'd love to have the lore items be usuable as some kind of limited use tool in fights which would also make the collecting of those items and the fights themselves more entertaining.\n\nConclusion\nI think the developers are still adding things to the game, so I'm going to go with recommend as there's still a chance of new things being added, and hopefully a 3rd camera option that's motion sickness friendly =D\n\nFor me, to be worth it's full asking price, it really needs more usable items and, given the lack of a real talent tree, some more variation in ways you can play to win the fights, like I said previously, I'd use the lore items to achieve this, giving them a purpose in the process.","July 6, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

COLLECTING FLOWERS?\nThe concept seems rather boring, but put some quirky characters, interesting world design and beautiful visuals on the mix and thus is born Lili: Child of Geos! A mixture of Yume Nikki and FEZ on a 3D environment, Lili's journey to complete her degree in something quite close to botany is not only a banquet for the sight, but also an entertaining non-violent alternative to not-always-so-subtle gaming references and somewhat-intelligent humor. However, as most indie games that try to inovate, the title has remarkable flaws or raw concepts.\n\nThe story is not impressive or captivating, but the funny and varied cast of characters sure compensate to what could be a dull, uninspiring experience with a cute message that didn't stick because the road to it was so "meh". Although the game has no voice overs (despite a few heys, yep and "SOUP, SOUP SOUP!"), the dialogues flow smoothly, soon making you feel like you know the pers... no... construct you're talking to.\n\nGameplay-wise, there's not much on store. First, there is no such thing as full controller support (if you want to play with a controller, that is) as the store page implies. This is actually a partial controller support where you'll get to use the analog sticks to move the mouse cursor on menus and get XBox controller inputs only during the "fights", making you get used to how 1, 2 and 3 translate on an XBox controller or simply use the keyboard when those item slots are necessary. After the early struggle, you'll soon find that the only interesting thing about the game is its "unique" way to deal with enemies -- which is actually a far more simplistic and fast paced Shadow of the Colossus, but with smaller enemies. Simply put, you jump on their backs and try to cope with a swarm of commands indicating where you can pull flowers, thorns or bombs, carefully not to dry the "grip" matter as that will make you fall off the enemy. With a decent score you get to collect that enemy's unique mask and learn about it. Other than that, running (walking is exclusive to houses), collecting flowers and the few RPG elements are clunky and raw. There was a lot of room for improvement, but clearly the developers wanted to seel a gorgeous game with that one fresh feature that you won't even get to play that much.\n\nSpeaking of features, content is another thing Lili: Child of Geos lacks. There are no puzzles at all, unless the game giving you the answer to stepping on buttons is considered a puzzle now days. For an exploration game with no actual combat, puzzles could make the experience far more enjoyable! The world layout is entertaining, but soon falls flat as the areas are pretty much narrowed corridors without much places to go. No no dear, you cannot jump or swim to anywhere you want to explore -- not that there are many places you think you could jump to anyways. You won't have to work much to get the god-mode items (e.g. the skeleton key and the treasure map), either, so instead of having the slightest hint of challenge on a casual exploration game (because even though it's casual, doesn't mean it can't be challenging), you can just keep running, collecting flowers, kicking vases and collecting flowers from the back of spirits. As for the outfits and hats, considering how short the game is and how useless they are (only there for cosmetics and eventually some lore relevance), there could be a larger variety -- like letting us use the Mario collectable hat as an actual hat instead of hinting on a reference-NPC that doesn't even exist.\n\nPros:\nGorgeous graphics\nRuns smoothly at highest settings on a medium rig\nInteresting designs\nQuirky, funny characters\nNice music\nSome subtle and funny references to the gaming world\nAn exploration game with few RPG elements and a weak focus on flower collecting\nCons:\nPartial controller support instead of full\nGameplay feels clunky at times\nNo puzzles\nThe only inovative mechanic is uninteresting and might become a burden if you're not a fast catcher\nThere could be more hats\nThere could be more pets\nFlowers could be more relevant\nThere could be more items and shops\nSome game references feel stupid (if I can call the Portal 2 thing a reference)\nExtremely linear considering what an open world can offer\nExtremely short considering the potential it had (you can clear the game and most of the achievments on a single day, maybe two if you decide to take on the 1000 vases and flowers)\nAll in all, Lili: Child of Geos is a funny one-time experience with a lot of wasted potential. Gorgeous graphics and funny characters, but poor controller support (considering the developers promised full support), lack of content and short playthrough. Doesn't justify the full price, but worth checking out at a nice discount.","April 7, 2015","false","5.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

It's not a shoddy port though; on the contrary, the graphics got a gigantic overhaul and it's very pretty to look at.\n\nHowever, it is way too easy and very light on content. You are picking flowers, open chests for items (which have no value whatsoever aside from just collecting them) or kick pots for money (flowers can also be traded for money). Even the "combat" is a flower picking game. The money can be used for items that aid you in the game but it's so easy that it hardly matters at all. Quests are about going from A to B and back or finding something. That's about it. Even if you take your time in 4 to 6 hours you'll have found and seen about everything there is (that includes all side missions).\n\nMy other gripe is with the story / dialogue, which is inconsistent. Some of it is complete nonsense, and/or seems to not fit at all. Other parts hint at much more going on than what's actually happening, but there's no plot twist or real surprise.

Too much to slap you with a witty pair of sentences and run away giggling.  So here's some proper paragraphs for you kids as I lead you on a bold coming-of-age adventure where you learn to part with three to five of your dollars but no more than that; an adventure where you learn if great art direction with a bit of humor can make up for some flawed gameplay and a very basic story:\n\nYou will take control of Lili: a young crossdressing botanist with daddy issues on a quest to "deflower" a population of anthropomorphic gardens.  Okay, okay.  That is only technically true, you cheeky reviewer, you.  It's a very inclusive, cheerfully bright, and quite original game, although the daddy issues still stand.  And in fact they stand in the way of me giving this game an unqualified recommendation.\n\nI'm talking not about Lili the character, but the game itself.  It is so proud of its roots that it spends too much time placing them on display rather than nurturing its uniqueness to blossom into a memorable classic.  Lili brings a lot to the table, but what's ultimately going to keep you playing (or not) are its story, characters, and setting.  Lili: CoG tries to follow the likes of games like Monkey Island by having a story-focused game supported by a strong sense of humor.  The story itself is unchallenging, boiling down to: bad guys are bad guys and it's up to you to put things right.  Bless it, it tries to do more by giving Lili a personal dilemma that comes into conflict with her objectives, but when it comes time for her to choose, there's really no consequence to the choice you make.  Although, I guess we can hand out a gold star for at least letting the player make a choice.\n\nOkay, so the story is middling, what does this have to do with that whole roots/blossoming/flower-metaphors-for-a-game-about-flowers  line you were banging on about?  Well, presumably if the story is lacking, it could be supported by its humor.  And the game has some wonderfully funny moments.  Unfortunately, you might just stop playing before you ever get to them.  A lot of the jokes in the first areas of the game you explore take the form of references to other games and the games industry, and praise toward the games that inspired Lili.  And, as many of us know, references aren't really jokes, especially since you have to have a pretty broad knowledge of games to appreciate most of them.  I did get a grin or two out of these, but it wasn't until the second half of the game when the earnest chuckles came; when Lili started being Lili instead of her various daddies' girl.\n\nI know anybody reading the length of this review is probably ready with their metaphorical throwing produce if I don't get to talking about the gameplay soon, but this is a very hippy-dippy, rainbow colored, mostly non-violent, interactive experience and there's a bit more to be said.  This game.  Is.  Beautiful.  No, really, it is.  The birds even poop rainbows!!!  It could sell itself alone on its art direction (it's a shame it comes a bit too close to doing that).  Without an army of artists and polygons, Lili creates a vivid, bright, painterly world that is going to stay good looking for decades.  The environments feel very open, engaging, and wholely Lili's own.  Lili is a realistically proportioned human exploring a luminous world populated by wooden robots and grim-looking masked spirits none of which are short on personality.  It's got a bit of a Miyazaki vibe to it, but it's ultimately Lili's own world, and it's truly charming.\n\nRight, gameplay.  In Lili, you chase down spirits, jump onto their backs, and try to yank off the flowers that sprout up with your mouse, while avoiding hazards that threaten to knock you off and let the spirit escape: interesting, arcadey, surprisingly challenging as the difficulty ramps up.  It's refreshingly different from many other adventure/action/RPG hybrids that will mostly have you swinging a sword around at the things you want maimed.  It isn't quite perfect, though.  It works okay with mouse controls, but does feel imprecise at times and can get a bit frustrating when the things you want appear in dense clusters of hazards.  It seems designed with touch screens in mind, but I only used the mouse, so I can't comment on that implementation.\n\nThe RPG elements, especially, seem misguided.  Upgrades are handed out at odd intervals and never seem essential, especially with items providing boosts that don't so much compliment your skills in running fast, stealth, and hanging onto enemies, as render them completely irrelevant.  The increments from leveling up and getting items aren't entirely unnoticeable, but the RPG elements could have gotten cut and nothing would have been lost.  In fact, the stealth aspect to the game is really non-existant.  You won't have to worry about things like which way the enemy is facing, what cover you place yourself behind, or the amount of lighting on you.  Stealth is merely a stat that determines how close you can get before the enemy automatically notices you.  If stealth games really turn you on, as they do me, just know that this isn't a stealth game, but a perfectly fine arcadey affair.  And, you know, you can just have a stealth-sandwhich and be invisible, so why the stats at all?\n\nI'll admit, I only played the game on normal difficulty.  The game does have easy and hard settings, but as an adult with adequate reflexes, I found Lili to be fairly easy to get through, but challenging to get through well (you are scored for each enemy you face and given a small reward in the form of a mask for doing well).  I'd say that makes it ideal, but then, I'm not sure exactly who this game was made for.  The simple saccharine story and visuals make it seem like a casual game for parents to play with their children, though I think even with an easy setting, reflex challenges might prove inherently difficult for younger kids.  But if it's just meant to appeal to the children of the 90s, now present day indie gamers, the difficulty is on the ball in terms of gameplay.  That audience will probably find the story a bit too easy, however (unless you want to get meta and compare Lili - the character's - struggle living in her father's shadow to Lili - the game's - struggle to emerge from the shadow of monumental games like a terribly clever gamer whose review will be super influential).\n\nSo who is Lili for?  Well, me, I guess.  I mostly enjoyed it and I recommend it if you think the strengths I've just beamed into your head outweigh the bits that are mediocre - and those bits are just mediocre, never really bad.","February 6, 2015","true","9.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

It has a really cool world with different races of creatures, you help them out in sidequests, etc. But beyond that, there's no action, or even any real enemies. And having 3 skills that just do the thing a little better (Speed = faster walking) does not an RPG make. At least IMO.\n\nAfter I stopped trying to compare this game to what I thought it was going to be, I really enjoyed it. You have to accept that most of this game is running. Go back and watch the trailers and see what happens: running & talking to NPCs. Which is indeed what you do but it's fun because of exactly those things. The world is really amazing; it looks beautiful and unique. The dialog with the NPCs has great humor and various video game (and other media) references and the music is just plain amazing, mostly because it sounded inspired by the music of Zelda games. I found myself reading the text of everything in the game (Treasures, baddies, etc) because they were often very funny and often had great references to video games and things of other media. And Lili is a pretty awesome protagonist.\n\nI feel like this game gets a lot of flack because it's not what people expected, which is true. The way it is marketed is rather misleading so as a result, a lot of people buy it who would not have if they had seen footage of it represented properly, which means they won't enjoy it. No, it's not going to appeal to everyone, but I would argue that there is a large number of people who would find it very enjoyable. It's a very original, simple adventure game with video game references, amazing atmosphere, and great writing. And it's got hats. How can you go wrong with hats?\n\n\n[And I would like to point out that -by the credits- this game was made by 5 people, which makes me respect it all the more. I hope to see more Lili in the future, maybe on a grander scale.]","June 20, 2015","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You follow Lili on her quest to free the citizens of Geos from the Spirits by gathering items and collectibles. There's really no point in the game than to immerse yourself with the wonderful cartoon fantasy world while discovering hidden items and collecting flowers - white ones which you can get anywhere and red ones which you need to fight some spirits to get it.\n\nI really enjoyed this game despite of the lack of gameplay and the linear story line. What makes this game so much fun is the great art style and the graphics, this runs smoothly on my 3 yr old gpu, and I can appreciate that.  There are collectable items in the game like hats, pets, and masks. It's a nice addition, but the dresses are just a change in color. It would've nice to see something different.\n\nThe music is perfect for a game like this but sometimes it gets a little annoying, I would have liked it to be a little subtle while im exploring and want to hear more of those ambient sounds.\n\nI can highly recommend this to someone bored of the usual games and just want to chill out and enjoy the fantasy world. But if your an average gamer who wants more gameplay and some serious satisfaction out of a game, this isn't for you. I'd say it's great for a collectible, but honestly not worth the price, since the game is too short and replay value is very low.\n\nGraphics: 7 - I like the graphics of the game and the the world of Geos is beautiful.\n\nGameplay: 4 - There isn't really anything to do here aside from collecting flowers to proceed with quests and maybe collecting  masks and hats.\n\nMusic: 7 - The music is above average and will keep you feeling like you are in a cartoon fantasy world, but it gets repetitive. I woud've enjoyed more if I was hearing a more soothing music and more ambient sounds.\n\nReplayability: 3 - The game doesn't offer anything more after you've beaten it once, maybe just to pick up more flowers and vases for achievements, or maybe get those missable hats or masks.\n\nOverall Impression: 7 - I still give it a 7 despite of all the negatives, there is a certain charm to this game the you can only experience once you start adventuring with Lili=)\n","December 3, 2014","true","4.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I don't need combat in every game; I don't need to kill, but the "combat" mechanics in this game (picking flowers) are not that fun and are extremely compartmentalized from the rest of the experience whilst also lacking any depth or nuance to speak of. The game would have been better having significant puzzle solving in the environments or even just making the combat a part of the interaction with the world instead of an activated sequence.\nI can't recommend this game as anything more than a very pretty moving picture to boot up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/recommended/266490/","silentcaay","SilentCaay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silentcaay/","247 products in account","First, let's talk about game length... I heard this was pretty short so I held out for a good sale and finally picked it up for about $4. After almost 3 hours I'm maybe halfway through the game. I figure it should give me at least 5-6 hours of gameplay which is decent for that price but at full price you may want to hold off.\n\nAnyway, about the game itself... The characters and the world are totes adorable. You'll find humorous writing, both light and even a little dark, video game references and great art direction. It's a good looking game with it's own style.\n\nIt's not without flaws, though. The biggest one which may even make it difficult for some people to play this is the barfy mouse-look. I can't even call it mouse acceleration. It's way worse than that. The mouse-look lags way behind and then suddenly snaps into position. It's very awkward and even though I never get motion sickness playing games, this had my stomache rolling sometimes.\n\nAlso, this game does not allow you set your game up via launcher or main menu. It dumps you into the game right away and you can fiddle with some minor graphics options once you get into it. The game did an adequate job of detecting my hardware and the game ran fine for me but for some others this may end up being a problem. Every game should allow you to configure your settings before rendering more than a menu just for safety's sake.\n\nAnother minor thing is the lack of voice acting. There are some voice clips, from Lili saying "hi" in 3 or 4 different ways to the other characters having their own little intros/outros to some grunts/barks during combat but aside from that none of the dialog is voiced which is weird since the voice acting that is there isn't bad. It would have been nice for a game this short to be fully voiced, at least the main characters.\n\nOverall, though, it's a fun, cute little game involving smashing vases, stealing people's belongings out of thier homes, picking flowers and completing quests in good ol' RPG fashion.

No replay value. You are basically playing the same minigame over and over again. Sure you can get a better score, but that gets tedious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/266490/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nLili: Child of Geos tells the story of a young botanist, Lili, set on a quest to the supposedly uninhabited island of Geos as part of a school research project, but as the stories never tell the whole truth until you live them, you will soon find out that the island is actually inhabited by creatures called the Spirits and their creations meant to serve them, the Constructs. It won't be long before your arrival will alert the Spirits as your presence starts to influence the lives of the Constructs and make them question their existence as servants, so you will soon be caught up in the affairs of Geos’ locals. As much of a premise for a serious plot there is, the game chooses tell its story in a satirical way, adding jokes and references to other games every now and then, some which fail to deliver, making the entire story feel irrelevant after you realize most quests are there to fill in the space without an actual outcome in the storyline. As a game that focuses on exploration and the landscape it creates with it, it was disappointing to see how limited that exploration really is; it was exciting to find new items, meet new Constructs and see where else their quests will take me, but after a few minutes you will soon realize that there are only around eight additional sidequests, most which take no longer than ten minutes to complete and as for everything you see in the distance, you will never actually get there.\nRating: 6\n\nGameplay\nAs for how the game plays, well it certainly is different from anything you have experienced before, as your main objective is to defeat Spirits by jumping onto their back and picking the flowers that spurt from their heads. This is where the game shows its true nature, as it was originally made for tablets and picking flowers by dragging them with your finger across the screen feels natural and easy, but doing the same thing with a mouse can be a little bit tricky. Using a controller makes the whole thing a little bit easier as you can select the flower you want to pull using the action button, but at the same time it creates another problem, as you can only select from a range of four flowers, mapped to their respective action button, so later on in the game when you'll have to deal with up to eight different flowers, weeds and bombs at the same time, the controller will prove to be more of a burden than a helpful tool. Outside the battle the game works much better, using the keyboard and mouse or the controller to move around, collect flowers, look around for treasures and meet Geos' finest, but then again for an open world experience, there is a really small number of things that you can do outside the main story, which isn't that long either and the first glance at Geos will soon be shattered by exploration limits and the lack of new things to keep you going for longer or distract you from your main objective.\nRating: 5\n\nGraphics\nLooking back at the iOS version of the game, it's clear that the visual upgrade worked out for the best and Lili: Child of Geos looks amazing on PC, but the real beauty when playing the game comes from the art style itself, taking you somewhere between what a gnome village would look like and combining it with a good Pixar movie. The landscapes are simply amazing and as for the characters, even if the Spirits look the same except for their masks, the Constructs each have a unique touch to help you recognize them whenever you see them around Geos.

The game started as an iOS game, to developer BitMonster's credit, the PC release has end of improvements, to the graphics and gameplay. However, you still get the inkling its not that far removed from its iOS origins.\n\nPros\nFunny, beutiful, and unique coming of age story that is generally fun.\nLots of collectibles with plenty of pop-culture nods and winks\n\nCons\nCombat gets tedious quickly, achievements are very grindy.\nBit too easy, a bit too simple.\n\nOverall\nConsidering the time it takes to play through, I'm not sure its worth the price (£15). It may sound a wee bit elitist but Lili: Child of Geos is just the type of "casual" game you'd expect from something designed for iOS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/266490/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nLili: Child of Geos tells the story of a young botanist, Lili, set on a quest to the supposedly uninhabited island of Geos as part of a school research project, but as the stories never tell the whole truth until you live them, you will soon find out that the island is actually inhabited by creatures called the Spirits and their creations meant to serve them, the Constructs. It won't be long before your arrival will alert the Spirits as your presence starts to influence the lives of the Constructs and make them question their existence as servants, so you will soon be caught up in the affairs of Geos’ locals. As much of a premise for a serious plot there is, the game chooses tell its story in a satirical way, adding jokes and references to other games every now and then, some which fail to deliver, making the entire story feel irrelevant after you realize most quests are there to fill in the space without an actual outcome in the storyline. As a game that focuses on exploration and the landscape it creates with it, it was disappointing to see how limited that exploration really is; it was exciting to find new items, meet new Constructs and see where else their quests will take me, but after a few minutes you will soon realize that there are only around eight additional sidequests, most which take no longer than ten minutes to complete and as for everything you see in the distance, you will never actually get there.\nRating: 6\n\nGameplay\nAs for how the game plays, well it certainly is different from anything you have experienced before, as your main objective is to defeat Spirits by jumping onto their back and picking the flowers that spurt from their heads. This is where the game shows its true nature, as it was originally made for tablets and picking flowers by dragging them with your finger across the screen feels natural and easy, but doing the same thing with a mouse can be a little bit tricky. Using a controller makes the whole thing a little bit easier as you can select the flower you want to pull using the action button, but at the same time it creates another problem, as you can only select from a range of four flowers, mapped to their respective action button, so later on in the game when you'll have to deal with up to eight different flowers, weeds and bombs at the same time, the controller will prove to be more of a burden than a helpful tool. Outside the battle the game works much better, using the keyboard and mouse or the controller to move around, collect flowers, look around for treasures and meet Geos' finest, but then again for an open world experience, there is a really small number of things that you can do outside the main story, which isn't that long either and the first glance at Geos will soon be shattered by exploration limits and the lack of new things to keep you going for longer or distract you from your main objective.\nRating: 5\n\nGraphics\nLooking back at the iOS version of the game, it's clear that the visual upgrade worked out for the best and Lili: Child of Geos looks amazing on PC, but the real beauty when playing the game comes from the art style itself, taking you somewhere between what a gnome village would look like and combining it with a good Pixar movie. The landscapes are simply amazing and as for the characters, even if the Spirits look the same except for their masks, the Constructs each have a unique touch to help you recognize them whenever you see them around Geos. The bad part in all this is that you never get to explore everything that you actually see ahead of you and the five different locations of the island can be completed within minutes as there is nothing else to do besides the main objective and a few chests scattered around.\nRating: 8\n\nAudio\nThe soundtrack complements the visual art style, probably not in the best way possible but its better with it there playing the background as you move on than without it.

Likely.\n\nLili: Child of Geos is decently ported iOS game about playing as a girl picking flowers....what am I doing with my life?!\n\nTL;DR: It is a fantastic looking game that is basically a collectathon without much challenge beyond hopping on the backs of enemies to pluck flowers from enemies trying to shake you off of themselves. It sounds silly, but probably worked well on mobile and worked fine as a PC mini game. Calling this game an RPG is a stretch -it's more like a platformer without platforming - adventuring and collecting really. I adore the world design and want to see more of it, and it's simplistic game style makes sense for being an original iOS game.\n\nLili caught my attention from a recent Groupees Bundle: The character is a unique female protaganist and the game looked like it had a nice Pixar-movie quality. I'm glad to say that at least visually and in terms of world building, it does have that quality. I've taken about 150 screenshots of this game, especially since I was captivated by the foilage, lighting, shading and texture effects. Sure, there are more graphically advanced games, but end result of the developers move to make the game look better on PC instead of being a simple port made the game a pleasure to look at and arguably one of the best looking games of the year.\n\nThe gameplay mostly boils down to exploring the island, collecting money from kicking pots and collecting white flowers, which are sold for money. The meat of the gameplay is near violently plucking flowers off the backs of Spirits in "combat" in order to get their red flowers for reearch at the school Lili is from. I like that the game has a simple story, but it is disappointing that in a game about flower picking, that there are only two types of flowers that matter in the overall world, excluding the green, coin, bomb, and thorns on spirits throught "combat". I use combat in quotes, because basically  Lili needs to steal the flowers off the back of the spirits haunting the living, wooden constructs by jumping onto their backs and plucking flowers that sprout from them while the spirits run around trying to shake her off. Thsi form of combat is really the only form of challenge in this game, which was fine for me since it's simplcity is what I was expecting. There is an RPG mechanic of increasing your grip, speed, and stealth, but considering how easy the game is, coupled with the easily obtainable items to augment these abilities (Not to mention that one guide highly recommended Speed and stealth, but I went with Grip and stealth with no problem), your progression will generally not matter unless you are just bad at the game.\n\nWhile the gameplay is extremely simplistic, yet solid, the best part of the game to me is the overall game world. From the protaganist, to the cast of kinda-stupid but lovable NPCs, and the well design "levels". it made me interested in the world more so than the game. I'd be interested in seeing a sequel or a successor that incorporates the world into new gameplay, like a platformer or a Zack and Wiki style puzzler.\n\nSummary: I finished Lili in slightly over 4hrs and considering what little gameplay there was, I'm perfectly fine with that. More if spent time with the sidequests, though I didn't see a reason too since money or upgrades are only a problem in the earliest first half hour of play. There are plenty of achievements and all seem easy, though it would be a grind to complete them all. I have issues with the constant achievement popups, the lack of ability to change the resolution or remap keys (part of the game was cut off on my Ultra-wide monitor. I played it on a regular monitor, and it was fine. Then I went back to the UW on another play, and I didn't have the cutoff issue anymore), but despite that, I still enjoyed the game. It's shortness makes it an easy recommend for people with large backlogs, though the $20 price point is a bit too high for what is being offered.","September 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Also the controls sometimes freaked out if you walked into somthing at a certain angle, and the steam acheviemnts aren't always responsive (mostly the ones for using items). To be fair though I didn't complete all the sides quests, but I also spent a lot of time running around getting flowers to save up for items. Although I can clearly see there is much more stuff I can get.

It's an rpg-esque exploration game, interspersed with an interesting little mini game involving ripping flowers out of the backs of malevolent spirits (never thought I'd say that before).  The scenery is gorgeous, definitely encouraging exploration just by being too darn beautiful to want to leave.  And the minigame was kind of addicting; I wanted to keep playing it and beating each of my high scores, yes, but I also wanted to keep playing it because it was fun.\n\nMy only gripe is that the game felt too short.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emyxia/recommended/266490/","Emyxia","Emyxia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Emyxia/","138 products in account","Short but sweet, if I had to summarize in one sentence. A game I think people of all ages could enjoy depending on what they're looking for. For younger kids you have a virtually non-violent, beautiful and funny place to explore. Older audiences might find entertainment in the occasionally dark humor and the game's weird inhabitants.\n\nGameplay-wise Lili: Child of Geos is a very short game. I'd estimate around three hours of casual play. If you're going for collectibles and a perfect ranking against all enemies you may add two or three extra hours of game time. It's not a very challenging game either if you play on easy or medium. During the game you will attempt to "de-flower" spirits walking about the game world. You do this by playing a sort of minigame where you drag and drop flowers and other items off a spirit's head. You can tell this game mechanic was designed for the use of a touchscreen, which isn't too strange as this is a PC remake of a mobile game, but the developers made it work fairly well with a mouse. Depending on your skill, you'll master this part of the game quickly. It does get progressively harder as the game goes on, but it never reaches a level that will really challenge you and have you retry beating a spirit more than a couple of times. I have yet to play the hardest difficulty setting though. There are three settings, of which I played the middle one.\n\nControls are a bit wonky. Camera control takes a bit getting used to. Mouse sensitivity have only four presets which is the part I found the most annoying about the game. Some weird collisions here and there. Otherwise well made.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, but try to find a bit of gameplay to watch before you decide whether or not to purchase Lili: Child of Geos. It's a game best enjoyed if you go at it with a relaxed attitude. If you're up for exploration and fun in short bursts. It would be easier to recommend this game if it had been cheaper. I don't really think the price suits the length or content of the game.

I've to say I really love level designs and characters.\nSure, it's mobile port which I expect simple mechanism.

I played Lili as soon as it came out for iOS and in my review of the game then I gave it high marks. I give them again this time around.\n\nThe best part of Lili for me is that it is full of humor and I actually had a very powerful emotional response to part of the story. It's really that good. But let me pause to point out the one flaw I see in the game.\n\nUnfortunately, punctuation is sloppy and visually stands out against such a flawless graphical backdrop. Admittedly, I'm a stickler for quality writing with careful, consistent use of punctuation and spelling as much as an engaging text. Sadly, this is seemingly the only unpolished bit of Lili. Also, while I appreciate the quirky descriptions and tongue-in-cheek collectibles, there is unexpected semi-questionable content for astute readers.\n\nThat being said, I love the feel of this game so get ready for more gushing. The graphics are stunning with beautiful art direction and an immersive environment. This is even truer in the Steam version. It's funny that it looks as I remember it but then when I checked screenshots from my iPhone playthrough, I realized what time and effort really went into this port. The graphics are redone and gorgeous on the big screen!\n\nLili is a great hero and it's nice to see a nonsexualized female lead. She can be taken seriously and is genuinely likeable. She is also fun to control both on iOS and Steam. I like the control options and found the use of the mouse to give a bit of precision to the main "battle" mechanic of the game. I use quotes because there really are no fights other than plucking plants from the backs of spirits and this unique twist is actually very engaging and serves as both a sort of mini game as well as a well tuned challenge in progression.\n\nFinally, I really like the new listings of characters because at the end of the day, they are what made my first experience with Lili so memorable. I look forward to playing through the rest of this game once more and hope you pick it up as well.","September 8, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's worth picking up on sale, but not for the full price of $20.\n\nPros:\n- Looks great, especially considering it started on mobile. A lot of that probably comes down to the fact that most levels are cleverly designed to avoid needing to draw more than 20 feet in any direction, but the game does run on Unreal.\n- Usually clever writing. Not perfect by any means, but it's generally entertaining.\n- Strong world design. The descriptions comparison to Tim Schafer's work is pretty accurate in the world and character design.\n- The main mini-game is fun. It involves trying to pick flowers off the head of a spirit as it runs around and sprouts bombs and thorns to make you miss. It's reasonably challenging to win the later rounds with a perfect rating, but you're going to breeze through it if just passing is enough for you. Mileage will vary heavily here.\n- Lots of hats. Every spirit (52) and most quests (something like 12?) will give you a hat. There are also at least two pets to find, but the costume changes are limited to palette swaps, unfortunately.\n\nCons:\n- Very limited graphics options. You get a few presets with no descriptions of what any of them actually do. I don't think many people are going to have trouble running the game, but Highest turns on an incredible level of depth of field. I'd have liked to be able to turn that off.\n- Short. I finished it in 3 hours. That was enough to defeat all 52 spirits (most with 3/3 stars), complete nearly all of the quests, and find around 60-70% of the collectibles.\n- Controls are a bit wonky. Particularly the camera.\n\nNotes:\n- Achievement hunters beware! Lili has a ton of achievements and *most* are near enough to completable in a sane person's playthrough. Then there's "Break 1,000 vases." I only got to 120 despite making an effort to break any I came across. You could probably get an extra 100 or so by going out of your way to look for them, but the full 1K is going to take some serious grinding.\n- Trying to play it on a standard touchpad would be a nightmare.\n- The description compares this to Zelda, but the only similarities I can find are some of the humor, Wind Waker's art direction, and the fact that money is completely and utterly useless in both games. Don't buy it hoping for puzzles or Zelda-like combat.","December 31, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I kept playing and got quite into it, the game is actually pretty good on the exploration and "questing" front, even if it doesn't have a massive map. I did find that the game was rather heavy on the "collecting items" front.\n\nMusic is very good, and the sound bites work well to enhance the text which makes up the dialogue as there are are no full-text voices. The dialogue in this game has lots of humour, and the story it tells is good.\n\nThe Graphics are very nice, cartooney not photorealistic. The design of the maps in the world are likewise very well done.\n\nI did encounter a bug that prevented the in-game cursor from loading, but this was easily fixed by switching resolutions in-game. The game is listed as having full controller support, but you shouldn't be playing with a controller. It is simply not suited to this.\n\nOverall, while it isn't the most amazing game out there, it does provide for a fun game that you can probably get through in an afternoon, if you have one free. I will say that if you're after a heavy RPG, don’t go for this. But if you want to buy this for a more easy-going RPG, or one suited to children, then this is a good choice.","December 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whorific/recommended/266490/","whorific","Whorific","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whorific/","211 products in account","This is a neat little game. It's very... casual. That certainly is not a bad thing. It's relaxing, easy on the eyes and fun to progress through. The majority of the game consists of walking between four areas, clicking a button next to flowers to harvest them, clicking the same button to kick vases, and occasionally clicking the same button yet again to engage in a minigame where you pull flowers off of spirits. Simple but fun. Where the game really shines though, is in its surprisingly engaging story and characters. This game has some really dark undertones and explores some touchy subjects. Talk to everyone and don't skip the dialogue. I don't really have any major issues with this game. Mostly just insignificant nitpicks, like progression, which requires you to collect red flowers through NPC side quests or through battles with spirits, which isn't a problem in itself, it's just that you don't need a lot to move forward and once you get a couple, you can skip about half the content in the game or do it anyway which essentially accomplishes nothing. It's good that they give a choice of how you can play the game but there's no sense of accomplishment for completing 100% of the game. I don't even think the game keeps track of how many red flowers you get in total. Regardless, I still recommend this game. Twenty dollars does seem a bit pricey but I got a good six hours on my main playthrough and I'll probably return to this game at some point so I'm satisfied.\n\nEdit 8/5/15 : Seems the price dropped to ten dollars. It's definitely worth it now if you don't have it yet.","February 3, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's worth picking up on sale, but not for the full price of $20.\n\nPros:\n- Looks great, especially considering it started on mobile. A lot of that probably comes down to the fact that most levels are cleverly designed to avoid needing to draw more than 20 feet in any direction, but the game does run on Unreal.\n- Usually clever writing. Not perfect by any means, but it's generally entertaining.\n- Strong world design. The descriptions comparison to Tim Schafer's work is pretty accurate in the world and character design.\n- The main mini-game is fun. It involves trying to pick flowers off the head of a spirit as it runs around and sprouts bombs and thorns to make you miss. It's reasonably challenging to win the later rounds with a perfect rating, but you're going to breeze through it if just passing is enough for you. Mileage will vary heavily here.\n- Lots of hats. Every spirit (52) and most quests (something like 12?) will give you a hat. There are also at least two pets to find, but the costume changes are limited to palette swaps, unfortunately.\n\nCons:\n- Very limited graphics options. You get a few presets with no descriptions of what any of them actually do. I don't think many people are going to have trouble running the game, but Highest turns on an incredible level of depth of field. I'd have liked to be able to turn that off.\n- Short. I finished it in 3 hours. That was enough to defeat all 52 spirits (most with 3/3 stars), complete nearly all of the quests, and find around 60-70% of the collectibles.\n- Controls are a bit wonky. Particularly the camera.\n\nNotes:\n- Achievement hunters beware! Lili has a ton of achievements and *most* are near enough to completable in a sane person's playthrough. Then there's "Break 1,000 vases." I only got to 120 despite making an effort to break any I came across. You could probably get an extra 100 or so by going out of your way to look for them, but the full 1K is going to take some serious grinding.\n- Trying to play it on a standard touchpad would be a nightmare.\n- The description compares this to Zelda, but the only similarities I can find are some of the humor, Wind Waker's art direction, and the fact that money is completely and utterly useless in both games. Don't buy it hoping for puzzles or Zelda-like combat.","December 31, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s not an RPG, adventure game or a walking simulator… It’s more of an exploration game with heavy emphasis on item collecting (hence why people call it a flower picking simulator). With some adventure elements in the mix, including “fights”, which are actually simple minigames.\n\nDon’t let the simple gameplay fool you though. Lili is an engaging game about exploring the world of friendly wood constructs and helping them out with their requests. (This usually involves gathering some items or “fighting” an enemy.) It’s not a community simulator like the Animal Crossing series, but has some similarities, including the same non-violent, relaxing charm.\n\nTechnically it was ported from iOS, but the only thing that may give it away is the very simple control scheme; the developer practically remade the whole game for PC, which includes astonishing, yet not intrusive visuals– all presented by the Unreal 3 engine– and brand new game elements. It is a version made with love (which sadly doesn’t extend to provide support for technical issues), and if you start playing it, you will feel that love too.","March 17, 2015","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You go on quests, break pots to get loot, challenge enemies, unlock doors and the character talk in text not voice.  Lili is a less violent version of Zelda because you can't die and the enemies are defeated and not killed.  Instead of swinging a sword you pick flowers off their head.  It sounds like a cheezy game but I had fun playing it and it takes some effort to get through the game.  The graphics are really good and the gameplay is easy.  This game is no match for Zelda but it's a fun adventure none the less.  Great for all ages.  I would like to note that considering this game was originally a mobile app game I'm impressed how well it's made.\n\nPros\nSimple gameplay\nGraphics\nClean language\nNot very long (complete around 5-7 hrs).  If this was a Zelda game that would be bad but for this game it's good.\n\nCons\nAchievements - most are easy to get but there's one you can't get with one playthrough which I find annoying.  To get all 3 training achievements you have to play through a second time.  You can get 2 out of 3 in a single playthrough.  Also, the game wants you to collect 1,000 flowers and breaking pots.  The flowers one takes time but not hard if you constantly collect them.  The breaking pots one seems to take forever because there's fewer of them and never marked on your map.  By the time I finished the game I only broke around 500/1,000...ugh!  If you're serious about achievements that will take up more than 5-7 hrs to complete the game.  The achievement issue doesn't make the game bad, just annoying.","July 18, 2015","true","7.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

The game is full of nice jokes and fun characters, though some moments have a darker edge to it, overplayed by the bright surroundings. Great colours, everything is shiny and bright, a joy to look at.\n\nEven though the controls with the controller are neither configurable nor actually explained, it works well. Every key binding for the items are displayed for keyboard only which may lead to some item waste as you try and figure out which controller button does which. But control is tight and during the spirit fights the controller buttons are shown correctly.\n\nThere's no speech in the game, but that - for me - only added to the charm. I felt reminded a lot of the Wind Waker, one of my favourite games as a kid. The inspiration clearly came from that game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is awfully short. You only need 3-4 hours to collect everything and defeat every spirit. The items are not really necessary here - though I only played on normal. And even though the game is so short, the fights with the spirit get a tad repetative near the end. Defeating all 52 of them brings nothing to the game, and almost every fight is the same. And replay value is nigh zero, the story is linear and everything is collectible in the first run.\n\nI have enjoyed the game so far but I can't really recommend it for full price. Though the game is beautiful, runs well and has a cute main character, it's just too short. Be sure to grab it on a discount, though.","June 21, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a game that children and adults (channel your inner child adults!) can play and enjoy.\nGraphics: When the graphics are set on 'Fantastic', which is the highest value, the game is gorgeous. The view of the island itself is magnificent and the lighting in-game makes the entire game seem somehow enchanted and magical.\nStoryline: The storyline is pretty simplistic and one should not expect a complex and in-depth storyline from this game. The plot itself is that you are Lili, a botanist and student sent to the supposedly 'uninhabited' island of Geos to collect samples of flowers to bring back home for your research project. However, you find that the island is not empty and that there are creatures (constructs and spirits and many others) of a different variety.\nGameplay: As you read in the upper section that Lili is a botanist, you may assume that you will pick flowers throughout the game. Yes, you are correct! You will be picking countless of flowers, breaking vases, talking to goofy individuals, scaring birds, finding items, and fighting spirits (yes, you will pick the flowers off of their backs!). You should not expect a hack-and-slash style or a difficult puzzle from this game.\nHumor: This game is hilarious. If you actually take your time (like I did) and talk to everyone and read everything, it turns out that our heroine is a gamer! And there are Zelda and Super Mario references (and many more) throughout the game as well as things and topics that would be considered 'inappropriate' are slightly implied so that if your children are playing it, they will not understand. If you are playing it (an adult), you will laugh your butt off!\n\nOverall, I truly enjoyed this game. No, it is not difficult but it is hilarious. It is a relatively short game (I would say approximately 3-5 hours if you don't take time to look at anything, read anything at all, explore, or do side quests), and the only reason I have 9 hours game-time is because I wanted to receive every single achievement (and I also kept going afk while in-game). This game is a good way to unwind after playing a scary game or having a bad day. The hilarity of this game is what kept me coming back!","January 12, 2015","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I bought it (like many people have) based on the dazzling screenshots and videos on the store page, and because it said it was an RPG. It took about a minute since I booted it up to realize that what I had just bought was in no way an RPG and in no way the game I had paid for. If only the Steam refund system had existed back then.\n\nThe sad part is that this game is beautiful. Really beautiful. The soundtrack isn't half bad either. Now if only those things could have been combined with a robust combat system, a world larger than 3 subdivisions in a small town and more than just a smattering of a story line then it might have been a runaway hit instead of such a letdown. Seriously, you can beat this thing in 3 hours or less, and all the side quests are nothing but fetch and find quests.\n\nI want to like this game, but I just can't bring myself to. It would be great if someday someone made a sequel or reimagining of this game, kept the theme, kept the characters and environment, but totally rebuilt and expanded everything else.

(bordering on 'some'?). There is some "humor" that is questionable both in taste and apropriateness for younger audiences. *See end of review for details, including trigger warnings and warnings for parents.\n\nAs far as the rest of the game goes, the atmosphere and evironments are absolutely stunning and worthy of screenshots. and the music is varied and well-suited. There is a bit of a Zelda-esque atmosphere which comes as no surprising seeing all the little Zelda references sprinkled throughout the game. It was refreshing to play a game that was not violent, yet still involved "beating the bad guys." So many of the characters you meet are adorable and hilarious, and have succeeded in getting laughs out of both of us. It is worth talking to all of them; they say some of the most ridiculous things. The gameplay centered around a very simple concept: pick flowers, though it was a pleasant surprise to find that it could be still be challenging sometimes. I would easily recommend this game to most of my friends.\n\nPros:\n+ Fun, non-violent gameplay\n+ Gorgeous visuals\n+ World worth exploring (not overwhelming like big sandbox games)\n+ NPCs worth interacting with\n+ Nice soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- The aforementioned tasteless jokes (why it is 8/10 and not 10/10. they were pretty gross.)\n- Unexpected spike in difficulty between areas/levels.\n- Does not clearly state its save mechanism (it's autosave, btw) and does not indicate what triggers a save\n- Bit pricey for the length. I wouldn't pay more than ~$12.\n- No replay value (one achievement needs ~half a 2nd playthrough but that's it.)\n\n*There are a small handful of instances in which sexual harassment is normalized or made into a joke. Fortunately, they are few and far between, and most are easy enough to ignore and move past, but I can see a couple of the jokes being potentially triggering - especially since you would not see it coming from a game like this (we were very surprised ourselves). None of these jokes are a big piece of the game, but it's enough to make it not an 100% all-ages friendly game. To be more specific,\nTRIGGER & PARENT WARNING: Stalking (creepy photos of Lili and her butt in one NPC's place), Sexual harassment (abuse of power/authority), Sexual abuse (1 joke).","January 4, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

But she does not pick these flowers from the fields or gardens, she only picks the ones that grow along the streets and on the monsters.\nYes, this game features flower-picking based fighting. You chase a monster and then, during the actual fight, you pluck flowers off the monster. Maybe using the mouse makes it too easy, but I never lost one of these fights.\nTo be fair, this fighting model makes more sense on a touchscreen device. This is not as surprising since earlier editions of Lili: Child of Geos were published for mobile devices. And after all, it seems new and creative to me.\n\nBut the open world of Lili: Child of Geos offers a bit more than flower picking. You can explore, collect stuff, talk to people and solve sidequests which consist of exploring, collecting stuff and talking to people.\nLili: Child of Geos is rather short and small. It took me about three or four hours to do the main quests, all the side quests and get all the nonrespawning collectibles.\n\nOn a more negative side, this game features no voice acting, only textboxes.\n\nSo, was Lili: Child of Geos any fun for me? Yes, but not 20€ worth of fun, more like 10€.\nConclusion: If you need a tiny charming open-world game for inbetween with an uhmm innovative fighting mechanic and this game is on sale, then give it a try.","July 3, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You could easily burn through its content in a day but the majority of it sadly gets very repetitive very fast. At $20.00, it's a hard sell I'd argue.\n\nYou're dropped onto the island of Geos as Lili, a college student persuing a Vege-Magical degree, and become embroiled in a conflict between the island's ruling Spirits and their servant Constructs. Lili's pursuit is not entirely selfless (at first). She's here to study the flowers that dot the island, which most conveniently grow from the backs of the Spirits, forcing her to spend a majority of the game delicately plucking them from her enemies.\n\nAs a central mechanic, the spirit combat is great and well realized. The chase to catch a spirit followed by the aforementioned flower picking is great fun, hampered only by the finicky controls thinking you want to stop and either pick flowers or smash jars when you're in hot pursuit. Lili's origins as a tablet game really show up here, as the plucking mechanic has you selecting a flower and dragging it away from a spirit to collect it.  It is fun perhaps the first handful of times, but given that there are over fifty spirits in the game to fight with little variety aside from the number of obstacles that crop up on a spirit, it does make the game's pacing drag if you are going for 100%.\n\nGeos has a lot of bright and colorful details to its world, and it is fun to just wander around the island and see what's in it as the Constructs go about their business. While not a fully realized world like in Deadly Premonition or Majora's Mask, where the characters all follow a set schedule, Geos nonetheless is a delight to get lost in for a few hours and take in the scenery.\n\nIt's also good to see Lili realized as a character; she has no love interest and she has no need of someone to come save her. As a plucky protagonist with ideas for what she wants to do with her life, Lili stands up for herself in a game that, while it has action, is at its core a non-violent experience, barring how you feel about picking flowers off the backs of monsters.\n\nIt's not a perfect game and suffers from having too many spirits to fight through, but for a quick delightful romp Lili's journey to Geos is one worth undertaking.","July 4, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The mechanics are simple and easy to understand for gamers of most ages (granted those gamers can read), and the rest of the game is made to be a family friendly adventure. Combat and violence is replaced with a fun little mini-game (which feels awkward on the mouse at first, but you'll get used to it) where you chase enemy spirits across the island, hop onto their backs, and pluck Spirit Flowers off to weaken them while avoiding the thorns and bomb plants that grow there as well. After defeating a spirit you can earn a score and a rating measured in stars, if you earn 3 stars you'll also get a colored version of that spirits mask (there are also fifty unique spirits to encounter, so that means 50 unique masks to unlock). Outside of that minigame, the rest of the game sees you running or walking around the island of Geos, slowly unlocking new zones to explore freely and to find new spirits to defeat inside. The exploration of these zones remind me a little of The Wind Waker, as the island is bright, colorful, and actually very pretty (especially on the highest settings). Unlike Wind Waker though, there are no dungeons to explore (unfortunately) but there are a lot of fun little puzzles to undertake, quests to do for the wood-construct citizens of Geos, and every time you enter a zone, a whole batch of Spirit Flowers (the same kind that grow on the heads of Spirits) spawns in random places for you to collect. Unfortunately a few bugs appear where flowers will grow inside walls or under bridges or just places you can't reach, and there are the occasional clipping issues that block Lili off from small areas she should be able to access, or temporarily stick her into the environment (only happened once for me, but it took me five minutes of running in a circle to get her free), and the zones themselves really aren't too large. However you will find yourself scouring these zones over and over while hunting for spirits, treasure chests, and flowers and the zones are well designed and so different from each other they surprisingly don't get old after a few hours of playing, and with the flowers you find you can sell them for gold coins (used to buy outfits, upgrades, and powerups for taking on spirits), trade them for keys (one key will open any lock on the island, but is destroyed after each use) so you can loot or explore the various houses and shops on the island, or you can use the flowers to gamble with in a minigame I found quite easy (probably just because I have good eyes and reflexes) to try and earn even more gold coins.\nI bought the game on a whim because it was on sale and looked cute, and surprisingly it is now my favorite game of all time, simply because it is so fun, cute, and happy it always makes me feel good when I play, no matter how poopy I feel before loading it up. I've already finished the game (it is rather short unfortunately, but I've heard you can play it for about 40 hours before collecting every single hat, outfit, lore item, mask, pet, and completing every quest) but I want to keep playing it and try getting the game's other ending and explore the bird poop mechanic a little bit more. Yes, there is a bird poop mechanic where if you run too fast while scaring birds, the poor things will fly away and poop all over Lili, leaving rainbow colored droppings all over the girls face and clothes (this always makes me laugh because she always has a calm smile on her face throughout the game).\nSo would I recommend this game? Yes, however the majority of Hardcore gamers probably wouldn't like the game for much more than the billions of references to Dark Souls, Oregon Trail, Mario, Zelda, Minecraft, Prometheus (yes, the movie), and much more. Children would probably love the colors and characters, but a lot of jokes and dialogue would probably be wasted on them. But if you're a total nerd who wants to play a peaceful game that'll just make you laugh and give you at least 3 to 5 hours of sheer happiness (that's the minimum time to beat the storyline), you'll probably love it as much as I do.","June 28, 2014","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's not difficult at all but it an odd way, it was really fun. Definitely something you can just relax and play. It reminds me of a game that would be on Wii-U due to its cute charm. I got it on sale for under $3 and I suggest everyone do the same.\n\nPros:\n\n+ GFX are nice\n+ The characters are really odd and interesting\n+ Has a great charm and there are some cool game references like Zelda and Mega Man\n+ Honestly, fun to play\n+ The surroundings are really fun to look at\n+ I could argue that it is the best casual game I have ever played\n\nCons:\n\n- Too easy, not challenging at all, you can get a key to open all locked doors at the beginning of the game, the items are useless, I didn't even need to use them\n- Moving between areas, the game kind of freezes for two seconds when opening red doors, annoying\n- When using a controller, some times the right stick will drift to the left, it can be fixed just by moving the right stick, but I don't think this game was designed to support controllers at first\n- Full price for this game is too much, I beat it in 6 hours and got 42/46 achievements, $20 is too much\n\nOverall, I'll give it a thumbs up. Just get it when it is on sale and don't expect it to be something super epic.

I well knew that the game was only a simple game, all it was about was picking up flowers (lol?) and quick time events fights. So I was prepared to a mediocre game with a good artistic style.\n\nWell, it's much more than that. The style is in fact very pleasant, I would say very well designed levels. You get 5 different levels in which you can free roam (you can't jump so no platforming sessions). Every level is quite different from the other and very suggestive. Every level also comes with its own background music.\n\nThe 'fights' consist in getting close enough to the enemy, and triggering the QTE (with the mouse cursor, or with ABXY buttons of the 360 controller). It is a nice QTE, compared to the average QTE in other games. During the fight you also can choose whether to use or not some powers (flash bombs).\n\nThe Character can be upgraded and customized (although the outfits are different almost only in colors). The flower picking is not tedious, comes spontaneous while you walk around enjoying the scenery.\n\nWhen I saw the achievements....picking up 1000 flowers....I thought it was crazy. But no, in fact in only a few hours I did everything in the game and it really was no hassle. I enjoyed every part of it. It is the exact game I was looking for: it is nice, fun enough, and not complicated at all. It is a perfect game for children, or for grownups that want to relax from all the other FPS and action games, and dedicate themselves to this relaxing game. You don't have to reflect, you don't have to plan anything or else, just sit back and enjoy this little game. 80/100","December 22, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

After 4H of playing im done with the main Story and unlocked every Item, got 3 Stars on every possible Enemy and completed every single Side-Quest.\n\nNow going on with the Good Points: I like the graphics very mutch, not too realistic with a little cartoony,handdrawn look. Some good athmosphere Light effects as well as good Bump-Mapping. The Map is just awesome designed and with love to every detail. Also the Character Models are always unique Characters also with effort and creativity put into everyone (except the Spirits, they always look the same, just the Mask differs), while you gotta say that those squeky voices kinda annoyed after a while. Also the Main Character, Lili, has a well thought-out character and a athmosphere fitting look. The Gameplay Mechanics are also something new and nice to experience aswell as they are easy to learn. I've got to mention the Controller Support the Devs put into the game ( you dont run across that often) is also a good job and easy to work with. Also the text lines are always fitting, sometimes funny, and very entertaining ( some spelling issues in items descriptions :/ ).\n\nFor especially the the Offer Price its totaly worth its money.\n\nBefore you go, always remember that there are TONS of video Game references or direct Links in the whole game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demontrace/recommended/266490/","demontrace","demontrace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demontrace/","1006 products in account","So somehow my review got lost, whether because of this "upgrade" to the complete edition, or some other reason, either way, here's my thoughts from back when I tried this abomination:\n\nReally boring, and not my type of game.\n\nFirst the options menu: It's horrible. Only a few resolution options, a few buttons for graphical options, which are preset according to setting like High, Highest, and so forth. No actual customising available. Keybindings cannot be changed. Basic mouse options of inverting, and mouse sensitivity buttons, rather than a bar or a number. All in all, the options menu needs a lot of work.\n\nGame starts off talking to everyone, and walking into building to talk to more people. You can also add to your fun by breaking vases or opening chests. The chests contain items that have really unfunny descriptions. That is basically a recurring facet of this game. Unfunny dialogue, stale descriptions, and flat jokes.\nDuring dialogue there is some voice work, but it doesn't match the text. Rather, it's your character saying hello multiple times in a conversation, and the constructs/spirit things making weird sounds.\n\nFinally, the character design is pretty bad. The female doesn't have to be attractive, nor have large assets, but I'm going to have to say the haircut is pretty horrid. A tumblrina if you will. The whole look of her is unbecoming to me, other than the outfit, which is passable. I suppose she matches an explorer, although it feels like the designer wanted her to be Lara Croft, just without being attractive in a tradional sense. I suppose the word is, hipster. This is of course subjective, but will this present times inspired look work in the future, should someone find themselves playing it? Does it work in present times? I don't feel her look emphasizes 'geeky girl'. It's different, and I feel emphasizes tumblr, SJW, feminist, things of that sort. I personally don't fall into that camp, and as such, makes me worry that the game is designed by a development group that IS affected by those camps. Politics don't belong in a game, unless directly marketed as such, and creativity marred by such a thing is troubling. From what I played of the game, I don't necessarily think the game itself is an extension of SJW beliefs, but I believe the creation of the character you play as in a physical sense, IS affected by the creators political beliefs. Take that as you will.\n\nThe world is colorful, and the game is inoffensive, in terms of interactions, but it just seems aimed at a younger audience, or people with easily offended sensibilities. I like a wide range of games, whether shooters, puzzles, rpgs, or some adventure games. I'll even go back to games like legend of zelda, or super mario bros. This game, however, is not my cup of tea, and I cannot recommend it. It lacks depth, and your interactions with the world reflects that. I didn't feel engaged, and more like the game was a chore. Maybe I'll come back in the future, but as things stand, it's too boring to hold my interest.","May 3","false","3.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

There is a bit of a plot here but ultimately the desire to return to the game isn't strong enough and the reply value is almost zero.\n\nThis brings me to the issue of, "Should I recommend this game to others?"\nThat is really a very conditional thing because there is money involved.\n\nHad this been a F2P game then I would wholeheartedly recommend it due to the fact that, in short sessions, the game is really very enjoyable and is a pleasure to look at. The visuals and style of the game just scream quality from the rooftops and there is enough tongue-in-cheek humour here to put a smile on even the most cynical of faces. If you enjoy games you will come across such a large number of references to other titles it is almost wrong to call them Easter Eggs since the game is saturated with them rather than having them hidden away. The developers clearly love Legend of Zelda and other Nintendo games because they not only attempted to create an Nintendo-esque art style but they also added music to the game which is clearly inspired by games such as Wind Waker. They achieved that goal with such success that you could drop Mario or Link into the game world and they'd look perfectly at home.\n\nUnfortunately when it comes to paying money for this and wanting value for money from your purchase, Child of Geos has very little to offer. It reminds me of something that would work well as a casual game for a rainy afternoon but nothing more, as such I wouldn't recommend this game unless it was on sale for maybe £2-3 at most.\n\nWhat the developers have created here is really something which deserves a sequel though, while they missed the mark on gameplay they have set a new benchmark for style and quality for the visuals, music and presentation for an indie game. I sincerely hope that this isn't the last we'll see of Lili.","November 29, 2014","false","4.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

However I can tell you about my own breif run in with this game.\nWhen I first opened the game it was in some obscure resolution that my screens couldn't comprehend.\nTo later on find the options menu proved to be a difficylt task. As the game appearently was taller than my screen but still thinner. So I had to click around outside of my screen until I got the correct button.\nFrom there on things just got even more cryptic. For in regards to screen resolution you do NOT have the choice of 1920*1080. Nor any other that fits.\nFurthermore, as the final nail in the coffin (for me), this game gives you 4 buttons in regards to mouse speed.

This game is AWESOME. It's really relaxing and the characters are really fun and interesting. Lili's character is interesting, albeit a bit under-developed. The "combat" is very low stress and is legitmately fun. You wont find yourself cursing rampantly if you mess up (at least I didn't find myself doing that). The only thing this game needs is more... more levels, more travels. I'd love to see DLC's in the future, although I know it is a small dev team. In closing, this game is fun, pretty, and may remind you of some of the old 3rd person RPG's from N64-PS2 era gaming (not only because of the references), it just needs more content.\n\n9/10","December 10, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a great breathtaking game , now the story is short and sweet and has a nice feeling tone to it not much of it to be honest. The camera controlls are great controller works dandy and the only thing I can complain about are two little things. One the voice acting , there is none just text speach followed by a voice of that person. Well if you already made that person make a noise or say "Hay" followed by a few other voice commands why not just finish up the whole dam thing. I mean that game is shorter than the chat dialogs so there were some loss of effort that is clear to see. Now last the music , very well put in and done , but there is only one whole song set into this game. Either that or I cannot tell because they are more same sounding than nickleback. Seriously I wish this game had diffrent tone settings on music and it lasted more than 10 mins Its like hearing your favorite bands most played to songs over and over a few times.

Once there, you discover that a race of beings called Constructs are working as slaves for vicious little critters called Spirits.  Naturally, you'll battle the Spirits, free the Constructs, do a little soul-searching, and save the day.\n\nThe gameplay is charming, but fairly limited.  You'll walk around, talk to people, do fetch quests, and fight Spirits in what are essentially QTE mini-games.  You jump on their backs and pluck all of their flowers out, avoiding thorns and shedding bombs as you go.  Defeated Spirits merely run off in a huff; everything is very non-violent and kid appropriate.  There's also a gambling mini-game that is fun for a few spins.\n\nSadly, there isn't much story to tie it all together.  It's clear that the evil Mayor will be the Big Bad from the get-go, so not much mystery there.  Lili's only real drama is whether or not to abandon the Constructs to turn in her project on time, and I doubt anyone will be very confounded on which path to choose.  Lili will also exchange letters with her professor that hint at some deeper family trauma at play, but it's only brought up at the very end of the game and nothing much is said of it.  Exploring that a little further might have added some real heart to the game and made it feel a bit more substantial.\n\nOf course, many of the game's shortcomings can be traced to its origins as a smartphone app, with an emphasis on sharp graphics and simplistic gameplay.  Make no mistake, the game is quite beautiful, but the transition from app to Steam product was less than ideal.  The game feels a bit unpolished all over, and the achievements are a total mess - some are bugged, others pop up erroneously, and many are tedious grinds which are completely inessential to clearing the game.  The game was perfectly playable on my end and didn't crash, but the whole thing felt rushed.\n\nAnd yet, with all that said, I'll give the game a mild thumbs up.  It's nice to see a family appropriate game on Steam, especially with a female protagonist.  It looks great, has pleasant tunes, and the writing can be quite funny in places.  You can tell that the adult writers were slipping in a ton of gags to either amuse themselves or any parents nearby.  It all goes down easy and most people will get a few hours of fun out of it.  That said, I got the game for 85% off - I wouldn't pay anything close to the base price of $20 for it.  Something in the $5 range is more appropriate.","January 30, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nolanalighieri/recommended/266490/","nolanalighieri","LordLiquorich","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nolanalighieri/","71 products in account","As usual with my reviews, let me start with the TL;DR version for those who don't have time to read a wall of text,\n\n"Lilli: Child of Geos" is an astoundingly charming indie game full of colour and character. The gameplay is addictive but can get a bit samey, but, thankfully doesn't overstay it's welcome. While the $20 price tag is a bit high for a 5 hour long game, it's well worth a shot when on sale if you are into casual, colourful experiences.\n\nNow for the meat:\n\nLilli is one charming title. There is so much colour in this game to help make the island of Geos feel alive, making each of the characters you meet another interesting addition to the game. Just starting off this review, if I have to say what this game's strong suit is, it is definitely the art direction it took with aesthetics, I couldn't ask for it any other way.\nThe gameplay, while somewhat reminiscent of "Zelda" games, lacks any sort of true combat mechanic. Even the game remarks at one point, acknowledging the fact that you will not "kill" anything on this island, even the bad guys. The idea predmoninantly is based around the idea of exploring the town (divided into 4 seperate sections) on the island of Geos. While in each section of the town there are various tasks to be completed: from independant exploration to find treasures, flowers, and pots to smash; to completing quests the various towns people have - most of these ranging in a form of a fetch quest, disappointingly.\nThe game also features RPG-esque stat building. These stat points are there to help aid you in the core mechanic of the game, which is finding, capturing, and defeating "spirits". This involves using the mouse to click on flowers and plants to pluck from the head of the spirit while trying to maintain your grip on said spirit by not plucking thorny plants or getting hit by...-bomb flowers-....\nThis mechanic works well enough to do the job, but is certainly not the highlight in quality for this game. The mechanic itself tends to get a bit monotonous after a lengthy playthrough with this game, as well as the 3-star rating system that seems to be unclear as to how to obtain a rank. Often times I found a well executed "plucking" of a Spirit would only reward 2 stars, while other times I was fumbling over thorny plants and mis-clicking, I still got 3 stars.\nWhen it comes to the controls of this game, this is probably the worst part, sadly. There are NO REBINDABLE KEYS. while the game doesn't use a lot of keys to begin with, I had many frustration that the "Interact" and the "mount Spirit" function were mapped to the same key, leading often to me talking to an NPC, rather than mounting the spirit I was chasing. Additionally there is some of the ABSOLUTE WORST mouse acceleration in this game. Even set to the "highest" mouse sensitivity, the game seems to have "camera smoothing" which results in the games camera and character feeling very, very floaty. I figured perhaps a controller would feel more comfortable for this type of thing, but surprisingly it was even more uncomfortable for me to play with a controller than a mouse. This is something that I hope the Developer will fix in later patches. Unfortunately, if you gathered with the 3-star rating system, addictive game play, colourful graphics, and wonky controls: Yes, this game seems to be intended for mobile platforms, and I think is quite a blemish on this game to have to comprimise competent, and proper PC graphics and control settings to aid with the underpowered mobile devices.\nBefore concluding I would like to mention a HUD bug this game seems to have, which is most apparent on 4:3 panels. This game does not feature proper word wrapping or font-size adjustments. Often text will bleed off of the on-screen button or prompt - this looks unattractive and very amatuerish.\nAdditionally I want to make 1 side note: While I am not a professor of law, I think this game borders dangerously close to infringing some copyright, with blatant use of Nintendo IP titles and names, additionally a music track in Mill Hill is dangerously close to a track in the Sims 3.\n\nLilli, with it's blemishes aside, is still a fun and addicting game to play. While the price tag is hard to justify for it's 5 hour campaign, if you find it on sale, I can't recommend it enough that you play this game. Give it a go if you want a happy, and very casual experience!","November 2, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a wonderful first impression for the studio and I honestly cannot wait for them to release more games. The game reminds me a lot of Zelda and Kingdom Hearts in its design which I enjoyed and I thought the goofy story line was cute as well. The cast will steal your heart by the end of the game and you won't really have a problem with that. There a few different areas on the island to explore which is surprising for such a small game. It's quite fun to unlock all the doors and see what's hiding inside. The combat system is interesting. Instead of hitting them or shooting at them you jump on their backs and steal their flowers. I thought this was a very unique take on fighting systems. Lili is beautifully designed and lots of fun to play though it is only about 8 hours long so I would suggest waiting for it to go on sale.

Especially the first couple of areas. They've designed and built an exquisite world for this game, and then decided that they don't want you to actually explore it. You can't walk through a lot of bushes, jump on walls, walk down the beach, climb on roofs, or even go down some passageways. I honestly don't understand what the decision process was during this whole thing. Beautiful environment that is begging to have every exquisite inch explored, climbed on, and jumped over, but no you need to walk on the path.\n\nThe enemies are unchallenging and repetitive. Not really a bad thing, because you spend so much time doing other stuff, but... well, it is a bad thing. It's definitely a weak point. It's not good. I at first thought that it was because it was targetted at children, but my friends kids (5 and 7) also think the enemies are too easy.\n\nIt is crazy short for what you're paying.

The world is rich and vibrant, with colours and structures that are nothing less than a joy to take in; from a crumbled and dilapidated residence to a light and woodsy forest, the visual design of this game is a real treat.\n\nThe next thing that sticks out is the simplicity of it all. Lili runs about collecting flowers as they spring up for use as currency to purchase upgrades which make the main task of the game a bit easier. Essentially, you chase down an enemy, leap onto it, and hold on as you race against your own fading strength to collect a rare flower from it, furthering your progress in the game.\n\nFinally, you'll notice the life in the game. L:CoG has you playing a likeable character amidst a cast of silly and quirky personalities who really bring this world to life. From a heartfelt postman with an odd way of delivering letters to an out-of-place group of spirits bent on destruction, there's so much to discover in the conversations with people alone, even though some of them are more than you bargained for (such as a photographer who stalks you or a woman who serves cannibalistic soup). In some cases, the storytelling can be surprisingly subtle (Towards the end of the game, you can see a pair of glasses at the top of a tower, hinting that Lili's father had possibly visited previously) or even a bit powerful (such as the dismantling of your mentor or the creepy and sinister feel of the Mayor.).\n\nRife with secrets and easter eggs such as a knockoff Master Sword and an E-tank lying about in a house, my experience was nothing short of satisfying. Lili: Child of Geos harkens back to the late nineties/early aughts, before "collect-a-thon" was a derogatory term. It revives in me a feeling of nostalgia for Spyro and Crash Bandicoot but also the wonder of a new experience, and for all of that, I sing its praises. L:CoG is not a long game, by any means, but it is an experience that I highly recommend.","March 16, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for a short distraction, it's a great choice.\nI picked it up on a whim during the Autumn sale, sat down, and blasted through it in one sitting.\nI looked at it because of the visuals. For an indie game, it's beautiful. Stylistic without abandoning realism. Bright and colorful. Great lighting. The character models are also really good, and well animated for the most part. The NPCs do seem to have one or two looping animations that they run through, but there's a lot of different NPCs, each with their own thing going on, so you never spend too much time looking at the single animations.\nThere is a story in there. It's nothing fantastic, but it isn't horrible. Its a sort of basic hero story; you show up on this island for a school project, and are introduced to a class struggle between the spirits, who own the island. and the constructs, who were created to serve the spirits. It moves along pretty quick, and the "big bad" of sorts is pretty entertaining to deal with.\nThe gameplay is almost a QTE sort of thing. You run around the island, picking up collectables. Flowers, which can be traded for money, chests that have money and quest or cosmetic items, and vases that you kick open for money and achievement score. Then you come across spirits roaming the quarters, and jump on their back for the main gameplay, where you are shown flowers you have to pick. You pick the good flowers and avoid the bad flowers, and pick bombs to throw off as you progress. You can upgrade your Speed (movement, helps you keep up with the spirits), Grip (gives you more time to hang on to their backs), and Stealth (makes you harder for them to notice, allowing you to get closer to them before they see you and start running away). I upgraded Speed to max, and Grip about halfway, and never had much trouble. You also get scored on how well you did. Picking more bad flowers or letting bombs explode in your face take points away, and for every 3 star score you get, you get the spirit's mask to wear.\nThere are also quests to do for the constructs. Simple stuff, like find me an item (in a chest somewhere nearby), go take down a specific spirit, go find and talk to another construct. They give cosmetic items, hats mostly.\nYou get a lot of hats to choose from, mostly masks from the spirits, but a fair amount of regular hats or headwear.\n\nTL;DR - It's fun, really short, and really pretty. I bought it for less than $5 and I feel really happy with it. I don't know if I'd agree with $20, but for $10 or less, its definitely something to pick up","December 3, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/266490/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Lili: Child of Geos is a game with massive potential that would've been excellent if it were actually made for the PC, and worst of all it's not even the developer's fault.\n\nSeeing this game in the Steam Store, the first thoughts to come to mind were "This looks fantastic" and "Why haven't I heard of this before"? Unfortunately the answer was evident in about 10 minutes. This is a mobile port - a fantastic looking one that trumps most indie games made for the PC proper in terms of looks, but a mobile port nonetheless and that permeates the game to its core.\n\nThis game is obviously a labour of love and it shows. But that it's also a mobile game utterly annihilates all of its positives - there's a "but" for each and every one.\n\n•Every inch of the world looks fantastic, but you can't interact with it beyond walking around it.\n•All of the levels are utterly distinct, but there's only four of them and they take 20 minutes to beat.\n•The characters are well written and distinctly funny, but you never get more than half a dozen lines out of even the most prominent ones.\n•There's sidequests and optional content, but they're all threadbare.\n•Design is solid all around, but assets are reused to a comical degree - I had trouble telling NPCs apart.\n\nThreadbare describes the game as a whole. Combat altering inventory items? Great idea. There's three of them and they're thrown at you, though. Stat increase system? Great idea. Shallow as a puddle, though. Climactic mid-sequence about abandoning previous life choices? Great idea. It consists of three and a half lines of dialogue either way and falls completely flat though.\n\nWorst case is the combat (or "combat", but there's enough high-octane explosives involved that I think you can safely ignore the whole nonviolent billing) - you perform the same unchanging minigame twenty or so times and then the game is over. Fifty-five if you're aiming for completionist.\n\nFor a mobile game these are all more than excusable. Hell, I've no doubt that had I played this on a mobile device it would rank up there with the best; Dead Space iOS and Infinity Blade. But I didn't, and for a PC game, to put it lightly, it kicks it straight in the balls. Right in there. And it isn't the developers' fault. But that's just how it is.\n\nAt it's best Lili: Child of Geos is an exercise in frustration at lost potential the likes of which I haven't felt since Crash Twinsanity.\n\nEven though I wouldn't actually recommend this to anyone, maybe just buy it anyway. Support the developers. I want to see another game from them. Built from the ground up for PC this time.\n\nAlso, gamepad support is kind of lacking and the video game references get a little shoehorned at times.","December 5, 2014","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It bothers me how you can't fully complete Lili's skill tree but it isn't necessary for finishing the game. Overall I would give this game a 7/10 based on the world, story, and game play.

So as do all (*cough* most) of my games, I bought it on sale.\n\nI have 4 younger siblings, and this game provides a safe, clean, game environment for them. As with most games, there was some humor pertaining to current society, but nothing that a younger child would understand. The graphics are spectacular one of a kind.\n\nIf you are looking to spend your money on longlasting game, this game isn't for you. If what you want is a clean and beautiful gameplay, I would definitely partake in the playing of this game. Though personally, I believe the game should be in the $5-$8 price range, the game is definitely worth it if you have young children (around 8 years of age) whom you want to play clean games.\n\nTo the developers:\nYou created something new here. Work on that. Create a franchise. Ease of the throttle of side quests and add more to the storyline next time. This game is peaceful, but it could still have such a sense even if you added more strategy without exactly adding more challenge. Add more customization to the strategy. More than just outfits, but outfit pieces that contribute to a better stat system. Invest in voice actors, it makes a huge difference. Look into adding a better ambient/light-trance music to the game to compliment the awesome scenery you achieved. Lastly be optimistic!

The premise is that Lili has arrived on a mysterious island in order to study plants. She discovers a society run by Spirits who build wooden people called Contructs to do their bidding. Her mission then becomes to help the Constructs find freedom by defeating the Spirits. To defeat the Spirits, she has to pull flowers out of their backs. If you're using a keyboard and mouse, you'll use the mouse pointer to manually pick out flowers whilst avoiding thorns. If using a controller, you'll use corresponding buttons (A, X, B, and Y if you're using an Xbox 360 controller).\nInbetween fights, you'll explore the land of Geos, opening chests and doors and doing various side tasks for the local residents. As you progress, you'll gain points to improve your ability to grip onto Spirits, run, and approach Spirits without them noticing you (these are listed as Grip, Run, and Sneak respectively). This is how they qualify that whole "RPG hybrid" bit.\nThe game will take you a few hours to complete if you do every sidequests (and by "a few" I mean less than 3 or 4 depending on how well you can find flowers and avoid falling off Spirits) so the $20 price tag may not be worth it unless you can find replay value in defeating straggling Spirits, rematching old ones for a higher score, or venturing into a harder difficulty.\nIf I had to recommend this game, it probably wouldn't be to fans of Zelda, Broken Age, or Psychonauts (although there are 3 or 4 Zelda references that might bore you), but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't enjoyable. Still, the short length and the shortage of explorable areas keep the game from being the Zelda-esque adventure it strives to be.\nSo ultimately, can I recommend this game? I want to say, "No," but I had fun with it, so I'll begrudgingly press the "Yes" button alongside a precaution to wait for a sale.","February 4, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Well, almost everything.)\n\nBut seriously, I'm not sure where to begin. The game is gorgeous, for starters. Don't be deterred by the fact that it was previously a mobile iOS game -- Lili: Child of Geos is a complete overhaul, and even playing on the lowest graphical setting I found myself just looking around in awe half the time. Everything about Lili's world is memorable, from the world design to the characters. There's a lot of wonderful dialogue and description text, and finding all of it feels like its own reward.\n\nThe gameplay is light, but clever. While exploring the world, you kick vases, pick flowers, and open chests, but more importantly, you chase down jerkface spirits so you can leap on their backs, yank out all their spirit flowers, and wear their masks in mockery. The whole thing is oddly relaxing and occasionally reminiscent of Fruit Ninja. But it was also the place that, for me, the controls fell down a bit, None of the control schemes available felt all that functional to me. On some spirits I'd effortlessly pick all the necessary flowers in a few seconds, but on others I found myself desperately grabbing at the same flower over and over, my clicks never connecting. I should also note that achievements seem buggy; I was occasionally awarded achievements I didn't actually earn.\n\nBut all in all, I adored the game world and the characters, and I really liked the innovative approach to dealing with enemies! Lili: Child of Geos oozes personality, and it's a game that I'm sure I'll keep coming back to for a good laugh.","January 29, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel like I'm missing some back story from how cold the opening was, but it really didn't detract from me getting stuck in to the begaining and learning the ropes of combat, if you can call it that, but your motivation however selfish Lili's may be initially feels very justified, like shooting Nazi's, it's has a mind set along the lines of "Of course I will topple this government, it's corrupt." the best part is you don't actually harm anyone in the process, pacifism for the win. Characters seem innocent and in need of your help, while bad guys seem uncareing and unworthy of your pity, there are side quests, mostly consiting of find x item and return when you do, so non time sensative my favorite kind, your main goal is to develop a substantial collection of magical flowers. Why? I don't know, apparently Lili is a colledge student wrting her Thesis, that's just what I've gathered from her saying explicitly that to several NPC's. Also no voice acting, so if you hate reading diolouge that dosen't scroll unless you tell it to, like in older adventure games, it really dosen't matter, seeing as you get quest markers on the map, you could possible just ignore all the talking and fallow the markers to beat the game, maybe occasionally need to hit Esc to see the next non marked goal. It's pretty and fun, and I bought a potion that makes butterflies like me more, also it's full of Pop Culture Tresure chests.","April 9, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is the dev's love letter to gaming in the '90s. The world is beautiful, the characters quirky, and the entire game will bring a feeling of childhood nostalgia for any Gen X-er.\n\nThose with kids who are on their way to be second-generation Hylian adventurers will like Lili. The difficulty is adjustable so both the young ones and parents can enjoy a bit of a challenge. The game is short but never feels grindy, a few acheivements notwithstanding.\n\nI played with a 360 controller and the hit detection for collecting items was a bit unforgiving at times, but I'm guessing that isn't the case for keyboard/mousers. That was my only real issue with this game.\n\nPersonally my favorite part of Lili is its humor. You'll notice a lot of screenshots with other videogames being referenced and also with Lili playing the straightman to a world of silly spirits and constructs. This is also the only game I have ever played where every single house has a toilet. Ironic that it's a game where all the characters are wooden dummies.\n\nSo a thumbs up from me, and I look forward to any sequels or new games from this team.","April 30, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Well, almost everything.)\n\nBut seriously, I'm not sure where to begin. The game is gorgeous, for starters. Don't be deterred by the fact that it was previously a mobile iOS game -- Lili: Child of Geos is a complete overhaul, and even playing on the lowest graphical setting I found myself just looking around in awe half the time. Everything about Lili's world is memorable, from the world design to the characters. There's a lot of wonderful dialogue and description text, and finding all of it feels like its own reward.\n\nThe gameplay is light, but clever. While exploring the world, you kick vases, pick flowers, and open chests, but more importantly, you chase down jerkface spirits so you can leap on their backs, yank out all their spirit flowers, and wear their masks in mockery. The whole thing is oddly relaxing and occasionally reminiscent of Fruit Ninja. But it was also the place that, for me, the controls fell down a bit, None of the control schemes available felt all that functional to me. On some spirits I'd effortlessly pick all the necessary flowers in a few seconds, but on others I found myself desperately grabbing at the same flower over and over, my clicks never connecting. I should also note that achievements seem buggy; I was occasionally awarded achievements I didn't actually earn.\n\nBut all in all, I adored the game world and the characters, and I really liked the innovative approach to dealing with enemies! Lili: Child of Geos oozes personality, and it's a game that I'm sure I'll keep coming back to for a good laugh.","January 29, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is definitely a game for those people who love to get to every chest and go through every door. There's some cute hats, masks and outfits to collect too.\n\nI have only two cons for the game. First, if you see the cute flying french bulldog in the banner? Apparently they took the dog away for newer buyers of the game. I obviously didn't buy the game just for the dog, but it was still disappointing (and throws the term "complete edition" into question). Second, there were a few loose ends left unresolved, so that feeling of completion was marred a bit by a few unanswered questions.

It was a great pallet cleanse to a lot of modern gaming, around the general tones of Disney and Pixar.  There is an obvious conflict and the "bad guys" are cruel without reason.  The dicotomy works, but it would take "Game Theory" levels of itching out information to dig the story deeper that "the bad guys are bad because".  Not that I'm oppose to that, I'd be curious.

Especially the first couple of areas. They've designed and built an exquisite world for this game, and then decided that they don't want you to actually explore it. You can't walk through a lot of bushes, jump on walls, walk down the beach, climb on roofs, or even go down some passageways. I honestly don't understand what the decision process was during this whole thing. Beautiful environment that is begging to have every exquisite inch explored, climbed on, and jumped over, but no you need to walk on the path.\n\nThe enemies are unchallenging and repetitive. Not really a bad thing, because you spend so much time doing other stuff, but... well, it is a bad thing. It's definitely a weak point. It's not good. I at first thought that it was because it was targetted at children, but my friends kids (5 and 7) also think the enemies are too easy.\n\nIt is crazy short for what you're paying. I cleared it in about 5hrs, and then spent about an hour looking for other, secret, things to do, but didn't find anything.\n\nAfter all of that, I am recommending it, because I enjoyed playing it. I like this game, and I want them to fix it, make a sequel, and keep making games.","March 11, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its more about exploreing then beating up the bad guys so if your looking for a tough chalange then you might be disapointed as even on the hardest seting I blew though it in a few hours and spent the remainer acheavement hunting. There are no lives, no health, if a bad guy throws you off like a bucking bronko then you just dust yourself off and try again.\n\nThe story plays out like an old cartoon, fun but full of holes. The characters are intresting to look at and some of the comments got a giggle but don't look for actual depth behind them, the game is incredable to look at and I could spend all day just looking around enjoying the sights, just wish a game that focused so much on exploreing gave us more to explore. I felt like just when I was geting into it, it was over.\n\nIf your looking for a silly family firendly game to kill a few hours then this is worth checking out as a nice breath of fresh air, though you might want to tone down the settings a bit as its a bit intensive unless you on a gameing system. If you want something tough to test your skills and earn braging rights then look somewhere elce cause this isn't it.","March 8, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't really like casual game- something that isn't stimulating really puts me off. But I can't believe how drawn I am to Lili.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple- you are on an island collecting flowers for your (school?) project. You have to collect red soul flowers from the islands evil spirits. I admit it does get a bit repetitive after a while. But thats where the beauty of the game comes in. The environments feel so greatly detailed. You can go into some of the houses of the towns folk and you get a pretty detailed look at how they run their lives, pictures on the walls, toilet paper on a tree-stick holder! With every new area I seek out- the more amazed I am of the beauty.\n\nThis is a short happy game- be prepared to do things over and over with a little bit of rotation. But take your time, explore. Experience the beauty.\n\nIf I'm ever to get the Occulus- I really want this game to be playable with it. I want to be in this dream world!\n\nPros:\nABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL GAME\nNice soundtrack\ninteresting 'people'\nSneaky game refrences\n\nCons:\nNot a really deep story\nEnemies are repetative\nVery little voice acting makes it feel like a wall of text sometimes\n\nI decided to pick up this gem when it was on sale\n","January 5, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

She finds the island and plans on collecting flower samples from the island. The island consists of wooden constructs and spirits. The constructs are essentially ill treated slaves and only Lili can help because your a human. Thus your goal is finish your school project by grabbing onto the mean spirits and... deflower them. As Lili runs around grabbing and deflowering male/female spirits she also collects things. You can buy stuff at the shop as well. You also level up your grab, stealth, and speed skills.\n\nThe Good\nThe art style is amazingly fun and colorful. The pull flowers mini game is actually quite fun considering how simple it is. The music and characters are quite lovely as well. More then anything this game just has that casual goofy fun vibe going for it.\n\nThe Bad\nIt doesn't have actual speech in the conversations. It advertises itself as a Legend of Zelda when it play more like a Animal Crossing slash flower picking similulator. I would also say that the game suffers from being to simple. You'll be left feeling that the game could have been a legend of zelda if they would have tried for it. The game tends to shove video game references and trivia down your throat.\n\nConclusion\nIts a casual fun game. Don't go in expecting a grand 3D platformer because this is just a phone game on steroids.\n\nValue\nAs beautiful and playful as this game is it really isn't a huge value.

When I saw screens of it I first thought this is probably some kind of highly polished hidden object game. What “sold” me was when I discovered you can actually walk this marvellous world.\n\nItem hint: Get the Skeleton Key early on as well as the Treasure Map (helps you keep track of chest and find flowers). Boots, bracelets and necklaces seem to have negligible effects when hunting Spirits.\n\n+ Beautiful somehow cuddly graphics\n+ Mostly relaxing atmosphere\n+ Okay story, hints to a possible prequel\n+ References\n+ Moderate length\n+ Game advises to visit the options menu and asks to automatically determine graphics settings\n+ Basically no grinding\n+ Good controls\n0 Unfortunately no voice acting\n0 Different camera modes\n- Some advertising for another BitMonster game\n- Level cap, making it impossible to max out all skills with the same avatar\n- Flowers sometimes in places that are simply unreachable\n\nI started playing this game in the hope it would provide a counterpoint to Dead Island which had become exhausting and bullseye. After playing like 15 minutes I felt pretty relaxed. The game still has tense moments but all in all it's a pretty tranquil experience.\nAlthough the game's world is not too big it has an expansive feel to it, maybe because it looks lived-in or alive.\nThe back story is rather light, maybe owed to the mobile origins of the game. You control Lili who has come to Geos as a Vegi-Magical student from the Gildern Magis College (with a deadline) but is quickly entangled in in the conflicts of a two-class society. Most NPCs have some depth to them which you learn by interacting with them, i.e. fighting the bad ones (Spirits) and talking to the good ones (Constructs). There is usually a reward for exhausting interaction.\nThere are some indicators to a story that happened before so there may be a prequel.\n\nA Construct mentions a geophantasmogramist visiting the island before Lili\nThere is a pair of glasses in the lighthouse that look like Lili's\nA letter from Lili's father mentions Lili's lost sister\nLili finds a tombstone for a girl named Orchid, who may have been, fitting in with flower-named girls, Lili's sister\nThe game's title is “Child of Geos” so Lili is supposedly linked to the island\nThe fishes find Lili's eyes (without glasses; the player never sees them) very interesting, alternating between wanting others to see them or Lili to hide them\nLeft over comb\nThe Constructs are wood-based being making a disturbingly wood-based living in wooden houses with wooden furniture and wooden toilets, even toilet paper and even bringing it to a Soylent Green conclusion.\nThere are a number of pop-references in the game and there is a mock pop-quiz where Lili can show off here extensive knowledge of games.\nThere is also occasional, not too much, advertisement for another game by BitMonster.\n\nThe game is of moderate length and may take you two evenings to complete. You can explore the world some more after you beat it. There are a number of achievements that may make you play some more and the “max out skill” achievements actually require you to stature at least one additional game – it took me not quite an hour to max out a single stat. Besides that there is almost no grinding.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no voice-acting. Instead there are a few generic sounds or words, e.g. “Hello”, and Lili's feelings are well-done by stances and facial expressions.\n\nWith so many games not actually having any actual options, I found it interesting that the game starts out with advising you to go to the options menu and offers to automatically determine your machine's graphic settings.\n\nThe controls work fine with the world's topology and are pretty tight with few exceptions. When chasing a Spirit it happened at times that instead of jumping onto them I suddenly found myself in conversation with a Construct or picking a flower because the game decided that was more likely what I wanted. Then you're supposed to collect flowers set around the world but a few of them are simply set in places Lili can never reach, e.g under bridges.\nThere is a number of different camera modes that aren't listed in the games help - I didn't find any use for them. Activated them with keys Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, then move around a bit to see their effect.\n\nLili: Child of Geos was a lot of fun and I recommend it. I bought the game as part of a bundle and probably wouldn't buy it for the full price (currently 10 Euros) but wait for 50% off. I'd be delighted  to see another game of this kidney, maybe a sequel or Orchid prequel.","September 19, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a short but fine lets say Action Adventure with a nice graphic style and nice music. You are Lili and arrive and at to Island Geos on the search for flowers, because Lili is a Student and needs them for her exam. Fastly she found out that somethings wrong on the island and she, the only human on the\nIsland, must do the things right.\n\nThe Graphics reminds me to an old game called Zanzarah (Nice game, you should google it.) and presents a wonderfull detailed world. You can control Lili via Mouse and Tastatur and have a free choice of your ways. You follow a main story but have sidequests. Your target is to solve the Islands Problems. You can earn money via collecting Flowers, finding treasure or defeating spirits. For those you have to come near them, jump on their back and in a minigame you must get the flowers from their heads. Sounds simple, should be, but can be harder as you thought.\nYou can also raise your skills, that helps you to get and defeat the spirits. Also you can spend the money in usefull items.\n\nMost of the achievements are very easy, some depends on grinding but i think the hardest one ist to defeat all the spirits in the Gold way (You can get Bronze, Silver or Gold, depends on how good you get the flowers from them).\n\nI like this game and i have much fun with it. Yes it is short. I`m through after about 5 hours, but i wan`t all the achievements, so i will play on.\nThanks to Bitmonster for this little pearl.

You play as a young woman named Lili who embarks on a quest to deflower an island of spirits for her botany thesis and save wooden people from certain doom. I enjoyed that there's some darker themes to this game too- cannibalism, drugs, and murder to name a few.\n\nThe fighting is extremely fun, you hop on top of an unsuspecting spirit and yank away at the rare flowers growing from them while avoiding being shaken off or hurt by traps.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetinnman/recommended/266490/","thetinnman","TheTinnMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetinnman/","347 products in account","Lili: Child of Geos is a game centered around picking flowers. I wish I was exaggerating. 90% percent of all quests, combat, gold-farming, and other typical adventure-game mechanics are all done by... you guessed it, picking flowers. It sounds ridiculous, I'll admit. But somehow, this game did it right.\n\nThe game is very short, only taking 2-3 hours to complete. If you want to complete all the achievements, I imagine that time would roughly double. The world itself is fairly small, consisting of four adjacent cities with only a handful of NPC's in each, but there are just enough side quests to make the world feel used without bombarding you with "New Objectives".\n\nThis game presents itself amazingly. The graphics ride that thin line of being cartoony, colorful, and plain while still holding the right amount of detail. One major selling point, for me anyway, is the music. The city background themes range from a Legend of Zelda town theme (SerfSide) to a Disney fanfare (Mill Hill).\n\nSpeaking of Zelda, the easter eggs in this game are many. Through dialog or by finding collectibles, this game makes reference to Legend of Zelda (I mean just look at the title card), Super Mario, Day Z, Fruit Ninja, and Minecraft, and even goes so far as to break the fourth wall a little bit by poking fun at hipsters, "neckbeards", and even Instagram.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting a serious RPG. The gameplay is simple and almost repetitive (it's picking flowers, if you haven't caught on by now). Lili: Child of Geos just wants you to have fun, and in the couple hours it takes you to beat the game, you will.","January 28, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, there are two possibilities: either you want all the achievements, in which case you'll play between 5 to 10 hours and have to start a second save (there is ONE achievement that cannot be finished with one save. But it'll take like half and hour MAX to get it done with the second, so...), or you just want to play the game to the end, which is maybe less than 5 hours. (all this in casual mode)\n\nI liked playing this. I had two or three times when Lili got frozen/bugged, but they were resolved with a menu on/off in two seconds. The game is very repetitive, if you want all the achievements (get 1'000 flowers, 1'000 broken vases,...), but those will go much faster if you check the tips section on Steam's page.\n\nThe characters are interesting. It's nice not to have human characters for once, and the dialogs can be fun in a nonsensical way. For a female character, Lili isn't even written annoyingly (much) which has to be noted, since female characters make so very often me want to slam them into the wall. Guys definitively can't make female character interesting. It's like they can't imagine that they could possibly multi-faceted.\n\nAnyway, nice game. Not worth more than the 10 € it is sold at, but fun and beautiful, and easy enough if you only want to play the casual mode (haven't tried normal/hard though)\n\nAh, one thing: you can't change the keys in the option menu, and wasd in azerty keyboard is a pain. So remember to alt + shift your keyboard to an english keyboard before starting (or during the game, since I always forget myself, before launching said game ^_^;; )","July 14, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is addictive but can get a bit samey, but, thankfully doesn't overstay it's welcome. While the $20 price tag is a bit high for a 5 hour long game, it's well worth a shot when on sale if you are into casual, colourful experiences.\n\nNow for the meat:\n\nLilli is one charming title. There is so much colour in this game to help make the island of Geos feel alive, making each of the characters you meet another interesting addition to the game. Just starting off this review, if I have to say what this game's strong suit is, it is definitely the art direction it took with aesthetics, I couldn't ask for it any other way.\nThe gameplay, while somewhat reminiscent of "Zelda" games, lacks any sort of true combat mechanic. Even the game remarks at one point, acknowledging the fact that you will not "kill" anything on this island, even the bad guys. The idea predmoninantly is based around the idea of exploring the town (divided into 4 seperate sections) on the island of Geos. While in each section of the town there are various tasks to be completed: from independant exploration to find treasures, flowers, and pots to smash; to completing quests the various towns people have - most of these ranging in a form of a fetch quest, disappointingly.\nThe game also features RPG-esque stat building. These stat points are there to help aid you in the core mechanic of the game, which is finding, capturing, and defeating "spirits". This involves using the mouse to click on flowers and plants to pluck from the head of the spirit while trying to maintain your grip on said spirit by not plucking thorny plants or getting hit by...-bomb flowers-....\nThis mechanic works well enough to do the job, but is certainly not the highlight in quality for this game. The mechanic itself tends to get a bit monotonous after a lengthy playthrough with this game, as well as the 3-star rating system that seems to be unclear as to how to obtain a rank. Often times I found a well executed "plucking" of a Spirit would only reward 2 stars, while other times I was fumbling over thorny plants and mis-clicking, I still got 3 stars.\nWhen it comes to the controls of this game, this is probably the worst part, sadly. There are NO REBINDABLE KEYS. while the game doesn't use a lot of keys to begin with, I had many frustration that the "Interact" and the "mount Spirit" function were mapped to the same key, leading often to me talking to an NPC, rather than mounting the spirit I was chasing. Additionally there is some of the ABSOLUTE WORST mouse acceleration in this game. Even set to the "highest" mouse sensitivity, the game seems to have "camera smoothing" which results in the games camera and character feeling very, very floaty. I figured perhaps a controller would feel more comfortable for this type of thing, but surprisingly it was even more uncomfortable for me to play with a controller than a mouse. This is something that I hope the Developer will fix in later patches. Unfortunately, if you gathered with the 3-star rating system, addictive game play, colourful graphics, and wonky controls: Yes, this game seems to be intended for mobile platforms, and I think is quite a blemish on this game to have to comprimise competent, and proper PC graphics and control settings to aid with the underpowered mobile devices.\nBefore concluding I would like to mention a HUD bug this game seems to have, which is most apparent on 4:3 panels. This game does not feature proper word wrapping or font-size adjustments. Often text will bleed off of the on-screen button or prompt - this looks unattractive and very amatuerish.\nAdditionally I want to make 1 side note: While I am not a professor of law, I think this game borders dangerously close to infringing some copyright, with blatant use of Nintendo IP titles and names, additionally a music track in Mill Hill is dangerously close to a track in the Sims 3.\n\nLilli, with it's blemishes aside, is still a fun and addicting game to play. While the price tag is hard to justify for it's 5 hour campaign, if you find it on sale, I can't recommend it enough that you play this game. Give it a go if you want a happy, and very casual experience!","November 2, 2014","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't really like casual game- something that isn't stimulating really puts me off. But I can't believe how drawn I am to Lili.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple- you are on an island collecting flowers for your (school?) project. You have to collect red soul flowers from the islands evil spirits. I admit it does get a bit repetitive after a while. But thats where the beauty of the game comes in. The environments feel so greatly detailed. You can go into some of the houses of the towns folk and you get a pretty detailed look at how they run their lives, pictures on the walls, toilet paper on a tree-stick holder! With every new area I seek out- the more amazed I am of the beauty.\n\nThis is a short happy game- be prepared to do things over and over with a little bit of rotation. But take your time, explore. Experience the beauty.\n\nIf I'm ever to get the Occulus- I really want this game to be playable with it. I want to be in this dream world!\n\nPros:\nABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL GAME\nNice soundtrack\ninteresting 'people'\nSneaky game refrences\n\nCons:\nNot a really deep story\nEnemies are repetative\nVery little voice acting makes it feel like a wall of text sometimes\n\nI decided to pick up this gem when it was on sale\n","January 5, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention, the characters can be very quirky and even hint at references to other games such as Legend of Zelda.  Overall, if you're looking for a cute and casual indie game, this is definitely worth a shot!","June 17, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is not a lot of complexity to it so those that are looking for a challenge won't find one here. The story tries to hit some areas that I didn't expect with becoming independent and discovering what it is that Lili wants to do in life but it never becomes something that connects.\n\nThe parts of Lili that really stick out are things such as the attention to detail as almost every room you walk into is something different. The world is also incredibly charming to run through as you hunt down spirits to pick flowers off of.\n\nOverall: If you want an easy game withe simple mechanics this is a game for you, if not then maybe go somewhere else.","June 18, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, there are two possibilities: either you want all the achievements, in which case you'll play between 5 to 10 hours and have to start a second save (there is ONE achievement that cannot be finished with one save. But it'll take like half and hour MAX to get it done with the second, so...), or you just want to play the game to the end, which is maybe less than 5 hours. (all this in casual mode)\n\nI liked playing this. I had two or three times when Lili got frozen/bugged, but they were resolved with a menu on/off in two seconds. The game is very repetitive, if you want all the achievements (get 1'000 flowers, 1'000 broken vases,...), but those will go much faster if you check the tips section on Steam's page.\n\nThe characters are interesting. It's nice not to have human characters for once, and the dialogs can be fun in a nonsensical way. For a female character, Lili isn't even written annoyingly (much) which has to be noted, since female characters make so very often me want to slam them into the wall. Guys definitively can't make female character interesting. It's like they can't imagine that they could possibly multi-faceted.\n\nAnyway, nice game. Not worth more than the 10 € it is sold at, but fun and beautiful, and easy enough if you only want to play the casual mode (haven't tried normal/hard though)\n\nAh, one thing: you can't change the keys in the option menu, and wasd in azerty keyboard is a pain. So remember to alt + shift your keyboard to an english keyboard before starting (or during the game, since I always forget myself, before launching said game ^_^;; )","July 14, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a short but fine lets say Action Adventure with a nice graphic style and nice music. You are Lili and arrive and at to Island Geos on the search for flowers, because Lili is a Student and needs them for her exam. Fastly she found out that somethings wrong on the island and she, the only human on the\nIsland, must do the things right.\n\nThe Graphics reminds me to an old game called Zanzarah (Nice game, you should google it.) and presents a wonderfull detailed world. You can control Lili via Mouse and Tastatur and have a free choice of your ways. You follow a main story but have sidequests. Your target is to solve the Islands Problems. You can earn money via collecting Flowers, finding treasure or defeating spirits. For those you have to come near them, jump on their back and in a minigame you must get the flowers from their heads. Sounds simple, should be, but can be harder as you thought.\nYou can also raise your skills, that helps you to get and defeat the spirits. Also you can spend the money in usefull items.\n\nMost of the achievements are very easy, some depends on grinding but i think the hardest one ist to defeat all the spirits in the Gold way (You can get Bronze, Silver or Gold, depends on how good you get the flowers from them).\n\nI like this game and i have much fun with it. Yes it is short. I`m through after about 5 hours, but i wan`t all the achievements, so i will play on.\nThanks to Bitmonster for this little pearl. Would  be nice if you make a second part.\n\nMany Greetings\nWyvern","July 20, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s a fairly simple game: run around the island as Lili until you encounter a Spirit and deflower them. I recommend playing with a controller for easier flower picking.  It bothers me how you can't fully complete Lili's skill tree but it isn't necessary for finishing the game. Overall I would give this game a 7/10 based on the world, story, and game play. Though this game is entertaining for a few hours with its repetitive game style; it is Not Mind-blowing. I would suggest waiting for this game to go on sale for some cheap entertainment (Don't pay more than $10 unless you really want it).

There are a few places where you might get stuck in the middle of path or can't reach certain things but it doesn't really affect the game too much. I think the story is original enough and the characters are quite quirky In my opinion and quite likable ^^ Among them are some (Seemingly flirtatious) fish and wooden constructs. You get to do side quests helping out the residents etc as well which makes it a lot easier when you're getting to grips with things. I wouldn't say I loved this game but it was charming in it's own way, one thing I really liked about it is that you're free to explore the Island as much as you like during or after you've finished. I would say it is more suited to younger gamers as it's quite simple and tame, also you might find that the achievements during the game are glitchy. A lot of people have had random achievements being unlocked at different times but if this doesn't bother you I'd recommend it :)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=466277682","June 21, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I saw screens of it I first thought this is probably some kind of highly polished hidden object game. What “sold” me was when I discovered you can actually walk this marvellous world.\n\nItem hint: Get the Skeleton Key early on as well as the Treasure Map (helps you keep track of chest and find flowers). Boots, bracelets and necklaces seem to have negligible effects when hunting Spirits.\n\n+ Beautiful somehow cuddly graphics\n+ Mostly relaxing atmosphere\n+ Okay story, hints to a possible prequel\n+ References\n+ Moderate length\n+ Game advises to visit the options menu and asks to automatically determine graphics settings\n+ Basically no grinding\n+ Good controls\n0 Unfortunately no voice acting\n0 Different camera modes\n- Some advertising for another BitMonster game\n- Level cap, making it impossible to max out all skills with the same avatar\n- Flowers sometimes in places that are simply unreachable\n\nI started playing this game in the hope it would provide a counterpoint to Dead Island which had become exhausting and bullseye. After playing like 15 minutes I felt pretty relaxed. The game still has tense moments but all in all it's a pretty tranquil experience.\nAlthough the game's world is not too big it has an expansive feel to it, maybe because it looks lived-in or alive.\nThe back story is rather light, maybe owed to the mobile origins of the game. You control Lili who has come to Geos as a Vegi-Magical student from the Gildern Magis College (with a deadline) but is quickly entangled in in the conflicts of a two-class society. Most NPCs have some depth to them which you learn by interacting with them, i.e. fighting the bad ones (Spirits) and talking to the good ones (Constructs). There is usually a reward for exhausting interaction.\nThere are some indicators to a story that happened before so there may be a prequel.\n\nA Construct mentions a geophantasmogramist visiting the island before Lili\nThere is a pair of glasses in the lighthouse that look like Lili's\nA letter from Lili's father mentions Lili's lost sister\nLili finds a tombstone for a girl named Orchid, who may have been, fitting in with flower-named girls, Lili's sister\nThe game's title is “Child of Geos” so Lili is supposedly linked to the island\nThe fishes find Lili's eyes (without glasses; the player never sees them) very interesting, alternating between wanting others to see them or Lili to hide them\nLeft over comb\nThe Constructs are wood-based being making a disturbingly wood-based living in wooden houses with wooden furniture and wooden toilets, even toilet paper and even bringing it to a Soylent Green conclusion.\nThere are a number of pop-references in the game and there is a mock pop-quiz where Lili can show off here extensive knowledge of games.\nThere is also occasional, not too much, advertisement for another game by BitMonster.\n\nThe game is of moderate length and may take you two evenings to complete. You can explore the world some more after you beat it. There are a number of achievements that may make you play some more and the “max out skill” achievements actually require you to stature at least one additional game – it took me not quite an hour to max out a single stat. Besides that there is almost no grinding.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no voice-acting. Instead there are a few generic sounds or words, e.g. “Hello”, and Lili's feelings are well-done by stances and facial expressions.\n\nWith so many games not actually having any actual options, I found it interesting that the game starts out with advising you to go to the options menu and offers to automatically determine your machine's graphic settings.\n\nThe controls work fine with the world's topology and are pretty tight with few exceptions. When chasing a Spirit it happened at times that instead of jumping onto them I suddenly found myself in conversation with a Construct or picking a flower because the game decided that was more likely what I wanted. Then you're supposed to collect flowers set around the world but a few of them are simply set in places Lili can never reach, e.g under bridges.\nThere is a number of different camera modes that aren't listed in the games help - I didn't find any use for them. Activated them with keys Insert, Delete, Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, then move around a bit to see their effect.\n\nLili: Child of Geos was a lot of fun and I recommend it. I bought the game as part of a bundle and probably wouldn't buy it for the full price (currently 10 Euros) but wait for 50% off. I'd be delighted  to see another game of this kidney, maybe a sequel or Orchid prequel.","September 19, 2015","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish I was exaggerating. 90% percent of all quests, combat, gold-farming, and other typical adventure-game mechanics are all done by... you guessed it, picking flowers. It sounds ridiculous, I'll admit. But somehow, this game did it right.\n\nThe game is very short, only taking 2-3 hours to complete. If you want to complete all the achievements, I imagine that time would roughly double. The world itself is fairly small, consisting of four adjacent cities with only a handful of NPC's in each, but there are just enough side quests to make the world feel used without bombarding you with "New Objectives".\n\nThis game presents itself amazingly. The graphics ride that thin line of being cartoony, colorful, and plain while still holding the right amount of detail. One major selling point, for me anyway, is the music. The city background themes range from a Legend of Zelda town theme (SerfSide) to a Disney fanfare (Mill Hill).\n\nSpeaking of Zelda, the easter eggs in this game are many. Through dialog or by finding collectibles, this game makes reference to Legend of Zelda (I mean just look at the title card), Super Mario, Day Z, Fruit Ninja, and Minecraft, and even goes so far as to break the fourth wall a little bit by poking fun at hipsters, "neckbeards", and even Instagram.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting a serious RPG. The gameplay is simple and almost repetitive (it's picking flowers, if you haven't caught on by now). Lili: Child of Geos just wants you to have fun, and in the couple hours it takes you to beat the game, you will.","January 28, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Picking Flowers With the Sun Flares in my Eyes.Genre: 3rd Person Light RPG\nDeveloped & Published by: Bitmonster Inc.\nPlatform: Windows, Mobile\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by MyselfOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nLili: Child of Geos is a 3rd person casual adventure game about picking flowers and exploring a strange, colorful and cartoony island. Said island is under the tyrannical ruler of the Mayor of the wood spirits. So, what's a girl to do? Pick flowers off of their heads until she viva la revolutions the entire island. Duh. I mean, using a sword/gun is so 2012 anyway. Well, the non-voice acted characters in this game are happy enough to greet you upon your arrival. Some have side quests and others just want to chat. The side quests are amusing (and sometimes eye-raising) but are pretty much busy work fetch quests. The exploration is reasonable but a bog standard affair of finding keys and opening locked doors/chests to locate the multitude of artifacts in the game. What’s rather interesting about the key system is that you can buy a skeleton key pretty early on and it makes a key vendor completely pointless before you even get the chance to encounter him. That wasn’t well thought out. Otherwise, this is a fairly standard and mechanically light adventure game. So, let’s talk about the flower picking.\n\nFlower Picking Mechanics\nThe main mechanic to fight the wood spirits is picking a certain amount of white flowers plus the final red flower from their heads within the time limit that Lili can hold onto the spirits. You have to sneak up to them or catch them in a run in order to start the flower-picking mini-game and this isn't very difficult to accomplish. Picking flowers is done by click and holding a flower and then dragging them away from a spirit’s weaving head as they run around. Lili must do this while avoiding accidental clicks on thorns or allowing bombs to explode. There are also green flowers that extend's her grip time and gold-coin flowers that give Lili, well, more gold. There are also “bonus rounds” where the head may be covered with bombs, gold coin flowers or thorns. Upon completing the level, the game will rate your score, giving you one to three stars for how well you did. You can then replay each spirit to get a better score, if you wish. This is repeated for every wood spirit “fight” and the only thing that really changes is the difficulty and amount of grip time Lili has.\n\nThis mechanic isn’t the most interesting I’ve stumbled across. It definitely feels like it was designed for touch screens first and it doesn’t make the best transition to the mouse. Its passable when using the mouse but I think you’d find it more entertaining on a tablet. The flower picking is certain different from what I normally see. However, I will say that It’s good that the campaign is as short as it is. Since it really starts to run out of steam towards the end. I can’t imagine a longer campaign sustaining itself on the back of this idea.\n\nWhile Lili claims it’s a RPG hybrid, it’s an extremely bare-boned one. The only things you can customize when you level up are your running speed, time under stealth and grip aka how long you can hold onto forest spirits. Which are certainly helpful to progress through the game, there’s not a lot of in-depth choice to any of these stats. The other things you can customize are Lili’s clothing, floating companion and hat she wears while running around the island. There’s a decent amount of selection but they only affect how Lili looks.\n\nStory Thoughts\nThe story is pretty straightforward. You’re Lili, a student at some school who’s on assignment to this island to find flowers for some research project. Upon arriving to the island, she sees how the wood constructs are being oppressed by the wood spirits and their mayor. Though he’s not very good at stopping you from achieving your goals. The wooden constructs request that she helps them out. So, she does. What follows is an amusing, light-hearted exploration of the island. Littered with references, jokes and quirky characters. The script is pretty well done, especially when it comes to some of the descriptions of artifacts she’ll find along the way. Though some of the character growth dialogue that Lili has feels forced or out of place. The whole subplot of Lili being unsure whether she wants to continue her degree at the college or if she wants to do something else. It just kind of comes out of left-field.\n\nPC Settings, Audio/Video and Controls\nOriginally developed for mobile devices, Lili was ported to PC later on to mixed results. Lili’s settings menu is horrendous and lacking a lot of features that should be here. There’s a casual-normal-hardcore difficulty slider. Graphics can be changed but only with a quality slider low-medium-high that gives you very limited control on how the game looks. For resolutions, I could only select 1280x800 and 1680x1050 (my native resolution), with full or borderless window. Windowed mode doesn’t seem to exist. It's very inadequate for a third person title even if it does run rather well. Music can be turned on and off but there’s no slider to adjust the volume of the music or sounds.\n\nIt does get worse with the keybindings. You can’t change them. The game simply displays a keyboard showing you what they are and that’s it. This is where Lili shows her mobile roots the worst. You can get by with what it has and the game is short enough to prevent it from being annoying. However, I'd prefer to see the devs make the settings menu more comprehensive and customizable in the future.\n\nProbably the biggest problem I had with Lili was the control scheme. Lili has two different input schemes: “FPS” and “MMO”. It seems that the MMO style was designed for touch screens while the FPS style was intended for regular PC gamers. The difference between the two is mainly how the camera can be changed in regards to your moment. MMO has you click and dragging to move the camera while FPS’ camera stays with your mouse. Regardless of which style I picked, I was never entirely satisfied with how Lili controlled. She felt largely unwieldy to move around the island. Especially as you started getting movement speed items. It took playing around with my mouse’s DPI setting, the in-game mouse sensitivity and input scheme before I could get it to a place where I was reasonably ok with it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI liked my short time with Lili. However, I’m having a hard time deciding whether I should recommend this to anyone else. With the main mechanic being just about picking flowers, there’s really not much to this title. Even the flower picking is only really fun at first, then it loses its appeal towards the mid-to-late end of the game. There aren’t any puzzles or platforming or any other ideas to sink your teeth into. So, it’s a bit lacking. I’m also aware that this is a more casual adventure game. As such, I’m willing to let a lot of this slide because I knew what I was getting into. Additionally, there are control and PC settings menus that are just...extremely lacking. That all said, if you’re just looking for a casual adventure experience to break things up, Lili is a title to give a look. Otherwise, I’d recommend looking somewhere else for something that has a little more depth and content. Do not expect something on the level of Legend of Zelda or a more involved RPG because it will disappoint.\n\nRead the Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","August 1, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an RPG style game with beautiful graphics. The main character Lili is sent to an island to collect flowers. There are two types of habitants on the island - spirits who carry flowers and constructs who serves spirits. Lili then joins the movement to topple the powerful spirit-led government and free the constructs.\n\nThe battle mechanics is simple, click and drag flowers off the spirit's back. It is a nice and child-friendly way to present an RPG, while it isn't too boring for older people. For me, the RPG adventure and graphics is the selling point of this game.\n\nUnless you are obsessed with getting 100% achievement, replayability is low.

I finished the game in a little under a week, but it was just different, and interesting, and simple. It's a relaxing game and fun to explore the different places and unique people/robots/things. I'd like to play another game similar to this :)","February 26","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, it doesn't, but the game is riddled with nintendo easter eggs.\n\nLili is a short, story heavy game with beautiful graphics and simple gameplay. Controlling Lili, a teen researching this colourful island for educational purposes, you find the island is full of slave like, wooden built, sentient robot humanoids run by evil spirits (who are in the form of creepy, mask wearing creatures). The plot is simple; stop the spirits and let the robot things be free and happy.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, this game can get boring quickly, since there are a small amount of mechanics used to vary the gameplay up. Defeating spirits is fun at first, but after realising the amount of spirits there are to defeat in the game, I couldn't be bothered chasing them and accomplishing repeating quick time events over and over again. Sure, defeating them isn't wasted, as oyu are rewarded with their mask and character biography. Every character has a biography, which is nice, but not all characters are interesting. The main characters you meet in the story are charming, cute and even funny when reading their dialogue.\n\nOverall, this game is colourful, happy and relaxing. Don't let the advertising image fool you, as this is far from a LoZ game. Buy this if you want a short, cheery story with a few giggles here and there, or really like to collect stuff.","March 19","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/266490/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","There's something about the beautiful character designs, bright and colourful environment, simple yet challenging gameplay, and yes even the collectathon-ing that really makes this game special. The controls are a little clunky and the world feels a little 'UDK template'-ish, but there's a soul to this game that I rarely, rarely see.\n\nYou get a nice little selection of alternate costumes (mostly colour-swaps), a large selection of hats, and a few companion animals that float along-side you - all aesthetic goodies that serve no purpose, and that's how I'd want it. The dialogue in this game is solidly written, with some memorable characters; one in particular is a veritable stream of game references, which you will also find in hat collection. Will you be donning a plumber's hat, or perhaps a green hood with matching tunic and fairy? It's a little on the nose and slightly out of place, but all in good fun.\n\nThe game isn't 'huge'. You get four small areas of the island to explore, filled to the brim with unique characters and flower-picking 'combat'. You'll spend a few hours here, deep in the game's universe of wood-sprites and mask-wearing opressors. The only complaint I have about this game is its acheivements. Get ready for the long-haul, because the number of pots to break and flowers to pick requires 3-4 playthrough-lengths of grinding spawn points over and over.\n\nIn short, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the right balance of simple, fun gameplay, exploration, story, creative design and genuine heart you can't deny.","March 9","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its really beautiful and thats why i bought it and also because it was on sale. Its a casual exploration game with some great humour, I played through the whole game and loved it (I am 17) but also i believe my younger cousins would love it too. I wish it was longer but since there is a mobile version i will just continue there. I suggest it to any age group as its a fun casual game for anyone to play!\n\n","January 25","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
