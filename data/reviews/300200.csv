I got this game for free for reviewing purposes >\n\nFirst of all i'd like to say that I give this game 1/10, here is why.\n\nWhy is it bad\n- First of all, its not really a good idea in my own opinion, to make an early access\nhorror singleplayer game, because after later updates it will probably just ruin the story if you\nalready played that part and the "horror" itself.\n\n- The way the game starts is just so ... not done right ? no real words for whats done with it\nbut really, you start the game in a room and don't know what to exactly do, then go to a door and\nsuddenly you're in a hospital ... yay ..no wait no... thats bad..\n\n- I am getting 30-40 fps at the game even though i changed the graphic settings to the lowest,\nand I'm getting 60 fps at Dark souls 2 at maxed graphics, so yeah bad optimization, and not to\nmention the crashing issues and freezing whenever I try to change screen resolution, and\neverytime I do it goes back to 1980x1280 which is not my screen's resolution.\n\n- There is basically NOTHING to do in the game, in the hospital you just run from the "madman"\nand everything is so dark so you use a pi$$ lighter to see what you're doing which is not really\nhelpful, and later you run to an end which is basically still the first floor not done at all.\n\n- Not to mention the bugs thats clearly anything, it ruins the entire game's point that the\n"madman" thats following you keeps getting stuck at places and just looks at you weirdly or\nsometimes turns around and you can pretty much walk and do whatever you want, which is why I said\nthat the devs probably have no idea what they're doing.\n\n- I like how the screenshots on the storepage shows that you can actually see whats going on\nbecause nope its all dark to give this "Spooky" atmosphere but fails at it.\n\n- Also the game does not explain whats going on like I pointed out before, but really like at\nthis time where the "madman" tries to kill you a red thing appears so you're supposed to spam\npressing E to counter it ... how was I supposed to know this ? it happened several times before\nin the game and never explained, after 10 minutes in the game I think it said " Press I to show\njournal " OH I ? from all the letters on the keyboard you chose that ? *sigh*\n\n- Game-play tactics are lame, press E to open doors all opens normally but the one with the real event, the character opens and then suddenly decides to look back, so you just auto-figure that it will turn towards the door again and something will popup and guess what ? it did, and was not scary at all or anything ... they have no idea what they're doing.\n\nThe only good thing in the game is probably the sound effects.\n\nWhat I expect/hope to happen, devs giving up on the game because its a no no, people gets refund, because without a miracle this wont happen.\n\nTL;DR = Don't buy this no matter what... I can't believe this price tag ...","June 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","33","42","4","0"

I understand it is a early access game, but as it is, it in no ways can justify the 17.99$ price tag.\n\nIt is a nice cliche concept. You are locked in a hospital with a madman... And it shows potential. However, said madman is not spooky thanks for very casual voice work and animation. Also it has glitches all around, minor things like getting stuck in floor and getting stabbed because your brilliant protagonist can't evade a box of soap ( or whatever ) is not helping either.\n\nThis game shows almost the same pricetag as Outlast. It can't compete against outlast in any ways in it's current state. IF the game was priced 5$ or lower, i would have been more forgiving. It could evolve into something worthwhile. In due time i will revisit this game to see if i will change my rating and if it got better.","June 13, 2015","false","1.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","14","17","2","0"

Some of the resolutions just dont work. Selecting them will reset you to full screen and max resolution. Running  a gtx970, graphics were stuttering after first entering the hospital. After first entering the hospital, I ran into a bug where I somehow got stuck in a wall and had to alt-f4 the game, only to have it crash when restarting. When I did get the game to start properly, I noticed that doors are an inexact science, and it was very easy to get stuck in them, or accidently turn off a light switch trying to open a door.\n\nOn the good side, the audio is pretty solidly spooky, though the volume slider in the options seems broken or maybe it was resetting like the resolution bug.\n\nAgain, maybe its just because its very early into the early access thing, and it does look the like dev's are actively working on it, so I look forward to some bug fixes so I can give the game a real try. But right now, I would probably wait to buy.","June 27, 2015","false","2.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","2"

I'm aware it's early access, but it was a bit too short, Jeff's AI seemed a little wonky, as he kept walking through walls and ignoring me completely.

I had lots of fun being chased by Jeff. He is definately very very creepy when he chases you. The music also is a nice touch to him chasing you.\n\nSo my pros are:\nScary for sure, some paranormal mixed with a great creepypasta is success in my book.\nGreat detail when it came to the scenery and graphic detail. I'm glad they went out of their way to animate the outside. The sunset was beautiful.\nThis Jeff the killer game is by far the best that I have ever seen compared to the other ones on Youtube and so on. (both graphical and scary wise).\nIt was straight forward and there weren't a lot of puzzles, which was nice because it didn't need a lot to begin with.\n\nMy cons are:\nIt has some minor graphic issues like when you hide in the closet the door blocks the view or seeing jeff on the other side of the door.\nI would of liked to see him wander if he loses you along with chasing you into rooms. It is early access after all so I'm sure it will be implemented at some point.\nIt is a little short, would of liked to push jeff out of the elevator and climb through the top to try and get away. (Maybe a sequel or addition?)\n\nOverall I would greatly recommend this game to anyone looking for a little horror in their life, or even to a Jeff the Killer fan. Hope to see more from this developer. Definately was a good game. :)\n\nAlso I'd like to note that this game is in EARLY ACCESS. So it isn't finished yet.
