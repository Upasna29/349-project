In ZKWR you have to fight off wave after wave of undead in hostile environments. Killing zombies will earn you money which can then be spent on weapons and unlocking doors.

You buy new guns, unlock doors & even open fridges.\n\nPros :\n+ Amazing soundtrack to the game\n+ Graphics are very nice, animations are smooth.\n+ "Level up" system with perks and weapons to unlock and it takes ages to unlock all of them. (I only have about half of it unlocked, 11 hours into the game.)\n+ High fps over-all throughout the game.\n+ Multiplayer doesn't require you to port-forward, and you can pass-word protect your server.\n\nCons :\n- If you get surrounded by zombies, you're most likely going to die.\n- Not very many maps. (Not sure if they will add more maps in the future.)\n- You might lag in multi-player...a lot. (Rare occasion, but it still happens.)\n- Not very many people play this game during certain hours of the day. Hard to get anyone to join a server.\n\nOverall :\n9 / 10 stars.\nI would highly recommend this game to everyone who enjoys killing zombies. It is very fun, even when you are playing by yourself.\nI thought this game would be a waste of time. I was wrong.\n\nNeed new steam friends?

You are forced to survive wave after wave against a horde of zombies that will try to get you at whatever cost at all.  After a certain amount of waves a Mini-boss will spawn and your goal is to kill it, and once you do something magical happens. You can buy perks, upgrade weapons and upgrade skills using ZKW-coins that you earn by playing the game from within the ingame Store- you can also customise your player and use the ingame map editor to make your own maps and share them on StillRunnings own servers (You will need to make a StillRunning account to do so). And multiplayer works great, from what i have seen. I didn't experience any lag at all and people where able to join my lobby without any problems.\n\nThere are many maps to chose from, and in most maps you will be able to find a cellphone that will let you add bots to your game later on. Also, like in the Call of Duty Zombies mode, there are drops that give you special powers such as insta-kill or rapid fire.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing for the price. 5.99€ for a game that will bring you hours of fun! :)","March 13, 2015","true","5.9"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","24","29","2","0"

X amount of zombies will spawn and you kill them, get money, get a small chance for power ups. Spend money on random weapons in a fridge or to open doors. At lvl 20 you can use it to buy power ups aswell. Bosses will spawn, different enemies, more enemies etc etc. Lots of weapons to unluck with credits which you earn throughout the entire game.\n\nThese credits can be spend on: maps, weapons (which you can find in the fridge), crafted items and perks.\nCurrently there aren't many maps yet, but Mr Dev adds more and more over time.\nThere are alot of weapons ranging from a crossbow to a flamethrower and even a KILL EVERYTHING IN YOUR SCREEN WEAPON.\n\nEach weapon can be upgraded in your current game to last longer. Bots can be unlucked by picking up phones and you can level up your character outside of the game by earning xp in the game obviously.\n\nThe voice over is silly but you'll get used to it. Lots of funny one liners such as "This is my boomstick!" ... Where have we seen that line before ha!\n\n>>>>> I enjoyed the game alot, it wasn't "easy peasy" to get all the achievements but it was very rewarding each time you get that little bit closer to 100%. Very nice to play if you don't want to focus too much, just shoot and chop away untill you die and repeat!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/342300/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","Game Detail Name: Zombie Kill of The Week - REBORN\nDeveloper: Still Running\nGenre: Survival, Horde Mode, Resouce Management, Lite- RPG\nMultiplayer: Yes. Not tested. Lack friends with copies.\nBots: Yes. Lobotomized but can carry a gun.\n\nWhat is Zombie Kill of The Week?  Short Version\nA resource managing zombie survival game with lite-rpg element. Now you can safely skip the longer version if you want straight into the graphic section. I wouldn't think less of you.\n\nLong Version\nGame development for this game was rather 'convulated' so as to speak. I tried the version that was a standalone EXE all those years ago so imagine my surprise when i saw this game on steam. Both of horror and joy. A memory tainted by nostalgia and stained by terrible remembering ability. Anyways.....\n\nIt's basically a 2D pixel art zombie horde survival game set in a single location of your choosing 24/7. What 24/7 implies is that there is no cooldown at all between waves. You killed all the zombie? Well have fun because here is another wave, and another and another and another till you drop on your knees praying to a god which i do not know then die. Rinse and repeat! Also apparently you have all the cliche zombie weapons such as shotguns, katana and even the fabled chainsaw.\n\nOn with the review.\n\nGameplay\nYou start the round with a pistol and a katana that is supremely weak in all aspect other than the fact that the pistol can do headshots but that is pretty much it. Through slaying/shooting zombies you gain money to unlock door ala call of duty zombies style and to buy weapons. Also dropped by the zombies are powerups such as a medkit that heals you, bullet restoration and even a hit everything that will save your life a lot of time.\n\nGuns come in all shapes and sizes but the best weapons are locked behind the refrigerator system which i will explain later and also you have to unlock some of the weapon via premium currency which i will also explain later. Most of the guns are the typical fare such as shotgun, machinegun and smg. Interestingly enough once you unlock enough room you gain access to the upgrade mission which for a steep price will make your guns better.\n\nZombies also fit most of the trope we find in films and other setting but you see i am unable to confirm zombies above wave 28 since i died at that point. You have the runner, the shambler, the fat guy and a few different bosses. Now it goes without saying that since this is a 2D game you don't have as much wriggle room as oppose to 3D game therefor brushing up against zombies is enough to incur damage on your side. BTW health are not represented by health bar but instead the more closer you are to death the bloodier you get but don't worry since your mate/bots can very easily revive you provided you did not die at a location where they swarm like mad.\n\nEvery level has a refrigerator where you can pay money to get a random weapon. Buy too often and it will disappear into another part of the map. The refrigerator is also the only place where you can get the very powerful guns in the game minus the rather useless minigun.\n\nThere are 1 mobile phone scattered in each level which allows you to call a bot in to help you with the rampage, They are dumb are brick but thankfully they can carry a gun which proves useful enough for them. Otherwised they are just dumb bricks.\n\nYou gain exp as you play and gain levels that you can spend on skillpoints that aids in a lot of aspect of your character such as money collecting, gun reload speed and oh well you know the rest don't you? The only one not in the list is increased resilient against damage. There are also Z-Token that are dropped randomly as you play. Used to upgrade your weapons, buy accessories, and unlock new maps you will soon find these to be in short supply forcing you to run through a map multiple time to grind through them.\n\nAccessories are a unique thing. They have a set limit amount you can carry [at 10] and they have limited uses plus the fact that they are bought with Z-Token makes them a grind tool to help with the tougher wave and not to be squandered at the earlier waves. The inventory is mapped to the I button just in case you didn't know how to use them.\n\nZ-Token are also used to purchase useful perks that helps your character in the game although the cheap 25 token Rampage perk is more than enough for any needs.\n\nYou can also customize your character look and err... apparently there is a certain maid in the game. Spoilers. You use Z-Token to buy those looks. Naturally.\n\nGraphics\n2D pixel arts. At times the art look rather ugly but i suppose fighting off 20 undead at the same time makes you rather forgiving of this shortcoming. But hey, at least you will be able to tell the important thing such as guns, powerups and items at a glance. It's ugly in a functional way.\n\nSounds\nSounds blend in good enough without getting in the way. Guns are boomy and everything works as expected although the in game character i suggest you mute him since his voice is rather jarring to the overall game. Seriously.\n\nConclusion\nAll these years the game hasn't change much but i argue that the core component that makes it fun is still there intact and not lost in the years. Therefor go look for 3 mates and buy all 3 of them a copy and go play this 2D survival game like no tomorrow. Because tomorrow is a farce anyways since it is merely the rotation of the earth that cause the shifting of light and darkness.\n\nScoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: B-Rank\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/342300/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Zombies, zombies, zombies… everywhere you look nowadays, the ranks of the living dead are there. You cannot escape them! Crawling its way into our world on Steam is the latest edition for Zombie Kill Of The Week: Reborn. Readily apparent from the title alone, the entire game is a love letter to classic and iconic zombie genre tropes and media including The Walking Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Dead Snow.\nZombie Kill Of The Week: Reborn is a simple but fast-paced, 2D survival shooter game with platformer and RPG elements. It is irreverent, bloody, over the top – just like every B-rated zombie flick you have ever seen. Similar to Call of Duty’s Zombies Mode, there is no possible way to “win.”\nGameplay is divided into three classes: carnage, challenge, and multiplayer mode. In carnage mode, you rack up as many kills as possible before dying. Displays of your ultimate zombie slaying skills allow you to accrue points to level up your character. In challenge mode, you have been infected and will die in 4 minutes. You are armed with only a shotgun and you must kill as many zombies as possible before you die at their hands, or from the virus that is coursing through your body, and rank up the highest score in the process. If you create a ZKW profile, you will be able to post and see the online rankings. Creating a profile will also enable you to connect and play with up to four fellow zombie hunters. Finally, the game includes a level editor to craft your own twisted arena of death for you and others to enjoy.\nCarnage mode is the brains and guts of this game. You must survive and outlast each horde of zombies that progressively become tougher and more difficult to handle. Zombies will become more resistant to damage. They will able to jump after you. Some will still be able to walk, attack, and kill you even after you’ve blown off their heads. If you blow off the torso and legs of a ghoul, some will ravenously claw their way towards you, ready to gnaw off your ankles. Combined with their staggering numbers and their bothersome tendency to flank you, the situation will certainly become dire in a short amount of time. Successive rounds will also spawn special undead classes – reminiscent of the Left 4 Dead series. I have encountered super-fast, berserker zombies and two variants of the “Tank” class.\nWhat caught me off guard immediately was how insanely quickly the numbers and the intensity of the mobs escalated. This effect is further compounded with the presence of other players, or bots, on your team. On numerous occasions, I had literally cleared the first 10 rounds within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, thus prompting the rapid appearance of special class zombies. This gives the game a frenetic pacing that forces you to quickly move through the map in search for more resources and building a more powerful kit, as well as insidiously drawing you back again for sweet vengeance if you got instantly swarmed before even breaking the double digits in terms of rounds.\nPlayers can expect to enter boss battles intermittently. These usually involve slow, lumbering, Frankenstein-like zombie behemoths that are heavy hitters. However, hands down the most annoying, challenging, and bile-inducing boss battles involve what I can only describe as an undead cow/human hybrid creature dressed in a blue suit and holding a briefcase. Seriously, you can’t make this up. The creature is extremely resistant to damage. While it does not actually deal physical damage, it will proceed to rob and siphon gratuitous amounts of precious cash from you – locking you out from acquiring precious guns, ammo, or unlocking doors.\nThe game integrates platform elements for you to explore, navigate, and unlock special weapons, buffs, weapon upgrade kiosks, and special fridges that randomly assign you weapons not commonly found on the map. The labyrinthine levels has you run through the gambit of locked doors, corridors, ledges, and jump platforms. Navigating the terrain forces you to keep a cool head and good instincts. If you’re not careful, you could end up getting surrounded on all sides with no means of escape.\nZombie Kill Of The Week rewards your brutality against the living dead through the acquisition of ZKW points giving way to in-depth RPG customization options. These points act as the currency you need to upgrade your character stats, to buy new skins, costumes, new weapon drops, special perks. During the course of carnage mode, stronger zombies and bosses drop raw materials which can be utilized at the workbench to craft consumable in-game items.\nOverall, Zombie Kill Of The Week is a must-have game if you love zombies and want quick, fast-paced, over the top action. Its controls are simple and intuitive, so you will be running, jumping, shooting, and hacking zombies with ease. The designers crafted each level to make you want to continuously play over and over again, in spite of that voice in your head telling you it is 3AM and way past your bedtime. The game knows exactly what it is doing to promote high replay value.  It’s taunting you, tempting you, like some masochistic, adrenaline-junkie throwing yourself back into the fray just so you can beat your previous record in zombie kills. You will be tempted to play over and over just so you can live long enough to explore the entire maps to discover hidden power-ups, acquiring special access to high-powered weapons available on the map, acquiring experience points, or discovering Easter eggs.","September 5, 2015","true","38.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","3"

I'm usually not much into 2 dimensional games, but the zombie  shooting theme, with the creep metal music gets me going . I played like a doink for a while, untill I noticed how to use my zombie credits to get the perks . The graphics are chinsy old school arcade, like way back, but I don't mind that either, when I consider how some games just won't play well on my pre-NVIDIA graphics driver laptop . THIS COULD BE A FUN TWO PLAYER LOCAL GAME, IF PROGRAMED SO PLAYER TWO CAN ONLY GO TWO THIRDS OF A SCREEN DISTANCE AWAY FROM PLAYER ONE !!!!!!!!!! I'm enthusiastically awaiting a follow up, just don't call it number two; (I always hate that number) - call it Zombie Kill of the Month, and make the graphics about as good as Mortal Kombat Three, with a lot of sweet bloody explosions, and some more creep metal options, and gangsta funk, and more believable screams, and put in a local two player option like I suggested, and then you should have a big hit !!!","March 23, 2015","true","19.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","7"

If you like zombie games and find yourself with only a little bit of time to play, this is a great one to grab. I like that there is no limit to the rounds/waves and no level cap as well as the fact it has a daily challenge for you to do, which is a great encouragement to continue playing. The achievements are not hard to get at all so there is less of a "grind" feel to it if you like to get a perfect game. While it has a single player option (carnage), it also has challenge modes with lead boards and also a multiplayer so you can connect with either your friends or random individuals for a quick game.\n\nPros:\n-Quick and easy gameplay\n-Perks, costumes, and accessories (e.i. turrets, mines, mollys, etc.)\n-Easy achievements\n-Fitting music (i know, i'm weird)\n-Two levels of difficulty to play on\n-Optional bots in Carnage mode\n-Quick progression\n-Nice "art" style\n-Able to craft items\n-Daily awards/challenges\n\nCons:\n-Only Easy and Normal difficulties (after level 40, you kind of need something a little stronger)\n-Some rare glitches (though its not really a problem and sometimes works towards your advantage)\n\nOverall, I'd say this game is a 10/10 and is a hell of a lot more fun than you'd think.

What’s different from the other shooters is your goal isn’t to run through levels and finish the game, but to survive for as long as possible under increasingly frantic conditions (we say as long as possible because ultimately you will die!).\n\nSeems simple enough, but where Zombie Kill of the Week - Reborn really takes off is in the added layers of depth and huge variety of features and customisation available. Players earn money for slaughtering the zombies (money might not bring you happiness, but it does buy you guns!). We live in a consumer society after all, which is useful, as you can spend big on over 25 different weapons (including chainsaw, katana, mini-gun, RPG, D.O.M. and many others!). You also need cash to open doors, activate jumps, buy new weapons, or hunt for the magic fridge and see what loot drops are inside! In short… the longer you survive, the more weapons and prizes you get.\n\nSurviving longer also gains you ZKW-Points which you can cash in to totally customize your character, customize your weapons, buy new weapons, buy different perks, open new maps, and a lot lot more! Players also earn XP as they play, allowing them to level-up their character and develop them to fit their chosen gameplay skills. Survival is all about the margins, and every little extra helps!\n\nThe Steam release also features an exclusive level editor for the Zombie Kill of the Week - Reborn community, which allows the community to create their own custom and bespoke maps, then share them with friends (and enemies) for everyone to enjoy. Endless permutations and maps means endless challenges.\n\nWith a compelling single player survival mode, as well as cooperative multiplayer for up-to four players, this is one zombie firefight you are not going to want to miss! If that wasn't enough you can even play cross-platform play with Android owners too!  - Highly Recommended!","March 19, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At first I didn't know what the point was, just kill zombies? I can do that in tons of other games. I was not impressed at first, but found myself coming back daily to play.\n\nSurprise! The mindless firing of your many, many guns and gibs flying about is very satisfying. This game feels great to play and unwind. I play a game before I move onto games that require more thought.\n\nThere are runners, standard zombies, and tanks. Not to mention bloody lawyer bears in suits that steal your money. There is also Maid outfits, Cave Story references, and my favorite, dressing my character like Too-ticky from moomin.\n\nPure win","August 21, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every wave increases its strenght and resistant so the difficulty to kill them all increases too.\n\nYou can earn gold during the game that you can use to upgrade your weapons (there are may kind of them: guns, bombs, shotguns,uzis and a katana) unlock doors or open some fridges.\n\nZombies drop money too, bullets or some power-ups that are going to help you.\n\nThe game has a "level-up" sytem with some perks and some more weapons to unlock.\n\nBehind this simplicity is hidden an addictive way to play, there are some different game modes: single player survival mode, the challenge where you limit your basic weapons and can't buy or upgrade weapons, or the cooperative multiplayer for up-to four players. You can also play with bots if you find some cell phones in the game.\n\nYou don't expect to find the same graphics of L4D2 or the same kind of music and sounds but in general they are correct and nice, animations are smooth and there are a lot of pixels of the screen covered by blood.\n\nIn my opinion, four maps are too few, but you have an editor to make your own and share to the rest of the players.\n\nThe game has achivements and trading cards.\n\nNice game to play if you don't want to think a lot of and you like to kill tons and tons of zombies\n\nPS: Thanks to Shade00","February 26","true","5.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For me I picked it up in a sale I think it was £1.50 and thought why not? What a shame that a game so fun with such hidden depth can be off putting from price. The developer would have made much more money had the starting price been around £2! Anyways this is business and I'm not rating the game on it's marketing.\n\nI can't stress this enough, this game has hidden depth, you see a typical platform 2d shooter and think "played it before" and in a sense you have, but this has RPG elements, you collect coins to buy better stats for the guns you can collect in the game, though you can never max out a gun, you can hold 2 guns as well as a sword, so being intelligent about your choices dpending wheree you are in a level (each level plays differently) really matters. You can collect parts to put together to make automatic turrets, or mines, or fire bombs etc. You can update the starting gun to dual pistols or a desert eagle and much more.\n\nI really recommend this game highly, as a game developer myself(indie) I'd be very proud to say I had developed this game, it's games like this where you look past graphics and see sheer gameplay.\n\nExperience 7/10\nfun 9/10\n\nBuy now!","July 16, 2015","true","11.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You make a decent game for the mobile market and try your hand at Steam and people like me come along and say you’ve wasted your time. That’s why I feel like it bares repeating: This is a good game for mobiles. It’s not filled with microtransactions, it’s fast paced, it’s fun and it feels like a decent competitor against all the other games on the mobile market. But Steam is bigger, with more fleshed out games that offer a huge amount of content for, generally, fair prices. Hell, there are free to play games on Steam that blow my mind every day. Zombie Kill of the Week: Reborn gets trampled in that contest, especially against the games it draws inspiration from.\n\nFull review here[www.idiotbox.co.uk].","March 22, 2015","false","0.9"," 20 of 49 people (41%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","41","20","49","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrCowle/recommended/342300/","MrCowle","MrCowle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrCowle/","47 products in account","This game feels like a game one might find at an arcade - The controls make it feel the same way, like it's meant for joysticks and buttons. Aside from that, it's a very mediocre game. It's enjoyable for about 30 minutes, however i'm sure it would be more enjoyable if I could play with some friends.\n\nBasically, the way you play is that you kill zombies, and you start with a very underpowered pistol. You gain money by killiung zombies, which allows you to buy guns that are sitting around the map or open doors to allow yourself to have more space.\n\nYou also can gain xp and level up with this, which unlocks new maps, however they all feel the same.\n\nThis game kind of feels like a 2d, sidescrolling call of duty zombies game. However, it lacks much of the features and depth that call of duty zombies offers (this is coming from someone who despises all andany forms of COD, btw).\n\nAll in all, I would not recommend this game. It's simply too repetitive to give more than a few  minutes at a time.\n","September 27, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","3"

PC games need a higher resolution. The menu's make me dizzy as it looks like a mess because its scaled up from 480x320 to 1920x1080. This needs to be addressed and the menus really need to be re-designed for PC platform.\n- Some HUD elements are overlapping like red texts in the crafting page making everything very confusing.\n- Multiplayer doesn't seem to be that stable, I'm not sure how its done but people keep disconnecting and there is no real way to have a long enough play session.\n- Chat is in mobile design (press button to open string and then enter message) not a good idea. PC version could have a chat box which would fit if the menu's would be re-designed for bigger screens.\n- In overal feels like a mobile game played on a PC screen.\n\nFor these reasons I wouldn't recommend this on the desktop platform, but for mobile. If these changes are addressed then I'd be happy to recommend it.","March 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 25 of 63 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","25","63","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraneloran/recommended/342300/","kraneloran","pcguru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraneloran/","764 products in account","**********************************************\nThis Review has been completely rewritten after the following occurance:\nShortly after sending out my review the Dev responded with a little explaination of some of my mentioned negative points.\n\nAfter that the Dev proposed that we'd play together. And so we did. A few other random people joined as well, so the multiplayer is not as dead as I initially experienced. It just took a few minutes.\n\nBecause this Developer actually takes his time to interact with his players and clearly has a passion for his own game, I decided to review this anew. However, know that I'm not gonna make a biased review. If the Developer takes his time to interact, I will take my time to nit-pick the hell out of the game. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Although the Rating changed from "Not Recommended" to "Recommended".\n**********************************************\n\nFor the sake of sanity, I will make this Review more traditional in that I will make Bullet-Points of things positive, negative and meh. ("meh" can include things that are individually "negative" or "positive")\n\nThe Positive:\n\n1. This game features rather simple control mechanics as seen in virtually every single flash-game 2d shooter to date. So if you played those you pretty much know the control-scheme. Which is a plus for convenience.\n\n2. Pixely Graphics have 2 upsides to them: 1. It reminds us of glorious retro-games and 2. It is not so heavy on your graphics card. So, if you have an older computer (with sufficient RAM), you should've no Problems running the game.\n\n3. As a Multiplayer-game this title shines, It is loads of fun to run around, shoot Zombies (and occasionaly other creeps), help each other out, try and get somekind of advantage before returning to your group to kick some more Zombies A**. The Dev himself described this game as a "multi-player-game in its core" and I agree. As a Co-op title this is a definite recommendation, as long as you like "Zombie Shooters". And Co-op.\n\n4. There are excessive gamefeatures which, ignoring the fact that you need so called ZKW-points to unlock them (not to be confused with micro-transactions, you cannot buy ZKW-points), add customization and choice to the pretty simple genre of "Zombie Shooter". There are Maps, Perks, Weapons, Weaponupgrades and more to unlock.\n\n5. In addition there is a skill point system for more basic boosts, like more Money per kill or more damage through melee. All this translates to both, single- and multiplayer, with only rare exceptions.\n\n6. In-Game there are also mutliple options for the player to take. There are generally a good number of ways to spend money on the map, either buying weapons, upgrade an existing one, get a random powerup etc. Also, Power-ups like Shield and Health, that are picked up by one player count also for the other players, which reinforces group-support.\n\nThe Negative:\n\n1. I said it in the original Version of this Review, and I'll say it again, the Reset Button on Weapon Upgrades is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. All it does is give you a Textbox stating "Are you sure? You will not get your ZKW-Points back." There is no friggin' point in resetting then, in fact, it has no benefits and just makes your situation worse than it was before. Which brings me to my second point... (It shall be mentioned that the Dev already responded to that, it shall be fixed in the upcoming version. But please, don't remove it, instead make it give us our ZKW back)\n\n2. In such a game the Reset button on all and everything should be included. A Player just doesn't want to start all over, just to try and make a better Skill-Selection, Perk-Selection, Upgrade-Selection than before. What the player wants is his put-in Gamehours being worth something. This also wouldn't hurt the game and, in my humble opinion, would benefit the game and it's player. Let me Reset my spent Skill-points and spent ZKW-pts (excluding disposables of course, which can stay). Let me experiment.\n\n3. The Character Menu is a little confusing. By just looking at it one would assume, that there are only 4 options in customization and upgrades, when in fact there are more. By clicking on a selection below the first you'll notice the Menu to kinda "roll" and present more options at the bottom.\n\nThe "meh":\n\n1. ZKW-Points..... oh well, see, the ZKW-Points look like something bad, you might see it and think "oh... oh no. No, no, no, no. Micro-transactions!!!! Run!!!!", but you would be wrong. There are no Micro-Transactions (as of now). ZKW-Points could be most accurately translated to "multi-purpose Upgrade-Point". And they're aquired through gameplay and gameplay only. To quote the Developer himself: "As for ZKW-Points. You get these from: level ups, trophies, daily missions, challenges, and generally surviving"\n\n2. I don't like some things that fall under "purchasable" in this game. While with things like Perks and Weaponupgrades it makes sense, you also need ZKW-Points to purchase Customization Options for your Character as well as any Level beside the first one. So you suddenly have to decide, if you want to be more competitive against the Zombies, or you wanna look cool or try a new Level (which is a thing that should be given to the player as a reason to keep playing). Here, a character-level based unlock-structure would've made more sense. Note: In Multiplayer all the Levels are accessable.\n\n3. If you generally hate Online-Multiplayer and don't intend to play this game with friends either, be warned. While it is generally possible to aquire a good load of ZKW by playing Multiplayer, it would require quite alot more of single-player effort to get enough ZKW for decent progression, if you never touch multiplayer. However, if you aquired quite alot of ZKW-Points through Multiplayer, this also boosts your single-player competitiveness as well as your ability to aquire said Points on your own. In Short: Mixing multi- and singleplayer this is still a good and fun game, playing only and exclusively single-player turns it into a grind.\n\n4. This game has issues regarding the "Grand Chase-Syndrome" (aka. Elsword Syndrome). This descibes a Situation, where having a pretty High-Level player in the group can really help out alot with a given level, but on the other hand, the challenge for the other players is spiraling down. Though the other players don't feel useless in this game, like they do in Grand Chase / Elsword, they're still majorly helpfull to the highlevel player, but a more challenge-hungry party of players should try to be around the same character level (+/- 5-10 Lvls)\n\n5. I also imagine it to be quite fun to specialize with it's group, meaning, that one dude would concentrate on the skills and perks which gives him more money, to open doors, activate jump-fields and such, the other dude would specialize in Melee, while another goes for Ranged Weapons, each of which then would stay away from purchases other than the ones helpful to their role. This however would be made much easier a group-dynamic to provoke, if skills, perks and Weaponupgrades were resetable.\n\nThis concludes my Review of this game. I tried to be constructive and hope I've succeeded in that. Would I recommend the game? Hell Yeah! But not to people who really can't bare the thought of playing Multiplayer. All others should definitely check it out, if money allows. Time should not be an issue, one session will rarely take longer than half-an-hour and if it does, it's probably because you're having fun.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKrolan","December 8, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraneloran/recommended/342300/","kraneloran","pcguru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kraneloran/","764 products in account","**********************************************\nThis Review has been completely rewritten after the following occurance:\nShortly after sending out my review the Dev responded with a little explaination of some of my mentioned negative points.\n\nAfter that the Dev proposed that we'd play together. And so we did. A few other random people joined as well, so the multiplayer is not as dead as I initially experienced. It just took a few minutes.\n\nBecause this Developer actually takes his time to interact with his players and clearly has a passion for his own game, I decided to review this anew. However, know that I'm not gonna make a biased review. If the Developer takes his time to interact, I will take my time to nit-pick the hell out of the game. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Although the Rating changed from "Not Recommended" to "Recommended".\n**********************************************\n\nFor the sake of sanity, I will make this Review more traditional in that I will make Bullet-Points of things positive, negative and meh. ("meh" can include things that are individually "negative" or "positive")\n\nThe Positive:\n\n1. This game features rather simple control mechanics as seen in virtually every single flash-game 2d shooter to date. So if you played those you pretty much know the control-scheme. Which is a plus for convenience.\n\n2. Pixely Graphics have 2 upsides to them: 1. It reminds us of glorious retro-games and 2. It is not so heavy on your graphics card. So, if you have an older computer (with sufficient RAM), you should've no Problems running the game.\n\n3. As a Multiplayer-game this title shines, It is loads of fun to run around, shoot Zombies (and occasionaly other creeps), help each other out, try and get somekind of advantage before returning to your group to kick some more Zombies A**. The Dev himself described this game as a "multi-player-game in its core" and I agree. As a Co-op title this is a definite recommendation, as long as you like "Zombie Shooters". And Co-op.\n\n4. There are excessive gamefeatures which, ignoring the fact that you need so called ZKW-points to unlock them (not to be confused with micro-transactions, you cannot buy ZKW-points), add customization and choice to the pretty simple genre of "Zombie Shooter". There are Maps, Perks, Weapons, Weaponupgrades and more to unlock.\n\n5. In addition there is a skill point system for more basic boosts, like more Money per kill or more damage through melee. All this translates to both, single- and multiplayer, with only rare exceptions.\n\n6. In-Game there are also mutliple options for the player to take. There are generally a good number of ways to spend money on the map, either buying weapons, upgrade an existing one, get a random powerup etc. Also, Power-ups like Shield and Health, that are picked up by one player count also for the other players, which reinforces group-support.\n\nThe Negative:\n\n1. I said it in the original Version of this Review, and I'll say it again, the Reset Button on Weapon Upgrades is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. All it does is give you a Textbox stating "Are you sure? You will not get your ZKW-Points back." There is no friggin' point in resetting then, in fact, it has no benefits and just makes your situation worse than it was before. Which brings me to my second point... (It shall be mentioned that the Dev already responded to that, it shall be fixed in the upcoming version. But please, don't remove it, instead make it give us our ZKW back)\n\n2. In such a game the Reset button on all and everything should be included. A Player just doesn't want to start all over, just to try and make a better Skill-Selection, Perk-Selection, Upgrade-Selection than before. What the player wants is his put-in Gamehours being worth something. This also wouldn't hurt the game and, in my humble opinion, would benefit the game and it's player. Let me Reset my spent Skill-points and spent ZKW-pts (excluding disposables of course, which can stay). Let me experiment.\n\n3. The Character Menu is a little confusing. By just looking at it one would assume, that there are only 4 options in customization and upgrades, when in fact there are more. By clicking on a selection below the first you'll notice the Menu to kinda "roll" and present more options at the bottom.\n\nThe "meh":\n\n1. ZKW-Points..... oh well, see, the ZKW-Points look like something bad, you might see it and think "oh... oh no. No, no, no, no. Micro-transactions!!!! Run!!!!", but you would be wrong. There are no Micro-Transactions (as of now). ZKW-Points could be most accurately translated to "multi-purpose Upgrade-Point". And they're aquired through gameplay and gameplay only. To quote the Developer himself: "As for ZKW-Points. You get these from: level ups, trophies, daily missions, challenges, and generally surviving"\n\n2. I don't like some things that fall under "purchasable" in this game. While with things like Perks and Weaponupgrades it makes sense, you also need ZKW-Points to purchase Customization Options for your Character as well as any Level beside the first one. So you suddenly have to decide, if you want to be more competitive against the Zombies, or you wanna look cool or try a new Level (which is a thing that should be given to the player as a reason to keep playing). Here, a character-level based unlock-structure would've made more sense. Note: In Multiplayer all the Levels are accessable.\n\n3. If you generally hate Online-Multiplayer and don't intend to play this game with friends either, be warned. While it is generally possible to aquire a good load of ZKW by playing Multiplayer, it would require quite alot more of single-player effort to get enough ZKW for decent progression, if you never touch multiplayer. However, if you aquired quite alot of ZKW-Points through Multiplayer, this also boosts your single-player competitiveness as well as your ability to aquire said Points on your own. In Short: Mixing multi- and singleplayer this is still a good and fun game, playing only and exclusively single-player turns it into a grind.\n\n4. This game has issues regarding the "Grand Chase-Syndrome" (aka. Elsword Syndrome). This descibes a Situation, where having a pretty High-Level player in the group can really help out alot with a given level, but on the other hand, the challenge for the other players is spiraling down. Though the other players don't feel useless in this game, like they do in Grand Chase / Elsword, they're still majorly helpfull to the highlevel player, but a more challenge-hungry party of players should try to be around the same character level (+/- 5-10 Lvls)\n\n5. I also imagine it to be quite fun to specialize with it's group, meaning, that one dude would concentrate on the skills and perks which gives him more money, to open doors, activate jump-fields and such, the other dude would specialize in Melee, while another goes for Ranged Weapons, each of which then would stay away from purchases other than the ones helpful to their role. This however would be made much easier a group-dynamic to provoke, if skills, perks and Weaponupgrades were resetable.\n\nThis concludes my Review of this game. I tried to be constructive and hope I've succeeded in that. Would I recommend the game? Hell Yeah! But not to people who really can't bare the thought of playing Multiplayer. All others should definitely check it out, if money allows. Time should not be an issue, one session will rarely take longer than half-an-hour and if it does, it's probably because you're having fun.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKrolan","December 8, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"
