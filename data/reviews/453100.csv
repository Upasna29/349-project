So more of the same!\n\nHaven't been able to start a multiplayer match yet, but it sounds interesting. It needs better UI though, and it seems like you're only able to join random lobbys, not create your own or join friends. All this I hope is added in a patch, otherwise it seems like a big waste.","April 21","true","3.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","3"

When I read about FRoM, I was VERY interested and knew I wanted to try it out.  Admittingly, I had built up some hype for this game and was hoping it lived up to it.  Words cannot express how absolutely incredible this game is.  Think of Guitar Hero and games similar to those.  Your instrument of choice is a piano, which I have to give the developers props on for using.  Pianos are, in my opinion, a bit underrated and underappreciated.  It's nice to see them getting some love.  FRoM has become one of my top favorite games.  I can't stop playing it.\n\nOne interesting part about this game is that there's not just music fights, there's a story as well.  You see this story between each fight.\n\nOne of the very first things I fell in love with was the music choice.  The music when you start the game, and during the levels is just the best.  They outdid themselves.  I may even leave the game open during a course just for the music.\n\nI can admit that I'm kinda bad at the game, but I really enjoy it.  It's so relaxing and fun to listen to the music and time yourself on when to hit the buttons.\n\nOne aspect of this game that may have been unintentional is that FRoM can actually help you get better keyboard wise.  A lot of people have to look at their keyboard to type, but this game can help you learn the keys without looking.\n\nOne of the better parts about the game is that the developers are active.  I'm seeing a lot of recent updates and posts from the dev team that show they love their game and want to keep it updated.  This is a huge plus.\n\nOne issue I had was that you cannot alt-tab.  This is something I find extremely important to be able to do, especially in cases like mine where I sometimes have to multi-task.\n\n\n\nPositives:\n\nExcellent music\nFun, challenging levels.\nActive development team.\nCheap (only $6)\nOnline multiplayer\nAchievements\nTrading cards\nLeaderboard\nCross platform multiplayer\nNegatives:\nCan't alt-tab.\nA bit difficult for someone who is brand new to this style of game.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curations.","May 7","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The 'owners' -90% disconut was a fair price for an 'upgrade'. The thing is - it was a temporary discount, and now all players, both new and old, are expected to pay the full price for two extra songs and the MP.\n\nWhile the multiplayer idea may sound good, it does not really work well. It used to be completely and entirely broken at first, but even now, with all its fixes it's barely playable. Even if they eliminate all the bugs, the gameplay had never been designed with a MP in mind, and 'random lobby' waiting  time is only going to increase.\n\nThe new songs do not add much to the overall game quality. They are actually weaker compared to the original tracks (with music&sotry&visuals).\n\nTLDR\n- If you already own the old game and got the -90% upgrade - you're fine.\n- If you already own the old game, but had missed the discount - keep it this way and\or wait for another -90%\n- If you had not played the original game you may go for this one, but have in mind that the old F:RoM is cheaper, and you won't lose much after all.","May 4","false","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I happen to enjoy the original game on the Wii U, and I enjoy this version, although I do need to get used to the controls for the PC version. Also, I love the two additional songs as well. Can't wait for the free soundtract they said to be publishing. :3","May 1","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WidescreenRules/recommended/453100/","WidescreenRules","WidescreenRules","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WidescreenRules/","512 products in account","I highly receommend this game even with a few minor issues and one big recommendation.\n\nThe game is effectively a Rock Band 3 keyboard using Frederick Chopin as the protagonist, but with so much cheese that you could make an amazing pizza. The variation of Chopin's music in different styles, including Irish, rock, raggae, and others, is an absolute delight to listen to. The music alone is worth the price of admission as far as I'm concerned, and there are several of Chopin's best pieces to perform. The minor issues include really bad voice acting, especially that of Chopin,  and *really* long (but thankfully skippable) cutscenes. In fairness, the really bad voice acting is no doubt a part of the cheese factor.\n\nThose slight dings can easily be ignored; however, (and forgive the caps, but this has to be emphasized):\n\nI HAVE TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME **PRIMARILY** TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOUCHSCREEN LAPTOPS OR TABLETS!\n\nAs an amateur keyboardist, I found it very difficult to come up with a PC keyboard layout that was comfortable for me and therefore became very frustrated while playing on a PC keyboard. Admittedly, you might find something better for you. But the game felt far, far more natural when I played it on my touchscreen laptop. (The game has its roots in the tablet arena, so this isn't totally unexpected.) It was much more enjoyable to play, and I had a lot more fun with this game than I expected I would once I switched to a touchscreen laptop.\n\nSo, if you own a touchscreen laptop or Windows tablet, I absolutely recommend this game, especially for the price. Just don't expect the best voice acting out there and get ready to skip cutscenes. Otherwise, this game is worth the low price.\n\nI didn't touch the multiplayer part because - with very, VERY few exceptions - I don't like multiplayer games. From what others have said, it doesn't work all that well; but I don't plan on trying it to find out. If you're more interested in the mutiplayer aspect, look at other reviews.","June 3","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
