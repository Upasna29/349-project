I guess it is something like a breed of Mirror’s Edge and some fun/mediocre FPS with a quite big freedom/choice in classes and class creation. For the rest just check some youtube videos.\nWhat is annoying though is that Bethesda has SWITCHED OFF THE DEDICATED SERVERS, SO THE GAME NOW IS PLAYABLE JUST IN SINGLE PLAYER MOD!!!\n\nPlease thumbs up this comment, so more people can see and do not spend their hard earned money on a false multiplayer advertised game and hopefully this will make Bethesda to put the servers online again, then I can highly recommend the game. Also be warned that Bethesda can do the same “trick” on any future multiplayer title in order to make you buy the next title eg.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/achawcx/recommended/22350/","achawcx","Psychii™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/achawcx/","99 products in account","BRINK: Proving that great ideas don't always make great games.\nDespite this game being released 4 years ago, I picked it up and wanted to give it a shot. Lots of people were furious over this game and how disappointing it was. Lots of awesome trailers and mechanics to show off such as Brink's S.M.A.R.T. mechanic (Smooth Movement Around Rough Terrain) and dynamic objectives.\nEven as it is right now, I'm loving and hating this game.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:There are less than 20 players global. Unless you are lucky and get some friends to play with you, you wont get much fun out of this deserted game" (That is if the game doesn't give you connectivity issues).\n\nStory:Well...there isn't exactly a story. The "Singleplayer mode" is just multiplayer maps with bots. However, I liked the setup for Brink.\n\nHumanity has fled to a manmade island called "The Ark". This island was able to renew resources and allow a safe last place for people to live in. "Was". The Ark is running low on resources and has lost communication from the outside world. Two factions: The Resistance (made up of refugees) and the Ark Security (basically the cops), are at a war. The resistance wants to escape the Ark while Security is trying to save it.\n\nBesides a short one minute cutscene at the beginning of every mission with some interaction between characters, that's as much as you will get storywise.\n\nGameplay:I'm guessing the developers made the AI "dumb" so that in multiplayer, the AI would not be able to "play the game for you" (similar to the bots in Titanfall that don't alter the gameplay much).\nHowever, the singleplayer mode is going to torture you. The AI will constantly go for the secondary objectives such as taking command posts (you will hear them chatting about this A LOT) and build turrets near your spawn. Medics will still revive you, but that's even if they don't get swarmed by three enemies. It doesn't help that the enemy AI seems to be much smarter than your team AI. Also, the difficulty of the AI scales to your level so playing a hard mission at Level 1 is just as challenging as playing an easy mission at Level 10.\n\nGunplay...well, it plays like your typical modern shooter. You have 4 classes: Assault, Medic, Engineer, and Operative (Like the spy from Team Fortress 2). There are 3 body types: Light (moves the fastest), Medium, and Heavy (Terrible because you gain only an additional 40 health and you can barely move as fast).\n\nLevel design isn't helping Brink much either. Levels will either end with stalemates or they are extremely one sided. Take the mission "Early Launch" for example. On the security side, it might be a bit hard to repair the crane controls at first, but eventually, when you have to hack the missile controls, its ridiculous. Why? Because the Resistance spawn point is RIGHT IN FRONT of the objectives and the security spawn is all the way at the other end of the map. It also doesn't help when you have the AI as I described above.\n\nCustomization:Alright, I can at least give some props to the design team. I really liked the customization options for styling your character, even if you rarely look at characters in game. You could get tattoos, change color of your clothes...and that's probably it.\n\nWeapon customization is a bit nice. You can customize sights, barrel attachments such as grenade launchers and bayonets, and different sizes of magazines.\n\nGraphics:A smooth art style with "unique" character design. Backgrounds would look nice if they weren't so low res. Otherwise, the art style is similar to games like Team Fortress 2 and RAGE.\n\nSound:The only reason I wanted to give Brink a shot was because I found a Youtube playlist with game soundtracks and Brink's main theme was playing. While many FPS games have fast adrenaline pumping music, Brink's OST is calm and ambient. Weapon sounds aren't much, they are self explanatory.\n\nShould you get Brink?Unless you are like me and you want to experience what a game that was supposed to compete with TF2 should have been, then buy it. The Agents of Change DLC may give you an extra hour or two of funtime. Otherwise, I would not recommend buying Brink. Not even during a sale.","January 25","false","30.3"," 123 of 144 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","123","144","6","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impsmash/recommended/22350/","Impsmash","Impsmash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impsmash/","329 products in account","Alright, let's put aside the hate and generalized distaste for this game and actually break it down into something that may be worth your time. Now, to start out, I would like to say that I pre-ordered this game the day I heard about it and the day the developers released a video on  the vaulting mechanics. I played the crap out of this game for a while and I didn't care what other people thought (partly because I didn't know people hated it until long after I defeated the game and unlocked all of the guns, outfits, and most of the skills/attachments). Truly, this game is a lot of fun. Think of this game as a really watered down version of TF2 with classes such as the Engineer or Operator (hacker, etc.) that can be switched around with others on the fly. The gun play may not be the best but it really is fun when you start leveling your character and unlocking stuff. Attachments help a lot and skills do as well such as having third person when interacting with the objectives in-game. -(Note that I am writing this review years after I stopped playing)-.\nThe story is something that I felt like was just a filler for the story missions, in the beginning, but as you progress that slowly changes. Throughout the game you can find dialogues and journal entries that really add to the game's back-story and adds some real character that would have been otherwise unkown in-game. The end mission is really intense and a lot of fun whether or not you win or not. The game sets itself up for a sequel, but it looks like it may never happen in the near future. Truly, this game had a lot of heart and some pretty good art-design with some great back-story that would have made this game a real hit. Game mechanic choices and poor decisions really watered this game down to the point where no one likes it but the selective few like myself. In reality, I am writing this review out of nostalgia out of the lots of fun I had with this game. Pick it up if you would like sometime soon, fairly small and can be run pretty easily with any system. I would suggest getting it on sale because it may not be worth the full price.\nThank you for your time and have a wonderful day.","October 13, 2014","true","18.4"," 244 of 334 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","244","334","9","9"

I picked it up back on the PS3 originally, and despite it's flaws at launch such as mediocre AI and minor lag, (issues that were improved later into the games life) it was an absolute blast to play. The varying levels of customization were great, spanning all the way from weapons to the character itself. Not only that, but all the maps played well and looked absoulutely georgeous. The gameplay was a refreshing change to what you experienced in most FPS games at the time, with fun and flamboyant free running moves that not only looked great but were simple to execute. However, because Brink was developed by 'Splash Damage' and not 'Infinity Ward' websites such as IGN and Gamespot gave it a 6, slamming the game for it's poor AI and repetition. Sure I'd accept that if this was a game that based itself around singleplayer rather than multiplayer gameplay, but marking it down for repetition when video games such as Modern Warfare 2 get given 9's is ridiculous.\n\nAt the end of the day, this was a game that had it's head put on the block before it even got released. Sure, it's far from perfect, but it's as good as your going to get if your looking for a multiplayer FPS that's a little different from the norm.","May 2, 2014","true","5.9"," 111 of 138 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","111","138","0","2"

Back in 2011 Brink brought some fresh air in the multiplayer FPS community. It required a lot of teamplay and skills related to movement & aim. Brink is different because of its many different game modes, a highly customizable character (skins & guns) and the way each mission is going on (meaning in 1 mp game you can be required to set up a charge & escort a vip..)\nI'm more than ok graphically if you can withstand the futuristic theme. The solo is awful and more like a training for the multiplayer. It's also one of the first (the first?) to bring the "parkour"movement style you can find later in Battlefield 3.\n\nBUT\n\nI played Brink as much as i could and in my gamer's life, Brink is the only game i had to stop because no one was playing anymore.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/22350/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","So, not too long ago I made a review on Dirty Bomb, a game made by the same Devs that made Brink, and that got me thinking... Why I never made a Brink Review? Well, not anymore. As usual, I'll start with the BAD details of the game, then switch to the good ones:\n\nFirst and foremost, the game is stupidly short. Well, more like the devs were lazy. Both stories use the same maps, and there's like only 8 or 10 of them. While the story is well voice-acted, you don't even get to know ANYTHING about the characters or factions. It just feels like the game was supposed to be twice as big and they ran out of time.\n\nSecond, when it came out, lag was an insane pain in the balls. I haven't played in years, but lag can still be found at times.\n\nThird issue it has, is the redundancy of the classes. There's 4 classes, they all use the same guns, only difference is the special equipment. That's dumb, specially when the game was SO based in Team Fortress 2. Funny thing is, Dirty Bomb, the "spiritual succesor" of the game, felt into the same God-damn mistake, and it failed even harder by blocking most of the game behind pay-walls.\n\nLastly, another big issue the game had is how fast the Devs ditched it. I mean, yeah, it was a gigantic failure at release, but it had potential. Why not just stick to it and FIX IT, instead of just comming back a ton of years later to commit the same mistakes? Specially when they could have just made Free-DLC's that fix the game, and keep releasing new content by Standard DLC's.\n\nNow, the good stuff. Is the gameplay FUN? When you get over the dumb classes, IT IS! I mean yeah, nobody uses Heavy characters because movement is key, but fast characters are just fun to play with. You can move arround the map freely and it was the thing that got me attracted to the game. Quite ironic that the best thing the game had, didn't came back for Dirty Bomb.\n\nAnother thing that's quite fun, is the variety of weapons: and not only weapons, but accesories for them. Like to make as less noise as possible, or to just spray bullets? You can pick most weapons and make those changes work. Ironically enough, this wasn't in Dirty Bomb as well, something that blows.\n\nSomething that was also quite interesting was the customization. An insane amout of items to pick up for your avatar, making everyone look diferent on the battlefield, like in TF2 but with less flaming hats. And would you guess? Also not on Dirty Bomb.\n\nQuite frankly, I gave that game a "Not recommend", and I'm going to do the reverse here. I feel like Blink, while a mediocre game, is way better than it's EVEN MORE MEDIOCRE Pay-to-play-Cash-Grab succesor. Does that mean that you should just go right ahead and buy it? No. Wait for a sale, pick it up with friends. You will all have fun and a good time playing together. Playing it alone is kind of dumb, and you'll just do better by downloading and playing Team Fortress 2.","June 30, 2015","true","16.7"," 108 of 159 people (68%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","68","108","159","12","9"

I really enjoy Brink as a game, even though there's a LOT wrong with it, but for some reason I still go back to it. That being said, I understand why a lot of people really hate this game.\n\nI wasn't part of the hype train for Brink when it came out. Brink was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pushed to the moon with hype, which rasied people's expectations to fatal levels. Brink tried really hard to advertise itself as a competitor to Team Fortress 2, which is not only suicide, but also a really dumb idea. If they had just changed any mention of "Class" to "Combat Role".\n\nAlso, you can probably find multiple reviews saying how terrible the ♥♥♥♥ing missile hacking mission for the Secutiry is, how the Engineer is the most overpowered combat role, or even how flimsy the connecting narritive between the missions is.\n\nThere are pretty much no active servers. I'm the pleb loner who's okay with playing with bots, but if you're not that interested in that, then\n\nThe singleplayer is locked to 30FPS. It's only the singleplayer, too. If I locally host a server using the Dedicated Server Tool it runs great. As long as you know what you're doing you should be fine.\n\nThe biggest thing I'll praise about this game is the sound direction. It's fantastic. I can't name a lot of other games that have more satisfying gunshots or explosions. It sounds so good!\n\nThe game's theme that plays thoughout the game it also an earworm of a jingle, too. Good luck getting it out of your head.\n\nThe character customization and art direction is also great. I enjoy the odd valley between realistic and cel-shaded. It almost looks like it's a rotoscope. I could fill all ten character slots you're given and come up with awesome mix-and-match designs for people. Even though you won't see it yourself most of the time unless someone disguises as you, I still enjoy it.\n\nThe line "Mucho bad guys spotted!" - It's so good. It's so bad. I love it.\n\nI don't reccomend buying this game. I'm a weird extreme case where I have stockholm syndrome or something.","May 2","false","33.2"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","28","33","7","2"

They got a lot of things right.  They certainly had the e-sports scene covered with a well polished interface and flawless steam integration.  However, the gameplay itself was lacking.  Certain aspects of the game seemed more like a chore than enjoyment.  For example, all of the classes required you to be right next to your teamate in order to heal them or provide them additional ammo.  This is a problem when everyone is running all over the place in a combat situation.  Battlefield's approach of simply dropping a medkit container or ammo supply box was much more enjoyable.  The weapons were uninteresting and the pace of the game was far too slow to really capture anyones attention.","October 8, 2014","false","27.8"," 85 of 133 people (64%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","64","85","133","10","4"

The style and music was beautiful, which is another yet another bittersweet feature of the game.

Brink is a FPS game with team-oriented gameplay mechanics with medics, soldiers, engineers, and assassins. Medics can revive team members, give accelerated healing abilities to other team members, and has specified special skills and abilities. Soldiers can give ammo and can unlock grenades. Engineers are like the engineers in TF2 where they can set up sentry guns. Not only that, they can give upgraded ammo or armor to teammates and they can also drop mines. To add to that, the members all have different tasks to do such as planting C4 to blow up bridges or walls preventing escape, hacking into systems to complete tasks, and more. The "new" Call of Duty Ghosts fuction of running and then sliding was already utilized in this game where you can slide by pressing the hotkey. Sliding can also knock down enemies so you can kill them without them shooting back. Weapons are customizable and you can unlock some other weapons through mini-games. Depending on the size of the character you chose, you can parkour through maps, jumping off the walls and whatnot.\n\nThe only unfortunate aspect of this game is that the multiplayer is dead. I hope that my review will cause a few of you to buy this game or to take another look at this game in your library and revitalize this great game.","January 13, 2014","true","123.8"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","43","61","0","2"

I found myself... forcing myself to have fun playing it - and a game shouldn't make anyone do that. I played through both of the very underwhelming "campaigns" that are mostly the same levels just on the opposite teams with a friend. That's what made it and any other less-than-acceptable game fun. Playing with a friend. It has it's great moments and the music is STELLAR. I regularly listen to parts of the OST while doing other things, or playing other games. The atmosphere is wonderful, and the story is pretty engaging at first.\n\nThen, there's the gameplay and the AI. In the beginning, it's not so bad. Wow, I can do parkour as a light class, this is awesome! Oh, I'm dead already - OK, let's try a medium class. Okay... let's try a heavy class. It comes down to what's right for the moment, which is a good thing. But your impact on the level you're currently playing is totally underwhelming and there are a lot of really cheesy actions you can perform that don't encourage strategy and counter-play.\n\nOnline, netcode is downright appalling. This -could- have been fixed since I played last, but it doesn't appear to be. Players constantly rubber-banding and shifting around, suddenly finding yourself dead frequently without being able to determine where you could improve your own gameplay is an atrocity.\n\nSimply, it WASN'T fun. What was fun, was hanging out with a friend and playing the game. Even with games that are intentionally satirical and are at their core dismal are similar experiences to this so long as you're playing with a friend.","November 30, 2014","false","7.8"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","38","54","5","0"

Did I expect it to have a call of duty-style campaign? No because I'm not an idiot.  I know that isn't what was shown in trailers and that Splash Damage (the developers) were obviously making a 3rd Enemy Territory game.  It's also fantastic that this game has GOOD BOTS since I always play the games I want instead of whatever anyone else is playing.  Servers don't matter, good gameplay does, and this has it.  I knew what I was getting when I got BRINK and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.\n\nI remember dreaming of putting call of duty 4's shooting into TF2 as well as wishing that Mirror's Edge-style parkour could be added to many more first-person games.  BRINK made that dream come true and it has been everything I hoped it would be since I bought it on launch for the PS3 so long ago.  Unfortunate things happened to my PS3 and that version of BRINK.  So glad to have it back on steam now.\n\nWhen BRINK came out, the gameplay was focused on solving common problems in FPS games at the time.  It competely succeeded.  For example, grenades can't be spammed randomly to get easy kills, they do lighter damage and knock the target over.  The weapons as well were well-balanced from launch and no gun was obviously dominante like happened in so many shooters and still does.  As for game structure, they use Enemy Territory's fantastic assault-style game mode wherein you accomplish one objective after another.  One team attacks, one team defends in a dichotomy that I prefer over any other game mode.  A feeling of progress, unique perspective for each team, and varied objectives are why this is my favorite game mode.  If only more competitve shooters used this mode (I call it "Assault" mode because of my experience with the original Unreal Tournament)\n\nThe aesthetic is gorgeous.  Every tattoo you can get, face, everything.  I just love it.  It is a personal taste, yes, but works of art never get old.  It is all about what you love.  There's certainly nothing wrong with the smooth aesthetic that BRINK has.  The hyperealistic style was a great idea, and the customizations are there to make it perfect.  The gun designs, character designs, maps; they all come together beautifully.  BRINK is a lovely game to look at.  I focus on art style over graphical detail yet BRINK has both.\n\nThe only legitimate complaint that I see with BRINK is that it feels a bit slow.  Not slow as a slug though, so it's easy to manage.  The game is fantastic.\n\nEDIT : Forgot to mention that it WILL freeze if you have a weak cpu.  Sometimes when it loads tons of data at once (like on character customization aspects).  Strong computers need not fear.","October 25, 2014","true","9.2"," 87 of 143 people (61%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","61","87","143","12","10"

It is an interesting little shooter but nothing out of this world; it is just a Basic FPS. The servers are very light in population due to the game simply not being a popular choice. That is all there is to say really, the style of game is a nice change away from the "modern soldier" or "future soldier" style FPS that seems to plague the market these days. I would not really recommend this game to anyone unless they paid about $5, anymore and you're not getting your money's worth.","March 13, 2014","false","9.7"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

It corrected a poor habit of mine while it was still in its infancy.  That habit was blind publisher loyalty.  When I first came across Brink, I wanted to like it.  I really did.  I was immediately interested in its art style, and the Bethesda logo in the corner of the box assured me of its unquestionable quality.  How wrong I was, and how very much I overpaid that day, I cannot stress enough.\n\nAs a competitive first-person shooter, Brink has a lot of competition on today’s market, and yet it just feels like the developers haven’t picked one up in the last ten years.  Case in point: Brink sports no campaign to speak of.  The single-player mode, guided by a sheer-thin veneer of a narrative, is just a string of multiplayer maps in which players’ squadmates are A.I.s with about as much tactical sense as a rabid honey badger.   Multiplayer itself is stiflingly limited in terms of map variety, arena size, and weapon options, and many of the maps are rife with arbitrary choke-points that fatally cut down on the pace and entertainment value of gameplay.\n\nAvatar and weapon customization is a welcome feature, and the options available do allow for some unique and inventive character designs, but the decision to require unlocks and temporary in-game purchases for rather basic customization options, like body types, smacks as a bit counter-productive to players finding their niche early on. The total lack of female avatar options at all is equally disappointing.  There are female gamers out there, Splash Damage, and they don’t always want a mountain of armored flesh for an avatar.\n\nPerhaps most disappointing of all, the parkour elements that seem to have been such an integral part of the game’s concept are clunky at best, and a tacked-on gimmick the rest of the time.  Mirror’s Edge this ain’t, as it’s often difficult to tell which surfaces a player can vault over, which ledges one can grab onto, and why one shouldn’t just take cover and use some tactical sense rather than running into the open to charge enemies armed with assault rifles and shotguns.  There’s just no incentive the put it to use the vast majority of the time.\n\nWrapping up, Brink is visually pretty average.  Personally, I found its art style to be quite inspired and rather reminiscent of the modernistic, tagger-culture influenced, Marc Ecko’s getting up, but that’s just my personal taste, and will not factor into the game’s rating. The score and sound effects are par for the course, but ultimately forgettable, and its mechanics just fall short of their intended mark.  Most damning of all is the fact that there are now multiple free-to-play shooters on the market that outclass Brink in every way.  Blacklight:Retribution, Team Fortress 2, and APB Reloaded, just to name a few, are all superior titles that come with a zero dollar price tag, casting Brink’s sixty-dollar launch-mark in a pretty grim light.\n\nRating: 4.4\n\nVisuals: 5\nAudio: 5\nControls & Mechanics: 5\nAtmosphere & Experience: 4\nEntertainment Value: 3\n\nFor more reviews, articles, and videos, check out LastLevelPress.com!","November 25, 2013","false","3.0"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","42","72","0","6"

Got my attention as much as BRINK, BRINK had my highest expectations of 2011, more than skyrim, Arkham City, Portal 2 or any other game.\nDid it meet the hype? Sadly, no...maybe I hyped it too much, but many people have the same feeling as me.\nStarting with the graphics, they are not groundbreaking, but not bad either, ok-ish I would say, however it has pretty slow texture pop-ins...\nThe game also feels to be poorly optimized and console ported (you can't lower teh shadows more than normal, and besides that there aren't all that many options besides texture quality and V-Sync. So, if you have a crappy computer, you're screwed!).\nMoving to the gameplay, it's what somewhat saves the game, your character flows really nicely thanks to SMART (Smooth Movement Across Round Terrain, I think it stands for...) and teamwork is a very important aspect focused in this game, so there wont be any Lone Wolf crap here (I mean there can be if a noob enters, but he will get totally owned...). Sadly, the guns lack punch, only some assault rifles and shotguns and pistols, SMG's feel terrible and they have like a F2P-like handling (watermelon seed shooter).\nA good thing about the game is the customization: It's enormous, absolutely HUGE! It's impossible for 2 people to have 2 characters look the same. It's very deep! Both the character and weapon customization.\nThe game also features a class based system, assault, medic, etc. There is even the secret ops guy or whatever the name is (which is like the spy from TF2, can sap and hack stuff and disguise as an enemy. Except BRINK, unlike TF2, requires skill...). It's varied and VERY interesting.\nAudio quality is pretty good, surprisingly (not the guns, btw), your movement, jumping, the effect sounds, etc. All are really well done.\nMap layout and level design is absolutely phenomenal! It has many twists and encourages tactics, like ascend to higher places or flanking, as it's very team and objective focused!\n\nThe word of the day for BRINK is definately: Potential! Potential! Potential!\nSadly it's just the potential. If Bethesda gets their thumbs off their asses and stop supporting Skyrim and start growing balls and investing in BRINK, I would be very pleased, but more careful, after all, I paid 50 euros for this game to get 80 minutes out of it. -.-\nBut before BRINK 2 or something along those lines, I'm still waiting for FALLOUT 4! HUH?! Oh sorry Bethesda, I forgot it's your money-bath time...\n\nAnyways, I wont give a score. get under 9,99€ anything equal or under that is worth it! Beware, this game isn't bad! It's a colossal disappointment, it's different. If the expectation were much lower, this game would be GOOD! But all that hype not met...it's disappointing and it saddens me.

Originally bought it for Xbox 360 and LOVED it so bought it again for PC.\nPros:\nSome of the best character design I’ve seen in my life, the games art direction is impeccable and so it looks stunning. The character customization is probably the best in an fps game I’ve ever seen with so many awesome different helmets, tattoos etc. (You can even decide your characters voice!) Overall the visuals and aesthetics of this game are near perfect. Intriguing story sets up game nicely and gives it a unique feel although they could have gone more in depth. There are two campaigns from both sides of the conflict and also what if scenario missions so a decent amount of single player content. Shooting mechanics are basic but there is a nice variation in classes and absolutely awesome parkour mechanics.\nCons:\nNo one online so the multiplayer is pretty dead, sometimes the AI in single player can be a little dumb but only occasionally. Apart from the story missions there isn't much else to do apart from some challenges (however they do have leader boards).\n\nConclusion:\nOne of my favourite games of all time, I can’t understand why it gates so many bad reviews, with some tweaks to the AI more content and a living multiplayer base this game would be PERFECT.\n","February 29","true","11.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

A game that was unfinished. some of the mechanics are a bit clunky and the delay on some actions is frustrating but some parts of Brink are quite fun such as the class based team objective based shooter but the things which hint towards to game being unfinished is that the freeplay missions are the same as the campaign but with your choice of settings. one of the things they have dont quite well is the customisation. for example i could have a assult rifle with an acog scope, extended mags, fore grip and muzzle break and the character customisation is also quite nice and again for example i could have a security guy soldier with a demolistion suit. over all i do recommend it but i wouldnt spend lots of money on it just pick it up in a sale.","December 30, 2013","true","39.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I saw it on steam and I said to myself "I remember playing this on PS3, and knowing how much better the experience can be on PC, why not try it?"\nI was not disappointed, at all.\nThe graphics are pretty decent for this time if you crank 'em up and turn off motion blur.\nGameplay is phenomenal, despite the dead community.\nAudio, fantastic. I love the menu music. Sometimes I'll just sit there and listen to it, no kidding.\nThe story may not be the greatest, but it introduces some original and interesting concepts, such as the ark,etc.\n\n\nRatings breakdown\n\nGraphics: 4/5\nGameplay: 4.5/5\nAudio: 5/5\nStory: 3.7/5\n\nOverall I rate this game 8.6/10, I actually added up my individual ratings above. My only gripe with this game other then the dead community is the story. IT WAS TOO DAMN SHORT. I loved the story, it could be better, yes, but it had potential, like a metric butt ton of it. If they ever release a sequel to this game (which is doubtful) I would buy it. Despite the graveyard of a community this game is still a blast to play offline or with a few friends. This game (In My Opinion) was under rated. This is one of the best FPS games I have ever played and it will be that way for a while.\n\nAs I said, if you have a couple friends and are looking for something to do, consider picking this up. As a hardcore FPS? Eh, not so much, mainly because of dead community. (Which by now I've said ~5 times).\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading my review.\n\nOh, and sorry if there's any spelling errors. Feel free to make fun of me or w/e you do to people who spell stuff wrong.\n\nI DO REALIZE MY REVIEW MIGHT BE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

Various body types allow different weapons and different level of movement freedom (light - very fast and able to climb, medium - fast, but not that agile, thick - bullet sponge+turtle movement+no vertical advantage). Two factions offer different stories. Guns are ok and so are the perks. Classess are standard - engineer, assault, spy and\nmedic. Customization of your character and weapons is pretty rich.

AI isn’t too bad, but the bots on your team are constantly getting in the way. Game-play is very confusing. Not only are the objectives very unclear, but enemies seem to just appear in the worst possible places. You are often staggering  around lost and confused, then you get incapped without knowing where the bullet even came from becaseu an enemy spawned behind you. And enemies seem to be far more difficult to kill than you are! All in all it adds up to a lot of frustration.\nIt’s not a bad game, but it's far from a great game. It has some serious game-play issues. Recommended? Well, At at Sale price, yes, but not at full price.\n","August 8, 2013","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","6"

The campaign is a series of levels that deal with certain things like blowing up a place or stopping a group of guys from blowing up stuff. The game is a must have if you have friends to play with, the co-op modes are alot of fun and alot more easier to play with 2 people. The customization of characters is alot of fun to play with because there is so many different combinations to mess around with. The customization of weapons is great to have that advantage when your in a battle. The  "SMART" (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain) is awesome and is something that is not seen in games these days, you run and moving smoothly while vaulting over objects which is a fun feature to this game. Time plays a huge factor in every match of Brink, you need to be fast and use strategy to accomplish your goals. The game is great and alot of fun for any FPS player.

I bought this game to play with my friends (What the store page said I could do) I currently cannot join any of my friends even going so far as to download a program which helps matchmaking (still doesn`t work)\n\nI have played Brink for more then enough time to say this\n\nThings Brink NEEDS to Work on\n1. Campain Missions: They`re basically the exact same thing, there`s no change its always just attack this or defend this\n\n2. Matchmaking: If you claim to not only have a fantastic game but have co-op multiplayer in the game then actually do it instead of making people frustrated (make the matchmaking like Team Fortress 2 with no problems)\n\n3. DLC Gun Overpower: I have purchased the DLC and can already see both the Fallout 4 rifle as well as the DOOM submachine gun are very overpowered (DOOM gun does not have any recoil and has the fastest fire rate and the Fallout 4 rifle is the second most damage rifle that you can unlock as a noob)\n\n4. Bots: The bots are just basically awful. Playing campain its either your teammates are dumb as logs and don`t help with the main mission and don`t revive you when thier standing right on top of you or the enemies are damn near impossible even on easiest dificulty taking you out in a fraction of a second without you knowing where they are.\n\n5. Character Development: When I watched the videos about the character creation I was so excited...only to find out thier all the same. The voice selection as well as the character actually moving his lips with accuracy is amazing yet they all say the same thing with no uniqueness. When you first create your character all you do is make a face, get a voice then get shirts as you play the game. I wish the selection you made on your character could affect how your character handles in combat because no matter what shirt you get (Even the suit for Resistance which is basically a tank) you all mostly have the same health with no difference (Best example of what I`m trying to explain is Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim with each race having benifets as well as armor having benifets).\n\nI want to love you Brink because you have all the powers alligned in your favor, please fix these problems and make your game shine.\n\nSincerely\n- Professor Rook","May 29","false","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Matchmaking: If you claim to not only have a fantastic game but have co-op multiplayer in the game then actually do it instead of making people frustrated (make the matchmaking like Team Fortress 2 with no problems)\n\n3. DLC Gun Overpower: I have purchased the DLC and can already see both the Fallout 4 rifle as well as the DOOM submachine gun are very overpowered (DOOM gun does not have any recoil and has the fastest fire rate and the Fallout 4 rifle is the second most damage rifle that you can unlock as a noob)\n\n4. Bots: The bots are just basically awful. Playing campain its either your teammates are dumb as logs and don`t help with the main mission and don`t revive you when thier standing right on top of you or the enemies are damn near impossible even on easiest dificulty taking you out in a fraction of a second without you knowing where they are.\n\n5. Character Development: When I watched the videos about the character creation I was so excited...only to find out thier all the same. The voice selection as well as the character actually moving his lips with accuracy is amazing yet they all say the same thing with no uniqueness. When you first create your character all you do is make a face, get a voice then get shirts as you play the game. I wish the selection you made on your character could affect how your character handles in combat because no matter what shirt you get (Even the suit for Resistance which is basically a tank) you all mostly have the same health with no difference (Best example of what I`m trying to explain is Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim with each race having benifets as well as armor having benifets).\n\nI want to love you Brink because you have all the powers alligned in your favor, please fix these problems and make your game shine.\n\nSincerely\n- Professor Rook","May 29","false","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are issues, balance, ai, gun mechanics, map bottlenecks, all need a little more work. What Brink is good at, though, is making people work together as a team, helping out, and providing a different style of play to a stagnant genre. The Parkour mechanics add a wonderful element to the play, the customization is great, and there was definitely some ambition from the developers. Ultimately, the game is not a success, but it is a gem that I will pull out and admire from time to time and enjoy. If you catch it on a steam sale for <$10, I would check it out, and pass along anything positive in the hopes they can use it to make a better genre overall.","September 1, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, by then, everyone had stopped playing. The current state of the game is that there are only a few servers and only a few players. Despite this, I would still recommend this game but only if you have some friends to play coop with as public servers are very, very empty (at least last time I checked).\n\nAbout the game...\n\nIt's class based team games, with a variety of objectives and freedom to help your team in a number of ways. Great art style and graphics. The environments look great, but aren't as open as they should be to take advantage of the parkour mechanics. The singleplayer is basically just a botmatch, so I would stick to coop and multiplayer. The main flaw for me was that you are likely to distribute all your skills to one class so that you are very powerful, which dissuades you from switching class to help the team when you need an engineer to blow something up or an operative to hack, etc.","September 1, 2014","true","266.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, copy on it is region-locked.\nThis game is multiplayer-based, clearly... I think devs never considered that it'd die out and be played solo mainly. This game blossoms when played with players fighting on both sides - in singleplayer it's more dull, fighting with bots who are equally stupid on your side and on the enemy side, in multiplayer you need people on both sides, otherwise it becomes a babybeating fest of a game, as bots can't do anything against a squad of players. If you have friends who are willing to play with you, get this now. It's worth it...\n...however if you are on your own prepare for frustration with the stupidity of your bots, dull fights with the enemy bots and the nigh-incompletable challenge that is required to unlock all the guns and attachments, talking about tier 2 and 3 of "Be More Objective". The aimbot-like accuracy of enemy bots and concentrated fire, lack of aim on the side of bots that are "helping" you and  the fact that you get blasted away in mere moments, AND you are the only person completing the objectives in rather short amount of time are already enough to smash your keyboard.\nSad this thing died. It's so reliant on players that without them you suddenly realize it frustrates you more often than it makes you have fun.\nStill, I'd recommend it.\nIt was good.\nRest in peace, Brink.","April 25, 2014","true","17.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As the first wave largely abandoned the servers for TF2 the price was halved and the new blood came looking for a decent budget fps.

The free-running, the different body types, the whole idea of either siding with the guys trying to keep the fallen paradise in one piece or with the others who truly believed that there was hoarding going on that should be shared by all and scarcity was being made up. The ability to change your class mid-match to fill in what was needed.\n\nI even put together a cosplay of The Anger.

This particular game didn't click with me.\n\nI played this game in early 2013 as part of a personal challenge to play some games on my backlog.  Naturally I had to play SP with bots as the MP community had mainly moved onto other things years ago.  Also as your have to "level up" I didn't want to start as a noob with rude people who would be telling me I was doing it wrong.\n\nThe levels are quite fun at first, you can pick what type of  character to play, follow the other bots to an objective and either earn it, or death zerg until success.  Be prepared to hear about capturing or losing command points a hell of a lot.  You could be about to win the level, then the enemy AI take one of your command points and the AI on your team decide to go get their revenge.\n\nThe movement to the game is kinda fun, but really its just a gimmick.  In battle you'll either kill the guy or get killed, its not about fancy movement and gunplay at the same time.\n\nThe game has 2 sides, each map lets you play the story from either side, but really, does anyone care what the story is about, why the are getting wound up?  The third time you have heard the bots talking about "WE HAVE TAKEN THEIR COMMAND POST" you have forgotten what or why you were doing.  You just know you have to get closer and press and action key to win the objective.\n\nOverall the game wasn't fun enough.  Apart from going back to get some more achievements I won't be going back to this.\n\nThings that annoy me:\nI don't want a choice of voice actors\nOne of the maps was impossible to win at the normal difficulty.  Partly as the bots never teamed up with me. I dropped the difficulty and got through the map flawlessly.\nLots of focus on things that I'm just not interested in.\nThe bots dialogue\nThe bots, both friendly and enemy are the main reason you'll want to quit.","December 9, 2013","false","8.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"

Although it is what you'd expect, everything for the resistance is improvised and gritty, everything for the security forces is shiny, white and looks brand new, etc. The soundtrack is also decent, the main menu theme is currently stuck in my head as I write this review.\n\nThe gameplay is class based, the game requires a large degree of teamwork to accomplish any of the objectives, this isn't really a game where you can be the lone wolf and decimate everything in your path. Anyone familiar with games such as TF2 or star wars battlefront, will feel right at home with the gameplay. The only aspect of the gameplay I don't like is the parkour, its very jerky, sometimes unresponsive, and difficult to pull off in certain situations due to the 1st person view limiting your perspective of the surrounding environment, it feels like the parkour was an afterthought and was wedged in at the last minute in order to attract the Mirrors Edge crowd. However, I've found that parkour isn't particularly usefull in all the missions anyway, so the clunkyness isn't really a problem as I rarely used parkour to its full extent.\n\nCharacter customisation is rather good. By leveling up you unlock different outfits for your character, allowing you to personalise him as you see fit. Anyone wishing to play as a female character may be slightly dissapointed as you can only play as a male character. You can however choose from three different body types, Light, medium and heavy. all with their own advantages and drawbacks. e.g Light characters can run very fast but can be killed in only a few hits, wheras the heavy characters take more damage, but move slower. There are also perks and abilities for each class, with the Medic being able to upgrade his healing abilities, the engineer can gain a sentry gun upgrade, the soldier can dispense more ammo to comrades and the operative can genrally become more sneaky. More weapons and attachments for said weapons can be unlocked through the completion of individual challenges, separate from the main game. Most of these challenges are fairly easy, and don't require a great deal of effort, allowing you to unlock all the weapons and attachments somewhat quickly. The game has a wide variety of weapons to choose from, allowing for a good variety of playstyles.\n\nSadly, the multiplayer is fairly dead. Whenever I try to search for a match, there's no one else playing. This means you're left with the single player mode. However, those familiar with Star Wars battlefront's 'instant action' feature, will feel right at home as the 'free play' mode allows you to jump into any mission of your choosing, and apply custom mutators to that mission. Unfortuntely, the AI is not the best feature of this game as it is very temperamental. Sometimes the friendly AI will be as stupid as a sack of hammers and at others it will be flawless, the same can be said for the enemy AI, sometimes it wrecks you and your team, sometimes it just sits back and takes whatever beating you're giving it.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is fairly solid but is held back by the lack of an active multiplayer scene, the temperamental AI and the clunky parkour.","June 23, 2014","true","48.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I seriously regret this $10 purchase, I wouldn't pay $1 to play it. Absolutely horrible and unplayable. Glitchy graphics, team AI is unintelligent and usless with unbalanced gameplay. Only good things are  maybe some of the concepts in the game, story is okay but that isn't enough to make it worth playing. Extremely disapointing game from Bethesda.\n\nMind you I have only played solo. The game might be better played with others but even then I am certain there a better games out there with less issues. I have also heard most of the servers are dead so multiplayer is  for the most part a no go. If they fixed the solo campaigne so it was possible to progress and not waste 20-40min per mission because your own team mates are so useless, this could of been a great game, but It is just horrible. I don't play games to do the same thing over and over, and over, and over, and over... I don't just play for the sake of playing a game, I want to be able to progress. I think it was designed to be MP only, as the single player is just unpleasant and unplayable. They shouldn't of even bothered with a single player mode.\n\nWhile some of the customization is cool, it sill all seems more or less the same and the faces, while funny, are unappealing. The parkour is cool, when it works. this game is not worth the frustration.\n\nOver all, the game looks cool, not worth it if you want to play solo, and I am not even sure multiplayer is all that active. buy at youer own risk, do not pay full price.","June 5, 2014","false","23.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's no point in recommending this now - the player base is minimal and there are tons of other shooters with more players. Thankfully, there is a sort of campaign, but fighting bots doesn' feel fun or rewarding and they aren't terrible, but not a good enough test aginst human players. I'm not sure I'm fond of the way the guns feel either, though I can't describe why.

The Trailer is really catchy (to be honest: it was the reason why i thought about buying). This is not a game you can play every day, but a nice variety to everything you know before.\n\nMentionable points\n\n+ New and own game style, easy to learn\n+ Climb over machines, containers... use the direct way to the target\n\n-  MP Servers are mostly down\n__________________________\n\nGraphics - 7/10\nThe graphics seems rough and bit edged, but this is also the style of the game. It is basicly nice done.\n\nSound - 7/10\nSound is ok. nothing special.\n\nAI - 8/10\nThe Bots are average-good programmed. Less to none buggy behavour.\n\nIngame enviroment possibilities - 9/10\nThe best possibility is here that you can nearly climb over everything - depending on your body-type. If you choose to play light-body character you can run, slilde on the floor... why using the path? climb the container and take the direct way. really.... nice done.\n\ncomplexity 7/10\nIt takes a few minutes until you understand how to use everything. how you make xp the best way, how to change character... but its not too bad.\n\nSingle Player 4/10\nThere is no real SP Story line. The SP and the MP are nearly the same, because you play the same maps. you can choose to do it in random order or in a "story-campagne-way"\n\nMultiplayer 5/10\nPlaying MP is fun but there are most of the time problems when you open a server. For example others cant connect because an option was missing or connection problems,.....\nThe public servers by the developers are down also.\n\nThe only way to play MP online is now either to connect to a serve from history-list or to open a LAN server via Tunngle.\n\nPrice 3/10\nSince you can buy this game nearly everywhere for round about 5,- EUR, The 20,- EUR here are too much.\nIn my opinion 5,- EUR would be okay, since the dlc's are nice: 10,- EUR for the complete-pack would be a good deal.\n\n\nPersonal Summary\nEven with the DLC, there are round about 20 Maps you can play. Not bad but also not really much. The main thing that keeps the fun factor up in this game is that you have many possibilitys to turn the table around during the fight. Most of them need to be unlocked (which keeps you playing also). For example:\n\nEnemys keep killing your teammates and you cant reach them (as medic) without getting killed? Equip the "medic-grenade" and revive many (!) of them at the same time from cover.\n\nEnemys are too many? Equip "mechanic" character, boost your own weapons and your teammates' and also build sentry guns and mines.\n\nEnemys come from everywhere and catch you? Equip "Spy" Character, get the Identity from a dead enemy and you will look like him and appear as a "friendly" on your enemys radar. Then go behind enemy lines and kill him with an "suprise" from behind. You can also "hack" (as a spy) enemy sentry guns so they attack THEM or put remote control on them to control them manual ^^\n\nand so on....","January 19, 2015","true","182.2"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Soldiers: Soldiers are primarily concerned with destroying important objects with explosives. They are also in charge of resupplying their teammates with ammo. Soldiers can also throw damaging speciality grenades, such as molotov cocktails, flashbang, and plant satchel charges similar to C4. With the proper ability equipped and utilised (Scavenger), they are the only class that have access to a potentially unlimited supply of ammunition.\n\n2.  Engineers: The Engineer is concerned primarily with building, repairing, and upgrading things on the battlefield. Engineers must also disarm enemy explosives planted by soldiers as well as enemy landmines. He can also upgrade his and his teammate's weapons to do more damage, upgrade teammates' body armour, and plant hidden landmines.\n\n3.  Medics: Medics revive downed teammates and buff their teammates' health. They also have special health buffs they can dispense to their teammates, such as improving their teammates' metabolism (how fast they heal on the battlefield) or temporarily boosting their sprint speed. They are the only class that can buff their own health or self-resurrect themselves when downed.\n\n4.  Operatives: Operatives are the spies of Brink. They can hack computers to complete certain Mission Objectives and can also disguise themselves as the enemy. They are the only class that can spot hidden landmines.\n\n\nThe game was pretty damn good, but by now the games online would probably be dead.  So beware when purchasing.  Everyone working as a team was fantastic and fun.  The parkour is exactly as it sounds.  You do a lot of jumping here and sliding there.  Think Titanfall if you've played that, but without the jetpacks.  Customization is cool in which you unlock certain attachments and upgrades for your weapons and how you characters look.  Similar to how Call of Duty does it, but Brink's user interface makes it look all pretty and the 3D models of weapons stands out.\n\nInteresting, fun and well worth checking out.  It does have a story and simi-single player.  Drop in Drop out coop online, but chances are you'll be playing by yourself unless you have some friends willing to play with you.\n","January 19, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chieffargo/recommended/22350/","Chieffargo","Chief_Judge_Fargo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chieffargo/","105 products in account","I've previously owned this game before on PS3, so I decided to give the game another chance on PC.\n\nPersonally, I like the artstyle, its fairly unique and sets the game apart from other run of the mill shooters. Although it is what you'd expect, everything for the resistance is improvised and gritty, everything for the security forces is shiny, white and looks brand new, etc. The soundtrack is also decent, the main menu theme is currently stuck in my head as I write this review.\n\nThe gameplay is class based, the game requires a large degree of teamwork to accomplish any of the objectives, this isn't really a game where you can be the lone wolf and decimate everything in your path. Anyone familiar with games such as TF2 or star wars battlefront, will feel right at home with the gameplay. The only aspect of the gameplay I don't like is the parkour, its very jerky, sometimes unresponsive, and difficult to pull off in certain situations due to the 1st person view limiting your perspective of the surrounding environment, it feels like the parkour was an afterthought and was wedged in at the last minute in order to attract the Mirrors Edge crowd. However, I've found that parkour isn't particularly usefull in all the missions anyway, so the clunkyness isn't really a problem as I rarely used parkour to its full extent.\n\nCharacter customisation is rather good. By leveling up you unlock different outfits for your character, allowing you to personalise him as you see fit. Anyone wishing to play as a female character may be slightly dissapointed as you can only play as a male character. You can however choose from three different body types, Light, medium and heavy. all with their own advantages and drawbacks. e.g Light characters can run very fast but can be killed in only a few hits, wheras the heavy characters take more damage, but move slower. There are also perks and abilities for each class, with the Medic being able to upgrade his healing abilities, the engineer can gain a sentry gun upgrade, the soldier can dispense more ammo to comrades and the operative can genrally become more sneaky. More weapons and attachments for said weapons can be unlocked through the completion of individual challenges, separate from the main game. Most of these challenges are fairly easy, and don't require a great deal of effort, allowing you to unlock all the weapons and attachments somewhat quickly. The game has a wide variety of weapons to choose from, allowing for a good variety of playstyles.\n\nSadly, the multiplayer is fairly dead. Whenever I try to search for a match, there's no one else playing. This means you're left with the single player mode. However, those familiar with Star Wars battlefront's 'instant action' feature, will feel right at home as the 'free play' mode allows you to jump into any mission of your choosing, and apply custom mutators to that mission. Unfortuntely, the AI is not the best feature of this game as it is very temperamental. Sometimes the friendly AI will be as stupid as a sack of hammers and at others it will be flawless, the same can be said for the enemy AI, sometimes it wrecks you and your team, sometimes it just sits back and takes whatever beating you're giving it.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is fairly solid but is held back by the lack of an active multiplayer scene, the temperamental AI and the clunky parkour.","June 23, 2014","true","48.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Обычный тип обладает меньшим запасом здоровья, на может забираться на выступы с его высотой. Худой же тип самый слабый в здоровье и оружии, но он очень быстро бегает, не устаёт, забирается везде и на всё, так как умеет отпрыгивать от стен, забираться по ним и вытворять акробатические приёмы.

Overall the game is not even THAT bad but it just doesn't excel on any level.\n\nOne of the reasons i preorderd this game was because of character customisation. Although it has more customisation than most first person shooters these days, the game is just too fast to see any real difference between characters other then they're white or black, something the Unreal Tournament series always succeeded in.\n\nObviously, I did not buy the game just for the character customisation. I also bough the game because it should have great gameplay and there apparently was a story mode. While there is a story mode, I don't think anyone really cared about the story unlike in games like Left 4 Dead but it was a nice attempt to implant some sort of story mode. The gameplay is OK, just your typical shooter but somehow, to me it just didn't feel right for a FPS.\n\nThere are also objectives your team needs to complete in every mission, which could be great but everything is just too chaotic and you have no idea what to do.\n\nBrink isn't a bad game but there's a reason why players stopped playing the game. You probably won't find people playing so it's you vs bots. The only way this game could get alive is if they gave it away for free.\n","November 25, 2014","false","5.0"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

The game promised to be something different, introducing what was supposed to be fluid movement via a "parkour" style. I had this game pre-purchased on the promises delivered by the trailers, and I wish I had saved my money. The "Parkour" part was not well-executed, and seemed to be "laggy" on every server I played. Want to get away from the lag and play with bots instead? Expect to have to do every single objective by yourself, because the bots aren't programmed to do it.\n\nBut Brink's most disappointing feature is that it's just....boring. A game about parkour gunplay should not be boring. It takes half of your clip of ammo to down an enemy, and even when they're down, they're not dead yet. You'll essentially have to use a full clip of ammo whenever you want someone to really, truly die.","November 26, 2013","false","7.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpoly/recommended/22350/","mrpoly","Magic Polygon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpoly/","218 products in account","Brink is what happens when you try to make a multiplayer FPS game that promotes movement and fast-paced action but feel constrained by the modern trends of "tactical" play and cover mechanics. Simply put, it falls flat in every way imagineable.\n\nIt's disappointing because I was really excited for this game when I first heard about it. I thought it might actually be the next best thing since Unreal Tournament 2004. "Finally, a new competitive shooter that encourages movement." But nope. In fact, most of the time, you get more points for being near an objective and just standing there. That's already a bad sign for a game that supposedly encourages you to run around, climb, and jump off walls whenever possible, but if the guns didn't all feel like pea shooters it'd at least be tolerable.\n\nOne thing I'll give this game credit for is that it doesn't keep track of your kill/death ratio. It's all about the objective here. All about the teamwork. But even then, as mentioned earlier, you'll find that the easiest way to play this game is sitting still and shooting at people running by. It's not inherently a bad thing if a shooter isn't pure run and gun, but when a game puts a lot of emphasis on its parkour system, I certainly expect some faster-paced action.\n\nEven if you somehow find a way to enjoy this kind of gameplay, the horrible optimization will completely kill off any desire to keep playing it. If you use an ATI graphics card, you better pray to the gaming gods that your game won't run at less than 10 fps for no reason at all. And THEN if you happen to enjoy it and can run it well, you'll be disappointed to see that the game is pretty much empty online. It died off that quickly.\n\nShort version: Don't get this game. You won't find anything worthwhile here.","December 5, 2013","false","20.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The lack of ways to get around brought the game was contrary to their claim to "free motion" with the 'SMART" button.\n\n","December 6, 2013","false","22.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Sure, it's not the game it could've been, but it's definitely not as bad as the reviews want you to believe. The graphics are a bit dated, but they're stylish nonetheless. And the gameplay is a solid mix of Team Fortress, Counter-Strike, Call Of Duty and other popular shooters. The only downside is that there just doesn't seem to be any decent balancing on certain maps. Sometimes you're stuck in the spawn zone for the entire match, and there's no way to get out. Things like that really take the fun out of the game. That, and a few bugs (like no sound at all on certain maps). There is still a lot of fun to be had here, so if you like multiplayer games you might want to give it a spin :)\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","May 19, 2011","true","27.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Beautiful game but it was the last time i pre-ordered anything form a physical store. Once I returned said store copy, etc what was the point? I bought the normal version. Menu stutters and bugs abound held me back from even playing . Once I did there were even more problems. Whatwas fun was some of the movement styles and customization. 4 years later I wish it had recovered.

Yet, it still felt like a condensed version of TF2 prior to the customization. But that made it interesting. The classes by name were there, but a lot of the elements mixed together in a clunky and sometimes enjoyable game.\nLike the medic aspect, it could be paired with a spy-like ability and a scout-like speed. All good on there own, all pretty hard to work with when melded together.\nWould I recommend this game? Hella. If only on sale and under $5. The game has a linear campaign that repeats in a multiplayer format, which means that multiplayer to this game was almost a requirement. Within a month of buying this game, the active players number was almost gone already, and it was a bot vs bot game, which was just a merciless frustration. Buy this game and bring friends, a lot of em'. Honestly, if this game were just introduced again on a different face, it'd probably do well. It's an experience, the guns, the characters, even the movement style. But the lack of players and clunky class unity, (among other things) rightfully brought it a quick demise. I'd love to see this go F2P, because it'd pull in a lot of players and revive the servers for a short while. It has a lot of good in it, but not enough interest to inspire a renovation worthy enough of bringing it back.\n\nBuy it cheap, play with friends. Avoid bots.","May 11, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The gameplay was solid and the parkour added to the faced paced multiplayer matches, however the single player was very dull and repetitive due to there being zero story to distract me from the monotony.\n\n-Fun gameplay , although somewhat repetitve.\n-Zero story\n-Had so much potential but the completely missed their chance.\n-Dead Community\n\n-7/10","December 9, 2014","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Ignore the other comments that people make about this, because this is a true masterpiece.\n\nThe combat in this game feels solid and the AIs are of a reasonable difficulty, and the three difficulty levels make the game accessible for all gamers. Getting kills feels very satisfying and rewarding in this game, and you can even see the XP roll in as you deal damage.\n\nThe gameplay in Brink is excellent and provides fun each time you play. The game is very clear with regards to the in-game objectives, as there is an 'objective wheel' which directs you towards each objective.\n\nIn addition, the graphics in Brink are very good for the time and have features such as anti-aliasing and aniostropic filtering. The graphics engine used in Brink is very well optimised for the PC, so the game will run on most modern PCs.\n\nHowever, the primary objective can sometimes switch quickly and suddenly, which can make you a bit confused with where you need to be.\n\nOverall, Brink is an outstanding game and deserves much more respect than it gets, so I am giving it an official grade of A*.","July 22, 2014","true","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And the Common people are not telling the higher up the stuff the Ark is made of is Dying. If you own this game Give it a second chance, pay attention to everything.

Attempted to cover parkour in a shooter, which would have been awesome if the guns didn't feel like they shot nerf bullets. It shouldn't take three point blank shotgun blasts to the face to kill a normal character. Also the maps were a huge dissapointment, not enough, and many were just too straight forward. This game would have done better as a TDM game with open maps, rather than the "You can go left, or you can go right if you're fast" paths the game forces. Modding was pretty basic, char customization was okay, if you want to change your character's facial appearance, you won't be able to, everyone looks the exact same with the exception of wrinkles. Also the game went UT3 and removed all the color from the maps, with plenty of graphical popins. 6.7/10.

The story is basic  with 2 factions opposing each other though neither are shown to be "evil" and can be played with 7 other players. Its adversarial modes and customization are where Brink shines with players able to change the appearance of his/her character(s), customize his/her weapons with multiple attachments which both are unlocked through completion of obstacle courses, and level up to unlock many abilities in each class catagory.

Attempted to cover parkour in a shooter, which would have been awesome if the guns didn't feel like they shot nerf bullets. It shouldn't take three point blank shotgun blasts to the face to kill a normal character. Also the maps were a huge dissapointment, not enough, and many were just too straight forward. This game would have done better as a TDM game with open maps, rather than the "You can go left, or you can go right if you're fast" paths the game forces. Modding was pretty basic, char customization was okay, if you want to change your character's facial appearance, you won't be able to, everyone looks the exact same with the exception of wrinkles. Also the game went UT3 and removed all the color from the maps, with plenty of graphical popins. 6.7/10.

I'm going a bit too far here, it was my fault i bought this, but, if you don't know how to install all the patches you need to RUN brink, then don't buy it.

The class system based on experience provides questionable benefits requiring a huge investment of time to unlock, quite a long time after you will be bored of the game itself. The free-running aspect which has an interesting slant to it suffers in execution: it is too difficult to navigate, often vertically, while still combining gunplay and avoiding opponents in the first person perspective.\n\nAvoid.","December 3, 2013","false","6.8"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

The game is well polished and has a interesting art style that isnt to bold but the fact that this "storytelling" game relys completely on multiplayer gameplay to flesh out the plot makes it crash and burn.\n\nI feel all games should be able to support themselves on some form of single player gameplay. If the player cannot enjoy the game by themselves then there isn't any point to it. Granted you can play with bots but after two "matches" the player feels confined in the adequately programmed AI. This game's multiplayer is dead as well since a majority of people who were interested in this game wised up and went on to do better things with their time.\n\nBut if you have a bunch of friends and extra cash coupled with free time I can see this being a worth while thing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/22350/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","507 products in account",""The future of shooters..."\nyeah, that's what some big-time pre-reviewer said about the game months before it came out.\n\nMaybe "Brink" is the secret subconscious symbolic Illuminati slang-short for Boring(k).\n\nWhat can I say, for the past few months up until present half the New York City buses had the Brink ads on either side posted.\nThe game has been given special care, very special care...by the advertisers. I also feel bad for people who pre-ordered this game.\n\nIf one was to take one quick general look at the game, he or she wouldn't necessarily find anything wrong with it. But that's the thing about Brink. It has a catchy name and flashy gun fights, but underneath it all is either broken or overdone mechanics.\nDon't get me wrong, the weapon recoil is realistic and short burst from just about any gun will do the job. In general the gun-shooting feels right, but sometimes it does take more than a magazine clip to clip someone.\n\nI like the general mobility of the character you play but I was under the impression that there would be more wall bouncing, and more obstacles to easily climb on and climb through. So for the most part, you will end up doing the same thing: sprint, slow down, peek, crouch, shoot, step back and reload, repeat until you are dead or bleeding, respawn, repeat...\nWell, there are team objectives to complete, but most of these objectives are same or similar - we've seen it all before.\n\nI also realize that plenty of multiplayer games out there have the auto-healing, which I quite frankly despise. But this game takes it to a whole other level. Your health fully regenerates within 4-5 seconds, the only time you need a medic is when you are bleeding on the ground which is when a medic can run up and give you the adrenaline serum.\nThere is also less than ten maps. And I KNOW what they are going to do next. In a couple of months or so, they will anounce a DLC with "ALL THREE NEW MAPS" for 10 bucks or so....\n\nThere's no single-player to speak of. I mean it looks like there is one, but once you start playing for either the resistance or the security forces, all you end up with are short skits between skirmishes-NO STORY MODE. Each successful skirmish (map) is slightly harder than the previous one, but all it really is the multiplayer play against the AI - fulfilling the same redundant objectives over and over again.\n\nThere are also mirror-edge kind of stunts that you can do, only i found the mechanics to be slightly awkward. If you bounce off the walls the right way, you also get points (same for kills) that you later use for customization. So the outcome of your stunts isn't always clear.\nI can't comment on the severity of the multiplayer bugs and the lag just yet. Maybe the PC servers are slightly better than their console counter-parts, or maybe I got lucky, but they are also much less numerous.\n\nThe customization was meant to give the overt feeling of individualism, but in the end, it doesn't matter as much, at least to me. The ironic thing however is that after developing my character a little, I was more interested in customizing my weapons and dressing up my avatar as opposed to playing the actual game.\n\nOverall, the weapon customization is the one that matters, but that has all been done before in other games.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad, but they aren't impressive either.\n\nI also found it interesting how the soldier class has infinite ammo. This was supposed to be the city on the b.r.i.n.k. of complete collapse, yet somehow you can have infinite ammo.\n\nFurthermore, the grenade explosions are laughable. You can also hear the sound of you running but if you look down, you will not see your legs. Also, since this is a port, the aim of your mouse will auto-aim for you as if you are a playing on a controller, cool huh?\n\nThe so-called co-op in this game doesn't really apply. Because the single player is the same as the multiplayer. It's the same as playing co-op in Battlefield 2 BC, but at least that game has squads, and it is also better at doing everything, and stuff...\n\nAll in all, there's no real incentive to help out your team mates by giving up your ammo and health serums. You can if you want to, but you don't have to. You can just continue blasting and hoping to get a kill. I am sorry for thinking back to Battlefield, but that game makes you want to help out your team mates and squad mates and rewards that splendid.\n\nOne of my main gripes with the game is the way it was shown to be in previews and trailers. And that tells you a lot about the Art of Ads. I would also like to know what exactly is so revolutionary about this game.\n\nIn general, I always thought that the future of shooters started with Battlefield Bad Company 2 and it will probably end with Battlefield 3.\nIn the end, I think Bethesda should have focused more on making the next Fallout, only this time in NYC.\n\nP.S.

Not exactly the greatest shooter ever made, but I had some fun with it. The massive technical issues have been ironed out since launch as well. Biggest problem you'd have is that no one plays it now, and as a multiplayer game, that's kind of important. There are bots, but they don't substitute for real players. Only way I could recommend this is if you had a group of friends who also want to play a mediocre shooter with you.","December 29, 2013","false","2.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Art style is pretty nice, customization is very fun to use (only issue is you can't custom color your items, just pre-sets.) Sadly I am not sure if many people still play this game, as it had mixed to poor critical review due to bad console versions, but you would have to look into that if you are interested. The game is not for everyone, but if it is for you, someone who loves team based games with a twist, you'll adore this game and look past the flaws.

It suffers from being a short and broken mess, yet I still find fun in this game. This game is a guilty pleasure of mine, yet I can't recommend this game. If you really want to try this game, proceed with extreme caution.\n\nLONG REVIEW: Brink was supposed to be the next big class-based shooter. What we got however, was a boring and broken mess. Brink features "3 ways to play" being the Story Mode, Free Play, and Multiplayer(not the real names. I forgot those). I say "3 ways to play" because Story Mode is the story witht the cutscenes, free play is you chose the story level and play with custom rules, and multiplayer is the story without cutscenes with other people. What you get, is a set of missions, and 3 ways to play them.\n\nThe story is very short. To add length, you play as both the ARK Security, and the Rebels. I'm not going to get into the story because it was a very cool story when told to you, but you quickly don't care why you're fighting when you start playing. Don't get me started on the A.I. because its trash. In the story, you're tasked with different objectives in each mission, with each requiring you being a certain class. The A.I. is unfinished in the sense of balance. The enemy A.I. is aggressive as hell and will tear you up in seconds, but on the other hand, your team's A.I. is so brain dead, that rather than seeing them make an attempt to complete the objective, you will find them in a corner, eating paste through their nose(not really).\n\nThis game was meant to be a stepping-stone shooter, meaning that this was going to be that game for kids/teens who have been playing platformers and sports games, and teach them how to play a shooter. The point of that was completley stupid because most kids/teens these days already play shooters. Aside from the vast character customization, there aren't many pros about this game. However this game is a guilty pleasure of mine, so I still play it from time to time. My final verdict: Don't get this game unless you like guilty pleasure games. Even then, proceed with extreme caution as this game is still a broken mess.","August 14, 2014","false","12.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The gunplay is great, it has proper recoil, and the guns don't slice through enemies like they're cheese. The story is ok from what I've played. Essentially, there's a floating city called "The Ark". After the seas started to flood, they went elsewhere, but some of the civilians want to leave and find other people. These are the rebellion. The Ark Security tries to stop them. It's really cliche, but interesting nonetheless. All in all, it's a really solid game, and almost all of the bugs that inhibitted gameplay have been fixed at this point.","July 25, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It was obviously designed from the ground up to be a different team FPS experience, and it had a lot of potential.\n-The graphics are clean and stylized.\n\nThe Bad:\n-A totally lackluster singleplayer experience.  No campaign worth mentioning, it's just multiplayer with bots.\n-For all the talk of classes, roles, and cooperation, ultimately every class kind of feels the same in a firefight.\n-When the community died, the game died.  It has no replay value if your friends aren't logging in.\n-Controls are iffy.\n\nDon't bother with it unless you have a sizeable group of friends who play.  Even then, try to convince them to get something else.  Maybe TF2, if you don't mind the hats.","May 28, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The Parkour mixed with Guns gameplay seemed like a good idea, but it ends up being a watered down version of Mirror's Edge. In places, that's honestly what this game strives to be. It tries so unbelievably hard to be good, but it just misses the mark. Brink was a good idea, and had it been executed properly, I'm sure that it could've been good.

Yeah.\nAll the hype created over those trailers- the beautiful concept and possibility.\nI blame the developers for their decision to stray from the intended path and into the "cartoonish" and unrealistic mess the game turned out to be. Personally, I'm not a fan of playing the same storyline twice with only minimal changes(Plant the bomb this time, stop them from planting the bomb next time)- Not only does the campaign have you do both storylines, no time has passed in the game either way- playing as the Security stopping the Rebels from planting the bomb you planted during your Rebel playthrough, for example.\nThe only thing about this game more broken than the story is the combat, nobody dies until you have killed them twice.  First you have to knock them down, say with a headshot of a couple slugs to the chest, you then have to do the same once more to kill them.\n\nJust get Blacklight: Retribution, much better, free, not BRINK.","March 20, 2013","true","13.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

A stain on the name of the studio who brought you the Enemy Territory series, not even Bethesda wants anything to do with it, as they've apparently shut down the master server and now you can only connect directly to servers by specifying IP addresses.

If you're into Character Customization, be warned that there aren't female characters.\n\nBrink is a fun game overall. Gameplay is nice, teams are balanced, and nobody goes home a loser. The fighting is relatively simple. Aim, shoot, kill. But then you factor in ammo resupplies, damage buffs, and armor enhancement, and it complicates the equation. Complicate meaning "funnifies" in this usage. Plus, the movement is unique. Holding sprint activates a kind of "dynamic parkour" feature that allows you to find new paths and move around more fluidly. This also allows for some characters to vault walls taller than them. Class perks and abilities are cool, being able to give someone a damage buff or resupply of ammo. There is also a cool perk system, which as you level up allows for more abilities and tricks to be available to the character. Instead of set perks, they are bought by level coins, a nice feature in my opinion.\n\nThe story is engaging, albeit short. Depending on which side you play, you get both sides of the story. You can replay any mission as either side and learn their views and reason for fighting. Alongside the main campaign (which can be played solo or multiplayer), there is freeplay and challenges. Freeplay is exactly what it sounds like. Challenges are different tasks that test your ability to use the ingame skillset. The only qualm I have is with 'Parkour This'; I love the parkour aspect of the fighting, but in no way did I ask for you to require me to master it to unlock silencers.\n\nI love the character customization. Very simple, clean, and creative. Two things: No girls, and no custom facial/bodily features. I find the lack of girls sad (if you emphasize character customization, you dang better have both genders!) but not game ruining. Yeah, it'd be nice to seduce my enemies into not shooting me, but it's okay to have only guys. The only thing that really grinds my gears is that you are locked to a specific set of facial setups. No big pouty lips and anime eyes here, just a couple dozen near identical faces. On the bright side, each clothing piece comes in an assortment of colors (which often change the patterns of the clothes as well). The face paint and tattoos partially fulfill me in the way of face modification. Overall it's nice, but still makes the character customization just feel like chara custo.\n\nOne aspect this game displays nicely in gun modification. You can attach multiple enhancements to your gun. That's it. You get a few sights, a couple muzzle brakes (purely cosmetic, still fun), and if you try hard enough, silencers and speed holsters/slings. No camos, nor extreme performance enhancements (which adds to the argument of team balance).\n\nOverall I give it an 8.5/10, really fun to play, but has a couple bugs and missing features that kind of harm the gameplay. If you have the money, it's worth it.\n\n8.5/10, would knockdown again.\n\n(Btw, the reason I complain about Brink not having girls while CoD and Battlefield don't is that advertising character customization implies having women; and I don't think that CoD or Battlefield said that there was a totall of 100+ quadrillion total combinations.)","October 9, 2014","true","7.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Indeed the characters are curiously modeled, but it's just Brink's unique graphics. No other arena game- save perhaps Halo Reach, has such a multitude of combinations to create a truly unique character.\nI suppose there may not be anymore dedicated servers, I've never noticed a different between them and private hosted servers, which Brink has.\nIf you haven't bought the game; buy it. And if you own it, join the Brink universe again, get it back on it's feet.\nCall of Duty has an impressive arsenal, sure, but there's absolutely no strategy involved, and I'm not certain as I've given up on that franchise, but as far as I'm concerned doesn't have character customizations, as with Brink, your character evolves as you progress.\nAnd the combat, with some games it's too complex, or the game itself pratically fights for you, but with Brink you have inumerable ways to approach a firefight, with inumerable guns, and as a character with no equal.","October 10, 2014","true","18.5"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","1"

It was Brink that set the benchmark for how shooters looked and played in the HD era. It was Brink that redefined the FPS as all-action blockbuster, while transforming multiplayer.\n\nThe premise is interesting, albeit faintly ridiculous. In the near future a new power – The Federation – rises in South America and its influence begins to spread across the world.  Federation forces attack a US orbital weapon and turn its weapons of mass destruction against the US, blasting half of the states back into the stone age and putting an end to North American dominance of the region.\n\nBrink's one shining aspect is SMART (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain). Using SMART, holding a single button lets you navigate up walls, over obstacles, and through the game world. Depending on your body size, you can do more or less with movement, but overall this finesse is fantastic. Nothing in Brink feels quite as good as sliding under gunfire into someone, taking them out with a shotgun.\n\nBrink is by far the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game my friends have ever played!\n\n7/10 A Masterpiece.","October 15, 2014","true","1.7"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","12","33","0","0"

It's a game you'll play, enjoy, and forget quickly because well, it's that kind of game.","May 27, 2013","false","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The AI isn't as good as say Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but they are above average. It has a single player campaign which can be co-op'ed or solo'd. Playing online with hmans is pretty much the game's bread & butter. The game supports LAN and also allows the player to host a dedicated server. Oh, and the graphics still hold up well today; certainly hard to believe it's using the old id Tech4 engine (makes Borderlands 2 and Bioshock: Infinite look dated).\n\nPretty much the quality type stuff you'd expect from Splash Damage.

That's basically it. and I'm more eager to see the the level design possibilities this nice system will bring up (maybe we'll get more Parkour-challenges in future, who knows.\n\nIf you are more into rambo, run-and-gun type of games, this is not for you.

As Splash Damage's first IP, it comes straight out of left-field. It manages, however, to be both fun and engrossing, supplying me with unimaginable giggles at gunning down terrorists and opressive tyrants alike. The character customization is less deep than I thought it would be, however Brink's gameplay is solid. The damage balancing and the character ability balancing was well worked into the game, and no weapon or character feels over-powered, excluding the shotgun at point blank (however, the shotgun is useless unless you can count the hairs on your enemy's chin). Brink manages to deliver a shooter experience so fun, that I wouldn't hesitate to call it one of the best games of this year, if not the last decade. In a time of L.A. Noire, Crysis 2, and all the other games being released or released this spring, Brink stands alone on a pedastal above them all.","May 10, 2011","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The downside is when teams are uneven and all you do is get spawn camped and boned. This can be frustrating and at times made me want to rage quit more than any game I've played recently because of the chokes.  XP system and upgrades that only minorly affect the game without being overly dramatic.\n\nWhile the maps are small (About 14 maps between challenge and normal), they contain lots of compact area's and pathways. However most of the levels are kind of ugly looking with no open areas.\n\nI was mostly interested in the game because of its ability to travel around, wall jump, and quickly move into combat areas. In the actual online multiplayer game I found that no one does it because you'll get shot and killed quite quickly.\n\nMy overall review is that the game is good, but flawed because of the lack of content, classes, and the shoddy environments.","May 22, 2011","false","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The point is, new players don't know what to put on their weapon and will end up with a "bad" weapon. This may be something to put you off.\n\nThe whole SMART thing that was going on: it's bound to Shift and it's basicly the same as sprint, but it does allow you to climb walls and stuff, wich is kinda neat, but if you really want to use it, you'll have to play as a light, low health character, witch come with their own problems.\n\nWeapon parts are unlock trough, what essentially is, a training mode. Unlike other games, like CoD, this allows you to unlock all weapons and attachments, as long as you're good enough to get them.\n\nThe whole problem are the perks. Much like CoD, you get perks wich benefit you in one way or the other, you get to choose one perk per level, much like you would in an RPG. Levels are divided by "level brackets", to make sure a new level 1 player wouldn't have to face off against a level 30 character. This promised a plain playing field, as everyone has access to about the same stuff, if they so desired. In the current state this poses another problem; there are barely enough people playing to fill one server, let alone one for each level bracket. Fortunately, the level brackets can be turned off, but as you guessed, this does impact the game.\n\nThe AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Even on the highest difficulty, they barely pose any thread at all. Half the time you lose it's because you AI teammates weren't there you help you, to keep you alive as you attempt to complete an objective.\n\nSo all in all: it works as co-op shooty bro-bro fun time, and it would work as a competitive shooter would more people play this.\n\n-Higgenbothom","July 15, 2012","true","45.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Brink being an FPS game, is slightly different than other FPS games in terms of the following facts:\n1) Strongly focused on Team Work. If you like to work in a group and don't want to gun blaze into a fight and try to prove you are better than others (which is pointless), then this is the game for you.\n2) Parkour. David Belle's parkour makes its (probably) second return in gaming world. Being able to move around the environment using parkour is great but you should be aware of the fact that only Light Body and Medium Body types get to do them, as oppose to the Heavy Body types. The trade off lies in which weapon you can carry based on the body type you choose.\n3) Get it if you are tired of playing mediocre game like Call of Duty. :D","May 12, 2011","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The customization of the characters isn't as detailed and indepth as several on-hand video demos pre-release made it seem to be, and the Artifical Intelligence? They're useless on non-defense objectives for the most part, since offensive teams swarm too tightly and too furiously for your disorganized AI companions to be much help.\n\nHowever, BRINK's encouragement of objective focus rather than kill focused teamwork and gameplay REALLY help to make the ONLINE experience a joy: Players are more likely to assist and work together to achieve a goal than in most other team and class focused games I've played. SMARTS works great, and will be 'stolen' for use in other games, I suspect.\n\nMy advice?

It sounds like it should be the next best thing in online FPS gaming, but sadly, this turned out to not be the case. The art direction and the free running mechanic is pretty much all there is that's good about this game. Poor gun mechanics, poor controls, poor optimization, a community that was nearly dead as soon as the game launched, poor server browser, and practically no post release support all helped in putting Brink into an early grave. Gamers buried this one alive while it still had life in it, because there was just no future hope for this title. Seeing how Splash Damage is now developing a new free to play FPS called Dirty Bomb, the chances of this going free to play are basically zero, so this game is as good as dead now.\n\nHere's hoping that Splash Damage has learned from their mistakes with Brink...","April 21, 2015","false","25.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/savaze/recommended/22350/","savaze","savaze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/savaze/","489 products in account","This is a balanced role & objective-based fps. Gear & abilities unlock as you level, and it unlocks quickly. There are also training levels that unlock gear as well. You also unlocks fashions at the same time. Each of the roles have a specific advantage that support each other and the objective through buff and abilities (which is tweakable each level). You can semi-switch your role on the fly - you go to consoles your team controls. You can alo switch your weapon loadout the same way. The only thing you can't change is your build type (you have to quit the match, tweak, and then join a new match), which is related to the size of weapons you can hold, how quickly you move, and how agile you - which is related to whether you can parkour and to what extent.\n\nThere is no jump or run button in the game, it's just a movement button of sorts. You hold it down and you'll run, and based on your movement inputs it allows you to go under or over objects, or to climb up things. It also has tactical value because you can use it to not only manuever, but to also knock over your opponents and avoid fire. It's a very slick mechanic. Melee attacks aren't designed to kill, they're designed to knock opponents down so that you can do other stuff to them. Everything has a specific design, even grenades - it's all very well balanced. You don't immediately kill people when their health is exhausted, you incapacitate them, which gives their allies a chance to revive them. You have to specifically go out of your way to finish them off with another melee or expend some of your limited ammo and hope your allies are the appropriate role and are buffing you with ammo. When you are incapacitated you can either wait for an ally to try and heal you, and it'll show you where the nearest ally capable of healing is and whether they have the supplies to do so, or you can die and wait for the spawn timer which you can also see - giving you more tactical choices.\n\nEach player has limited supplies of their buffs/abilities, but they're slowly regained. Everything is designed so that you have to rely on each other. This game really didn't catch on, as much as I wish it did. It's clear that it was thought out very well. Unfortunately no one plays it anymore, and I have a feeling it was a nonstarter on PC. I had a lot of fun with Brink.\n\nI purchased the game for the 360 when it released - I had an injury to where playing it with the keyboard/mouse was nigh impossible. I got a couple hundred hours on the xbox and when I could use my hand normally I picked it up on the PC. At the time they had a notice that they 'now' had controller support, so I thought why stress out my hand I'll just use the controller, besides the PC always has more people to play with right? Not so. Well the controller support didn't, and still doesn't work and if you try to get it to work expect to put about 10-15 hours of messing around with it before you decide to go back to keyboard and mouse and hope that all that registry editing didn't break anything permanently, because it will break the game - expect to reinstall a couple of time trying to get the controller to work. So a note about the keyboard and mouse controls - this game was optimized for the use for a controller with it's movement options being tied to one button, but it doesn't have built-in controller support. So the keyboard controls are very simplistic. There are also more players on the console than on PC.\n\nBrink has time trials, single player/co-op, and multiplayer - though the SP/co-op and multiplayer are a matter of semantics, playing against bots or players. The story is interesting and there are two different factions to play through with their stories, points of view, and ideas. Accomplishing or not accomplishing objectives fulfills one side or the others story affecting the ending of the match and what team advances in their storyline. All-in-all I'd recommend this game, it's fun, fast, and interesting, even with it's flaws. You might like it just for the fashion mini-game - each character you create comes with a different version for each faction that needs body type, heritage, tatoos/scarring, clothes, and armor all with a mix of colors and styles - and each different based on their faction. If you decide to jump in you should probably get a copy for all your friends unless you're willing to stay up to weird hours in the hopes to play with people you met on the forums - which is unlikely since the multplayer is dead. I remeber matchmaking with trying to get friends all in the same match being an issue, but I haven't played in a while, so I'm not sure if that was fixed. Either way it's still fun solo for at least one run through of each faction, which will be about ten hours of playtime.","April 24, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
