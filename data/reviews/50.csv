See Conclusion\nNOTE:Also see my:\nHalf Life (1) Review\nHalf-Life 2 Review\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift Review\nBlack Mesa Review\n\nINTRODUCTION:Half-Life: Opposing Force (also known as Government Cover-up Simulator 1999 or Call of Half-Life: Black Mesa Warfare) is a first-person action shooter game that serves as the first expansion to the critically acclaimed and award-winning Half-Life by Valve. Unlike Half-Life however, this title was made by Valve alongside Gearbox Software. Interestingly, unlike Half-Life, the player will see the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of a U.S. Marine(the Military enemies in the first game).\n\nPLOT (No Spoilers)The player takes the role of Commander…(I mean)…Corporal Shephard, a U.S. Marine with the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit who were sent to the Black Mesa Complex for an unknown operation. While en route inside an Osprey to the Complex, Shephard and his team are attacked by Xen air-borne units forcing the Osprey to crash knocking him out. Follow Shephard in his trek across the massive Black Mesa Complex in an attempt to escape while uncovering a government cover-up that would pitch Shephard against U.S. Black Operations Units, Xen forces, and a new alien threat called Race X.\n\nPROS:+ New enemy types with unique abilities and weapons (instead of just rehashing the materials of the main game)\n+ Fun and interesting new weapons such as the Displacer Cannon and Shock Roach\n+ Well made action-packed story which shows players a different side of the Black Mesa Incident\n+ Introduction of new game mechanics such as Rope Climbing, Secondary heavy melee attacks, Grappling hooks (Barnacle hook?), Night vision and Portal guns that send you (or your target) to another dimension (See Displacer Cannon above)\n+ Possibly the first FPS game to implement a Military Squad game mechanic\n+ Entertaining Tutorial with cultural references\n+ Story intersects with some important Half-Life 1 events\n+ Good voice acting for its time\n+ Andrian Shephard is possibly a descendant of Jack (protagonist of Bioshock) due to his uncanny ability to wield a Wrench in battle against Black Ops Soldiers and Aliens.\n\nCONS:- Relatively short game with me clocking around 5 hours of game time on hard mode.\n- New squad mechanics is clunky (I can actually forgive this since it’s possibly the first squad mechanic on an FPS game)\n- Puzzles are not that satisfying to solve\n- Final chapter leading to the final boss feels rushed and underdeveloped\n- Unsatisfying and easy final boss\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT EXPANSION that I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED specially for those who played the first Half-Life game and I say this because it is littered with several subtle nods from the main game.\n\nWORTH IT?MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE.  I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you do not have it, get Half-Life Complete.\n\nFINAL NOTES:Opposing Force is a good example on how to make an expansion; it introduces new game mechanics, new enemies, new weapons and all the while delivering a new story that still being closely related to the main Half-Life plot.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

But Gearbox was more than willing to set the bar.\n\nOpposing Force is fundamentally a similar experience to Half Life 1. But it expanded on it's core foundation in numerous ways. There are new actually interesting weapons, friendly squad members who serve different non-combat roles and a few other things.\n\nBut what Opposing Force does well is it continues the legacy left by Half Life 1. It has consistantly good pacing and like Half Life dynamically goes from low-key puzzle segments to high octane action horror. It's just so much fun to play it's an actual challenge for me to pick between playing either Half Life or Opposing Force. Since both games compliment each other so well.\n\nIf you like Valve games, or even first person shooters. You owe it to yourself to play Opposing Force. It is one of those games that you just can't stop playing.","September 27, 2014","true","17.3"," 66 of 71 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","66","71","2","4"

As I mentioned in my HL review, I wasn't too happy with Half Life's pacing - the environmental changes that were supposed to delay you were all too random-like - it was just obvious that game mechanics with the sole purpose of slowing you down. It was really unreal. Similarly, it kind of bothered me that even though Gordon IS the archetype of the clever protagonist, the man of science who rises and fights back - it's just surreal that every other scientist is older than him, and can't protect themselves at all. Hell, Gordon was more capable of fighting than the guards, employed by Black Mesa.\n\nSo, back to Opposing Force. You play with a soldier (not a bad guy, you don't need to kill scientists if you don't want to) , and your standard gear will be a Deser Eagle and a combat knife - I really liked how realistic this part is compared to Gordon's. The story and the character harmonizes, your character, and even HIS ACTIONS have their part and place in the story. Additionally, claimed by wiki it's his training, Shephard can climb ropes, which is an intresting mechanic in the game, and opens new dimensions in movement and game variety.\n\nAnd at this point I still have 3 great things to say about the game, but they are kind of interlope -\nfirst of all, the game introduces numerous new weapons - M249 (brutal machinegun), Displacer Cannon, Sniper rifle, the already mentioned Deser Eagle and then - New alien weapons! The rocket-launcher-like Spore Gun, the Shock Roach (my favourite) and the Barnacle Grapple.\n\nSecond great thing is partly about Barnacle Grapple - it can be used as a good-ish melee weapon, but it's main usage is just crazy - it can stick to any organic surface, including some pods on the walls, that appeared along with the alien invasion.  You have a grapple that can be used to close distances and move around some parts of the map - it's just brilliant.\nThe Second Great Thing is the creativity of level design. FINALLY the expansion, while being shorter than the base game, uses it's features much more frequently, while inserting these into the game almost flawlessly. There are not only  "push the box 3 metres to the right to jump" parts, there is a part when the same box needed to be used 3 times! I guess this is because they knew that after playing the base game, the player will know that they can be moved, and as s/he's accustomed with the feature, can use it in a more varied way.\n\nAnd the third great things is the overall game integrity. It's good, in my opinion way better than the base game was.  There is way less button pressing - once you need to free a medic to take care of the engineer, who can afterwards open a door with a flame cutter. Much intresting than pressing two buttons, isn't it?  Most blockades during the game are legit - a huge worm or pillars of flame in the waste burner(?). Things that delay your progress won't just randomly happen, but your way goes through paths where they delaying elements DO exist, making - at least in my eye - Opposing Force a much more immersive game then the original story.\n\n(On the sidenote - bossfight was less monumental, but far less frustrating than repeadly missing jumps in the shower of electric discharges of Nihilanth)\n\nI won't throw numbers around, but while I felt Half-Life was fun/good,  I *loved* Opposing Force. I wholeheartedly recommend this purchase if you enjoyed the base game, and you're intrested in the expanded story.","January 4","true","11.2"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","57","60","2","2"

The bottom line is this is a great expansion pack.\n\nYou are a marine, Corporal Adrian Shepard sent into the Black Mesa facility after Half Life 1's protagonist Gordon Freeman uh accidentally created a rift in space / time and brought aliens in. Everyone talks to you in the game without cut scenes.\n\nWhen you start the game, Gordon in Half Life 1 is still there and your mission goes from being sent to kill him to fighting for your own survival. You visit portions of the first game yet changed, such as you will visit some of the entry tunnel from the first segment of Half Life 1. You will visit the dam from the original game. Everything changed with new challenges in each. There are plenty of puzzles some are different than the original game and others are more complex. Such as instead of having to use a push box once, you need to use it 3x pushing it from room to room.\n\nI'd say those old environments (destroyed with new challenges) are maybe 1/100th of the map content. The new environments feel fresh and they use a lot of lighting to make it look different. It feels fresh because the other universe is starting to be integrated into our own universe through the aliens making it and because Black Mesa had creature exhibits. There are new textures, you'll go through vine covered sewers where giant fat aliens have their nests.\n\nThere are also new gameplay elements that you will be introduced to in an optional training course. The training course is a very nice tutorial that will show you everything new such as ropes to climb and swing on. It's a very nice mechanic. The flashlight has been replaced by night vision goggles which are very nice. You also have new squad mates to find in the game that will aide you like the medic who can heal you on command, the engineer who will blow torch his way through some doors and your standard commandos. Each of these three will fight intelligently and won't just stand around getting shot. They will defend the territory if you command them to stand there.\n\nThat's another thing the enemy and friendly AI is great as always from the game. AI will run from grenades, throw their own grenades, flank you, run from your fire and other things. It's very nice.\n\nThere are a lot of new weapons. I was surprised. You start with new melee weapons, a new pistol with an optional laser sight, a new sniper rifle that can be quite useful, new alien technology (if you don't want to hear just skip to the next paragraph), such as an electrical gun, a cannon that looks like a BFG from Doom (only more awesome), an acid spitting alien, and a ceiling grabber (yes the enemy) that can be used as a hook shot!\n\nAll the old enemies are here too... but there are a lot of new enemies too (if you don't want it spoiled, skip on!), the new enemies seem to be faster and more dangerous. From waist high creatures that run to you, to taller electric shooting aliens controlled by ant like parasites, giant fat electrical discharging enemies... and their offspring, the list goes on, but you'll be surprised at some of the things the expansion comes up with.\n\nWith a 5+ hour play through the first time, I do wish it was a bit longer so they could divvy out the enemies a bit slower. But hey it's an expansion pack. The graphics are not improved and they still have bugs like getting stuck in the floor of elevators and lifts, but all of that can be overlooked. A lot has been added to make this expansion worth anyone's time.

Instead of playing a Black Mesa personal you are Corporal Adrian Shepard and you are task to hunt down Gordon Freeman and terminate him. You think it would be easy, instead just like the Black Mesa personal you are thrown into the chaos that is wrecking havoc all across the facility and just like everyone else. You must fight your way through the facility and survive.\n\nThis game adds a lit bit of something new to the game. Not only new alien species. But also team effort. Your AI squad mates that are dotted throughout the huge complex. Be warn however there are some instances that they MUST SURVIVE if they die then you will have to start all over again from where you last save. So keep them alive and work with them.\n\nThis game adds more puzzle and more exploration to the huge facility which is always nice. The only minor complaint is the senstivity in some cases it can get really annoying or dizzy when doing these physical puzzles (jump, crouch jump) those sort of puzzles. Unlike in the previous games where the looking senstivity and what not seems more slower. So beware of that.\n\nIf you are a Half Life fan and want a taste of of military action. Half Life style.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/recommended/50/","bipabrena","Metatron | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/","31 products in account","This was almost as engrossing as Half-Life actually was. Of course, you can't beat God (Half-Life, in this case) if you're an angel (OF), God is God for a reason! And that's the stupidest analogy I've ever made up, but bear with me, games like Opposing Force are never easy to make justice in words. But what I mean is, even though this game can't beat Half-Life, it was incredible. I'm not going to lie; I found certain things a tiny, tiny tiny tiny bit more "WOOOAAHHH" than Half-Life, but y'know... HALF-LIFE, MAN.\n\nSomething that amazed me from the game is the fact I was actually busting my ♥♥♥ to save every grunt I encountered. I loathed these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Half-Life and Blue Shift; I mean, they killed the poor scientists/security guards and actually enjoyed it! It was so sad! And I'm so used to killing them that every time I encountered a group of HECU marines, I'd panic and start shooting them. Then I'd be like "Oh. Right", and pressed the F9 key (my reload last save). At first I didn't mind and let them die, but dammit, they grew on me, to the point I'd truly be attempting to save them. I just felt fond of them. Except for the grunt that pushes the scientist when he's asking for Freeman when you're about to board the Osprey in which you're supposed to escape. That grunt I killed. ALSO, TWO GRUNTS ABANDONED ME IN CHAPTER 11 (The Package). I WENT TO EXPLORE A ROOM AND WHEN I GOT OUT THEY JUST DISAPPEARED. ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nGetting more serious now, something that really impressed me from Opposing Force besides the guns, the Race X and the new "puzzles", was the large-scale battles you can have at times. If you take care of your squad, you can have a group of at least four grunts with you. So when you encounter a lot of enemies, the fights are phenomenal! Sadly, this only happened once to me, I was barely able to get three grunts to follow me most of the time because some grunts were just too stubborn and stupid to follow me. This is the strongest flaw I encountered in the game; the grunts' AI is really stupid in the vast majority of the time. And they were also generally pretty useless in battle, and I'm not even counting the times I died because of friendly fire. However, there was one time in which I was able to have an epic Black Ops-Shock Troopers-HECU battle. Replayed it about four times just to repeat the breathtaking sequence. Unfortunately, it was hard to achieve and generally I spent too much time in the game trying to get everyone to follow me, which is simply precious game-time wasted. This is quite disappointing, in my opinion, since the rest of the game is of such extreme quality.\n\nBeing someone who's mostly played modern games, I have to say Opposing Force (as well as HL and BS) looks really good and its graphics are not bad at all for being a nearly twenty year old game. And even if the graphics were terrible (they're decent, in my opinion), the game would make up for it with its fantastic atmosphere, gameplay, battles, bosses, guns, ambiance and so forth. I also adored Gordon's direct and indirect appearances; his "employee of the month" photograph (was that his office?), his constant mention by the grunts and finally his Chapter 6 ("We Are Not Alone") direct appearance: where you actually see him. I seriously replayed that sequence seven times. I LOVE WHEN GAMES CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO DIRECTLY. Thinking that while you're still fighting your way through Black Mesa, Gordon is beating the crap out of Gonarch and everyone (or everything?) else. Opposing Force is, quite simply, a passionate application of creative design. I seriously cannot wait for Tripmine Studios' remake.\n\nDefinitely recommend the game. But as I also said on my BS review; only play it if you have played Half-Life. Otherwise, the game might feel dull to you and you won't understand the storyline, and won't be able to fan-girl over Gordon's appearances/mentions... well... if you're a crazy fan.

There are numerus bugs throughout the game, you often get stuck in lifts and you can get stuck in walls during map translation (although that is also present in HL), furthermore there is a section where the roof of a lift goes through the bottom acting as separate lifts if one part gets blocked. There is one section where a scripted NPC is talking and mid-sentence he says one of the random idle lines and doesn’t finish the scripted line. But more importantly there is a major sound issue right at the end, the volume level of a section of a map is really really high, if you were playing the games moderately loud with headphones this could literally cause pain before you were able to turn the volume down.\n\nAs for the game itself, the map design doesn’t match that of Half-Life’s. In HL everything was well thought through and everything was in its place, in this things are a bit random. A couple of times there are scripted sequences that open up your path, these are obvious and makes the game fell scripted. There are reused sections from HL, although these have been altered and are not meant to be the same place as the ones visited in the original, there is even one section that seemed to be reference to a map in HL but it was evidently different and happened after another map, where that map happened first in the original. In addition there is not much of a story, at all.\n\nThe same can be said for the enemies, they are uninspired, overpowered and are just there to be something new. Valve cut a lot of content from the original because it wasn’t that great, Gearbox hasn’t seemed to have done that. A lot of the enemies are just not that fun to fight, and furthermore the use of the Black Ops in the original was infrequent, because they were much more powerful than the grunts. In this, they are used way too often, although most don’t go invisible. But ultimately Gearbox was just using an enemy that wasn’t used that much in the original, instead of what they should have done is create new human enemies, perhaps Black Mesa security forces or something. The use of the new aliens and overuse of the Black Ops was just an easy way to make the game seem different to the original, a lot of really good enemies were not used purely because they were used in the original.\n\nThe same can be said for the weapons, a lot of really good weapons from the original are not there and instead you have gimmicks and there are far too many of them. Furthermore there are way too many weapons that have regenerating ammo, once you get them you need never use bullets. There is a reason why Valve cut a lot of weapons from HL2, a methodology that Gearbox did not get.\n\nBut ultimately, this is not Half-Life, this was not made by Valve. It was a quick expansion made by Gearbox for those who liked the original. Considering that it is still a good game, it is not anywhere good as the original, but that’s more because of how good the original is. The design of the maps, weapons and enemies are uninspired, but it is still a Half-Life expansion, so it’s ok.","December 21, 2015","true","11.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","0"

It's set in the same world and environment only this time from the perspective of one of the U.S. Marines of which were the enemy in the original game.\n\nI always enjoyed these add-ons for the different perspectives that overlapping ever so slightly. The detail in these games are great and despite how old they are i still really enjoy them. For me they are quite nostalgic to play, but i imagine maybe for others who are just now coming across these games, they might look a bit crap. With that said, i'd hope that the story would be enough to keep the new audiences interested.\n\nThe game runs great for it's age. The resolution for my screen wasn't compatible but it wasn't too bad, it was still very playable. Unlike my recent playthrough of Half-Life: Source, this one actually had no bugs or anything that stopped me in my tracks. I had no problems with this game from start to finish. Although, this game was a quite a bit shorter.\n\nI sunk about 5 hours into this game and completed it in that time, compared to the original game, which took me a lot longer, this game is fairly short. With that said it's still a great addition to the franchise. As far as mods go, this one was great.\n\nThere are interesting new additions in this game, a few of which i forgot about. New races of alien, new human enemies and new weapons. All of which kept the game interesting instead of it just feeling like the first one. Again, there is never a dull moment in these games as there is always something around the corner. Some of the puzzles in this game impressed me, as they were just as creative, if not more so, then the first game.\n\nAll in all I've definitely recommend this game if you have played the first one and can put up with the old style of the game.\n\n\nTL;DR : A great add-on to the original game, it's old but classic. You play from a different perspective from the first, get new weapons, fight new enemies and it's generally just a lot of fun, although shorter then the original game.\n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Half-Life: Source:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/280","January 9","true","5.8"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","3"

It looked so detailed back there, so long, filled with puzzles and crazy stuff.\nAs far as I remember, when HL Opposing Force came out, it was also praised as an awesome and one hell of an Add-on (yeah no freaking DLCs back there). I remember, I was using cheats since HL was hard (and it still is) and I simply couldn't pass through it otherwise.\n\nNow I've finished it honestly with only my skill alone, or should I say.. Survived it. With a constant save/load, trying to stuck as much of the little HP given as possible, using up ALL of the weapons, tools and explosives given, and Honestly, after years of modern shooters with, you know Health Regen, Dumb AI that's standing still and shooting after a huge pause, linear gaming and a hell lot of ammo on round I'm voting for that era of FPS games to be back here.\n\nForget the graphics I was SO concentrated on the action, simply sucked into game, I really couldn't stop. For the first time in YEARS I have finally had challenge, and if you, my friend is still willing to have challenge in the one genre that puts your reflexes and aim to the test, you HAVE to fight through this game. You can either realize what it trully means an old-school way of making FPS games, or you might remind yourself of that wonderful era, when we were really proud of ourselves to get to the title in the end where you sit there relaxed and realizing it's over. No wonder modern FPS can't possibly make you feel the thrill, they don't have the guts for this.","March 8, 2014","true","4.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

You can use the barnacle monster to swing around the environment. Overall apart from that new mechanic and new weapons like the teleportation gun that sends you to a location with ammo, armor and health pick ups.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome as always. There are intense music during some of the later firefights and it's awesome. The audio for the bad guys isn't that good but that's too the age of the game. But the music overall is really good.\n\nThis expansion is really hard even on the normal difficulty. You will have to take things slowly, if you move too fast you will die cause some of levels are insanely hard.\n\nLevel Design for the most part is alright, there's less of thinking where to go, but it still has many places to explore to find secret stashes of ammo and health pick ups. But some of the levels have very claustrophobic environments that could confuse some players.\n\nHalf Life Opposing Force took me 5 hours to finish. It's quite short and it's doesn't have much replay value apart from the first playthrough where you will see everything there is to see.\n\nThe game has a few minor bugs like the enemy AI glitching through walls but overall it doesn't happen too often and there aren't any game breaking bugs that I could find.\n\nOverall this is a very good expansion pack compared to Blue Shift. It's longer, adds more stuff and has a better story. Overall If you want the complete Half Life experience than by all means check out Blue Shift and Opposing Force. But if you have to choose one then by all means buy  Opposing Force. I give Half Life: Opposing Force an 8/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 4, 2015","true","4.9"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","26","37","2","3"

Lee Ermey impersonation, right before he gets unceremoniously sucked out of an airplane.  It IS official Valve product, though, so while it's one of the "lighter" - and arguably less "essential" - forays into the Half-Life universe, it's still a very high-quality product by the standards of not only first-person shooters, but indeed video games as a whole.  Sure it's dated more than a tad - especially graphics and sound-wise - but the gameplay is still very much there, and the story ain't half-bad neither.  The word "solid" definitely comes to mind...and then some.\n\nMaybe not the best place to start your FPS training - that'd be more like Half-Life itself, dare I say! - but obviously highly recommended to fans of the original who crave more.  It delivers, plain-and-simple, in a way which a far more recent "mod" like Wilson Chronicles - look it up (no, wait, don't bother) - does not.

The game was developed by Gearbox Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment, it was released on November 19 1999 Opposing Force is the first expansion for Half-Life. Opposing Force returns to the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the perspective of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game. The you take on the role of, Adrian Shephard, who is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility when a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units. As an expansion pack for Half-Life, Opposing Force is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of Opposing Force does not significantly differ from that of Half-Life: you are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. There are also a lot of new weapons for use in single player and multiplayer, again you see everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains in control of the character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes.

Brand new storyline that ties into the original. The rest of this review will contain spoilers. You are Adrian Shepard, a marine whose mission in the beginning is unknown. We eventually find out it's to kill Gordon Freeman. You crash into Black Mesa, and near the beginning (I forget if it's like the third chapter or something) you hear a scientist say "Hurry up Gordon, I can't keep it open any longer!" And we run into Gordon Freeman in the flesh. Spoiler mode: deactivated. The two storylines intertwine to make this whole complex thing that is hard to keep up with. But, keep an open mind and pay attention, and you just might get it. Opposing Force has everything Half-Life has to offer, and then some, such as new weapons, new survival tactics, and new enemies. I wouldn't be able to decide which one of the two is better, but I do know some people who chose this game, even though it's shorter. I don't know. Purchase and play it, and maybe you'll be one of those people.","February 6, 2014","true","13.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There are many reasons for that (including countless LAN parties in my teenage years), but the thing is, only recently, and thanks to my friend who  bought me HL pack, I've discovered that apart from Blue Shift, (which I personaly call The Blue Sh*t) there has been another expansion. This time more interesting, since we get to see the Black Mesa events from perspective of a Solider. After beating the game, I decided to share my thoughts on it.\n\n1. The Lord is our Shephard. - The main character, the idea of the game\n\nShephard. Well that's basically who our protagonist is, just like in the first HL, we play the part of the people's hero, leading the frightened flock through the dangers of the warzone that the Black Mesa compound has become. Groups of two, three soliders can be found scattered along the whole game. I think it's a good idea to view the original HL story from a different perspective. The point of view is the key here, for it gives greater insight to certain things, like:\n- Humanizing the Grunts, whom, in the first HL we understandably percive as an evil force, not very much different from the aliens from Xen. Here, we realise they are just pawns, placed in a similar position to the BM personnel.\n- Outside of Black Mesa, we get to see what happens on a larger scale, exploring the military grounds.\n- We revisit certain places, like the laboratory in which Freeman teleports to Xen, and get to see what happens then.\nThe entire storyline follows in the wake of Gordon Freeman, so it has a nice feeling to it, for the players who enjoyed the plot of the original game.\n\n2. Panta Rhei - What's different from the original HL\n\nI must say I'm not a fan of the changes to the armory, or for that matter, to the way we can fight here. Some of the weapon options recived a failry mirrored replacement, like the Colt Python. Some, in fact about a half, remained unchanged - Glock 9mm, the HK MP5, Spas-12, and RPG. The new weapons include three alien biological weapons, which are very ammo efficient since each of them posesses a way of replenishing the ammunition indefinitely. I don't like their concepts however, since for me, they don't serve any purpose in expanding our combat possibilities (except for the melee weapon, but it's nearly impossible to use in serious combat, due to it's nature).\nI don't understand the replacement of the crowbar. It has been devided into two weapons - Pipe Wrench, which has 2 attack modes (a normal hit and a loaded attack which takes 3 seconds to fully load) and a knife, quick and low damage/range weapon. For me, the crowbar was perfect. After getting the glock I barely even used the wrench, since there is plenty of 9mm ammo everywhere, despite playing on Hard difficulty. The explosives remain unchanged. We get the granades, Laser Tripmines and Satchel Charges. More new weapons include Sniper Rifle, Heavy Machinegun or an experimental Displacer Cannon.\nCasual, Casual.. ehh. C'mon, the three best weapons of the series, being (in my humble opinion) The Crowbar, The Crossbow and The Gauss Riffle, are gone. What fun is there in slashing Xen'ians with a regular knife?\nThe enemies are also different, considerably tougher and more challanging than in the first HL, altough less fun in my opinion. We hardly see any zombies or headcrabs. We mostly battle organised Xen soliders and their.. warmachines?\n\n3. Nihil novi sub sole - So what is this game all about\n\nIt's Half Life. Reskinned, rearranged, rewritten. But it's all the same. The ideas were eaten, chewed and spat out in a mixture of green paint. I like the game, I really do. It's just - we don't do anything new (oh ok except for using a rope two times). Literally. It's all crawling through the pipes, trying to figure out how to get out of old storage-like places, fighting, jumping. There is no new element. We don't even have a chance, despite being a Corporal, to actually implement this element, for commanding people or anything. We just run around exactly like Gordon did, and fight a war we don't understand. there is one thing worthy of mentioning here though - The game passes on, and even expands the element which is one of the reasons for my deep affection for the first HL, this being the nessecity of strategic usage of the enviorment. There are situations and places in which you have to actually figure out what to do. In most of today's games you are given a minimap that shows you where to go. These games explain, step by step, what button to touch and what wire to cut. In this series you've got to rely on your instinct, and that's awesome.\n\n4. Leave a light on for me - More about concepts, changes and the game\n\nAm I the only person who hates the night vision? Man, it's such a terrible concept. I understand that we play a solider and military has to possess some high tech, but damn. You (or at least I) can hardly even see anything in this green light, even in the dark. I'd like a regular flashlight instead, please. What's the deal - couldn't they just leave the flashlight AND add the night vision? If they could implement 3 melee weapons, why not 2 light variants? I know not. Besides, there are like 3 or 4 places in the game where it actually comes in handy. Let's say HL has way more to do with a solid horror climate, where you had to use the flashlight actually more than the pistol and the battery was almost always red. The game is too long. Most of the locations are artificially stretched by repetition. In my opinion the game could be reduced to the 60% of its current length and still have the same, if not the better impact. By the way - there are hardly any bosses here, the ones that do exist are reused HL 1 bosses or boss ideas. Sad. Also, what the hell is with this Displacer Cannon's secondary fire mode? So we can basically teleport to safety at any moment we just need ammo. Did I mention that I hated the Night Vision?\n\n5. Too much love will kill you - my final opinion\n\nThe game is decent, overall. It lacks some elements of the original HL atmosphere, which made it a hit, but perhaps it was meant to be this way. Despite playing as a solider I almost haven't felt the military spirit in the process, except for some parts when the combat music carried us. As I mentioned earlier the action is stretched like granny's breasts. There were moments where I've felt like I was meeting some kind of a Force Opposing my completion of the level. Oh, lest I forget - my ultimate complaint. The game was way too easy. Playing on the Hard difficulty, through the most of the game, save for perhaps two last chapters, I was running around will full health... and armor. For old HL veterans this must sound like a blasphemy since HEV armor was hard to come by in HL 1. There are also way too many medpacks in this game. Well perhaps I am tainted with my multiplayer experience. Anyways, I recommend this game, adding 0.5 to my original score, for the sentiment towards the series.\n\nHalf Life: Opposing Force - 6.5 / 10\n\nProxym 2014","December 27, 2014","true","10.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

One marine get wrench and beat down other zombies.  He throw wrench into sky which transforms into space ship.  The ship contained Hal who would later marry Glados.\n\nYou play the role of Private Joker, who is a battle-ready pacifist marine who like taking pictures of dead GI Joes.  This is also one of my hobby so I really feel connected to game.  You can start by doing boot camp with Gomer Pyle and Hartman or dive straight into action.\n\nWhen doing campaign you are either shot down by Viet Cong or Dutchman is pilot.  Not really sure as I am nodding to music.  The music is made of remixed versions of Beethoven music.  This is to remove need for licenses, although one track is based on Singing in the Rain.  To really appreciate the music you need to drink milk plus beforehand.\n\nAfter surviving crash you try to escape but end up with fight against Iranians wearing black onesies.  Most enemy and friend look same in the game.  In fact, all models are based on Peter Sellers.  The Richard Keller model from Decay was further used in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.  I only watch film after seeing final word in movie title.\n\nSome of the maps can be a maze.  If you get lost it will begin to snow before you freeze to death next to Jack Nicholson.  If you press use button on Jack he say "Never rub another man's rhubarb" before a huge one eye trouser snake try to attack you.  When you kill worm game ends.  Spoiler alert.\n\nG-Man trap you on plane and ask for Shephard.  You stand up and say "I am Shephard" but then other marines stand up and say "I am Shephard".  G-Man very confused and not know who real Shephard is.  G-Man say "♥♥♥♥ it, no Shephard in Half-Life 2 then".\n\nTo play Half-Life 3 you need to enter password "Fidelio".","April 2, 2015","true","1.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","6","8","7","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joveisagirlname/recommended/50/","joveisagirlname","Plaip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joveisagirlname/","40 products in account","Half-Life: Opposing Force is a fantastic continuation of the storyline started in the original Half-Life. Looking back at it, OP4 isn't quite as amazing as HL1, but that doesn't mean it's bad. In fact, OP4 is really friggin' awesome.\n\nStory: You're Adrian Shephard, a 22 year old marine, or something army-ish. Okay so I'm not really sure what you are, but what's important is you're in HECU, a military...thing that exists to make sure the Black Mesa research facility is safe at all times. After being mysteriously bumped up to corporal (*coughGmancough*) the Black Mesa facility is invaded by aliens. Unbeknownst to Adrian, the HECU are under orders to "silence" the facility, meaning they have to kill everything in there, whether it be aliens or scientists, with their sights especially on someone called "Freeman" who has been killing all the HECU. A mysterious "Race X" is also appearing, a new race of aliens even more powerful than the originals.\n\nThe story is great. It ties in with the first Half-Life a lot, which is really neat while also including this sense of consistency. The game explains a lot of things from Half-Life, like why the black ops are there, and also makes the HECU become actual characters, as opposed to the mindless grunts they were in HL1. It's full of fun twists and turns as well as being just fun. One flaw, however, is that in HL1 you always had a set thing you were trying to do. Fire a rocket, find the lambda core, defeat the alien master, there was always something. Throughout a lot of OP4, Adrian is just wandering around mindlessly with no real goals and it makes you wonder why he doesn't try to leave instead of constantly going back inside Black Mesa.\n\nGameplay: OP4 introduces plenty of new weapons and enemies while including most things from HL1, meaning it feels fresh and new, but still maintains the "epic" feel of HL1 and doesn't change too much. If you didn't like HL1's gameplay then chances are you aren't gonna love OP4. But if you did like HL1 but don't want a total repeat, OP4 is right up your alley. It's new, but not "too new."\n\nCharacters: Although none of the characters are amazing, OP4 does flesh out and explain a lot of characters and groups from HL1. It makes them feel more real, and although no one character stands out as amazing (except you-know-who,) the cast as a whole just seem more real.\n\nGraphics: So, uh... this game came out in 1999. As in its graphics aren't exactly amazing. Granted, the new stuff does look better, but still... the game shows its age pretty obviously. If you want a game with good graphics, than look somewhere else. Also, screw you, because graphics don't matter.\n\nMusic: OP4 has an entirely new soundtrack from HL1, and, honestly, I like it better. The songs are all really good (albeit a little out of place at times,) and they're just fun to listen to. It's not an amazing soundtrack, nothing spectacular that'll really wow you, but it's above average for sure.\n\nReplayability: Personally, I think this game is a load of fun and I've played it dozens of times. But technically there aren't any achievements or hidden goodies for you to find on subsequent playthroughs, so if you aren't the kind of person to replay games just because you enjoyed them, there isn't much in replayability here.\n\nConclusion: This game is awesome. It ties into the HL1 series perfectly, and offers loads of fun for anyone that enjoyed the first HL game. Despite dated graphics and not a whole lot of replayability beyond being just a good game, OP4 is a fantastic game and I recommend it to any Half-Life fan.","August 2, 2013","true","84.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Instead of playing as the nerd Gordan Freeman, you instead play as one of the lunkhead Marines that you had to fight in the original game. Yey.\n\nSo what does this change? Not too much. You get options to control some other soldiers at times who help you open doors, heal you, and of course shoot aliens. There are also plenty of new weapons, several of which are rather awesome like the M249 SAW... or whatever it's called. It's a light machine gun, ok? Beyond these little things, there's little to differentiate the game from the original Half-Life, except that you fight far more aliens than humans. And that some of those new aliens are rather nasty.\n\nWell, it's also shorter. Alot shorter. I cleaned this out in just under 4 hours, though I had the benefit of past memory that seemed to instantly remember exactly how to get through everything despite not having played this in a decade.\n\nAnyway, it's a little extra Half-Life funtimes. Might as well play it if you liked the original game. :o","March 7, 2014","true","39.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It gives you a whole new perspective in the game as you play as Adrian Shepard, a member of the military that you encounter as Gordon Freeman in Half-Life. Shepard is given unique firearms to the Half-Life universe, such as the sniper rifle and black hole gun, which were not present in Half-Life. Instead of a hazard course, there is a boot camp which runs the player through the usage of the PCV vest (the counterpart of the HEV suit used by Black Mesa scientists) and brand new weapons, such as the aforementioned sniper rifle with scope, and a modified pistol fitted with a laser sight. Teammates, such as a medic and an engineer, can be used to assist in combat situations by healing Shepard or breaking down locked doors in order to progress. New alien races are battled, and never-before-seen areas of the Black Mesa complex are explored, as well as areas from the original game. A new boss is also present at the end, with a moderately difficult way of defeating it.\n\nGearbox really did an awesome job when making this expansion to the original Half-Life game.\n10/10","June 8, 2014","true","19.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It keeps the solid core gameplay from the original, but adds in new weapons, enemies, and puzzles - and they really are new puzzles, not just the old ones rearranged.  You'll also see your old nemeses - headcrabs, Vortigaunts, and the like.  A select few scenes from the original are revisited, but for the most part new areas of Black Mesa are explored.  Of particular note is that you can use more small alien specimens against your enemies than just the snarks from the original - and sometimes, this is necessary to succeed.\n\nIf you haven't played the original Half-Life, you should probably start there, to get the background story for this one.  However, you could jump right in to Opposing Force without playing the original.  Just play the tutorial first, and you'll be okay.  Along the way, non-playable characters will fill you in on what's been going on.  Like the original, the gameplay mechanics are excellent in Opposing Force.  So if you're debating whether to get the original or try this one first at half the price, you can't really go wrong either way.\n\nI would consider Opposing Force to have lived up to the quality of the original.  It's shorter, but it's also less expensive, so I wouldn't consider that an issue.","June 8, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It takes place shortly following the Black Mesa incident, and runs a little bit further into the storyline than the original game. It is shorter though, at a runtime of 4-5 hours. You play as the badass Corporal Adrian Shephard, sent into the Black Mesa facility to eradicate the Xen invaders and silence witnesses. You never really get around to the latter objective though, due to certain events that occur at the start of the campaign. However, you'll be happy to know you will be doing a whole lot of the first goal I’ve stated.\n\nNow that the scene has been set, let's get a little bit more in depth with Opposing Force. For one, it adds a lot of new weapons and enemies. You will also occasionally get some squad mates that you can direct in battle at key parts of the game. Moreover, you can achieve further insight on what the militaries' objective was during the main campaign, and further explanation of the overarching mysterious narrative of Half-Life can be derived by those who pay attention. While this may seem like cause to wrap up and say it's wonderful and of the same quality as the original, I really can't say that it is. The new enemies are pretty poorly thought out, and not much fun to fight. The AI of your squad members is dumb as a box of rocks, which gets them killed almost immediately in any combat situation. My final complaint is that the last half of Opposing Force felt extremely rushed, and is thus paced horribly when nearing the end. It does a lot wrong, but it's still Half-Life. The flaws don't take that away. I enjoyed it the majority of the time, and can still whole heartedly recommend Opposing Force to anyone who loved the original. Simply be aware that it has more imperfections than the base game, and Blue Shift too for that matter. Other than that, close to all I've stated in my review of the original Half-Life applies to Opposing Force aswell.\n\nPersonal Rating: 9/10","April 21","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I believe a whole 0.5 people read it. And as a very unwise company keeps demonstrating; I should push it further and do Opposing Force. For those of you 0.5 people who have guessed it; the company was EA. Shifting from an MIT background to a going-nowhere-in-life background; in this expansion you control Colonel Adrian Shepard and you fight on the side of the jocks, hence the name ‘Opposing Force.’ Well done Valve, well done. You managed to make a clever name out of a scientific term twice now. You should be able to hear me applauding, assuming you have a wild imagination.\nIn a prodigious series of events, Opposing Force tries to topple its predecessor by giving you two melee weapons (neither of which are a crowbar) and letting you have the magnum before the glock. Why? Hell if I know, just remember the astute title.  I’ve played through this one a few times as well and I have noticed something. You happen to be a nice jock and help the nerds. I guess Valve do have a wild imagination. But alas, I must remember the title… again. At this point I’m starting to wonder why everyone assumes the mute is going to save the world. Or maybe they just lead him towards the bad guys because they know he can’t refuse, literally.\nTo summarise, this game has more enemies, more weapons and a shorter campaign like the usual expansion criteria. Nevertheless, I must praise it because it came from the backside of the glorious Gaben.

Most fights take place in corridor/small-medium rooms, so keep that shotgun hotkeyed. Mostly you fight aliens, as you are a marine this time around. The enemy is exactly as the alien enemy was in half-life plus a few new baddies (that were borring but not detrimental to the fun).\n\nThe level design is linear, but made intereting by having elegantly masked  the progression path with enviornmental puzzles. These puzzles involve shooting explosives to break open a new path, and/or moving crates to reach vents and other areas. The puzzles are rarely stumping/frusterating, yet their sollution gives the illusion of cleverness, which is a satisfying addition to the bad-♥♥♥ feeling you get from the combat.\n\nMusic is used very occasionally, often to signify an event that lacks the momentum the sudden and intense music clips would have you expecting. The rest of the sounds are exactly the same as half-life 1. Again this is a half-life level pack, not a sequel or prequel.\n\nAs far as story, you're one of the nameless marine grunts gordon kills. Thinks get fubar quick, and pretty soon your alone in black-mesa rushing to meet the evacuating remains of the marines. The story is dictated through the occasional human npcs. The dialogue makes references to the half-life universe and games without really adding to the half-life plot itself. This game can be skipped from the canonical half-life series if you only care about the story.\n\nIts worth the time if you remind yourself to expect a solid level pack , it's just a seamless collection of worth-while (and occasionally excellent) half-life levels.","January 8, 2013","true","2.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Instead of being a scientist who is trying to fight for his life, you are now Adrian Shephard, A Corporal rank soldier who, alongside his platoon, has been sent to Black Mesa to clean up the problems that have occured there.\n\nAnd the mission goes to hell pretty damn fast.\n\nWhat was supposes to be a simple clean up mission for Adrian suddenly becomes a similar situation that Gordon had - a fight for survival. If Adrian must endure the madness of Black Mesa, he must adapt to his surroundings, use anything he can get his hands on, rely on those willing enough to help and use his military training plus his own wit to it's full potential. So far, Opposing Force does Half Life justice by sticking with a similar story with a lot of great ideas that contrast very well with it's predecessor, so that it doesn't become too similar.\n\nBut what about the gameplay? Does it do justice to Half Life too? First off, due to the fact that you are now a Soldier instead of a Black Mesa Employee, there ane new friendly NPCs, who of which are Soldiers, Engineers, and Medics. All of which are a great help and can back each other up. And due to the way the story starts, you won't need to kill the survivors of Black Mesa (which was what the Military was sent for), the security guards and scientists of Black Mesa will still lend you a helping hand throughout the story. When it comes to weapons, sadly not all of the guns and gadgets that were in the original game make it back. However, all of the weapons that haven't made it back have been replaced with new and, surprisingly, BETTER weapons. Remember the Crowbar? You now have a stronger Combat Knife! How about the .357 Magnum? Now a Desert Eagle, which is faster and comes with a Laser sight! All the new weapons are not just replacements though, For instance, there is a new LMG weapon which is an absolute blast to use and feels completely different from the weapons that were in the original. Overall as far as weapons go, Opposing Force gives you more than just new and improved weapons. Heck I didn't even think the weapons needed to be replaced with better ones, seems what wasn't broken got fixed anyway. There are new Enemy NPC's too, and they fit very well into the Half Life Universe, such as a bigger zombie, Alien Shock Troopers and since the Military are on your side now, the enemy soldiers have been replaced with different Human enemies, I won't spoil who they are but they are a worthy replacement, seeing that they were also enemies of a different sort in the original game, now taking over another role. And the Level design is just as superb as the original, but with the inclusion of new weapons and NPCs, we get to see a load of new puzzles and situations that couldn't be done in the original game. Oh! and you can climb and swing on ropes now! Which adds to some cool things! So, as far as Gameplay goes, everything is better.\n\nGraphically, yeah I guess it is just as blocky and wooden as the original, but there are some really varied looking levels again, even the training level looks great! The new aliens look fearsome and formiddable. Again Half Life uses real time cutscenes, which is always a treat, not to mention they are well written.\n\nWhen it comes to audio again, the game sounds just as good as the original, the aliens sound angry, the guns are loud, the soundtrack is excellent and the voiceacting is superb. Soldiers now have different voice lines as well as a different voice actor  since they are now on your side, but they are a joy to hear... in a cheesy Star Fox sorta way. "MAN MY DOGS ARE BARKIN'!"\n\nBut is there anything wrong with Half Life: Opposing Force? Sadly, there are a few issues. First off, the glitch that can get you stuck in the level terrain is still present, but again it doesn't happen very often. And... as much as I hate saying it, due to the fact you can get more teammates with more aggresive firepower, the remarkable AI from the original starts to show some of it's issues. For example, Sometimes, soldiers will not realise to stop shooting when the player is in their way of the enemy target, they'll even shoot if the player hasn't walked in the way and was already standing there, if I recall. Another little nitpick I have is that friendly Medics don't heal their own wounded teammates. However, the AI is still great, especially the enemy AI, as it's still relentless as it was in the original game. My last major gripe is the end boss, although was a bit challenging, I thought it was a bit too straight forward compared to the original.\n\nTl;dr, Half Life: Opposing Force does justice to it's predecessor and is possibly one of the best Expansion packs I have ever had the joy of playing, and for an Expansion pack to add so much to an already perfect game is mesmarising. I may as well consider it a separate game from it's predecessor. Not only that, this was technically Gearbox Sofware's first ever project, and  considering how well made Opposing Force was, it was one hell of a way to start them off into the gaming industry. If you enjoyed Half Life, buy it. If you never played Half Life, buy it anyway!","April 23, 2014","true","9.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you enjoyed half life 1, or half life blue shift, this should fit right into the spirit of its game-sibilings.","October 9, 2013","true","9.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joenis/recommended/50/","joenis","HeyManNiceShot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joenis/","168 products in account","Opposing Force was the only expansion pack to Half-Life that was really crtically acclaimed, and there's a good reason for that. To get this out of the way: this is a full game, not a short ripoff, and it remains Gearbox's best game to date in my opinion. Not only does it rival the original game, it remains a strong candidate for the best Half-Life game ever made. It's hard to believe that typically with an expansion pack, and the fact that was developed by another team just makes it even more unfathomable. However, Opposing Force gets everything right with Half-Life.\n\nUsually expansion packs don't end up being too special. They often do little else than add more content to a pre-existing game. Stand-alone expansions tend to fare better. Other examples of this type besides Opposing Force include Halo 3: ODST and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon.\n\nOpposing Force doesn't screw up anything. The puzzle solving elements are still great. The platforming elements are still great. What it ultimately improves on besides just the visuals, and this is the main reason why it's so great, is combat and pacing. All of the new weapons are fun to use. There is not a single moment in this game that lacks tension or feels off, and in the end although it stands on its own it gets tied together with Half-Life very cohesively. This is what an expansion pack should be in a perfect world: something that goes beyond what it's expanding upon. And although most don't, this is an exception.","January 20, 2014","true","56.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Many  puzzling element's here and between. quick thinking required. and did i mention that you can shoot whoever you want? Ya you can do that it shoot the scientist's. shoot your fellow marines's. shoot that guard.\n\n\nGraphics\nI can safely say best for it's time, Still very playable till now while other game's for it's time aren't. Only few graphical option's resolution and only a few bit more. But come on guy's it was 1999 okay.\n\nStory\nIt take's in the same place (black mesa) but this time around you aren't a scientist no no no this time you are soldier hell ya baby. Joke's aside it's just great and put's you in the perspective of  Adrian Shephard,  U.S. Marine Corporal. You are sent to black mesa with your fellow marine's by the goverment to eliminate all threat's and silence the facility . The game occurs  after the incident  has already happend and you also get to see more off what happen's when the whole facility is destoryed. And no cut scenes here between event's same as the original half-life.\n\nSoundtrack\nWell there aren't many and no music in the menu as well. But still there are some and they are good.\n\n\nAi\nNot much to say here. Mostly same as it was in the original half-life which was pretty good so mostly it's the same here.\n\n\nAmount of play time\nMore than 5 hour's. Very significant for a (standalone) expansion and the price alone.\n\nConlusion\nSurely i fully reccomend you buy this gem if you are into half-life at all. For the price being only $4.99 dollar's i'd say get it.\n\nA worthy (standalone) expansion to the half life universe. Same puzzling element's with a different perspective , a variety of new mechanincs and weapon's.\n===================================================================\n\nJoin our Giveaway Group and win every month over 2100 Steam Keys (Daily 60 keys) We love to share!\nClick to join our Giveaway Group!\nClick me and follow us as Curator","September 4, 2015","true","6.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The squad's helicopter goes down before they can land and get their orders so they assume they are there to save the scientists.  As Adrian Shepard you go through Black Mesa killing everything in your way, similar to Gordon Freeman, you even see Freeman go through the Xen portal and can follow him through.  The game plays just like Half-Life, so it is pretty much just more levels for Half-Life.  If you are interested in the Half-Life lore this also adds to that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfklebba/recommended/50/","jfklebba","Ergaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jfklebba/","247 products in account","Half-Life: Opposing Force is the first of two standalone expansion packs developed by Gearbox for Half-Life. The first thing to know is that neither one is a continuation of Gordon Freeman's story. Instead, each is a look at the Black Mesa Incident from a different perspective. In Opposing Force, you play as Cpl. Adrian Shephard, one of the marines sent in to contain the catastrophe. You'll be moving through some of the same areas as Freeman, but the game is laudable in that while every area feels familiar, you'll rarely feel as if you're running over the same old ground.\n\nSo, how's the story? Well, like Half-Life, the story is that you're attempting to escape Black Mesa. Cpl. Shephard is one of the first wave of marines sent in, and your transport is shot down immediately. The unit is thrown into complete chaos, and no one has any idea what they're doing. After all, while you might remember the marines from Half-Life as murderous enemies hellbent on killing everything in Black Mesa, Shephard's unit is lost before they can receive that order. Shephard is simply trying to escape, but like Freeman, he'll have an alien threat of his own to deal with. He also has more help than Freeman. While in Half-Life, you had security guards and scientists to aid you in different ways, he also has help from the scattered remnants of the military, namely medics, who heal you like scientists but more so, and engineers, who can cut locked doors open.\n\nThe weapon roster has been expanded as well. While Shephard doesn't have access to the Gluon Gun or the Tau Cannon, he has a number of new weapons to make up for it. The revolver is replaced with the (better) Desert Eagle and the Crossbow is replaced with the (better) sniper rifle. The Displacer Cannon is an interesting but only situationally useful weapon that opens portals to Xen, the alien dimension. The primary fire basically works as a powerful, slow rocket, destroying any enemy it comes into contact with, and the secondary fire teleports you to different areas of Xen depending on where you are in the game, which is useful to escape combat and grab a few items. There are a couple of alien weapons as well, the Shock Rifle (an energy assault rifle) and the Spore Launcher, a sort of alien grenade launcher. The crowbar is split into the absolutely useless wrench and the awesome knife, and a new melee weapon is added in the form of the Barnacle, which isn't all that useful in combat, but serves as a hookshot and is played with liberally later in the game. A number of new enemies are also added, and all are challenging and fun to fight. I'll not spoil those for you.\n\nOpposing Force is a textbook expansion pack. It adds a ton of new content, is reasonably lengthy as 6-7 hours, and well, it's more Half-Life. Perhaps the only two complaints I can think of are that the end-boss isn't all that interesting and that the whole military angle changes the feel, sort of like Aliens to Half-Life's Alien. At the end of the day, if you're a Half-Life fan, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.","August 9, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In it, you take command of a US Marine, one of the many seen fighting against you in Half-Life 1, who is called Corporal Shepard. This game is in-fact shorter than the original game, as are most Add-ons, and I completed it in around 8 cumulative hours, over the course of several days. Like in my Blue-Shift review, it does have it's share of glitches due to it's age (Or I don't know. Old games can be glitch due to the technology used back then. That's what I'm saying), however, I haven't run into very many at all that are obstructive to the gameplay. One I have noticed that has no negative side effects whatsoever is that you can repeatedly reload the 9mm handgun even with a full clip. The only real glitch I've noticed that is annoying is that on Mac (And thanks to research, Linux as well) computers, once you defeat the final boss, you are trapped in limbo, and instead of being transported to Gman for the ending, you're just stuck in the room where you fought the boss. I do not know if this is present of PC computers, but based on the little research I've done, I don't think it is. Anyway, it is a fun, challenging, old-school game that is semi-important to the Half-Life 1 series so if you have spare money, I'd recommend playing it. What I forgot to mention is that there is a multiplayer option at the main menu but I have yet to try that out.","June 30, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its content will amount to, or at least in my experience, about half (punny) the play-time of Half-Life. It follows a different character, from, you guessed it, the opposing force. Going into this expansion I didn't think it would be at long as it was. So, it tended to drag on a bit around the middle. The gameplay is the same as Half-Life, but you get more weapons and other items. I had tons of fun with this expansion. If you are going to play Half-Life, I think you need to play this expansion, and the next (Blue Shift).\n\nI had one big problem at the end of the game, though. From what I hear, it's a pretty common glitch, but I had just beaten the final boss. Instead of fading away (like it should), it disappeared, and I was left wandering around, wondering what to do. You are supposed to be transported to the final scene of the game, but that didn't happen for me. Not sure if it was my version, or my platform or what. Thanks to the Steam ommunity I found a code to put into the console that sends you to the coorrect scene. :D\n\nAnyway, one big glitch near the end aside, this is a great expansion and worth the money (even more so if on sale). the story is interesting, and Half-Life fans will really enjoy it.","June 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The Soundtrack is also ambient and hectic.\nPlayed from the perspective of Adrian Sheapard, part of the military team sent to deal with the Black Mesa incident, you get to fight the Xen aliens, but also a mysterious race of aliens known as X. The game adds a few new weapons, new monsters, and the level design is damn good.\n\nThe soundtrack is one of the best of the Half-Life 1 era games. Although Blue Shift uses the same soundtrack as Op4, Chris Jenson brings alot to the table. It easily matches Kelly Baileys original score.\n\nOpposing Force is the best expansion for Half-Life. It's pretty lengthy, stretching over 9 hours. Blue Shift is also good, but the new weapons and monsters aren't there, and the length is considerablly shorter due to Barney's story. The Half-Life series is not complete without these expansions.","October 14, 2013","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/50/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","When Half-Life was released in 1998, nobody couldn't predict the real revolution the game started in the FPS World. As Doom, Half-Life was one of the best FPS in all times. So, an add-on was released in 1999, followed by a stand-alone, Blueshift, where you're playing Barney Calhoun, a security guard. Being in 2008, you already know what happened to Gordon and Barney. But what about the hero of Opposing Force?\n\nI'll refresh your mind about the three heroes of the first HL trilogy, set in the Black Mesa Era. Gordon Freeman is a scientist, working for a research center called Black Mesa and without willing it (the same can apply to the majority of his friends), triggered the opening of a portal leading to another world, called Xen. You're discovering that in reality, some scientists did know about Xen and that perhaps, it was planned to have an invasion. Gordon became the only hope for stopping it and having become a killing machine - for survival -, whether it was aliens, Marines or Black Ops, he was suited for the job. Barney Calhoun, a security guard, was working this day. Well, he did not know what or who started this bloody thing but he became an hero by fighting against the aliens and the Marines but only for a few survivors. He was also suited for some dangerous missions given by Professor Rosenberg in order to make work their only chance to escape the center. And finally, you have another hero, who fighted against aliens and Black Ops but who understood that killing guards or scientists wasn't a way for finding an exit to this hell.\n\nThis hero, it's the corporal Adrian Shepard, USMC Marine, affected to the HECU unit, specialized in anormalous threats. He's sent to Black Mesa with one goal: kill Gordon Freeman. But his plane was ambushed by aliens. He's the only survivor of his unit. He have to find a way to reunite with others Marines. And when he finds one, well, he's trapped into Black Mesa. Now, it's a matter of survival and finding a way to escape, him, his friends, the scientists and the guards of Black Mesa. What happened to him after is currently unknown. Thanks to G-Man.\n\nBeing a Marine, even if you have some common weapons found in Half-Life, like the shotgun or the MP5 grenade launcher, you have also the pleasure to see your weaponry increased with a Desert Eagle, a wrench (instead of the crowbar), a sniper rifle (instead of your trusty crossbow), a Barnacle (yep, it's a weapon now), an alien grenade launcher (Daddy's pet), the Displacer (allowing you to go to Xen), a chaingun, a Shocktrooper arm (instead of the Hornet Gun) and a knife. These additions are actually refreshing: Displacer have a good design, the alien grenade launcher and the Shocktrooper arm are fun to use and last but not least, if you love big chainguns making damage, well, you'll be happy.\n\nThere are also new enemies or rather a new race: the Race-X, which is difficult to say if they're siding Xen's side or if they're battling against survivors (including Marines), Black Ops and Xen in the same time. You will fear the Pits Drones or the Voltigores (these ones are pretty difficult when being adults). As for the Shocktroopers, well, you will not really fear them but you'll be jealous to see their weapons with unlimited ammo when yours is limited to ten electricity discharges. For the Giant Worm and the final boss, well, as usual, you need to figure a plan to take them out because your weapons had no effect on them. As for the Black Ops, if the female version is still present (you know, the fast women in black), the male version is making an appearance: he has heavier weapons, making him slower than his counterpart but that also means that he can inflict more damage.\n\nThat means also new allies: your fellow guys, medic, engineer, soldier but also what the first Marines in Black Mesa were ordered to kill: scientists and guards. Now, it's a matter of cooperation.\n\nYou'll perhaps recognize some places (Black Mesa Inbound, you know, your trip in the tramway at the beginning of Half-Life or Lambda Core) but you'll discover others facilities. And shoking truths.\n\nGraphics are still good, despite having more than 10 years of age. Even if it's sometimes angular, you find pleasure to making your way in this environment.\n\nSoundtrack is also as good as HL's. Yes, it's more a military tune but don't forget that you're in the skin of a Marine. I loved the music before fighting the final boss, it was so intense and non-military that it's still one of my favorites tracks for Half-Life.\n\nYou don't have the flashlight but you've an infrared vision but sometimes it's not practical, especially when you're in Foxtrot Uniform, in the sewers, fighting against adult Voltigores.\n\nGameplay is still the same, yep, but why change it? I mean, it's a good one, so, I don't see the point to develop new things.\n\nAs for Xen, I'm disappointed to see that the world itself doesn't give some of its secrets, like in Half-Life or in Blueshift (following Opposing Force).","November 19, 2010","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having played and fallen in love with the rest of the franchise almost immediately, I had never gone into a Half-Life game with an air of skepticism. And here's what I think (I'll keep it quick to avoid TL;DR's):\n\nFor anyone familiar with Half-Life, the gameplay is similarly fast-paced and exciting. However, I was impressed with the addition of new mechanics that made the game an entirely different experience. This expansion of the Half-Life universe boasts new enemies, environments, and TONS of weapons. It is shorter than Half-Life, but a lot is crammed into the time that you get. Playing as HECU Grunt Adrian Shepherd is a fresh and different experience from Half-Life. However, I do have one minor caution for anyone new to the series: This game is pretty difficult. The same could be said of Half-Life 1, considering they are both older games, but Opposing Force has some moments where things may take a dip into the frustrating part of the spectrum. So quicksave a lot, newbies.","July 6, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shy Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094478088/","63 products in account","Half-Life: Opposing Force -\n\nThis game is an expansion of the original Half-Life. Its content will amount to, or at least in my experience, about half (punny) the play-time of Half-Life. It follows a different character, from, you guessed it, the opposing force. Going into this expansion I didn't think it would be at long as it was. So, it tended to drag on a bit around the middle. The gameplay is the same as Half-Life, but you get more weapons and other items. I had tons of fun with this expansion. If you are going to play Half-Life, I think you need to play this expansion, and the next (Blue Shift).\n\nI had one big problem at the end of the game, though. From what I hear, it's a pretty common glitch, but I had just beaten the final boss. Instead of fading away (like it should), it disappeared, and I was left wandering around, wondering what to do. You are supposed to be transported to the final scene of the game, but that didn't happen for me. Not sure if it was my version, or my platform or what. Thanks to the Steam ommunity I found a code to put into the console that sends you to the coorrect scene. :D\n\nAnyway, one big glitch near the end aside, this is a great expansion and worth the money (even more so if on sale). the story is interesting, and Half-Life fans will really enjoy it.","June 25, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, it's a flaw, because there is simply too many of them. While the sniper rifle and machine gun are great, you don't need two crowbar substitutes (wrench and knife) or another explosive weapon (alien origin doesn't mean it's different thus necessary). Barnacle hook is fun to play with, but useless in battle.\n[-] The god ♥♥♥♥ing damn AI. Your companions are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and won't follow you if you step into a simple corridor.\n[-] Grafical style - while I don't mind outdated graphics, the "new" models made solely for Opposing Force seem to be in a little bit inconsistent style in comparison to HL1's assets, but it's not all that noticeable.\n[-] At some point in the game (about the last 1/3, shortly after obtaining barnacle hook) there is a disturbing lack of headcrabs.\n[-] The ending. While not as plain as Blue Shift's, it's a little bit disappointing after the interesting boss battle that BS lacked\n\nIf you played HL1 and liked it, you definitely should check it out.\nWhen buying on sale, BS seems like a better idea since it's 1€ instead of 2. You should, however, get both right away.","January 28, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just additional hours of duct crawling and shooting.\n\nIt is true at first. You just get climbable ropes, new type of helpers and guns.\nHowever as the story unfolds you really appreciate the "second view" thing, and I'm not talking only about revisiting old locations and Gordon Freeman appearances. I don't want to reveal too much but let's just say playing Opposing Force you suddenly realize from where some Half Life 2 and even Portal things came from. I haven't expected the story to be so much related to previous and future Half Life games because the development was outsourced to Gearbox Software   (Borderlands series).\n\nCorporal Shephard rather fights than brains his way through obstacles so the arsenal is pushed to the limit, both conventional and weird weapons.\nFlashlight is replaced with night vision goggles. This allows to keep fighting in pitch black areas.\n\nSo it is still the same 'ol Black Mesa facility environment, but minor changes alters the gameplay enough to give it new feel.\n\nOpposing Force is a very pleasant conclusion to the original Half Life story.","November 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wait... There is no crowbar in this game? Then how can it be the next installment of the world's most famous crowbar simulator??!! no it must be the wrong game... No you say? The crowbar is replaced with a Pipe Wrench and a combat knife? that is just great, it is already going to be my favourite game of all time *thick sarcasm*\nWell let's jam!\n\n//I have to say that I have played Blue shift, in my opinion when it comes to new content and so on, Opposing force is way too superior compared to blueshift//\n\nHalf-life: opposing forces is the first expansion of the original game which "supposedly" flips the game upside down. Well let just be honest, this expansion is very much like the original half-life just without any crowbar and other weapons like the hivegun, some new weapons, new monsters and probably lacking some bits compared to the original game. But is it still fun? I would say yes :)\nEven though this one probably misses some more plot compared to half-life(Which already had a little plot) then it would  probably still satisfy your craving when finishing the original one.\n\nThis game is only recommend if!- IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THROUGH THE ORIGINAL HALF-LIFE'S SINGLEPLAYER\n- You do not mind an old game with old "ugly" grafic, glitches and somewhat buggy AI.\n- If you love the half-life franchies and want to know more because this one gives some more hints to the original game.\n- you like a FPS game with some puzzle elements(just like the original game this one does not give you the glues straight ahead when it comes to the "puzzles" and the plot itself)\n\nThe killers of the game.- The plot itself was more lacking than the original and with lesser hints of what is going on like what is the x-race and so on.\n- Even though I loved some of the new weapons I must say that the M249 SAW was way!!!! too!!! powerful. Either they should have provided with less ammo or something else  because even on hard difficulty it was way too easy with this weapon.\n- NO CROWBAR!!!\n- The game just like the original is filled with glitches here and there where you can get stuck weird places especially loading scenes.\n- The AI is not that great, still gives some challenge, but often you can sneak kill them.\n\nThe Sunshines of the game- IT IS HALFLIFE...\n- Some of the new weapons were quite interesting especially the living ones :3 so kawaii!\n- It gives more interesting details about the g-man and there are some quite interesting encounters\n- Some quite interesting new creatures compared to the original one.\n- The game is really good to make a real connection to the original one, you even get to see Morgan Freeman. :)\n\nThe game itself did not bring that much new to the table, yes some new monsters, new weapons, soldiers which you can "control", use and loot when you have led them to their death :P. But the game seemed to be too easy and missing more to the story line throughout the gameplay.\nBut in the end it was still fun to play and totally worth it when you meet G-man and get more hints and details about the mystery of the half-life franchies.\nBut if you are not a really great fan of half-life and old FPS games then pass on.","February 19","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you loved the first Half-life, check it out. However it won't change your mind if never cared for the series the begin with. Shoot, puzzles, and some platforming here and there. Nothing new, just Half-life.\n\nWhile the story may be non-canon for reasons, it's still worth playing since the game flows really well. Tight level design, that rivals Valve's own level design, and even sometimes surpasses theirs. Though since it also takes place in Black mesa, it can be at times be too samey. Gearbox tried hard to avoid this by adding many new enemies, and more encounters with the Black ops soldiers, and for the most part they avoided it.\n\nWeapons are far better this time around, while I do like most of Half-life's weapons, Opposing Force adds needed fire power into the mix. You feel prepared unlike Gordon does at points, while still keeping things balanced and difficult. The two stand out ones for me were the M249 & Sniper rifle. And the Displacer Cannon has the most interesting alt-fire.\n\nThe game can run around 6-8 hours (at least on hard), and that's the perfect length for this game. Since the biggest flaw of this game is it's too much like Half-life, yet that's also one of the best things about the game. Again, if you loved or even liked Half-life, it's a must play.\n\n8.5  Would play 2-4 more times.","December 13, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With new weapons, aliens and gameplay Opposing Force, although not as good as its older sister, is a short and fun game to play after you’ve finished the original Half-Life.\n\nAfter a Resonance Cascade occurs ripping holes in dimensional space allowing aliens to pass through to earth, Corporal Adrian Shepard, a U.S. marine in the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, and his team are sent to neutralize the situation by exterminating all life forms in the facility. This Resonance Cascade has also caught the attention of another alien species, Race X, who decided to conquer humanity and claim Earth as their own.\n\nThis game is not essential to the Half-Life story line, however if you’re a big fan of the original game and are interested to see the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of the enemy, then this is a game worth playing. There are also many references to the first game and even a Gordon Freeman cameo.\n\nOne feature which makes this game a great expansion pack for Half-Life is the fact that Gearbox introduced new enemies and weapons. If not for these aspects this expansion pack would be nowhere near as good as it is. My personal favourite weapon was the Barnacle Grapple which allowed you to latch onto organic matter and go flying towards it. There is also a Displacer Cannon which can beam you to Xen and back or obliterate other enemies no matter how large. The gameplay in general is the same as Half-Life with lots of platforming, puzzles and large battles against lots of enemies. You can even get help from other soldiers to heal you, break down doors or kill other enemies.\n\nThe Graphics in Opposing Force are dated and nowhere near as good as those in Half-Life: Source, I wouldn’t recommend this game for people who cringe at bad graphics. The level design in Opposing Force, like its predecessor, is well thought out and goes well with the platforming, with lots of optional areas to explore.\n\nOverall this was a solid game from start to finish, however I would only recommend this game to those who loved Half-Life. The level design was great and the gameplay was fun with new weapons and enemies, however the graphics, for some people, may distract from this. Unfortunately there were no new “stand out” soundtracks in this game. Those from Half-Life were recycled.\n\n7.5/10","August 30, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Just... wow. At first I went into this game prepared for a shameless cash making title by Gearbox. Well, let's put it this way, it's no Blue Shift. In a good way though. Instead of depending on references to the original to add any form of excitement, direct references are minimal, but awesome (You can murder Gordon Freeman and cause a paradox, teleport to the hazard course, and uncover the secrets of Black Mesa). None of those are even the high points (well maybe the paradox). First off new mechanics: your reticule reacts to being over enemies, and a squad command mechanic to unite with fellow soldiers. Obviously the major new mechanic is the squad command, is it any good? Well... Yes, but also no. What do I mean? It is pretty fun, interesting, and cool. However it is fundamentally flawed. There are three types of fellow soldier, heavy machine gunners that obliterate your enemies quickly, medics that heal you and can fight, and defense engineers that in addition to shooting also take doors down. Well that sounds cool, but they are pretty dumb. They always get in your line of fire, you have to beg to get healed and take down doors (mash 'interact' button like some maniac), and run right into bombs and trip mines. "Davey, hurry up with that door!" "Yes Corporal" *clunk* "Davey, nooooooo! Not that blue laser!" "What?" *boom* Yep that's definitely the worst part of the AI. Absolutely nothing else. Oh, what that elephant in the room, nah ingnore it it's fine. *Sigh* Okay I have to adress the elephant in the room. When you cross into a new chapter they... well they don't do anything. No, really they just stop and stare as you walk away in an almost creepy fashion. So, yeah not so wonderful, but it can still be cool at times. So anything else new? Oh, boy is there new stuff. Sniper rifle, night vision, heavy rifle, desert eagle with laser, pipe wrench, combat knife, barnacle grapple, shock raches, spore launcher, and the displacer cannon. Tons of new enemies that I couldn't even begin to mention to avoid spoilers, but let's just say prepare to run and gun for your life. It's got new maps, but in my opinion, they aren't quite as ingenious as the original maps. Well I have to admit I love the new variety, especially the new weapons. As always what you're supposed to do is often a process of trial and error, but I as an avid Mega Man player have gotten used to that. I guess if I have to be a downer the music isn't quite as good. Overall I'd suggest this game even if you haven't played the original. It's an amazing game on it's own right, not far behind the original. I give it 9.5/10 fallen doors.","July 26, 2014","true","20.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's puts you in the shoes of a military (one of the "bad guys" in Half Life), in the same time period as the first Half Life, during the Black Mesa incident. Lots of action, suprises, new weapons and new Xen aliens.

The game introduces a new character named shepard who you play as part of the military unit sent in to "clean out" the Black Mesa facility. You see all the familiar characters in the game but from another point of view, as a soldier sent in to destroy evidence and silence witnesses you will experience a different "feel" from the characters you meet and the places you go.

Half Life Opposing Force takes you on the role of Corporal Adrian Shepard where your helicopter crashes just before you've been given orders and now you run like hell trying to escape the Black Mesa facility. I gotta admit this is a pretty intriguing setup as you now have a new perspective of the Half Life universe.\n\nThe story is quite good as a whole and the pacing is nice. The tutorial, now that's probably the best tutorial I've ever played. Training in a military academy and being barked at by my commander, it really sets the mood. Graphics I won't go too much into detail but I used the HD texture pack that was included with Blue Shift and I don't mind either personally so it's entirely subjective whether you prefer the old or new textures.\n\nMusic is minimal but very good, a little obscure but I like that. It makes it unique in a good way. In terms of gameplay it's Half Life with some new enemies and weapons just as an expansion should work. The new aliens are cool, a couple you get to use certain organ parts as weapons which is pretty sweet. You even get to have a Barnacle Gun which is used pretty well for some puzzles. The Black Ops soldiers later on get pretty annoying and they're placed in some pretty cheap spots you'd never react to in time on your first try.\n\nThis time not only do you get help from the Black Mesa staff but also your HECU brothers. You'll need to stick with them in order for them to help you since Black Ops soldiers have been ordered to target any grunt marines in the facility. As for their A.I. They're okay but a bit static but they do the job in healing and opening doors for you.\n\nI ran into a couple of glitches like in the original Half Life but they didn't do too much to hinder the game.\n\nShould you get this standalone expansion? Hell yeah it's only $5 and you could spend much worse these days. The cool story along with the good pacing, puzzles (oh yeah the puzzles are better now) and awesome aliens to shoot makes this a well made package. This gets a 8/10","April 29, 2015","true","7.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's certainly an interersting concept that appeals to me, the chance to play as a HECU marine during the Black Mesa Incident and be on the side of the "bad guys" is a cool idea in my book, and although Opposing Force opened strong, I felt that as it went on it became progressively weaker. I think that where this game fails the most is in the gameplay. There are way too many weapons that you can carry around in this game (16 in total) and it gets to a point where either you forget to use them or they are redundant. I found myself sticking to the basic, dependable weapons the whole time (shotgun, assault rifle, etc) and there was never really a time when I had to switch to those alien weapons. I should also add that the barnacle gun is pretty much useless except for a couple of pre planned sequences where you have to go across an area using it, so that gun doesnt really see a lot of action which is dissappointing because it would have been cool to grapple up on regular ledges (not organic ones) and get a different view of the battle/tactical advantage. the AI in this game is also rather stupid, your marine buddies who are supposed to tag along with you (and offer you things like health etc.) will either get killed in about 10 seconds or glitch on a wall and stop following you. They're honestly better off dead so that you can take their guns and move along. The story is also pretty much nonexistent. No one bothers to explain where "Race X" comes from (and why Gordon didn't see them in his travels) and the same applies to the Black Ops enemies. They are part of the military, shouldn't they be HELPING you? What reason would they want to kill you for? And that boss battle, geez... what a boring waste of time. Whoever came up with that sorry ♥♥♥ excuse of a boss battle needs to be fired (there's nothing fun about shooting 2 eyes out of a monster). So, overall Opposing Force is an expansion pack that sets out to be as grandiose as the original Half-Life, but fails on its delivery. It's 5 bucks, so at the end of the day it's your choice as to whether or not you think its worth the pick up. But in my opinion, it's not really worth it.","December 16, 2014","false","5.7"," 1 of 20 people (5%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","5","1","20","0","0"

Somewhere between 5-10 hours is probably fair. ---\n\n\nI Finished the game with almost no issues, only that you sometimes got stuck, mostly coming out of lifts.  But this isn't this Steam version's fault, these are typical glitches of the original expansion (and original Half Life game too).  You can mostly get out of them by shooting and changing weapons, otherwise you'll have to reload the last savepoint.\n\nThe expansion itself is brilliant!  I played Half Life for the first time only a few weeks ago (a whopping 16 years after it came out) and now count it among my favourite games of all time (along with Amnesia, Portal, FFVII, KOTOR).  It did the remarkable thing of making me enjoy a shooter, whereas normally I get bored of incessant enemy goon encounters: Bioshock, Uncharted & Last Of Us are just a few examples of highly-rated games that dulled me because of the frequent & repetitive enemy encounters.\n\nMost importantly I really enjoyed the actual shooting gameplay.  It's hugely moreish and perfectly balanced.  Opposing Force is arguably even better as it offers beguiling new weapons and dangerous new aliens, tho' the level design isn't as inspired as the original (and neither is the final boss).\n\nAs for the story, it isn't essential to the main Half Life plot, but if you're interested in what happened to Black Mesa after Gordon Freeman teleported to Xen then Opposing Force is fully recommended!  The Briefcase Man is very present too, his role recalls that of the Cigarette Smoking Man from X-Files.\n\nThe length of OF is probably less than half the original game, but this is still a nice long experience, with some really tough sections.\n\n9/10\n\n\nI've heard Blue Shift is the weak link in the Half Life chain but now I'm invested so that will be next :)","December 11, 2014","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Half-life One series had plenty of great installments, however Opposing Force exceeded them all by a large margin. Second ONLY to the original (though in MANY ways, exceeded its predecessor) Opposing Force is a testament in quality game expansions. The game was developed by Gearbox and Valve and released on November 10, 1999. The reviews at the time this title was released did not do the game justice.\nThe title is set in Black Mesa during the “Incident” however instead is viewed through the eyes of Adrian Shepherd a U.S. Marine, one of the enemies from the original game. As Corporal Shepherd, the player explores more of the Black Mesa Research Facility and the alien world of Xen.\nMany of the weapons from Half-life return in Opposing Force such as the Glock 17, MP5,Laser-Guided Rockets, Satchel, Tripmines etc... However several new weapons were featured in the game such as the Knife, Pipe Wrench, M249 SAW, Displacer Cannon, M40A1, Spore Launcher, Shock Roach, a tamed Barnacle and finally the Desert Eagle.\nIf your a fan of the Half-life series, than this is a must own game.

HL was a narrative-based, immersive FPS where you roleplayed as a scientist fleeing a research facility in the middle of New Mexico.\n\nOpposing Force is an unofficial Quake sequel where, armed to the teeth, you're a marine kicking some alien ♥♥♥. And if this is actually a Quake sequel, then its the best Quake game ever made.\n\nWhat it lacks in story, it compensates for with amazingly fun gameplay. The variety of enemies you fight and weapons you fight them with is overwhelming. You begin battling against headcrabs and zombies and Vortigants...but then a new batch of aliens emerge and you get 'advanced' zombies, zombies that shoot lighting, strange fish-like creatures that shoot shark-teeth, and aliens over three times your size.\n\nAs well as most of the weapons from Half-Life, you get two melee weapons (a Bioshock-style wrench and a knife) a new pistol, a new machine gun, a laser gun, a sniper rifle, an alien rocket launcher, a barnacle you can mount on your hand, and a gun that teleports you to Xen whenever you want. Whilst this is all completely awesome, it's difficult to find ammo for every single weapon...so quite often I just found myself using the old Half-Life weapons and only occasionally whipping out the new rocket launcher to deal with those massive aliens. I suppose this is a good thing, since a lot of the new weapons are ridiculously overpowered - but then so are the new enemies.\n\nBoth an advantage and disadvantage with the game is that there is no difficulty setting (at the time of writing). Couple this with the fact that the last chapter has a habit of throwing a boss monster at you in every room and your going to die a lot. I spent the last hour of the game never having any more than 50 health...and it was one of the most tense experiences I've had in a FPS.\n\nThis is a very different game to Half-Life. As of yet, the events of this game aren't in canon with the Half-Life series (unlike Blue Shift) so this isn't an essential game. But if your a fan of old school shooters then you'll definitely have a good time.\n\nOh - and this game has one of the best tutorials in gaming history. I'm serious. Play it and see for yourself...","July 4, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The latter often work out nicely (i.e. the Portal Gun that lets you go back to Xen to stock up on health and energy, or the Barnacle Gun that serves as a grappling hook of sorts), while others could have used some polish - the rope climbing mechanic feels very akward, and the AI of the small squad you're occasionally put in charge of is nothing short of suicidal. And since you actually are part of the HECU unit you would normally fight, the standard enemy soldier now is replaced by some mysterious Black Ops that works exactly the same - not exactly a creative solution. Finally, the End Boss doesn't deserve the name (admittedly, Blue Shift had no End Boss at all, but its still a shame seeing how cool the battle against HL1's Nihilanth was).\nDespite of these flaws, Opposing Force still is a fantastic FPS, with a broad arsenal of interesting weapons, challenging enemies (I'm looking at you, Ninja Girls) and a wide range of environments ranging from the laboratories and deeper maintenance shafts of Black Mesa to ruined surface areas and finally the strange world of Xen.","July 5, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Excellent setting, poor visuals, adequate gameplay. The main difference is the point of view, and the fact OF is significantly shorter. However, you also get to do more of the same things, running around on rail, which is always fun ; killing Black Ops, which is always satisfying. But you also get to use a grapple hook and shoot with mortars at some point ! Meanwhile the narrative is quite nicely connected with that of the original and it manages to still be very fresh story wise with a nicely executed POV shift that also asks for alot more cooperation with NPCs.

Now with the gameplay, the controls work preety well and very responsive, the level design is good but sometimes it lacks of health kit and the game saves as you enter in a new loading spot keeping your current health so that's mean if you enter a room with 10 health and suddelly 5 enemys appear in front of you (like most of the times does) you'll die and respawn with 10 health and the enemys will appear and kill you, that happend alot of times to me, but I managed to finish those parts [/spoiler] with some help of sv_cheats 1 [/spoiler]. The A.I of the HUMAN enemys is good, they hide in corners, run away from you, but the aliens/zombies just run into you no matter what.

Personally, if Opposing Force had been released as a seperate timeline sequel, I feel it would have done alright in its own regard. It's also nice to see that Opposing Force is a very clever name in my view - an "opposing force" in military terms is a force tasked with representing the enemy - suggesting quite aptly that Sheppard is not the enemy, but merely plays that role. Opposing force is also an element of physics, specific to acceleration.\n\nAll in all, worth a play, but I wouldn't hype it as "better" than the original.","June 28, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also think the one BIG flaw in this game is your own squadmate's AI... it's very bad, but if you get past that this is still just as amazing as the original HL. There are a few single player mods out there for opposing force, if you LOVE nostalgia then you'll want to check out the Op4CTF gamemode.

HL was a narrative-based, immersive FPS where you roleplayed as a scientist fleeing a research facility in the middle of New Mexico.\n\nOpposing Force is an unofficial Quake sequel where, armed to the teeth, you're a marine kicking some alien ♥♥♥. And if this is actually a Quake sequel, then its the best Quake game ever made.\n\nWhat it lacks in story, it compensates for with amazingly fun gameplay. The variety of enemies you fight and weapons you fight them with is overwhelming. You begin battling against headcrabs and zombies and Vortigants...but then a new batch of aliens emerge and you get 'advanced' zombies, zombies that shoot lighting, strange fish-like creatures that shoot shark-teeth, and aliens over three times your size.\n\nAs well as most of the weapons from Half-Life, you get two melee weapons (a Bioshock-style wrench and a knife) a new pistol, a new machine gun, a laser gun, a sniper rifle, an alien rocket launcher, a barnacle you can mount on your hand, and a gun that teleports you to Xen whenever you want. Whilst this is all completely awesome, it's difficult to find ammo for every single weapon...so quite often I just found myself using the old Half-Life weapons and only occasionally whipping out the new rocket launcher to deal with those massive aliens. I suppose this is a good thing, since a lot of the new weapons are ridiculously overpowered - but then so are the new enemies.\n\nBoth an advantage and disadvantage with the game is that there is no difficulty setting (at the time of writing). Couple this with the fact that the last chapter has a habit of throwing a boss monster at you in every room and your going to die a lot. I spent the last hour of the game never having any more than 50 health...and it was one of the most tense experiences I've had in a FPS.\n\nThis is a very different game to Half-Life. As of yet, the events of this game aren't in canon with the Half-Life series (unlike Blue Shift) so this isn't an essential game. But if your a fan of old school shooters then you'll definitely have a good time.\n\nOh - and this game has one of the best tutorials in gaming history. I'm serious.

The latter often work out nicely (i.e. the Portal Gun that lets you go back to Xen to stock up on health and energy, or the Barnacle Gun that serves as a grappling hook of sorts), while others could have used some polish - the rope climbing mechanic feels very akward, and the AI of the small squad you're occasionally put in charge of is nothing short of suicidal. And since you actually are part of the HECU unit you would normally fight, the standard enemy soldier now is replaced by some mysterious Black Ops that works exactly the same - not exactly a creative solution. Finally, the End Boss doesn't deserve the name (admittedly, Blue Shift had no End Boss at all, but its still a shame seeing how cool the battle against HL1's Nihilanth was).\nDespite of these flaws, Opposing Force still is a fantastic FPS, with a broad arsenal of interesting weapons, challenging enemies (I'm looking at you, Ninja Girls) and a wide range of environments ranging from the laboratories and deeper maintenance shafts of Black Mesa to ruined surface areas and finally the strange world of Xen.","July 5, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very good because it adds new enemies, new weapons and has lots of little crossovers between this game and the original Half-Life. It really is a pleasure to play but this game obviously didn't go through a lot of playtesting. You notice that very often when the game gets hard and never becomes easy again. There is a constant pressure on you and if you don't have a lot of health you constantly die and in extreme cases rage quit.\n\nAnd I think thats quite sad... This game has so much potential and I really hope that Tripmine Studios balances their Opposing Force remake "Operation: Black Mesa" more and eases the gameplay a bit.\n\nMy final thoughts are that you should buy this game only if you don't start yelling at your screen after you died multiple times at the same point. Otherwise I sadly have to tell you to keep your hands off this game.\n\nThis review is based on my own experiences, yours may vary","July 27, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mainly loved the new weapons that were added,like being able to use a barnacle as a weapon was amazing. It also added some question with valve if shepard may a new character if half life 3 comes out but thats for valve to deicide. I'd say that this game is a giant expansion for all half life fans to try if they haven't already. I put this game at 10/10. This game never made me bored and being able to control a squad of soliders was an increadibly amazing part in this game. The final boss in this game was amazing since i never expected to see a giant monster come out of a portal,and when i mean giant i mean GIANT! I'v played all the half life games i think the most disapointing one was Half-Life Blue Shift. First the cons were that it was a cool experience to be a security guard in black mesa fighting your way out from aliens.But I didn't see any new features to the game. The ending was you...Well i don't want to spoil it if you were going to buy blue shift. So i would recommend buying all the games and perhaps blue shift if you want the experience of being the one that helps gordon on the way to getting through black mesa.Overall opposing force is an amazing game and you should buy it if you're a half life fan.","June 3, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Opposing Force is a great expansion to Half Life 1. It takes a different approch on the Half Life series. By making you a soldier for the United States Marines by the name of Adrian Shepard. You have been detached to the Black Mesa research facilty to rescue the scientists and deal with the alien problem. Though not everything goes as planed. When the government sends a strike team to kill everyone at Black mesa including you and your fellow marines. The story is very compeling in this game really wanted to know what the hell was going on and why this was happening and as you discover more things about the story it makes it even more enjoyable. The gameplay is great to it is basicly the same as Half Life 1 so it's pretty good on it's own right. There are less puzzles so if you liked Half Life but got sick of puzzles you should get this. Another good factor of the game is it's weapon varitey, and holy ♥♥♥♥ there are so many like the Barnicle gun being my personal favorite. One more thing that made this game excellent was it's length, for an  expansion its long it could very well be a hole other game which is good so you get more for what you payed for. Unlike other Half Life expansions such as blue shift, you get a good game but it feels very short and could have had more potential. over all though Opposing Force is a great expansion and I recomended it to new Half Life fans or any FPS fans aswell. My final verdict is a 10/10 Awesome ♥♥♥ Game!","May 18, 2014","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have the medic who can heal you and your allies, the engineer who can cut through inaccessable areas and your standard infantry solider who helps you during firefights. The friendly AI is quite rudimentary and you will often witness your allies wandering out into the open and getting cut down by enemies.\n\nThe enemies you face are similar to those in Half-Life but with a few interesting additions. The aliens you face are more varied as are the weapons you can use to take them down. Opposing Force features some of the most imaginative weapons you can encounter in a first person shooter, from the gun that can teleport you, or your enemies, to destinations unknown to the grenade launcher that is actually a small alien that you feed explosive food to.\n\nOpposing Force is a great expansion pack, building on the world established in Half-Life and allowing the player to experience a familiar setting in a different light.","May 6, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Personally, if Opposing Force had been released as a seperate timeline sequel, I feel it would have done alright in its own regard. It's also nice to see that Opposing Force is a very clever name in my view - an "opposing force" in military terms is a force tasked with representing the enemy - suggesting quite aptly that Sheppard is not the enemy, but merely plays that role.

You have the medic who can heal you and your allies, the engineer who can cut through inaccessable areas and your standard infantry solider who helps you during firefights. The friendly AI is quite rudimentary and you will often witness your allies wandering out into the open and getting cut down by enemies.\n\nThe enemies you face are similar to those in Half-Life but with a few interesting additions. The aliens you face are more varied as are the weapons you can use to take them down. Opposing Force features some of the most imaginative weapons you can encounter in a first person shooter, from the gun that can teleport you, or your enemies, to destinations unknown to the grenade launcher that is actually a small alien that you feed explosive food to.\n\nOpposing Force is a great expansion pack, building on the world established in Half-Life and allowing the player to experience a familiar setting in a different light.","May 6, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's not a bad thing either, most of Half-Life was puzzle solving and platforming whereas this is more along the lines of heavy duty survival and combat. The later levels manage to get especially nasty while still finding a nice balance between tactical but still fun.\n\nThe new weapon ideas that OF offered were hit and miss though, the SAW & Desert Eagle are neat additions whereas the alien guns were iffy and largely boring. Similarly, the barnacle grappling system and the squad system really should've been more refined, they were awesome when they worked right...sadly that just wasn't too often. Although, the new aliens definitely rounded out for a altogether fresh experience, I especially liked how the story that tied into the original so well while avoiding being a total retread.

If you played Half-Life 1 and enjoyed it, OpFor delivers an intense, well-paced experience, and adds a lot more to the game. Playing through the Black Mesa Incident as the military is an interesting perspective, and adds to the complex lore of the Half-Life world. It leaves more questions than answers, as Half-Life games tend to do, which is a good thing. OpFor feels very different from the main game, and plays very different too. A lot of new weapons have been added, and although some are just reskinned versions of old weapons, the weapons here feel more militaristic than Gordon Freeman's patched together arsenal of stolen guns and scientific experiments. OpFor offers a lot of new content to Half-Life 1, and is an amazing experience for anyone who enjoyed the first game.","January 20, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once again your stuck in Black Mesa, sent by the government to investigate the Black Mesa research facility, and to find and capture Gordon Freeman. Except now with newer weapons, newer music, and newer characters (models). Not to mention a few newer enemies.
