"http://steamcommunity.com/id/patrunjelu/recommended/289360/","patrunjelu","Alex M.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/patrunjelu/","760 products in account","Whether or not you will enjoy Konung 2 and any other games in the series depends on how you will make your approach. If you're expecting an oldschool RPG ready to smash Baldur's Gate out of its place, you'll be very disappointed. If, however, you apporach it as if it was a low budget indie RPG made by enthusiastic people, you'll begin to see things that high expectations would not allow you to.\n\nThe Konung games are pretty old and low budget titles. They're not terribly great from a functionality POV and they're not really great from the perspective of writing either.\n\nHowever, there aren't many RPGs with a Scandinavian theme, so if you want some of the specific legends and motifs packed into a game, Konung's your best bet. There are also some extra and unique gameplay elements, like village management, that you can hardly see in other RPGs.\n\nAt the end of the day, I do recommend the game(s) to everyone, with the warning that they may not become favorites anytime soon. Be ready to get used to some clunky controls, in exchange for a very original setting, well made art and fascinating enemies.\n\nFinally, don't pay much attention to the low review scores you find on Metacritic. The game barely got reviewed enough anyway. If you really feel like not taking a risk, just wait for a discount. Hopefully, the game sells at least enough for the publishers to consider adding Konung 1 to Steam. I'd really like to play that one again.\n\n\n**** TIP! To make sure you don't abandon the game because it feels unfair ****\nKonung 2 is not a terribly hard game but it's not an easy game either. Its difficulty can strike at you in many forms, from having to deal with a very powerful enemy to not being able to raise enough money to get yourself healed. If you want a nice introduction to the game, choose Ratibor as starting character. You will get two extra party members which will make battles easy and a nice sum of gold to start with. The starting stats are great too. The forests near the village will make you fight some easy enemies which will be enough  of a battle tutorial. Most importantly, you'll already be a konung of your village, so you'll get free healing and item repairs, and the chance to build stuff around.","May 17, 2014","true","0.8"," 95 of 99 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","95","99","0","3"

I've been playing RPGs for over 20 years. It is my favorite genre of games. That said, Konung 2 is a bit of a mix between a simulation and an RPG.\n\nDon't get me wrong. There are plenty of RPG elements to sink your teeth into here. There are 6 unique heroes with their own backgrounds and stats, stats to customize upon leveling up, a bunch of skills that impact gameplay in different ways, inventory management for every member of your party (yes, it is party-based. You can have up to 8 other characters join your cause.), magical items to find and an extensive loot system, a bunch of side quests, treasure hunting, a bunch of maps to explore and more! It's a very meaty RPG if that's what you're looking for.\n\nAs for the simulation side, it's well done in that aspect as well. You control various villages and can build them as you see fit. You can collect tributes from the villages, build blacksmith forges, shipyards, a barracks, etc. You can find people to work these jobs and they will do them based on their various skills. Eventually you want to build up some strong villages so you can recruit some fit warriors to help your cause.\n\nOverall, this game is a hidden gem. I'm very surprised it's as good as it is, given there is little information about it online.\n\nOh, one final thing. Do not play this game if you want fast-paced action. This game takes a high level of patience to get the most out of. You won't be slaying hordes of enemies right from the start. You've really got to spend some time to work your way up the ladder to become a respectable hero and leader of men. In my 11 hours, I've barely killed anything, that's how challenging the game is thus far. But I've still loved every minute.\n\nHighly recommended for something a bit different and for lovers of RPGs.","July 22, 2014","true","36.8"," 48 of 49 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","48","49","0","0"

But if you would never save scum or abuse bugs or anything like that I think the game might be quite enjoyable.","September 30, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It's an open RPG with a little bit of unit management.\nThe game is pretty complicated with lots of unorthodox  features.\nYet the devs decided not to include a tutorial whatsoever, leading to players fumbling around inside the game.\n\nThe funny thing is that the first game has a pretty comprehensive tutorial.\n\nKonung 2 is an open game. You can go wherever you want and do whatever you want.\nDo some quests? Or killing monsters or maybe even killing all of the villagers.\nAnother aspect of the game is you can own a couple of villages and by doing so you can earn money from daily tributes.\n\nYou can also make you villagers to be stronger by dispatching one of your characters as a trainer to train them or as a blacksmith to make the villagers have better equipment.\nYou can train them up to trainer's level + 1. So you also have to train your "trainer" lol.\n\nThis is because your enemy will constantly sending a raid party to attack your villages.\nSo they have to be able to protect themselves lest they become occupied by the enemy.\nAll NPC on an occupied village will not interact with you. And you will also be attacked by enemies patrol as they see you. But you can free them by killing every enemy's patrol on the village.\n\nNow onward to battles.\nBattle in this game is very hard. The enemies always swarming together so you have to make a big party of your own to fight them on event ground.\nThe lowest enemies levels i've seen is 5. so before you can fight them you will also need to level up a couple of times via doing quests too.\n\nThe bad news is Exp from completing a quest will only be granted to your Main Character. Any other characters have to earn it via battles.\nAnd even worse Exp in battles only given to THE CHARACTER THAT DEALT THE FINISHING BLOW. Making leveling a chore.\nThe worst is the enemy raiding party is also getting stronger. And they are getting stronger very fast. Faster than you.\n\nSo you will soon face a situation where you can't protect any of your villages at all. Bad game design.\n\nI like this game. Well i like grindy game in general. But it's hard to recommend this game. Espescially to casual players.\nThere are lots of conter intuitive features and bad game design. Musics are mediocre, towns are boring,\nNPCs totally useless saying the same thing over and over.\nBattle are unbalanced and you can't do tactical pause like say Baldur's Gate.\nControlling 9 characters in a real time combat can be pretty chaotic you know.\n\nThis game has cool concept but bad execution and overall i'd say to stay away from this game unless you know what you are expecting : One hell of a challenging game but very unbalanced and involves alot of grinding.","October 26, 2015","false","32.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I bought it because i really like oldschool RPGs but Konung 2 it's to slow for me, and there's not any map of locations. Another things are encounters, sometime you fight with spiders witch is simple and in next encounter you meet dragons even if you are level 1. It's make the game more difficult than it should be. And the characters are kind of boring, but I shouldn't expect anything like in BG.\n\nHowever game have some "pros": 6 characters with different begins is cool! And the thing with village management was good idea, but could be done better. And the world, I think it was quite big.\n\nMaybe it's just not RPG for me, or maybe they should make somethings better, but i wasn't enjoying when I was playing :/","June 23, 2015","false","6.9"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","8","24","0","0"
