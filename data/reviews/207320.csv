It has my favorite combat system and Adol is your playable character for this Ys game. I love a good challenge and this is the most challenging game in the Ys series. Many people won't ever complete it on Normal difficulty (you can choose an easier difficulty though). The boss battles in this game are extremely challenging, yet not cheap in the slightest. You need to learn how to dodge all enemy attacks and you will feel great about doing it with this fantastic combat system.\n\nTheres nothing special about the storyline or graphics in this game, its obvious that everything was spent on developing the combat system and boss battles. You have a main town that you visit for supplies and forging new equipment, while traveling the world for new dungeons to explore. Theres lots of secrets, upgrades and new abilities to find throughout the game. Theres also some small sidequests you can complete for achievements and other rewards.\n\nThe game will last you around 15 hours and you unlock a Boss Rush aftering completing the game. If you like action RPGs, this is a must buy.","May 4, 2014","true","37.7"," 60 of 62 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","60","62","0","1"

Before I broke down and bought it I stared at its gameplay video in steam. I stalked the title for months on end. I was delighted to see a JRPG on Steam. Would my delight be broken, or would I take the oath and never look back?\n\nFirst off I must say I played this game to completion with a gamepad. I never even once tested out the keyboard ad mouse controls. This type of game just screamed use a controller to me haha. The game controls perfectly with a gamepad. Every little command I used worked, and never were the controls broken. A++ on that.\n\nSound design in Ys is all about the music. The sound effects are very basic and serve the game well, but do not stand out at all. The musical score on the other hand does stand out. Each piece was moving, and the guitar driven battle themes fit perfectly. Never once did I feel like I wanted to put on my own soundtrack while playing the game. If it's any testament to the games music, I would even go into the options menu just to play the games soundtrack a few occasions.\n\nThe story of the game is its weakest area. The game uses nearly every JRPG trope. I knew of every upcoming plot twist and action. This made me really sad as someone who enjoys a good narrative. I must admit though that not once did the narrative become convoluted. It served its purpous rather well, and that was to transition from dungeon to dungeon and the awesomely addicting gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay of Ys is where it's at. A simple mixture of semi strategic hack n slash with a dabble of platforming and RPG light elements. Combat is fast, fluid and when you get hit it's ultimately you're fault. The game doesn't offer that much in terms of different combos. You can perform only basic ground and air combos. You can't knock an enemy into the air and combo them further. What you can do is cancel combos to get in more hits. There are 3 magic in the game, but playing on normal I didn't find much use for them. The most useful if magics is the earth dash as it nullifies enemy attacks. Once you get this magic it'll be you're go to magic. This is because the game doesn't feature a shield or dodge roll which some may find annoying, but I understood it as part of the game.\n\nLevel design is simplistic and yet very well done. That being said, there are a few areas where you can enter a new screen keep holding the same direction, and move yourself back into the previous area. It's a personal annoyance to me. These areas are few and far between so it's not that big of a deal. The platforming segents mainly located towards the end of the game are well thought out. I initially believed I was going to have trouble with them until I realised your character shadow does appear on the ground. This way you could at least tell where you might land. For people who fear platforming there is a mode in options to make it even easier, and even at that there no fall related deaths in the game.\n\nThe bosses are where the game really shines. Each boss fight presents a new challenge and build upon eachother as the game progresses. You're first time playing the game the bosses will kick your ♥♥♥, unless you're an uber-gamer, don't get discouraged. Their attacks hit hard, and require precise timing to dodge. There is also limited time to hit the bosses. That window becomes less and less as the game goes on forcing you to get better with your attack dodging. This type of progression is saught after by me, because no matter how much someone could power level, you still need the skill to back it up. Speaking of leveling in this game, I didn't have to grind more than one time, and the combat is so fluid and fun it didn't even feel like grinding and lasted all of thirty minutes anyways.\n\nYs: The Oath in Felghana isn't an expierence I'll soon forget. Nearly all elements of the game blend harmoniously into a polished hidden gem just waiting to be stumbled upon. I thought I was risking $15 paying full price for the game, but my apprehension was laid to rest quickly.","November 25, 2013","true","17.4"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","60","68","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/207320/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","Ys games are all action RPGs where you control one character (usually Adol, though Origins has no Adol and I think Seven has multiple character options?) against the world in a story-moderate environment. (moderate compared to Falcom's other RPG series, Legend of Heroes) Grinding is generally expected to some extent, but that'll only ease the pain so far -- especially as you get to the end bosses. They're also known for their amazing rock/metal soundtracks.\n\nAs for this particular Ys game...one word: Brutal.\n\nI've played Origin, I & II, and VI on Steam and this one still annihilates me...on NORMAL. What separates most of the difficulties is simply damage caused by enemies and enemy health, and the enemy patterns can be difficult to make out after your first 10 or so attempts at a particular boss. Just a fair warning -- you need to be in the zone while playing to stand a chance...or you just need to be better than this reviewer.\n\nAside from that, it's a loose remake of Ys III, the one "platformer" of the series and as such, this one has a lot of platforming elements. Thanks to the fixed camera, though, the 3d platforming is pretty simple and straightforward.\n\nOne disappointment worth noting: Some PSP features like New Game+ (which itself was very minor) and refining gear up to level 9 are gone from this port. Seems strange, especially since the achievements beg "replay", but it's not anywhere near a deal breaker.","November 9, 2015","true","18.2"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","30","31","7","0"

An excellent game where it's polished for the highest difficulty. Nothing is as satisfying as struggling through this game on Hard, then coming back to play on Inferno and see that everything has become harder (while not being unfair) but so did I, and it was manageable. There are more than a dozen bosses in the game and there's like 1-2 bosses that's actually feel obnoxious. Also the kickass music, great level design and a lot of other things just flow so well together.\n\nIf you want to choose between this and Ys: Origin, I'd recommend this. Origin has more things (3 characters) and more stuff to do with, but some of its bosses have healing abilities and pretty much you to mash buttons constantly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/207320/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Adol Christin has wandered back into our living rooms with a familiar tale: The Oath in Felghana is a full-fledged remake of Wanderers From Ys. And, when I say "full-fledged," I really mean it. From the storyline, sound, gameplay and graphics, every aspect of the original game has been completely enhanced. The result is an experience far more ambitious than Wanderers From Ys, the most commonly criticized installment of the series, would have ever dreamed of becoming.\n\nIn terms of storyline, Wanderers From Ys was relatively simple and straight-forward. After the complete liberation of Esteria and Ys (as observed in Ys Books I and II), Adol and Dogi decide to visit the Town of Redmont, Dogi’s hometown. Upon their arrival, they realize that, gasp, the land has been overrun by monsters. The two heroes meet up with Elena Stoddart, a childhood friend, who eagerly explains the recent events. To further complicate the situation, the local mayor has been kidnapped, and Elena’s brother, Chester Stoddart, has abandoned the town. Since becoming knighted in the service of King McGuire and Valestine Castle, his demeanor has changed, and the general public suspects that he’s become involved in something sinister. And, naturally, what could be more sinister than the resurrection of an ancient god of destruction? Thankfully, The Oath in Felghana completely expands upon this old storyline, fleshing out each of the classic characters, adding new ones, and seamlessly weaving each into the tale.\n\nAs expected, The Oath in Felghana shines in the gameplay department. Those who have played Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim will easily recognize similarities. Adol hacks and slashes a bloody swath through countless monsters, always with speed and precision. Oath, however, introduces a new 'combo meter' which serves as an experience multiplier; for each successful hit, the meter rises and an experience bonus is granted. This bonus can climb as high as 1.99x the original experience granted from defeating an enemy, resulting in nearly double experience. If the chain breaks, however, the bonus is reset to 1.00x. Interestingly, Adol is no longer able to use/stock healing items; rather, enemies drop them in battle and provide instant recovery. In addition to healing items, enemies also drop Strength, Defense, and Magic Potions which provide temporary enhancements to the respective traits. Similar to the combo meter, these have a timer attached, so defeating enemies quickly is the key to maximizing their benefits. Adol also has a "Boost" feature at his disposal; after having dispatched a certain number of enemies, he will be granted the ability to Boost, which provides a temporary increase in attack speed. As you can see, speed and accuracy are the keys to success.\n\nAside from combat, Wanderers From Ys' equipment system has been subject to revisions as well. The infamous 'Five Magic Rings' have been replaced with 'Three Magic Bracelets.' Each bracelet grants an elemental power, one of Fire, Wind, or Earth. In addition to being useful in battle, utilizing the power of these bracelets becomes simply indispensable when searching for many of the game’s secrets. The Fire Bracelet allows our hero to light torches and melt ice. The Wind Bracelet allows him to whirlwind over large gaps, and otherwise impossible jumps. The Earth Bracelet allows him to break walls and other natural barriers. You can also switch between these abilities on the fly; it becomes an essential element of success in many of the game’s more challenging boss battles. Aside from bracelets, Adol is also able to purchase new swords, armors, and shields. These can be statistically enhanced by delivering them to Adonis, the town blacksmith, who will customize them using rare crystals known as Ravals. Early in the game, Ravals are fairly hard to come by, but enemies drop them semi-frequently in the last two dungeons.\n\nBut, does it have replay value? Tons of it. How about two unlockable difficulty modes, Hard and Nightmare? How about Boss Rush? Those who have completed Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim will be quite familiar with this time attack mode, which allows the player to consecutively battle against all of the game's bosses. And how about the countless side quests and hidden items, such as the War God’s Talisman and the Augite Brooch? There’s always something to do, especially for completionists, who will be hard-pressed to unearth every secret on their first time through.\n\nFinally, in case it wasn’t obvious: Sound - 100%. That’s right, absolute perfection. Ys: The Oath in Felghana has, quite possibly, the most amazing soundtrack in the history of video games. There are no audio issues or ‘filler tracks’ to speak of. They’ve managed to take an already superb soundtrack and make it even more awesome. Each track, exceptionally remixed from the original compositions in Wanderers From Ys, simply rocks. In particular, "Valestine Castle" stands out among the crowd. In true Soundteam JDK fashion, it is exceptionally heavy on the electric guitars and more-than-competently weave in the perfect amount of synth. Speaking directly to fellow fans of their music, I never would have thought that any version of Valestine Castle could overcome/surpass JDK Band 1... I was sorely mistaken. In fact, it’s difficult for me to navigate through the castle at times; when the solo at 2:02 kicks in, I can’t seem to avoid setting the controller down, closing my eyes, and allowing myself to become entranced by the music. It’s that good.\n\nYs: The Oath in Felghana is a remarkable remake which never cuts corners. It’s the best remake ever produced. It’s (debatably) the best installment of the Ys Series ever produced. And it receives my absolute highest recommendation.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 17, 2014","true","65.9"," 34 of 45 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","34","45","3","0"

It is the third game in the Ys series, and a remake of the original Ys III. While the original Ys III was a good game in its own right, it was also a flawed game in many ways (don't take that to mean it wasn't a heck of a lot of fun). Oath in Felghana not only rectifies every flaw of the original, it also improves upon Ys III in every way, all while remaining faithful to the core essence of what made Ys III such a fun and memorable game.\n\nPros:\n- Phenomenal soundtrack\n- Great battle mechanics\n- Unique boss fights\n- One of the best Ys stories\n\nCons:\n- The beginning feels a bit slow\n- (No Volcano)\n- No easy way to access bonus bosses (even if you beat them)\n\nA distinguishing feature of all Ys games is outstanding music, and this is true even for the original Ys III. In Oath in Felghana, the music has been upgraded to entirely new levels of awesome. If the soundtrack was the only good thing about this game, I'd still recommend it at full price. Fortunately for us, the music comes with an awesome game as well.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics of Felghana are some of the best, with controls that are tight and very refined. There are difficulty settings for every kind of player, be they casual or hardcore. Regardless of setting, the game is very encouraging of exploration, but for any difficulty above easy, it's loaded with intense action. Even some strategy comes into play concerning certain enemies and scenarios. Boss fights are varied and unique, and each boss requires a different method in order to defeat them. At higher difficulty levels, boss fights can be very challenging. While there is a random luck factor, for the most part, beating the bosses is a little bit of know-how accompanied by pure mad-skills (and it's very satisfying once you beat them).\n\nOath in Felghana is a bit of an oddball in regards to story. Most Ys games begin with Adol washed ashore after some great struggle. Here, Adol leisurely sails into Felghana with his long-time friend Dogi. Most Ys games feel epic and grand from the get-go. Oath in Felghana feels like a sidestory you could skip over (you’ll regret it if you do though).\n\nThe story has a pace that is uniquely its own, and VERY different from any other Ys game (that I’ve played at least). It ends on a powerful note, but it takes its time getting there (despite being a surprisingly short game). Even though it feels slow, there is always a driving energy that pushes the story forward; you can always feel the hidden danger, even if you don’t fully understand it. And when the story finally hits the turning point, everything comes together perfectly, leading to one of the most powerful moments in any Ys game.\n\nYs stories have depth, but they go by so fast that you may miss some of the more thought provoking themes and ideas being explored. Oath in Felghana, in particular, is an exploration of human weakness. The theme is explored through several characters, all of them strong individuals. And all of them having fallen to human weakness. That said, it is not just the strengths or failures of these characters that make them, in particular, so interesting.\n\nLike the game itself, the story doesn’t give any answers; it shows you what you need to know, and leaves the rest to you.\n\nWhile the slow pace of the game is one of its good points (it matches perfectly with Dogi returning home to family), it has the consequence of making the beginning feel too slow. This is because the beginning isn't interactive enough to offset the slow pace. More interaction means more immersion; experiencing rather than watching.\n\nIf you've had the opportunity to play the original Ys III, then you might remember the Volcano in the background of the Illburns Ruins. And it was AWESOME! I know this isn't really a 'negative' per say, and the Felghana version of the Illburns Ruins is clearly amazing without it. But... this should have made it into Felghana because it was just that cool.\n\nWhile more of an annoyance than anything, there is no easy way to access the bonus bosses, even if you've beaten them before. It would be nice to have a means by which to easily access the two bosses once you've unlocked them. What makes this more annoying is that the bosses are quite fun and challenging, and not deserving of such obscurity.\n\nOath in Felghana is available for both the PC and the PSP. The PC version is, decidedly, visually superior to the PSP version. However, the PSP version has some exclusive content that should not be overlooked.\n\nPSP Exclusives:\n- Voice Acting: While mediocre (sometimes hilarious), it definitely has its own unique charm. And for the most part, I liked it. Unfortunately, the voice acting choices made for the final boss destroyed the atmosphere; it gave the boss more ‘human’ qualities (made it less monstrous) when it should have done the opposite.\n- PSP Version is More Forgiving: Double Boost (regenerates health after boost), Room Retry (retry in the room you died in), Retry Boss at a Lower Difficulty.\n- Selectable Soundtrack: You can choose between the Oath in Felghana Soundtrack or the Original Ys III Soundtrack.\n- Inferno Time Attack: With double boost, this is probably about the equivalent of Nightmare Time Attack for the PC version. By the way, am I the only one who things Inferno Time Attack should be added to the PC version?\n- Easier Access to Bonus Bosses: (Random Eye Twitch).\n- Museum: This is a collection of unlockable art for the game (not unlike the Ys VI Materials Collection).\n- Prologue Novella: As it turns out, the manuals for the Ys games included a Prologue to the main story. I actually think the Ys prologues should be included with their respective games is all cases (even if it’s as a PDF in the game folder) since they are a part of Ys lore.\n\nWhile the PSP version decidedly has some nice exclusives, I don’t believe it has anything that makes it ‘superior’ to the PC edition. Both is an excellent choice (I might be evil).\n\nOath in Felghana is a phenomenal game. It is so polished and well executed that it is easilly one of the best action RPGs on Steam.","December 17, 2014","true","127.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

It's a hack and slash rpg where you slay monsters and kill tough bosses to progress through the entire game. I liked Oath in Felghana because after playing Ys Chronicles, the game remains true to the series even if you can't bump into enemies anymore. So what did I think about it? Lets see...\n\nGraphics: This game is a port from the PSP version that was released a few years ago. I liked how Oath of Felghana now has 3d backgrounds or monsters but still maintains a 2d layout. The sprites look nice if you set your graphics to the highest, but I personally think they are simple. I still find the game to great, even with it's cutscenes which look decent but could be better.\n\nSound: I really thought the sound department went forth and had fun making the music. There are good songs, but I just don't find myself to play over and over again. Sound effects are pretty basic, but I don't think that matters. There was never a moment where I just wanted to put my own music to the game which is a plus in my own opinion.\n\nGameplay: If you played Ys Chronicles, you realize that you can't bump into enemies like you used to for exp. There's now an attack button which can be used to string combos to gain exp. What I find the most rewarding is the three magics you obtain in the game. My favorite is probably the wind power since you use it to get to treasures and to another section of the level. If there is one thing I really enjoyed the most are the bosses. Playing on past normal is a challenge as it requires you to be quick about your actions and for you to time your attacks. The game is hard if you're not leveled correctly but it doesn't take you long to be strong enough to take on a boss.\n\nOverall: I consider Ys: The Oath in Felghana a great purchase if you enjoy J-rpgs that aren't complex, yet easy to play but difficult to master. I think falcom did great with this remake because it adds a new chapter in the Ys storyline for American audiences and it is faithful to the first two Ys games in the series.","February 17, 2014","true","7.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

As much my thirteen year old self would hate to hear this, I'm not the gamer that I used to be. Fifteen years later, now an adult with a full time job, I don't have the devotion for gaming as much as I used to have. This game though allowed me to relive my experience of those days where I would stay up to the early hours of the morning, not at all concerned with sleep or the work that I had to be at in a few hours time.\n\nI had recently picked this up on a sale. As it looked intriguing and was 75% off, I figured that I would give it a go. Going from its Metacritic store, I figured that it would be a 'Meh' kind of game. How wrong was I. This was easily the most enjoyment I've gotten out of a game this year.\n\nEnough rambling, on with the review.\n\nThis is an action-RPG with a very satisfying combat system. Within minutes of starting, you're quickly thrown into it. Although the game has a story, a fairly good one at that, you won't be clicking through endless amounts of dull dialogue before you get to the action.\n\nIt's great fun as you run from screen to screen cutting down the monsters that face you. Although there is no way to heal on demand, when I first started playing, I didn't find this to be very challenging even on the normal difficulty, but it was still very satisfying.\n\nWhen I reached the game's first boss, I got my ♥♥♥♥ handed to me, several times over. Here I initially thought that the game wasn't balanced properly. After a character level and learning the boss's patterns, I was finally able to get pass it, barely.\n\nThis is where that game's core challenge comes from; boss battles. Difficult but I wouldn't call them unfair. Once you're able to defeat them, you're bound to be able to repeat it. The game doesn't factor in luck much. It's a very rewarding experience to get through them.\n\nIn terms of playtime, it took me a little under 14.5 hours. I'm a gamer who tries to I try to find everything I can so it could probably be finished a lot quicker. In fact, there's an achievement to finish it in five hours or less. Could be completed over a weekend, or two in my case. To me, the length was just right, not too long nor too short.\n\nOnce completed, a boss battle mode is unlocked, and the game has five difficulty levels so it has some replayability. There's a number of side quests as well, some of which I somehow had missed so I'll be replaying it.\n\nThe game has a great soundtrack. Normally I'm not one to even notice this unless it's really good which I'm pleased to state is the case here.\n\nI found the story to be better then the average JRPG. This is helped greatly with the range of characters, none of which are nameless or a palette swap of another, which are great contrasts to each other. The weakest would be protagonist who doesn't utter a word, with only a narrator describing his actions.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that for those who buy this, take a look at the forums as someone was able to extract the voices, which are only found in the PSP version of the game, working on this version which greatly adds to the game's atmosphere. It would be good if they're included by default though. Hopefully they'll be patched in in future.\n\nWith all the praise, it's not without its flaws though. This may not apply to the easy difficulty levels but I did spend a bit of time grinding. While cutting down monsters is fun, much more then a turn based RPG, when your EXP bar is rising very slowly, it can become repetitive.\n\nYou're bound to die a number of times on bosses. Mostly while trying to figure out their patterns and then some more after that. At times, I needed to take a break from this as it was becoming frustrating. On the other hand though, once you do get through them, it's very gratifying.\n\nIt's flaws are minor compared to the overall enjoyment I got from it though. I highly recommend this game.","July 19, 2014","true","17.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

If not, you're looking at a solid, fast-paced (but always manageable) 8-12 hour action RPG, perhaps most easily compared to games like Kingdom Hearts.\n\nAlthough Oath is technically the third game in the Ys series, newcomers can feel comfortable jumping at this point- the game barely references the previous games at all, in fact the only carryover are the two protagonists and all you need to know about them is readily apparent. The story won't shake your world but it's serviceable enough to give Adol an excuse to rampage through the world destroying the entire population of monsters in fluid and satisfying melee combat.\n\nIt's an Ys game, so of course the soundtrack is superb. Lots of noisy high-tempo epic-metal to roll around to, but it never gets obnoxious. Personal favourite is the Valestine Castle theme.\n\nSpeaking personally I preferred Ys Origin and would recommend that one above this, but the truth is they're both solidly built games and it probably just comes down to which you play first is the one you prefer. Many who played both feel Origin bogs itself down with story while Oath is a lot less story-centric and thus more replayable. It depends what you want from your RPG, but you can't go wrong with any of XSEED's superb localisations of Falcom's Ys titles.","November 10, 2014","true","28.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It has its own epic tale to tell, and knowledge of previous events is not required. A fair warning though: if you have never played a Ys game before, start on Easy or Very Easy. I'm not trying to scare you away, but Oath is without a doubt one of the most challenging games to hit the market in recent times. If you choose normal, prepare to die a LOT during the massive boss encounters. That is not to say that the game is cheap or unbalanced, as often tempering your equipment or simply gaining another level will even the playing field. The reward lies in the challenge, and you WILL feel a great sense of accomplishment each time you finally triumph over your foe.\n\nOne way to describe the gameplay in Oath would be to imagine an amped-up Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Add blazing speed and the ability to jump into the mix,  and toss with a heavy dash of well-executed platforming, and you have a hearty recipe for gaming success. Don't just go rushing in headfirst hacking away at your foes with reckless abandon however, the combat in Oath requires a fair bit of strategy. You will have at your disposal three elemental rings, and the powers they bestow upon you are necessary to dispatch your foes with efficiency. Always be on the lookout in hard to reach areas, as you can always find hidden chests containing upgrades and new equipment, as well as the Raval ore needed to temper your gear at the smithy in town.\n\nBack to the topic of combat. The boss encounters in Oath are epic in scale, and they take a fair bit of thinking to overcome. Simply flailing away with reckless abandon is sure to get you killed. Don't be afraid of failure however, if you die in a boss fight you will be given the option to retry as many times as you wish (though beware, dying 10 times to the same boss and the game will mock you with an "achievement"). The key to success is to study the bosses patterns, and use the proper attack for the job. If all else fails you can grind a level or two, or temper your gear as I pointed out before.\n\nIt truly is a grand day for the Steam Community and Ys fans alike now that one of the finest games in the series has hit the platform, and with promises of Ys: Origin on the horizon. Oath will definitely fulfill the wishes of anyone who desires a solid JRPG experience on their PC. With an epic storyline, badass bosses, masterful music, gorgeous graphics, and all around gratuitous gameplay, Ys: The Oath in Felghana does NOT disappoint. With unlockables such as higher difficulties, time attack, and boss rush modes, players will be entertained long after the main story has wrapped up. What are you waiting for? Go get your Ys fix now!","November 25, 2013","true","16.9"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

The game is fun! But it takes too long to get started. There's somewhere around 10-15 minutes from pressing New Game to being let out into the world. Around 4-6 hours into the game, you can get an item that lets you regenerate health if you stand still. This is a needed mechanic, since you're going to have to beat up on a lot of enemies to level up for the boss fights, but standing still is not fun. The game has a 'Boost mode', in which you deal extra damage and take less damage for a limited time, after you fill up a gauge that fills up as you take and deal damage. Why not tie the regenerating health to damage done in boost mode? That would set up a dillema for the player: Do I keep fighting since boost mode is almost full, or do I not take the risk and teleport back to town to heal? Instead, if I find myself in danger after clearing a room, I just stand still for 30 seconds. Somewhere in Falcom, a ball lays on the ground, dropped.\n\nJRPGs get a lot of flack for grinding, and there's plenty here to go around. It's really not that bad, since only monsters that pose a threat give good experience and gold. I died several times while grinding, since I thought I could go just a little more before having to heal. It's a lot more tense and exciting than beating up Rattata outside Pewter City's gym. The story is cliched and filled to the brim with classic JRPG tropes, which I can sort of forgive for a game released in 2005, but I wouldn't hate the Ys series if it took a less serious tone in it's story department, maybe something like Half Minute Hero.\n\nFour out of five Lennys\n( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( )","February 24, 2015","true","15.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","14","20","3","1"

Although I can understand why this is the case; if you want a deep story with well-developed characters in a rich, vibrant world, you're probably better off looking elsewhere. (Or you could read a book.)\n\nHowever, if your cup of tea happens to be runney-jumpey-hackey-slashey-swing-your-swordey-things-get-deadey gameplay where you mow down swarms of monsters, all building up to fights against gargantuan, screen-filling bosses with heavy rock music playing in the background, then you should totally give the Ys series a try. Like I said, they're a lot of fun.\n\nI haven't played all the games in the series, but out of the ones I have played, I feel that The Oath in Felghana is pretty good game to start out with. I & II are fun, but very much showing their age; Seven is a good one also (and was actually my first Ys game), but it's only for PSP. I would actually argue that Origin is better than The Oath in Felghana, but being a prequel, it does have some spoilers for Ys I, and it doesn't have everyone's favorite mute redheaded berserker.\n\nEvery Ys game also comes with multiple difficulty settings, so if you want to let off steam by making everything that looks at you the wrong way your ♥♥♥♥♥, there's Easy and Very Easy. If you like a really good challenge, there's Nightmare and Inferno. And yes, holding down your jump button (at least I think it's the jump button, off the top of my head) speeds up the text scrolling in the cutscenes.\n\nSpeaking of buttons, if you have a USB controller, you're definitely going to want to dust it off; in my opinion, Ys games weren't meant to be played with a keyboard.","May 31, 2013","true","40.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LongTimeNoSiege/recommended/207320/","LongTimeNoSiege","LongTimeNoSiege","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LongTimeNoSiege/","246 products in account","Ys: The Oath in Felghana is a re-imagining of Ys III: Wanderers from Ys, originally released on the NEC PC-8801 in 1989, and it is one of the most finely-crafted action RPGs ever made.  Ys III was the sequel to the classic Ancient Ys Vanished duology, and followed the autobiographical story of the world's most famous adventurer, Adol "The Red" Christin, albeit in a new setting with a plot mostly unrelated to the previous games.  The Oath in Felghana follows the same overall story as the original, but with many additions.  However, the story is not even remotely the focus of the game and while the characters are charming and the plot is by no means awful or unbearable, it's also very barebones, like its predecessors.  The series is well-known for its fantastic music, and The Oath in Felghana is no exception to this.  It has one of the finest soundtracks in the industry, with calm, soothing melodies, fast-paced frenetic orchestral music, and powerful rock themes for the more intense fights.\nYs III's main departure was in the gameplay department, where the top-down "bumper car" combat of the previous games was replaced by a side-scrolling platformer.  This new style was poorly received by series fans for being too clunky and slow in comparison to the older combat style.  The Oath in Felghana completely overhauls the combat and gameplay, to the point where the only real similarity to the original are some side-scrolling-styled segments.\nThe combat in The Oath in Felghana is a drastically improved version of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim's style.  It's a fully 3D action-based combat system that is extremely fast paced and rewards patience, quick reflexes, timing, and the utmost precision over memorization, button mashing, "cheesing," or trial-and-error.  Unlike Ys VI, there are no consumable healing items in The Oath in Felghana.  The only way to restore your health is by touching a save point, using one-time powerups occasionally dropped by enemies, or by leveling up.  You can also restore health while outside dungeons by standing still for an extended period, but it's usually faster to simply run to a save point.  In addition, enemies will sometimes drop powerups that boost your stats temporarily, and keeping on the offensive keeps your combo counter high, giving you bonus experience.  This combination rewards players for keeping a fast tempo through a dungeon, as staying on the offensive levels you more quickly and nets you more stat and health bonuses.  However, during a boss fight, there are NO powerups available, so you can only defeat the boss with pure skill.  With the exception of a single boss on a specific difficulty setting, every attack that each boss uses can be completely avoided with the right timing and technique, and thus you must be entirely reliant on your skills and reflexes to win.  This doesn't mean that the bosses are easy, however, as some bosses will fill their arena with projectiles and particle effects that can be extremely difficult to avoid effectively while also damaging the boss.  Each boss is also entirely unique, except two recurring boss fights (which are significantly more powerful and more difficult on their second round) and no bosses that might as well just be a really powerful regular enemy.\nWhile each level is memorable and each combat skill you obtain is used to traverse dungeons and avoid traps, regular enemies can sometimes be very simple to defeat on lower difficulties, which can lure some players into a false sense of security, leading them into believing they're ready to fight a boss when they may not be.  One thing that is very important to remember in The Oath in Felghana is to ALWAYS ensure that you've explored every level thoroughly and obtained each treasure, and to upgrade your equipment regularly.  If you don't, the game will punish you HARD.  This can be a tempting challenge to skilled veterans, but to players not used to RPG-styled exploration, it can be a very rude awakening.  In addition, the game is very difficult.  The lower difficulties are definitely managable for most players, but they also dull the experience somewhat.  Normal will provide a good challenge to those who don't often play action games.  Hard and Nightmare difficulties will provide a significant challenge even for the most skilled and experienced players and can be extremely frustrating for people unused to the genre.\nThe Oath in Felghana has a Time Attack mode that you can unlock upon completion of the game that allows you to re-fight any boss on any difficulty with pre-set equipment and stats, and while this can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to those looking to challenge themselves at speedrunnin or people who just want to re-visit their favorite boss fights on various difficulties (as well as an opportunity to unlock a secret boss), the game offers little else in terms of replay value other than playing the game again on a higher difficulty (which improves boss' AI and makes many of their attacks more complex and harder to avoid).  However, for $15, The Oath in Felghana is worth the price of entry even if you only complete the game once (which should take between 10 and 20 hours) and then never touch the game again.  Ys: The Oath in Felghana is one of the best action games ever released, and is most definitely worth the low cost.","March 21, 2012","true","129.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Welcome to Adol Christin’s world. The long running Ys (“EEEs”) RPG dynasty has not been well-known outside Japan until recent years. Plucky import specialist XSEED is changing that by bringing the original PC games to the west.\n\nA remake of the 16-bit era Ys III: Wanderers From Ys, Oath in Felghana is as close to a 16-bit action adventure game in 3D as you’re going to get. While humble in technology, Oath nails the character of a Mega Drive game to the wall. Wandering hero-dude Adol lives only to find new lands, people in trouble, and murder what’s troubling them. It’s pretty much expected of him. Here, he glides through hoards of monsters and demons, leaving a literal shower of fragments in his wake. Experience racks up, multiplied by keeping your kill count up. Dungeons are simplistic until the last third of the game, but offer satisfying platforming action to offset the killing. Bosses are huge, with patterns right out of an old school arcade game.\n\nSharp controls and a driving electronic orchestra finishes off the package. It acts as both nostalgic trip, and introduction to a simply satisfying franchise that’s been pushed by fans for a reason.

You start with a simple sword combo and jump, but subsequently aquire other abilities, like dash and double jump, as well as elemental spells, that not only do damage, but change the way you move and behave in battle. Wind spell lets you glide in air, useful for making long jumps and avoiding some boss attacks; Earth spell can break some walls to reveal hidden paths and provides you with invincibility frames; Fire spell... just shoots fireballs, that's all.\n\nMain gameplay basically consists of two sections.\nFirst, you have to traverse the level and reach the next boss. Enemies in level may start as challenging and drive you back to town to heal and upgrade your equipment, but little by little you will be pushing forward, gaining levels and eventually will overcome any obstacle. Exploring levels rewards you with some very useful items as well.\nThen, when you get to the boss, real fun starts. Game rewards you with an achievement for dying ten times in a single boss fight and I almost got it with the very first boss encountered - reached 9/10. Needless to say, I "succeeded" unlocking this achievment with the second boss. Boss attack patterns are varied and tend to change mid-fight, when you think you're adapted to it. The last boss in particular will mercilessly test everything you learned in the game - you have to have lightning reflexes and full control over your character movements to beat it, but when you'll do it you will feel like total badass.\n\nFinal word about music. It's often praised in reviewes, but I was afraid that it will not fit the fantasy setting. I was wrong - music is very fitting to non-stop hack and slash action and creates epic rock opera feel.","July 13, 2012","true","18.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than that for $15 this game is amazing value. One playthrough will take about 15-20 hours and even more depending on how much of a completitionist you are.\n\nThe "Ragnarok Online" 2D sprites in a 3D world works well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orphen07/recommended/207320/","Orphen07","Orphen07","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orphen07/","111 products in account","Note 1: This is currently being played on Nightmare difficulty. That being said, your mileage may vary on how these games compare (how easy is is to make money, gain exp, etc.)\n\nNote 2: I will be comparing this to Origin's gameplay. Spoilers for both games will be unmarked, so please read at your discretion.\nThis is a review of the game from a technical/gameplay standpoint  not  a review regarding the storyline, graphics, etc. I am writing this review for those that wish to play the Ys games in chronological order.\n\nFor those of you that didn't know, Origin, Oath in Felghana, and Ark of Napishtim use the same engine. However, OiF and Origin were released after Ark of Napishtim, in that order, and thus were "tweaked" or "improved," rather, in terms of combat, stat growth, and money gain. Playing in chronological order means playing Origin, then Oif, then Ark, and getting used to things that might be missing, as you go through the series.\n\nNow, I've played Origin all the way through on all characters on Nightmare difficulty, and the first thing to compare between Origin and Oif, is that Yunica and Adol play similarly to each other, without being exactly the same. For example, while Yunica and Adol's fire spells function identically, Yunica gets her fire magic from a sword, which does slightly more damage than her normal weapon, but swings slower. Other than that, their attack patterns are pretty similar, with Adol doing more thrusting as opposed to Yunica swinging her axe about (which makes sense, considering you don't stab with it).\n\nIn Origin, your dash attack has a chance of lowering the enemy's defence, including bosses. This is incredibly helpful as it can be chained into your normal combo. In OiF, you still have a dash attack, however, instead of lowering the enemy's defence, it is a quick 3-hits, that can be chained into your normal combo. That being said, in Origin, it's imperative to learn how to effectively use your dash attack, where as in OiF, you can almost completely disregard it, and get by just fine.\n\nThe second thing to note, OiF and Origin have a thing called Boost, which functions similar to a Limit Break, if you will; while it's active, movement and attack speed is increased, while damage is greatly reduced. However, Origin added an additional power to that, called Burst, a special attack that, when activated, will use the remaining time on your Boost. The attack varies for each character, but is nice to have, as it's essentially a panic button, to go along with your Limit Break. You don't  need  it, but it's nice to have, in the situations where you are surrounded by enemies with 3 HP, and no way out.\n\nRegarding the difficulty as a whole, of both games, Nightmare is incredibly hard, even frustrating at times, in both Origin and OiF. The difference, however, is that OiF has boss fights that are much more demanding in terms of snap decisions, timing, and reflexes, whereas the dungeons leading up to said fights, are a fun challange. Not particularly terrifying or anything. The first boss, Ellefale, is both a perfect representation of what to expect later on, as well as being a nice throwback to Ys 2, where everything died by fire. If you try to dodge her attacks too early, they will chace after you, and you'll get hit, and likewise, dodge too late, and you get hit. For a first boss, having to learn the timing right then and there is incredibly demanding, especially when you die in 2 or 3 hits. Boss fights like Gyalva and Gildias very much felt the same way, requiring precise timing, quick thinking, and not using every tool in your arsenal will cost you your life.\n\nOn the other hand, Origin had much harder dungeons, yet had less demanding boss fights (not to say that they aren't exactly "harder"). I found myself dying quite a bit, as trash mobs used their numbers and large attack power to hit for all I'm worth. The Water Prison has you fighting enemies that can only be destroyed with your earth power, while trying to navigate underwater, looking for more oxygen. The Silent Desert has enemies that, when you first get there, can't be permanantly killed, all the while traversing quicksand, while they come from the ground and dance around you. At times, I felt myself traversing these dungeons with a sense of caution, as the next batch of enemies, and a wrong move would be the end of me. While poor planning will also get you killed in dungeons in OiF, it felt a lot more frequent in Origin.\n\nBoss fights, however, were a lot more fair. The dodging you had to do from enemy's attacks would prepare you for this moment, because a lot of the bosses have projectiles, or attacks that reach large sections of the field. Jenocres' attacks feel very much like playing a shoot 'em up, for example. Which leads to one of the more noticible changes between Origin and OiF; You see the entire battlefield, and always have eyes on the boss, at all times. During the course of the fight, lightning strikes will come down in the area where you are standing, indicated by circles on the ground. You have to keep running, until the lightning is finished chasing you. Being able to see where  Jenocres is, as well as the entire arena, while dodging attacks that reach every corner of the screen is keeps you from running into another attack, after dodging the last one.\n\nThis, cannot be said for OiF. With the exception of Gildias and Ellefale, you do not normally have constant sight on the boss, the entire arena, and Adol, at the same time, without keeping within a certain distance of the boss. The arena in which you fight is about the same average size as the ones in Origin, however, the camera is focused on Adol, zoomed out for the boss fight. What this means is that to see all of the boss's tells and attacks before they happen, you must keep within a certain proximity. However, the result of that is a smaller margin of error for dodging and reacting to attacks.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of traditional shops, Origin has a system implemented where you can buy powers, named Blessings, which allow your character active passives such as boosted ailment resistance, reduced damage from terrain, or things such as increased item drop rate. However, on Nightmare, all SP (the currency of the game) is worth 1 SP. With the occasional treasure chest giving SP, you will have just enough SP throughout the game to increase the defence on your armour, and obtain 1 to 2 extra skills, depending on what you get, and assuming you are leveling normally. The lack of shops also means that you will find all of your weapons and armour, and any items you obtain must either be found, or otherwise obtained from the story. OiF does not suffer from this, as it does use the traditional shop. You do still find weapons and armour during your escapades, however, you can also buy weapons, armour, and expendable items. Thankfully, unlike in Origin, currency in the land of Felghana is a lot easier to come by, so there is no worrying about saving for just the right moment.\n\nUpgrading weapons and armour requires two things: money, and Cleria Ore. In OiF, ore comes in abundance, dropped by enemies, along with gold. Every weapon and piece of armour requires both gold, and ore to level up (stat increase), with better equipment being more expensive. Origin has simplified this process, in accordance with the shop system and/or money drop rates. Weapons are upgraded specifically with Cleria Ore, however, they are scattered throughout the game, and power up your weapon enough to last you until the next upgrade, and armour is upgraded by spending SP.","August 18, 2015","true","78.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

I'm not exagerating here, Ys really does have some of gaming's greatest bosses.\n\nThere were 3 ys games to use this style of engine. The ark of Napishtim (which was the first), The oath in Felghana and finally Origins.\n\nFelghana has the greatest soundtrack of them all and arguably the second strongest soundtrack in the entire series (In a series famous for it's soundtracks (look for a psp or psvita for Ys 7 if you want the best soundtrack)).\n\nFelghana, on it's hardest difficulty has some spectacular bosses. However the game doesn't put it's best foot forward at the start. Initial bosses are pretty simple and hardly inspiring, which is unfortunate because the later bosses are absolutely spectacular. Thematically unique bosses all with their own interesting quirks and unique mechanics make each big baddy feel wholly unique and incredibly satisfying to down.\nIn fact Felghana and Origins are spectacular examples of good boss design (with a few very obnoxious exceptions).\n\nThere's also a bit of exploration and secret discovering involved in Ys, and because a number of your abilities give both combat and traversal options there is some fun platforming to be performed in the game.\n\nSo this all sounds super positive, are there any negatives then? Actually yeah, quite a few.\n\nThis game isn't pretty, I mean let's be fair it's old (2005) but that's gonna be a turn off for some people.\n\nThen there's the plot, Ys' localization is about as good as it can get (Xseed is really good at that) but this isn't a plot that's likely to do anything for you, and not much time is spent on either it or its characters.\n\nThe game is also very grind heavy, especially on it's higher difficulties. Levels and weapon upgrades in Ys make a huge difference, to the point where a single level can make your attacks do almost twice the damage and can turn some boss fights from cruel jokes into fun encounters. but there are humungous experience penalties once you start over levelling, and even then you're going to have to farm normal mooks just to avoid being underlevelled, which may have been alright except for the game's final weakness, fights that aren't bosses.\n\nYs's combat is simple, but the way it blends with each bosses unique mechanics make it incredibly satisfying. This doesn't occur with normal enemies though, which means for many, normal combat in Ys isn't very satisfying, which is unfortunate because you'll need to do a fair amount of farming basic enemies to be able to afford upgrades and avoid\nbeing underleveled.\n\nSo to sum up:\n+ Awesome soundtrack\n+ Awesome bosses after the first couple of dungeons\n\n- Not very pretty\n- Grindy on higher diffculties\n- Fighting basic enemies isn't that fun\n- Playing on easier difficulties wont let you appreciate it's great bosses properly\n\nYs will appeal extremely strongly to a certain crowd, and that crowd absolutely SHOULD play it, because it's one of the best examples of it's genre. But most other people will likely find the game to be more trouble than it's worth.","November 26, 2015","true","34.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if so, this game should be avoided at all costs), and features a cozy, classic jRPG art style of 3D backgrounds with pre-rendered actors.  The battle system is also quick and enjoyable, if  a bit simple.\n\nThat said, there are some things not that great concerning this game. First of all, it’s not particularly long for a role-play. Beating the game should take no more than 15 hours (and it is entirely possible to complete the storyline in about 5) which is not all that impressive concerning the fact that some other jRPGs have mini-games that are more time consuming.\n\nAfter completing the campaign, you can try the time attack or replay the story on another difficulty setting. There is no incentive to do so, since perhaps the Oath’s weakest point is its plot. The story told is extremely generic and predictable. Furthermore, the 30-some cast of characters is largely uninteresting. Finally, the extremely pompous  dialogue (and I do say that as a fan of jRPG narration) lines do not help at all.\n\nThere aren’t  that many items to be collected either –  6 sets of equipment (sword, shield and armor each – all with 3 levels of upgrades ), 3 (also upgradeable 3 times )spells,  24 other items (usable, plot tokens or granting a particular ability). And , which is quite surprising in this genre – no party can be formed at any point of the game – the protagonist is forever alone (in battle) .\n\nWhat saves the day and, in the end, redeems this otherwise average game, are some of the most brilliant boss- battles I have ever seen in a jRPG game: quick, demanding and almost perfectly balanced to avoid the excessive grind (at least on the medium difficulty setting).\n\nConcluding, this is not a greatly memorable title and in the end I feel that it abused my longing for a classic jRPG experience, which  kept me in front of the computer until the end. 6 out of 10, and I recommend it solely due to the awesomeness of  boss battles.\n","December 29, 2013","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I would recommend this to any Ys fans but personally I was kind of underwhelmed. I'm not even sure what it was that underwhelmed me but I liked Ys Origins a lot more. Maybe it's because it feels like you only need to beat it once and then move on to another game. Save the other Ys games for after you've beaten this one for a more rewarding experience.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: As with the other Ys games, you have difficulties for everyone to be able to enjoy the game although there are at least 2 bosses that are annoying no matter what you choose.\n\n[Story - average]: Pretty standard stuff but I liked the little touches here and there to make the story more than just a standard issue "Evil being awakens and you happen to be nearby to slay/seal it for the villagers" story. I don't know if Ys Ark of Nepishtim would explain why Adol and Dogi are traveling together but not being able to own and play it may explain why I feel so disconnected from Felghana.\n\n[Characters - good]: As with all the other Falcom games Steam has, the attention to details about every character's personality and lives is always a pleasure to read about. The merchant trying to get fame and fortune, the hardworking townspeople and a surprisingly kind countess are just a few to name in adding layers to the otherwise cookie-cutter plot.\n\n[Graphics - average]: It's a matter of personal tastes on this one. The characters look great to me since I prefer the 2D anime style over full 3D characters. The cinematics are as lovely as I've come to expect from any Falcom game as well.\n\n[Music - excellent]: One thing this game has no problems with is the music, my favorites would definitely be the world map and clock tower music. Not to say the rest wasn't memorable though.\n\n[Combat - good]: It uses the same combat and magic system as Origins which makes playing one then the other very easy to transition into.\n\n[Length - average]: It may be a good length for people who prefer short games but as for someone with tons of spare time and expectations of RPGs to have decent length and content in them...it was disappointing how quickly I chewed through it. That disappointment also leads to my rating for...\n\n[Replayability - bad]: Unfortunately there is almost no reason to replay this game except to get Steam achievements. The version we Steam players got is lacking all the extras the PSP version players get for beating the game and time attack mode.","July 4, 2015","false","12.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

But just because the game is a hack-and-slasher RPG doesn't mean it's an easy game to play, as you will have to use certain abilities and time your attacks in all of the game's boss battles, as well as plan your attacks at the right time in the right place to pull off combo attacks to gain an XP bonus. Yes, the game gives you an XP bonus for your combos. Magic is also important in the game, but unlike other RPGs where you learn magic through training, you gain magic abilities through rings that can be found throughout the game (three in all), and you can find gems that are of the same color of a specific magic ring to improve the strength of that ring. The game also allows you to better your current equipment at the blacksmith's shop in the main town, but it unfortunately does kinda fall flat in terms of scope, although it is still recommended to better your current equipment in order to reduce damage taken.\n\nLike most Ys games, Felghana has bad ♥♥♥ music. The tracks range from orchestrated instrumentals to bad ♥♥♥ guitar riffs. The game's graphics are often compared to that of an original PlayStation game, albeit with a better framerate than most PS1 games dream of having. The graphics are mostly okay. They could have been better, but they do their job well enough. The game runs well on PCs that tend to be extremely shity, so those who have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PCs should not worry about this game running horribly on their PCs.\n\nOverall, the game is an essential game to play for those who love action RPGs and should be a game that gets more love. The game is also for the PSP, so if you're still worried about your PC not being able to run it, and you own a PSP, you can get it on that.","November 27, 2013","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The controls are excellent seeing as all of the problems I've had were only with me not jumping too great on the platforms.The boss battles are quite challenging (unless you're on very easy) and you'll want to destroy your keyboard & mouse/controller after dying time after time (you do get an achievement for dying 10 times on the same boss, so don't feel too bad!) but it is a rewarding experience that truly tests your skills. While it is just a good 'ol hack & slash, it's a really fun action RPG and as such is a great installment in one my favourite series.","January 6, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was hard then and it's hard now, I love it. Nothing like the feeling of finally beating a boss that has been giving you a hard ♥♥♥ time. Most games nowadays you can beat in one sitting, not the case with Y's : The Oath in Felghana. I put 40 hours in it so far and I'm still not done the game, the story is pretty straight foward like most old titles ( it actually seems to be the very same story that it had on SNES ) but more than makes up for with awesome gameplay. Maybe not as important to some gamers out there but the soundtrack is absolutely amazing too!! Controls are a little frustrating when using mouse//keyboard but once I plugged in my XbaX controller the game played very smoothly, I'd actually recommend using a gamepad for this game over keyb//mouse. I'd give this title a 9/10, a must have for any JRPG fan!

The bosses are tricky though and some compare it to Dark Souls. Once the pattern is figured out, it's pretty awesome beating them. It's a nice acomplishment.\n-Some grindy elements. If you're underleveled and having issues, you'll have to grind out some levels and then it gets easier.\n\nGame length can vary. There's an achievement for under 5 hours and one for over 10 hours.

Crushes them. Devestates them. He can jump like a running African and the world around him is full of giant monsters that sit there and wait, their whole life, for this kid to show up. Then they try to kill him and fail, because he's a badass.\n\nThen there's this guy named Chester, right.\n\nHe's a negative point on the metaphorical IGN review.\n\nHe spits acid and breathes fire.\n\nAdol has to do destroy him and trek all the way across the land, from the hangar, through the nuclear plant and command control, stop at central processing - it's a mess. All with no food. Then, he has to travel on foot to Installation 00 so he can activate the Halo Array.\n\nStop and think about that: that's 262,144 LIGHT YEARS on FOOT.\n\nThe bosses at the first gas station stop on the way range from mildly amusing. The wolf with the sword is way too easy, the convicts in the humvee are overly difficult considering Adol doesn't obtain a firearm until level 28, they could at least have included a save point so you don't have to spend 37 hours (in real time, not game time) doing it again.\n\nFinal boss is a pushover. The minigame where you have to hide behind the curtains while his minions look for you at the top of his tower is MORE INTERESTING than the boss himself. After he dies, Great Fox picks you up, Adol returns to the Liberl Kingdom where some white haired jerkass going under the name of Morpheus gives him two handguns named Ebony & Ivory. It's pointless because you cannot use them as there are no more enemies to fight. There you are free to roam about on your Big Wheel obtained after the first third of the game located in Boletaria.\n\nThis is where a lot of issues start coming in, because NG+ doesn't support vehicle upgrades. This effectively forces you to walk through each area and run into far too many random encounters with wild animals.\n\nI mean, look,\n\nIt's a 6/10 game.\n\nBut it's a 9/10 EXPERIENCE.\n\nEither go with this or Artificial Academy. Crash Bandicoot is another great Falcom game as well, but it lacks the optimization that this does.\n\nI'm done now. Too much for one day.

It had a massive overhaul from the original that includes gameplay, style, graphics, and music. It's action RPG goodness to say the least. I know veteran fans will blast me, but think of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on crack with a lot of enemies, 80's rock and power metal, tough bosses, and leveling, but without the puzzles, exploration and Zelda.\n\nIf you want to jump in to the series, I recommend you play it on Easy first. Normal isn't that hard but the bosses will punish you for mistakes. The bosses themselves don't look bad and they have set patterns but dodging is harder than it looks and if you can't keep up BOOM! That's a tenth or more of your health gone.\n\nThere's also a bit of level scaling to the table. Say a boss is level 15, and you're level 12. You are going to get mopped on the floor. It's possible but it's really hard. Climb up to level 15 and you should be okay. Level up to 16. It's almost a joke! For the most part.\n\nLastly, you don't have to play the past series to understand the story because each entry in the series is a new adventure. Ys I and II are the execptions because they're sequels to each other.","December 26, 2013","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was wary of it because I know Ys games tend to have particularly brutal boss battles, but the lowest difficulty is easily doable for a first-timer (though bosses may still be a challenge).  Higher difficulties will give you more of a run for your money, with stronger enemies with more HP.\n\nIn terms of content, it's no more than a 10-hour game realistically, and maybe doesn't seem like much by today's RPG standards, but especially if you've played the original Ys III you'll enjoy the vast improvements to the story, the reimaginings of the setting, and the rearrangement of the soundtrack.","July 27, 2012","true","160.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay's tight, and requires a certain level of skill so that you don't get wrecked, even on normal. The visuals are decent for the type of game it is, and for when it came out, but aren't going to win any awards. The main strengths of this game come in the boss fights, which are varied and unique, and will destroy you the first few attempts. The level design is also standout, and makes exploring for equipment and items more interesting.\n\nThe story's pretty weak, and really just serves to move your character from area to area, but the dialogue is cheesy enough to make up for it. And the music, while mostly being decent, never really does anything spectacular, and can, though rarely, be grating.\n\nAll in all, for the first game in a long running series to try something new, it really comes together as more than the sum of it's parts, and what it lacks in polish, it makes up for in charm.","April 8, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was my first experience with the Ys series, so it's always held a spot in my top ten lists. After playing Ys: TOiF, I was surprised by the some of the changes and the additions of different story-lines, as well as more characters being added in. As for the game play, it is more of a top-down style RPG, having you hack and slash every enemy you come across. It can get a bit repetitive, especially if you are overwhelmed by some enemies in an area, but with the upgrading system for your items, the spell system you could call it, and the musical score, it may just be me, but I find it hard to get bored with the game.\n\nThis review is probably on the more biased side, but I would just say, if you are curious, give it a try and don't get discouraged if you end up hitting a bit of a roadblock at certain points. The Ys series was never one for much hand holding, just pointing you in one direction with a pat on the back, then going from there.","December 26, 2013","true","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The soundtrack is awesome, a trend that has (and hopefully will be) continued through the Ys series.

I should have looked elsewhere.  The controls are clunky for a 3D-ish game - you'll find yourself having to mash jump multiple times when your jumps matter, i.e. crossing platforms, etc., and your character will go off missing constantly due to the horrible control.  There is very little forgiveness when it comes to progression.  You have to grind to get your level to the appropriate point for each different area, and then return to the save at the start of the area incase something stupid happens, or else you waste an hour of your time and have to do it all again.  This game boils down to "Make sure you are the max level for the area you're in, or you will die, over and over."  There's no rushing, and no amount of skill of dodging/countering will compensate for being 2 levels shy of what you "should be".\n\nImo, skip this one.","April 3, 2015","false","13.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Previously cleared this remake of YS in 2006 when the original Japanese version was released for PC, but purchased and cleared again for nostalgia when it was re-released on Steam.\n\nGameplay is action-RPG'ish (resembling both Zelda and Diablo), as the player controls the main character from an overhead third person view. Character can level up and acquire a set of sword-skills and magic to demolish enemies that are encountered throughout the game. Storyline is very well-paced, keeping the user focused on the set objectives he must accomplish to get to the next segment. Music is absolutely amazing, setting the tone of each and every stage the character enters.

Character can level up and acquire a set of sword-skills and magic to demolish enemies that are encountered throughout the game.

I would honestly put this thing on par with Dark Souls for difficulty, requiring much trial and error if you refuse to play with a walkthrough (like me).\n\nThe camera angle is static but is rather comfortable, and the graphics are charming.  The game is also rather light in that it's easy to just pick up, play through a dungeon and advance the story a little, then put down again for another day. The music is also beautiful, making me want to sit in dungeons areas after clearing a room of enemies just so I can listen to it.\n\nObviously if you're looking at JRPG classic like Ys, graphics aren't exactly what you're seeking.

Though the remake is very much a better game, even at the start and even though is a bit dated, the art style is beautiful and it does have great enhancements compared to the original.\n\nThe story is pretty basic but it was entertaining. It had a pretty good story to it and the characters were interesting. The main antagonist was pretty interesting in his own right even if he wasn't the final boss he still was a good adversary and he was obviously strong through the entire story and had his own motives. The story by todays standards might seem like nothing special but it does tell an old game plot pretty well with enough spice to make it interesting. There are many interesting characters in the narrative and the ending was probably one of the better endings in recent memory. It left an impression.\n\nThe music is fantastic. Everything is wonderful in the soundtrack and the sound effects are really good. Nothing to complain about here.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome. It's very fast paced with enough depth to keep someone interested. Though I do love Action RPGs but this game is pretty challenging on Normal. Probably one the hardest Action RPG's with the exception of DarK Souls. It's not as insane as Dark Souls but it does have quite a bit of frustrating moments. At moments it does require the player to grind to get through the tough boss battles. The boss battles are intense but do give a sense of reward after they are defeated. The good thing about the gameplay is that if you die at a boss battle you don't have to go to your last check point but at the boss fight itself. Once you nab the pattern down for the bosses they are much easier but they do require a bit of skill and luck to defeat, including the final boss which when I saw it fall gave a huge sense of satisfaction.\n\nIf you're not really good at these kinds of games, I would reccomend playing on Easy instead of Normal. I did complete the game on Normal but the challenge was almost to the point where it started to interfiere with how fun the game was. Though it does give a great sense of satisfaction, so if you like challening Action RPG's, this one should fit the bill. Even if Normal is too easy for you there are other difficulities which I will personally never try but they're there for those who are into that.\n\nThe game doesn't have much replayability but I think that I'll defintly play it again down the road. Doesn't have a new game + that the PSP version has but that's fine, it's fine how it is.\n\nStory: 8/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8.5/10\n\nI fully reccomend this game especially for the price point.

Released way back on various consoles and computers as, "Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys", it was brutally hard and I'm sure led to many a controller tossed in frustration. Back then it was only a 2-D side scrolling platformer, though in this go-around it has been given a massive facelift and brought into the 3rd dimension. There are lots of pretty visuals, excellent music, and the game play can be tailored in difficulty for the meek or the seasoned. It's got a good storyline, a lot of content, and great graphics.\n\nNow, for those of us who DID play the PSP or Vita download versions of this game: they cut out a lot of content. Not game or quest-wise, but you'll notice that the people of this Redmont have a lot less to verbally say than their PSP counterparts. There is no way to program your controller to your liking, and the special bonus pictures and such you could earn throughout the game are gone. If you already own this and are thinking of getting it for the updated visuals and such, know they're NOT widescreen, and honestly, they don't look much better than the PSP in my own opinion.\n\nSo, if you don't have a PSP or Playstation system you can play it on, it's worth getting. Especially on sale. If you have the PSP version, stick with that one, you're not missing anything really.","April 18, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The overworld is short and simple, to make it easy for the player to get from place to place, and it ties into each area pretty well! The combat system is easy to get a feel for, which really complements the smooth controls. The bosses are some of the best I've ever fought, the atmosphere is great, and as for the soundtrack, MY GOD IS IT GOOD!!!!! One of the best things about this game though, is that it's something anyone can play, and that's because of the way the difficulty settings work. It allows people to play the game in a comfortable manner, and it also allows people to get better at the game at the same time. Easy mode too boring? Try Normal or Hard Mode! If that's not enough, the game also has a Nightmare difficulty, to give players a heck of a challenge! There's a time attack mode for you to try out as well, which pits you against every boss in the game in bosh rush, or lets you fight them individually if that's too tough.

I haven't played Ys origin yet or any of the PSP ones but this one is the best combat of the Ys games IMO. While my knowledge is only from ys 1 and 2, I think oath in felghana has a better combat system due to the fact it has an actual combat system.\n\nWhile it centers around one area only they're still things to do even after you complete a certain dungeon. The main reason for return to each area as you progress through the game is the metroidvania like system that's implemented. As you gain new powers new areas that may have been inaccessible open up (Like a higher platform) and most of them have really cool treasure locked away.\n\nMain story features Adol the Red and Doji returning to Doji's homeland and things soon get out of hand for the Duo (Like usual). Adol is seemingly stripped of everything at the start yet again, but from a gameplay perspective I understand why. I would have liked if they featured his last games armor and weapons as the basic starter items though.\n\nThe combat system is miles ahead of what ys 1 and 2 had with a combo system, magic built in, multiple magic moves that have charging attacks as well, can jump in the air and do air combos and downward slamming attacks.\n\nA lot of the enemies in the game have some strong defenses in one category but may be extremely weak to another category (Strong vs attacks, weak vs magic). Once you figure out each enemies weakness they become slighty easier to kill off.\n\nBosses are really awesome in this game and most of them feel bullet-hellish (To a minor degree, nothing insane) and require you to learn the bosses patterns to beat them effectively. Some bosses do become pushovers if you overlevel an area via grinding.\n\nMusic is badass like usual with electric guitar and electronica sounds mixed into the game for a bunch of memorable tunes. Also another nice feature is no more grinding an enemy over and over again for its bestiary (Only have to beat it once for it information).\n\nPositive:\n\nGreat combat system\nInteresting combos both in the air and ground\nMultiple magic charging attacks\nReally interesting boss mechanics\nNegative:\n\nStripped of everything at the start\nNo voice over","May 8, 2014","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also made me think up a few rather awful jokes, I was in high school at the time aftera ll...\n\nY is it called Y? Y would anyone play a game with such a silly name?\n\nWell, here's a new one. Y the hell didn't I try Ys sooner?!\n\nThe combat is fast paced and energetic, the magic system is a lot of fun and plays double duty as a means of getting to new areas, the graphics are bright and colorful, and the music... well, I'm getting the soundtrack to this one.\n\nDefinitely worth a play if you have some spare cash on hand.","July 28, 2012","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it all flows at a breakneck pace.  Sound familiar?  If you've played Ys, it should.  But then again, you'd already own this game, because once you play one Ys game, you buy them all at once...\n\nYs is a hidden gem.  Please, buy, play, and spread the word.

Simple mechenics charming story and characters and super fun gameplay.

Its playable with any configureation but a controller is more ideal. Mote normal mode is pretty tough this game wont hesitate to kill you where as the other Ys game`s normal modes are a lot more fair so if your going into this dont expect a walk in the park.Start with rather this or Origin if your intrested 1 and 2 are crazy old school.

Though the remake is very much a better game, even at the start and even though is a bit dated, the art style is beautiful and it does have great enhancements compared to the original.\n\nThe story is pretty basic but it was entertaining. It had a pretty good story to it and the characters were interesting. The main antagonist was pretty interesting in his own right even if he wasn't the final boss he still was a good adversary and he was obviously strong through the entire story and had his own motives. The story by todays standards might seem like nothing special but it does tell an old game plot pretty well with enough spice to make it interesting. There are many interesting characters in the narrative and the ending was probably one of the better endings in recent memory. It left an impression.\n\nThe music is fantastic. Everything is wonderful in the soundtrack and the sound effects are really good. Nothing to complain about here.\n\nThe gameplay is awesome. It's very fast paced with enough depth to keep someone interested. Though I do love Action RPGs but this game is pretty challenging on Normal. Probably one the hardest Action RPG's with the exception of DarK Souls. It's not as insane as Dark Souls but it does have quite a bit of frustrating moments. At moments it does require the player to grind to get through the tough boss battles. The boss battles are intense but do give a sense of reward after they are defeated. The good thing about the gameplay is that if you die at a boss battle you don't have to go to your last check point but at the boss fight itself. Once you nab the pattern down for the bosses they are much easier but they do require a bit of skill and luck to defeat, including the final boss which when I saw it fall gave a huge sense of satisfaction.\n\nIf you're not really good at these kinds of games, I would reccomend playing on Easy instead of Normal. I did complete the game on Normal but the challenge was almost to the point where it started to interfiere with how fun the game was. Though it does give a great sense of satisfaction, so if you like challening Action RPG's, this one should fit the bill. Even if Normal is too easy for you there are other difficulities which I will personally never try but they're there for those who are into that.\n\nThe game doesn't have much replayability but I think that I'll defintly play it again down the road. Doesn't have a new game + that the PSP version has but that's fine, it's fine how it is.\n\nStory: 8/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 10/10\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8.5/10\n\nI fully reccomend this game especially for the price point.

I did find a little glitch that's probably not even worth mentioning... towards the end of the game when Adol was sent back to Redmont, I decided to try and find the last hidden ore, and got stuck in the chicken coop in Elena's house- jumped through the window onto the beam and got stuck. But that's nbd, cause one can just beam Adol out of the situation. Anyways, fabulous music, really fun to play, the bosses are a bit of a challenge making them hella satifying to beat.

The game holds your hand through the storyline; the challenges are the bosses and dungeons, not figuring out where to go next. There's no major things to miss; most things are in plain sight. It's all about the battles here.\n\nI beat it in about 6 hours on Very Easy. Very Easy is stupidly easy. I never died. Inferno is sadistic. No healing items, massive damage from monsters, it's a challenge alright!\n\nThe story itself is kind of derivative. That said, I came to understand the characters, the authors took time to make them seem human. The music is pretty awesome too; growing more and more epic as you approach the end.
