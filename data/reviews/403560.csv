"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Leveled_up/recommended/403560/","Leveled_up","brodivh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Leveled_up/","1206 products in account","The permadeath sounds like a good idea...until touch a zombie, die, have to watch a game over screen that takes far too long to get through, and then start over right back at the beginning. Starting over means doing the exact same things you already did in the same order you already did them.\n\nIf there were randomized elements or at least some sort of checkpoint system it would make the game enjoyable. Think of it like the movie Groundhog Day, where Bill Murray can alter the rest of the day just by making a different choice. There will be none of that in Eaten Alive, as it's straight forward mirroring what you've done and hoping you don't get within spitting distance of a zombie before you can get to that point (and a little further) all over again.\n\nAs far as death, you only have to graze a zombie and it is INSTANT death. There's no trying to push it away, no kicks to topple them over - you're just 100% done.\n\nI like the idea of RPG Maker games that aren't the standard RPG, such as horror or mystery/adventure. So, with that being the point of interest for me, I went ahead and played this long enough to get a feel for it. I'll play it some more later, but I just hope the repetitiveness isn't going to keep me from getting at least a little fun.\n\nSo, if you don't care about doing ♥♥♥♥ over, and over, and over, and over, buy it, it's otherwise decent. But my final verdict is that some changes need to be made by the developer before it's going to be a recommendable game.","September 30, 2015","false","1.2"," 188 of 213 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","188","213","12","11"

I also think that if you die the save should  be erased so you cant go back, thus keeping permadeath. I dont the dev doesnt realizes is that alot of us have things to do, whether it be work, school, social life etc. and cant keep this game running all day till we're able to play again.\n\nI mean I think Ive barely cratched the surface of content this game has to offer, and props to the dev for making it so, but I had to stop playing because I had to go to work, and when I came home and booted the game up, I had to start over. And I REALLLLY dont wanna do the crap I have already done again.\n\nI mean think of a survival game, like Day Z for instance. If you log out and log back in, you have everything, but if you are killed you  have to start over. Thats how this game should be.\n\nSo a TL;DR, the permadeath system adds intensity and the game itself is great! There just needs to be some way to save my progress if need be so I can come back later if I need to leave.\n\n","October 1, 2015","false","3.9"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","49","56","0","2"

Only volume and "resolution" (fullscreen or windowed), nothing about graphics, no actual resolution options (the game was locked to 3:4 ratio on my pc with extremely low resolution, my fps counter was huge), and no mouse control options.- No mini map (or any kind of map)  - the area in which i was playing was divided to many parts, most of them looked familiar to each other and so I couldn't nevigate both from area to area and inside big areas (like the sewers) because everything looked the same.\n-  No UI  - the game has no UI whatsoever, there aren't any way to see if you have missions or what items you have, you have to remember any items you picked on the way.\n-  Many bugs:\nGame mouse is able to escape the screen, and leaves the normal-unusable mouse on the screen.\n\nIf you click on an area you can't go to, the game gets stuck for a few seconds.\n\nCan't alt tab, doesn't work, just leaves the game on top.\n\nThe mini games don't work-  No progression  - as far as i've seen, you have no inventory, and no lvl up system, and so there's no actual point going around the map doing anything.\n- Not enough things to do  - you can't fight, all you can do is wonder around the place and do missions, neither of which is exceptionally fun, but there just aren't enough things to do, in the 1 hour i've played, all I did was 1 mission, because I couldn't find anything else to do.\n-  No saving  - I wouldn't mind this all that much if you could freaking  alt tab\n-/+  Text seems sort of messed up  - some of the things some of the characters say is pretty messed up and ridiculous and doesn't make a whole lot of sense (at one point, on soldier asked me to find a horse to he could **** it, infront of his entire squad).\n+  The base of the game is good  - I really like the idea of the game, an open world zombie game that isn't focused about just killing the zombies, and that actually lets you move on your own (ahem, the walking dead), there aren't enough of this sort of games.\n\nConclusion: I do think this game has a good idea behind it, but it's hidden behind many bugs and awful design choises. I choose to not refund this game just yet because I think it can be a good game with enough changes but the biggest problem I have with it is that it doesn't teach you what to do, and there is no reason to do anything, since it's not fun to wonder around.\nBut at the moment I do not reccomend buying, I recommend keeping a track of it every few weeks and see if it got tweeked a bit and is in better state.","October 1, 2015","false","1.1"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","44","53","4","2"

Spoilers: In order to escape the first room, your character wants a gun, you click around and find a locked door, only then can you interact with the generator (or maybe I missed it earlier because the collision box is actually one tile BELOW the generator). Once you've inspected the generator you discover you need the passcode to turn it off. Only then does the computer show up as interactable, but it's missing a  cable. Next go into the room with the door, now one of the boxes that you couldn't interact with before is clickable. You get the cable, take it to the computer, get the code, turn off the generator, zombie immediately kill your only fiend, you say "meh" and walk out the door.\n\nAdd in the fact that the main character is an immature ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who could use a good spanking if her parents weren't undead, that the world is large enough to make walking around a slog yet empty enough that exploring it is boring, that the map is inexplicably constrained, that the pathing is buggy as hell,... well the whole thing is just a mess.\n\nI'd say maybe put in on follow and wait until it's been propped up a little.\n\nI bought this on sale for 15 cents and kind of wish I hadn't, but in good faith I can't really ask for a refund.

You just run and hope you find anything interesting, some kind of story, then give up after a while.\n\nThis game is full of things randomly becoming usable and unusable, forces you to use the mouse for no good reason, the path-finding will usually take you on a route that runs you right into a zombie, the visibility circle doesn't follow you to the edge of maps, it forces you to read bad dialog over, and over, and over every death, it has no Steam integration, you can't alt-tab, and generally has a bunch of bugs all over.

It was in a really poor state, but I decided to give them a grace period on a review because they personally promised me and others that a big update was coming in a few weeks to a month or so, (these statements are as early as october)\n\nbiggest thing they promised was achievements, but also more content.\n\nDan, representative (and only employee?) of publisher, Back to Basics Gaming said, and I quote\nOct 14, 2015 @ 6:04am\nIt will be a few weeks before it's ready.\nhttps://imgur.com/X0DZThW\n\nIt's March 1st, 2016. Still waiting for that update. According to their facebook page, the developers have other games being worked on.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SpaceCatGameDev/\n\nThey do not post on the steam forums, so if you don't have facebook, you aren't getting in touch with them.\n\nInterestingly, Dan@ Back to Basics Gaming insists two things. #1.  The update is new content, bug fixes, and achievements and the main game core is complete.  #2. Turbo Pug, which was released after this, was not made by Space Cat Studios. Eh? What? But that's not what Space Cat Studios says.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/aFCi3\nhttps://imgur.com/jgQBDFY <- directly from their facebook page\n\nDan? Well, he's been silent since January. (last known post in his search history) I assume he will start posting on the games he published soon, he just got more junk greenlit this week, but its been over a month of silence, up to the day I write this. Between Space Cats and Back to Basics, nobody on the steam forum is talking to us. Dan's got an e-mail but I prefer communicating out in the open, ya know? I don't use facebook.\n\nSo... This game appears to be abandoned, and those achievements are probably never coming. I'll update this review if they ever do deliver the update they promised back in October , and I will review it.\n\nThis isn't the first time a Back to Basics Gaming published game has been seemingly abandoned either!\nYou may have heard of this gem.\n"A New Kind of Adventure"\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/375510/\nmissed its early access launch date by 6 months and counting. abandoned.\nI wrote a review about that story.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Zootch/recommended/375510\n\nBefore that, we had Back to Basics Gaming publisher give us "Escape Machines".\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/363490/\nThey've been in early access since April, missed their release date by at least 7 months and counting, and is also abandoned.\n\nAround this time, Back to Basics Gaming published another game called "Flesh Eaters" (unrelated to Eaten Alive)\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/383580/\n\nThis also missed its release date by at least 6 months and counting.  Meanwhile, the developer has gotten two new games greenlit in the mean time. Both published by Back to Basics Gaming. Why is someone working on 3 games at once, especially when they can't even finish the first project?\n\nBack to Basics Gaming has also published "Lup", more recently. In tradition with most everything early access, it has missed its release date by 2 months and counting.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/412600/\n\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/yTKmUpA\nyeah i own a majority of their entire catalogue, and this game is in many ways, not an isolated incident with them. I would recommend avoiding Back to Basics Gaming.

It's so bad I can't even describe it\n\nLet's see, where do I begin...\n\nI played through the tutorial because that's what I usually do, and when I got through it, the game told me to use the pause menu to leave. I thought doing quit game would take me back to the main menu, but nope, it just flat out shut the game down. Why have a tutorial if it's going to force you to quit the game?\n\nGetting into the actual part of the game, the first building, FIRST building, I find multiple problems: I had to do sort of fetch quest in order to leave, in which I was given no knowledge, or even a hint, of doing so. It literally took me a whole 8 minutes to figure out what to do. When I got that done, I encountered buggy mapping near the exit door that would let me the exit the map. Just seeing those two things along almost caused me to close out right there, but I still managed to move on with this painful thing called a "game".\n\nNow, these controls... Using the mouse and shift key to run? That just doesn't feel right on me. Especially since you have to click on every tile you want to go to. I get that it's a point-and-click game, but it would make more sense to be able to run in one direction while moving with shift instead of clicking on every single tile, but that's just me and my personal experience with these types of games.\n\nBut this dialogue... It's so cheesy, I wouldn't even eat it...\n\nI saw this game was on sale, and had trading cards, so I figured "Hey, let's sit through something for a while and drop these cards", but nope, I didn't even drop my first card, that's how far I managed to get myself before I quit.\n\nSave your 15 cents (or how ever much the game happens to be now) for something else, people.

I have to prevent others from buying this in the state it is.\nMost early access games are a hundred times more polished and functional then this one is!\n\nNormally I wouldn`t kick a game out of my memory after such a short period, but this game must be meant as a joke and for the purpose too ♥♥♥♥ up people.\nFor sure nobody ever did test it ... or if somebody did, his skills in game testing are at the same niveau then the devs are in designing at least basically well designed and functional games/userinterfaces. Nearly at zero point!\n\nIt will be my first game (out of nearly 1500!) that I will refund at steam.\nI only paid 59 cent for it, but even that was too much!\nOk, perhaps I wont refund it, cause the effort for refunding is not worth the outcome. Perhaps thats why its so cheap .... for preventing ppl from refunding it!\n\nWhy am I so angry?\n\nFirst, you cant play it in windowed mode, well, there is an option for it, but it just does nothing.\nOk, wouldn`t be such a big problem ... but ... you either can´t use alt tab to minimize it to idle mode.\nAlso not a big thing.\nBut!\nYou also cant save, and if you leave the game ... you have to start over from the beginning.\nWow, thats really weird.\nI really love permadeath games, I owe tons of them, but this way of dealing with the players time is the dumbest thing a dev did in my whole carreer as a videogameplayer!\nAnd this career lasts since 40 years!\n\nAt the dev:\n\nDid you expect us to do nothing else then to play your game for hours?\nIs it meant to be played in one session?\nHow long is it, 30 minutes to reach the end?\nOr what did you think when you did it that way?\nWell, just if you do not know, some people have a life besides playing ... most actually.\n\n\nBack to review:\n\nBesides that, even in the short while I played, I did find bugs ingame. You can walk on walls. You somehow fly over the ground, nearly no animations at all. The game did crash 2 times in 15 minutes (guess cause of trying me to alt tab it), which is very funny ... if this happens after you played several hours ... with no save function, forceing you to start over, I guess you will eat your keyboard!\nThe settings menue is the most ugly thing I ever did see in a videogame and a silly mix of mouse and keyboard controlled ... awesome!\nNo settings for resolution, nor any other graphical settings, no keymaper at all, even no descrption of keymaping, or anything else useful.\nBut thats not a real problem as it anyways have no effect on the game, so if you have figured out\nhow to use it, you just see its been for nothing.\n\nThere is a tutorial, which seems to try to be funny (did a child write the dialogues? seems so ...) ... it is not at all, its just boring, I dont want to have to read 25 lines just to find out such obvious things as how to move and that there are 2 different cursors and that this is a permadeath game, I read gamedescriptions before I buy them!\nThe things you want to know, for example how to get into your inventory or map (if there is one ... ) or how to use or craft items (if there are any ... or crafting) ... are not included at all.\n\nAll in all ... looks like the first job of somebody who hardly wanted to call himself a gamedesigner ... but who was not able to think even about the most essential basics. Better would have asked somebody who did have at least a bit understanding of how to design a working framework and interface.\nSorry, Mr. Dev, I think you are a nice guy, and you for sure did your best, but sorry, far far far far away from good, in this state your game is just crap.\nFix the bugs, make your menues and settings work, add the most basic things to it, redo the controlls, give the game a checkpoint system, so one can leave it without having to start from the beginning and make it able to bring it to idle and windowed mode.\nSo to say, do your job, at least the basics, you should have done that first!\n\nAfter that we perhaps can talk about the game ... cause AFTER that it will eventually be a nice experience, ... and perhaps your skills in designing content and a good story is much higher then your skill in creating a functional framework and a smart interface.\n\nBut before that all its not even a suitable screensaver ...\n\nOk, one can buy it for the tradingcards ,,, so if you collect them, buy.\nAll others ... wait.\n\nTo all readers, pls excuse my bad english, its not my native language.","October 2, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","9","11","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazedlion/recommended/403560/","krazedlion","Krazedlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krazedlion/","2046 products in account","Eaten Alive is a RPG maker style game. It has very little in the way of settings, no save feature and permadeath. You have no real way to defend yourself in the beginning except to run and dodge the zombies. The dodge move is performed by hitting the space bar at the correct time and if you don't hit it correctly, one touch from the zombie= instadeath and start over. The dev did add a checkpoint system, but it is only good if you quit the game so that you don't have to restart from the beginning, but if you die you start from the very beginning. The menu is poorly designed, not very clear on how to navigate. The mouse controls are not good, very imprecise, the cursor looks like a middle finger and you can't interact with something if you're right next to it. It starts in windowed mode and when I put to full screen nothing worked. The dialoge would not move forward and the game froze. The story isn't very interesting and consists of poorly written dialoge and too much profanity. You can walk on walls and stand on the clocks that are hanging on the walls you are standing on. There are plenty of bugs in this game, permadeath, poor controls and no save feature that make this game one I would not recommend.","October 7, 2015","false","2.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","0"

The music and the art style: dadgum, I was on board.\n\nThen, I started to play it.\nFirst thing that puts me off is this "Mia" character and the writing. Reading the text makes me feel like something 8th grade me might find deep or edgy.\nThe character interactions are weirdly disproportionate;  The flat characters speak without fluidity and and only have one attribute.  This would be fine if this wasn't a point-and-click  story-based game with multiple campaigns.  Seriously, Mia (i'm guessing) is supposed to be good-gurl-turned-buttcancer because shes experienced loss, but all she does is flux between sassy-cocky-badass-sassmaster to saying shes gonna rip some "♥♥♥♥ off."  This just makes me feel that lines for the characters are just written badly, especially everytime I'm going along and then suddenly BOOM disapropriate response.\n\nAs for the game itself, I get to enjoy walking on the wall and the the tops of the walls, occasionally, since the pathing will take me straight to the hole in the wall. I also do not enjoy looking for a gun in a building FULL OF BOXES. "Hes got it around here somewhere." Nope, you get to walk around here looking for a way to get out and the only door is locked.

Really? I get that dialogue can be hard to write, but using the f word, s  word and similar does not make great dialogue or believable character.\n- Now you are trying to solve puzzle... well not so great because the main cursor (which looks like a middle finger by the way) is again poorly handle and changes only really smally define zone... This makes the game poorly define.  I haven't checked from single play/remove the game from my hard drive if you can collect/find items before you actually know you need them... If this is the case, well it looks the game suffers also from bad design.\n- Look like it is done with RPG maker - maybe a good or bad thing ... who knows\n\nSo in short... bad game probably done with a lot of fun from the developpers which should strongly work on bug fixing, interface improvement and in parallel read and practice anything they can find on game design and story writting...

I mean if the point of the game was making the player feel trapped then you succeeded. That coupled with the extremely unrealisitic main character who used to be a friendly person before the apocolypse started up, there's a little lesson in psychology, a human being with empathy doesn't just lose it the moment something bad happens to them, you're either born without empathy or youa aren't taught to love. So she wouldn't give idle threats like she did. And their revealing her being like a sister to mark was very unnatural, nobody talks like that. So from what I've seen this game gets a very low rating.\n\nAge Rating: T for Blood and Coarse language\nOverall Rating: 3/10","October 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","6","10","2","0"

This seemed pretty interesting at first glance. Not to mention super cheap. However, there are some pretty major flaws in the game itself.\n\n-For starters, it took a LOT of player nagging for the developers to even a save function for people not wanting to play for however many hours straight.\n-Additionally, there's no such thing as health or anything in this game. If you happen to accidentally bump into a zombie (whether due to actual accident or due to the shoddy pathing) you have to immediately manage to succeed in clicking at the right time or... suffer permadeath. I mean, I get that it's a hardcore permadeath game, but come on.\n-To expand on the previous point, yeah. The pathing for the character is extremely shoddy at best. It'll often take the dumbest route to the clicked location, often passing right through a horde... or even a single zombie for that matter.\n-Putting mechanics aside, the main character in the only available story is a piece of crap. There is no possible way to actually empathize with this character in the slightest. I get that the game is more focused on the survival component, but seriously? If you're going to put in a story, at least try to make a character that has redeeming factors. She's akin to a soulless raider or something similar.\n-Another point I should add is that the fullscreen mode is rather broken. The in-game mouse cursor and out-game mouse cursor are constantly in conflict, depending on where you have your mouse on the screen.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd give this game a 5/10 at absolute best. The sprites are nice, even though they look like they are just the base sprites from the zombie pack for RPG Maker or similar, at least. The idea of the game is also alright. But that's about it for the redeeming qualities. I honestly thought for a little bit that the game was early access, but there is no early access label on the page. This feels like an alpha at best. Not a full game in the slightest.","January 31","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did see there were a lot of negative reviews, but I still wanted to give it a chance.  To be blunt, this is a terrible game.  My first complaint was the default volume of the music.  At least for me, the music got annoying pretty fast, and I ended up just turning the music off completely.  I really wish developers would set the music volume at half instead of setting it at max so it just blares in your ear.    The game starts off with two people arguing, and that's your introduction.  As you progress, you realize just how bad this story is. It even got to a point where I almost just gave up on the game and put it on my 'uninstall' list.\n\nLets move on with the most common thing that happens.  When you die, the game over screen seems to last forever, and then you have to start over from the very beginning.  If you're going to make us sit through a very long game over screen, at least give us check points.   As if that's not bad enough, nothing changes when you die.  It's the exact same process over and over.\n\nOne of my biggest issues is that you seem to have only 1hp.  If a zombie so much as spits on you you're dead.  I get zombie mucus is goss and all, but really?  You're going to make our death instant?  You can't even defend yourself, you just have to accept it.  That is a really, really poor mechanic.\n\nAt cetain spots I noticed you could walk onto the wall as if it wasn't there.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or an unintentional bug.  If it's intentional, why?\n\nTo my surprise, you can't alt tab.  You can't even use the Steam overlay.  I'm sorry, but how hard is it to allow us to use Steam overlay? It's a vital part of all Steam games, and it's incredibly disappointing when the option is not there.\n\nSomething that I did like was that you can use the arrow keys to move, and space to click things.  Sure, it's a point and click, you're supposed to use the mouse, but I ended up just using the arrow keys.  Always nice when you're given option to choose how you want to play/control your character.\n\nAs a final note, I do not recommend this game at all.  The only way I could see myself recommending it is if it was free.\n\n\nPositives:\n\nTrading cards.\nPoint and click game.\nMature game (swearing, etc)\nCan use arrow keys to move around, and space bar to click on things.\nNegatives:\n\nDefault music that is too loud.\n\nLack of a proper introduction to the game.\n\nFar too many bugs that made the game feel like it was in early alpha.\n\nInstant death no matter what.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","March 28","false","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You start out in a four-room warehouse (trust me you'll be seeing this place a lot) where you angst at your adopted father. You need to go from room to room and interact with various objects and eventually get out. Once you're outside, you'll meet zombies. If you touch them and fail a quick time event, you're dead. Totally dead. Permadead.\n\nThis is the most "controversial" aspect of the game. It definitely gives the game a unique feel and differentiates it from other RPGmaker games, but my major issue with it is how the game starts. It's extremely tedious to go through the uneventful initial cutscene and puzzle over and over when you die. I get that it's supposed to be punishingly difficult, but I wish there was a way to skip to when you get out.\n\nOnce you are out, there's not much I've figured out how to do. You can head north and find Jim Sterling, a game critic, for some reason and play minigames. You can find a group of soldiers, one of whom may or may not be a stereotypical Brony. And lastly, there's a mother who wants a medkit for her hurt child. No matter how hard I've tried, I can not find any way to fight off the zombies, the medkit, or the horse that the Brony guy wants.\n\nI really want to enjoy this game, but it's far too cryptic and tedious for my tastes.\n\nUpdate: 5/14/10\n\nThe developer has made it so that when you die, you respawn in front of the initial building as I suggested! Unfortunately, once you're outside, there's still very little to do. The outside world has expanded a bit, but the game feels empty. Almost all the doors are locked, you can't pick anything up, you can't fight the zombies, and the few quests that there are can't be finished due to the necessary items being absent. While I still feel that this could become a good game, I don't think it was ready for Steam when it was posted or even now.","December 11, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My playtime consisted for 90% of rebooting the game because my mouse stopped working. During the little time I was actually playing all I could do was the unintuitive tutorial and the first single minute of the real game.\n\n-The dialogues are horribly written, reminiscent of what swearing twelve-year olds would say if they were having a school play or something.\n\n-The click-to-go-somewhere movement system is unhelpful when you are trying to run away from zombies and it is very weird how the game makes you hold shift to sprint when there is no punishment for sprinting and you have unlimited sprint. If there is no reason not to sprint I'll be sprinting all the time, so why don't you make sprinting default?\n\n-During the tutorial I was already able to walk into a building, so it was already glitchy from the word go.\n\n-The menu is weird and unintuitive. You can only use the mouse and when you open the options menu you can only use the keyboard for some reason. Then in that menu, the game calls the option to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode the ' resolution' option. I think they need to look again what that word means.\n\n-The audio, while not bad in it's own right, is obnoxiously loud when you boot up the game.\n\n-You can't alt-tab out of the game.\n\n-Within two minutes of starting the tutorial they wheel out Jim Sterling for no reason whatsoever except perhaps to please his fans. The guy pops up out of nowhere and is about as out of place as Justin Bieber in the men's bathroom.\n\n-The title is probably the most unimaginative one I've seen in my entire life. Not a relevant point but just something I wanted to say.\n\n- By far the most important point: the game's mouse just stops working after a certain amount of time or doesn't even work from the word go. When that happens you can't click anything anymore and as everything is mouse-controlled you have to reboot it.\n\n-The menu buttons are so not-button like that the button that starts the actual game looks like the title of the menu page you are currently on. They have to make that look button-like.\n\nAvoid this like a zombie, because it eats your money alive.","November 27, 2015","false","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I only managed to get to what I think is the military base since I have no clue what do after that. The game gives you no objective whatsoever and I had to read comments and tidbits from other players on passing certain sections of this game because nobody likes this game enough to give it a proper guide.

And why is the guy so insistent of not letting her go, even though he has, apparently, a lot of weapon that, for some reason, he broke. Why go to the outside world? The girl looks like a teenager, by her actions.\n\nAnyway, the graphics are ok, since it is one of those rpgmakerlike games, but the game doesn't achieve much. It is not really interesting at all, although cheap.\n\nIf you want to try it, go at your risk, but wait for a good sale. Otherwise, don't touch this.","February 9","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
