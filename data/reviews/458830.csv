All I see currently are extra venues, which is decent, but not really sure where they could go with that. Extra game modes? Fantasy venues?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerMountingFlame/recommended/458830/","InnerMountingFlame","[DRUNK] bridge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerMountingFlame/","61 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nYou can tell this game is still in early access. A fair few things need polishing, like the referee's voice etc. But the referee calling out to crowd to be quiet is a nice touch, even when the crowd makes no real audible noise at all...The main area that you immediately notice needs attention is the audio. But, as stated, the game is in EA so that's perfectly understandable.\n\nAs for the mechanics, the game takes probably about half an hour to get the hang of. If you already know the rules of snooker very well and watch the sport regularly it will be even quicker probably. The design of the game is good and the graphics quality are great. The controls are actually really well thought out, and the user interface is handy - particularly the aim assist, which goes red if you're aiming at a ball which isn't on, for example. Definitely a game to unwind to with a beer after work, or something light hearted to play if you're a bit stressed out.\n\nIt's surprisingly addictive, and rewarding. When you get that tricky shot on the cushion just right, and the side on the cue ball perfect, the ball pots, the white comes away from the cushion perfect for the black - it's just satisfying for any snooker fan. If you don't know snooker very well, but enjoy playing other table sports, you may also find this game really interesting. Definitely well worth the few pounds paid for.","June 3","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have a Tournement to play offline, plus multi-player options to bring some extra competition. well done devs.","May 1","true","16.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Top Marks to the Devs, this is a very easy game to recommend.\n\nMy hopes for this game would be the addition of a career mode which follows the Pro snooker tour , and who knows maybe even official licensing from the WPBSA & worldsnooker.\n\nPleasant on the eye , easy on the wallet.\n\nA quality EA game 10/10.","May 10","true","5.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But apart from that the graphics are outstanding! and the engine (which is the same as pool nation) is also very good but could be smoothened out in some areas. For the price this game is defiantly a bargain imo.  Lastly in the career mode i reckon it would be good if you add a skill point system like that of wsc 09, it would mean players would have to play more to start winning many matches ;)","May 3","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","1"

The cue ball control is non existant for the player but is spot on for the AI. If you are lucky (and i mean lucky) and you manage to get ahead in a tournament, the AI will make it almost impossible to get any kind of positional shots and you just have to sit back and watch as the AI takes frame after frame.\nHavent tried multiplayer yet but, going on the AI play so far, even in easy mode its almost impossible to achieve much.\nIts still a work in progress as i am aware but still, they could have tried to put out a better game.\nSomeone said it was a steal for the price, well, they must have had a word with the effin AI ingame because that steals all the effin shots and frames.\nJust a quick update, do not use "force play-on" on the AI after it has commited a foul as it will place the cue ball in a convienient place therefore negating the unplayable situation it had placed itself in. Also beware of the AI calling Foul" "push shot" on you when the cue ball is near the pack of reds, this is a glitch and will most certainly cost you a lot of points.\nAnd finaly, do not be disapointed when playing in the solo player tournaments, the AI is ramped up to pro level when you get into the quater finals, unless you have many hours of gameplay under your belt, its best to avoid these even when in easy mode. The AI does not like to lose thats for sure, 60 points in the lead, no problem, AI calls a foul shot, AI player makes 70+ clearance and clears the table. Who knew the AI could be so professional :-)","May 4","false","17.2"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","3"
