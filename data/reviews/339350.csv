"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/recommended/339350/","somnivore","Chewable C++","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somnivore/","2644 products in account","Wow. That was such an unexpectedly wonderful experience.\n\nAs this is a CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure), your experience may vary, but, I say with little hesitation that my own experience with the story is the most meaningful experience I've had with a game - ever.\n\nAlthough wonderful in their own right, choice oriented games like The Walking Dead and Mass Effect don't even come close to what this game accomplishes.\n\nWhat Choice Do I Have?\nCoR gives you choices.\n\nCoR gives you lots of choices that make the story feel like your own, fostering immersion in a way that traditional literature cannot.\n\nCoR gives you lots of difficult choices that may have you thinking hard and agonizing about the potential consequences. The game has no manual save function. If you make choices that lead to a premature ending, you can't undo and must start over. (such branches seem rare, though, and replaying doesn't take much time once you're familiar with the text)\n\nCoR gives you lots of difficult choices that have a real impact. Something that is uniquely possible when the creator is unconstrained by the need to create full art assets for every possibility.\n\nDeep Dive\nThis "game" has no graphics at all except for the cover image, which is exactly akin to a book cover illustration. Is it a game or a book? I say it is most certainly a game. Graphics is not a requirement of a game. Interactivity is. A series of choices that impact the experience do a game comprise.\n\nCoR's language is competent, but not "literary". It reads like a matter-of-fact narrative of events that might actually happen in your life if the stars align in just the right way. Initially, I got an "amateur" vibe from the writing, but later realized that the experience may actually benefit from the simple, contemporary writing style. As the story progressed and sucked me in deeper, I became much too busy thinking about what was going on to criticize the writing style.\n\nCoR is (mostly) accessible. Although the fact that it was written by somebody with a Ph.D. in Computer Science does show. Having a CS degree myself, I certainly appreciated that perspective. Although lots of artistic license is taken for the sake of plot, there is lots of grounding in contemporary technology.\n\nThe story makes mostly "reasonable" extrapolations starting from the near future forward several decades. Like all good science (or 'speculative', if you prefer) fiction, the story poignantly references the present while writing about the future, framing the timeless human condition in extrapolated contexts.\n\nTo elaborate about why I put "reasonable" in quotation marks above, the story explores the future in ways that could, for the most part, conceivably happen, and many futurists would even claim that CoR's extrapolation towards the Singularity doesn't go far enough. However, the author is not afraid to explore fantastic scenarios that probably won't happen, at least not soon, and in some cases, hopefully never.\n\nThe scope of the story is indeed quite epic, following the main decades of a lifetime of the character you control. I do have to object to the game description's categorization of this as a "novel", though, as it is not nearly long enough to count as one. At best, it is the length of a (very) short story (a single playthrough takes a matter of hours). On the other hand, the sheer amount of content of all possible branches easily exceed the length of a long novel (50% longer than Moby ♥♥♥♥). It's quite an accomplishment.\n\nAnd, if you are worried about this being a boring, technical slog, don't be. Despite the apparently sterile subject matter of robots, there is plenty of emotion in this game - or, at least, there can be, depending on your choices.\n\nTurn to Page 23\nI've only explored one of the many, distinct branches of CoR. I will probably be going back to explore the others.\n\nI heartily recommend CoR to anyone who can read English, especially those with an interest in technology and/or science fiction.\n\nNote that there is also a free demo where you can play through the first 2 chapters (out of 7), either via Steam, or on the developer's web site.\n\nUPDATES\nHaving now explored a few other branches and having made more "optimal" choices, I feel that choosing less optimally for the first playthrough does make for a better experience.\n\nMy first playthrough involved an above average number of failures and tragedies, which amounted to a much more poignant experience than when everything basically goes well.\n\nI do suggest playing the game "organically". Perhaps it is unlikely to play optimally the first time around anyway. Certainly I would discourage any attempts to "cheat" by looking up optimal choices beforehand. That would truly ruin the experience. You can always go back later and "fix mistakes" on subsequent playthroughs.","December 26, 2014","true","45.3"," 199 of 211 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","199","211","2","12"

My first time through I lost badly.I'm still trying to wrap my head around how my own personal choices were deemed inferior. But since it was MY story, I'll have to accept my failings, though I have to expect the creator/writer of EVERY choice I made to be willing to share those flaws.\nI've played many text games. When I began playing there wasn't much else, unless you wanted to play Pong. Zork, which I played in 1985, is still perhaps my favorite computer gaming experience. Some of the WONDERFUL Infocom games, such as "Suspended: A Cryogenic Nightmare" actually benefited from being purely text.\nI've read many pages of science fiction. Between my two favorite catagories, science fiction and fantasy, the pages literally number well over a million, so there aren't many speculative fiction concepts I've not encountered.\nBut we're here to discuss "Choice of Robots". First off, on the basis of cost/hour this is among the MOST expensive, shortest computer games I have ever played. True, it was less than $3 (on sale), but lasted under 2 hours (even with starting over on PC #2), most of the time spent in thought. There was nothing new in this game, beyond perhaps some of the more recent concepts not devised yet when I was doing the bulk  of my reading. As far as robotics, Asimov has already said pretty much everything encountered in this story, better. While Dr. Gold has allowed the reader/gamer to create his own character, or explore themselves (however briefly), a writer as good as Asimov (or numerous others) creates a world so real you believe yourself a part of it. As far as feelings of reality, I prefer the latter.\nI began it a second time, but only a few pages, so I'm not sure if I "achieved" further. I'd presume I received around 1/10th of the achievements. This presumably means one of two things: 1) either the story branched so often that, even with substantial overlap in story, there were perhaps in excess of 20 endings (seemingly too many to consider equally), or 2) the story was far more fleshed out for a prefered reader/gamer type, and I was not among them. (I don't understand the purpose behind having achievements in this game, except as a selling tool. Why create a "loser" scenario (OR winner) in a game marketed as being an individualistic world? "Personal choice"="wrong choice"?)\nThis felt less to me a story OR game, and more like a personality test, perhaps as component of a thesis. I admit, by far the majority of the time I spent was in contemplation of what the character I created might actually do if he were real. While the other characters I was given were extremely superficial, I still felt a strong obligation to create as real, AND as good, a world as possible for them to participate in. But despite MY agonizing over choices, I felt the writer rapidly lost interest in my character as I made less "literary" choices. He simply ended the story with no resolution of any kind, leaving the lead character to complete his participation several short paragraphs after life-extending, life-affirming choices. While I anticipated fighting for life using robotics as tool/metaphor, the majority of the story remaining as life choices are considered/corrected, instead I was reading the last paragraph on the final page. The overwhelming feeling was one of abandonment, much like Mary Shelley wrote of Dr. Frankenstein feeling for his creation. Except that the abandonment was of OUR jointly created world.\nQuite possibly this game/story simply wasn't written for me. Perhaps if I were educated or intelligent, or imagined greatness, there might have been some AMAZING stories in this game. Instead I'm just a regular guy with personal dreams of home, hearth and health (albeit, while dealing with greatness would be for me, a GREAT story to create, or better still, to participate in.) I've read those other people's accounts lived out THOUSANDS of times in other stories. This time I wanted it to be my story. Perhaps there are choices that would have made it longer or more interesting, but then it would not have been MY story. And after all, wasn't that the whole point?\n(4 JV)","December 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 124 of 153 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","124","153","2","9"

Unlike most games, it does everything well. It would be difficult to say what it does best, but the storyline is definitely an incredible selling point. I like to spin out every scenario in a choice game, seeing what different routes exist, and never rush through. But, honestly, after 73 hours in the game I am sure I still haven't seen every possible twist in this script.\n\nI definitely got my money's worth from time in game and enjoyment with the game. But, more than that... I found myself deeply interested in the subject matter. I've researched robotics some when I was a teacher, got my students involved in designing robots, and of course was really excited to learn about Honda's Asimo back at the turn of the Century. Now, robotics is the frontier of Science.\n\nThis narrative takes every single idea you might have thought about the Science of robotics and weaves it in to the many scenarios. There are defenses of the "value of humanity," robotics, as well as many other social constructs. And, there are many poignant comments on immigration, America's role in the world, and Capitalism. I got the feeling of seeing America through the eyes of an immigrant.\n\nBut, one of the intriguing things about the layout of the storylines is the very first choice. You start with choosing what dream you will be having at the first of the story. The four choices are all incredible perspectives on the topic of robotics. Though each one lends itself to particular endings, most of the achievements can be achieved through either of these starting points. I just finished my last achievement today with the help of an "Achievement Hunting" friend. Thanks Vance!\n\nThe game all revolves around the stats you are building with your choices in each of 4 main traits: grace, empathy, military, and autonomy. These take you into the psychology of robotics. Other factors play into your stats screen as well, such as humanity, wealth, fame, and relationships. But, these are just like tools to help you in achieving your goals with either a robot that thinks, loves, is willful, or militarily useful. You don't feel forced towards any value judgement in your choices, unless you are trying for an achievie that requires high humanity in the end. So, you get to really play with the experience of having the robot hunt down your enemies, or become your greatest friend.\n\nWhatever you choose, it's all there in the game. Btw, I haven't found another choice game I like as much as this one. Tin Star had a passable story, but it had flaws in the achievement setup, for example and lacked replay value. But, I recently got The Daring Mermaid Expedition, and want to start that next. I only hope it provides as much fun as Choice of Robots.","February 20","true","72.7"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","38","39","2","2"

Taking the role of a robotmaker, your choices might not only change your fate but that of the entire world. Takes a lot of inspiration from various roboto-based pop-cultural works and offers various branches to turn your story into a dream of a harmonic human-robot relations paradise or a Skynet meets Matrix nightmare of machines destroying mankind and robot revolt. Toys with a few existential questions too - so, I would say it's a rather well rounded package.\n\nIt is quite extensive too, and the three or so playthroughs I did always had stuff going on I had not read before - some more subtle others dramatically different. In fact, it was quite amazing to see how alternate choices turned into several story-paths, allowing me to witness the same events happening in the world from multiple perspectives (and distances). And as mentioned before the scale of your actions quickly grows to global proportions, always a plus in my book when your actions feel like they REALLY have an impact on the characters / world around you.\n\nI imagine being into science fiction helps in getting the most out of this title (it references a lot of popular scenarios) but it is so well crafted that I would recommend it as an excellent entry to newcomers to this particular niche of Steams vast game library.

From there, I could not stop picturing my robot with the green-blue twin-tails and headphones. As I began humming "World is Mine" I noticed an opportunity for DARPA funding. Naturally, I evolved my robot to be less empathetic and more militaristic. After chasing off a crowd of rioters from my intelligence compound/factory in Alaska, I began the Chinese-American war and provided an arsenal of Miku-bots to conquer Asia. Having renovated medical technology as well as reimagining war, I funded a cult to bring the Word of Miku to every corner of the world, got on the president's cabin, replaced government with robots, and gave Miku the key to control them all. Dying of "old age" I maniacally decide to build a robot double, which proceeds to step over my corpse and go to be with Miku.

But I know that I instantly fell in love with it and that I played for almost 7 hours straight.\n\nBasically, if you are open for things like this and like thought experiments about creating robots or daydream about or whatever ... I can recommend it. The writing itself is really good. Yeah, I don't want to spoil anything about the story, you should just experience it for yourself.\n\nI found it quite mindblowing, actually. It combines the best attributes of both video games and books. You have all the possibilities books offer, such as unmatched story telling and ways to express emotions and to imagine worlds, plus the ability to make choices from video games. This makes the whole experience so special and awesome, because it gets personal, it becomes your story and every single decision actually matters (and there are many)!\n\nIf you ever were annoyed with the shallow meaningless choices most AAA games have offered until this day, well, then, go for it - you won't be disappointed.\n\nYes it has no graphics and yes you definitely need to be quite imaginative to get yourself into such games - or experiences - but it's worth it.

With whatever route you take for the story, the writing is excellent and there is always that subtle taste of humor somewhere mixed splendidly well with some moving moments. This aspect of the game is what makes Choice of Robots what Choice of Robots is. The game need not any visuals because the writing provides you what you have to see in your head.\n\nThe only real complaint I have with this game (and with most text-based CYOA games on Steam for that matter) is the user interface. Playing 7 hours straight on a game with a completely white background does not at all give you painful feelings that nearly make you believe your eyes are gonna blow up from their sockets Michael Bay-style (sarcasm intended). The developers should add the option to invert the colors if the user wishes to (from a white background with black text to a black background with white text).\n\nMan, if making a robot were this easy, I would be making my Miku right now (then eventually get murdered by her in my sleep when she starts the Robot Revolution).","January 2","true","21.4"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","18","18","2","2"

If you're familiar with these games or enjoy text adventures in general, then it's simple: pick this one up, it's the best installment yet. If you're not however, it's as good a starting point as any, especially when there's a free demo that adequately presents what the game entails.\n\nRobots is about crafting, growing and teaching your own personal robot, and for someone familiar with the Choice of Games series, that's all you really need to know. Besides the wildly varied tone and settings, the majority of these games function nearly identically.  For those who are new, it's a text adventure, and what that boils down to is simply: You read a whole lot and make choices. There's no graphic, no music and no action (besides the ones being described with words). And if that puts you off, that's fair, still, the demo's free if you want to confirm your position.\n\nAs with most other games of the series, the choices you make influence your stats and how the story progress and, again, as with the other installments, the game encourages at least a certain degree of specializations. What is new, however, is that the protagonist have only one stat to keep track of, humanity, which tracks how kind, humane, social and emotional your decisions are. Your robot, on the other hand, has four stats: Autonomy, Military, Empathy and Grace, and the decisions you make throughout the game influence what kind of robot you will have, and, in turn, how you will influence the world. Would you end up with a mindless militaristic machine at your whim, a self-conscious and independent robotic sentient being or a curious, constantly learning robot with near (or perhaps completely) human emotions? Chances are, though, you're going to end up with a combination of all the things in between.\n\nWhile, like the other Choice of Games, Robots do strongly encourage specialization in at least one or two stats, the games do not seem to punish you as harshly for deviation from your initial plans. The other Choice of Games' strategic elements usually boil down to specializing in a number of areas and then make only decisions that test your strong points and avoid your weaknesses. Robots is similar, except you have more leeway and, in fact, planning becoming a lot more difficult as decisions often have unforeseen consequences. For example, there's a point in the game where you are able to make a decision on what kind of information you want your robot to extract on the internet, and allowing it to pick up whatever it wants result in it learning things like "Big Brother is watching" and "the US is the bad guy", resulting in a substantial raise in intelligence (Autonomy) and a distrust of authority (Military). There's also a point in the game where your robot is interviewed, and if your Autonomy is high enough, the review will claim your robot is smarter than humans, giving it a boost in confidence (Autonomy) while making it more arrogant (decrease in Empathy). While the unpredictability of the gameplay structure here may hamper cold strategic decision making, it also makes the story more spontaneous and exciting, as your choices can have truly unforeseeable consequences later in the game, making the narrative incredibly dynamic. That said, depending on what you choose to focus on, the game can also end up rather difficult, requiring multiple restarts, which is even more frustrating considering the fact that the game has no manual save whatsoever, forcing a restart every time you want to change something. I believe this is to make you committed to your choices and make each playthrough special and dynamic, but I still feel that the game would benefit more from having a save system of some description, especially when you've already completed the game and don't feel like skimming through most of the story to change one decision. Robots, in particular, seems to offer more consequences and variations to your decisions than any other game in the series I've experienced (skim through the achievement list if you want to know how much you could achieve, and know that I only got 10 in one playthrough, and I thought I did pretty well). That said, personally, I don't plan on replaying the game anytime soon. This is in no way a fault of the game, but rather a strength, as I feel so attached to my first playthrough that any second attempt would feel as if I've cheated that unique experience.\n\nBut gameplay aside, this is still a text adventure, and as a game that's going to make you spend the majority of your time reading, it lives and dies on the writing. Robots, like most of its predecessor, does not disappoint in this regard. There's moment of humor, melancholy, romance (with the usual inclusiveness of the series) and, perhaps most of all, introspection. The parental relationship between you and your robot becomes clear very early on, and the game handles it extremely well. Your robot grows, imitates and reacts to your actions as you would expect, with great curiosity and bewilderment. As I watch it develops, I feel proud when it understands or questions, scared when it picks up undesirable tendencies, happy when it expresses indignant at cruelty and warm when it seems more human than any living character by the end, while still having more to learn and expressing fear of the inevitable as a child would. At least that's how it was for my Sapling (that's how I named mine, and Sapling was a she and refers to me by my real name rather than titles because that's the level of customization you have), your robot could go in so many unforeseen direction it's difficult to "plan" its development, and considering the theme, I think that's the point. The human characters, while getting less attention, are well-written and varied enough in their own right, but some, even if you choose to begin a relationship with them, will feel somewhat detached from the main storyline until the latter chapters. The game, despite its initial lightheartedness and humor, asks difficult question, present morally ambiguous choices and depicts interesting, introspective themes. The final two or three chapters are the most powerful part in the game for me because it shows the growth of your robot and how you've molded the world, for better or worse, as well as calling your ideals into question. I can only speak for myself, but my ending reflected my choices appropriately, filling me with wonder, doubt, melancholy and hope. While the game has its stronger points and weaker, more filler-y portions, the finale was undoubtedly my favorite experience of any Choice of Game story.\n\nIf you enjoy the Choice of Games text adventures, then I'll just repeat myself: Buy the damn game, it's, at least in my opinion, the best in the series yet. If you have no interest in the structure and ideas behind text adventures, then I suppose there isn't much here to convince you otherwise besides good writing. If you're new and willing to try out one of these games though, I can't think of a better place to start. Choice of Robots is inspiring, funny, well-written and introspective, and for a game about robots, it has more philosophies and humanity behind it than most games out there combined.\n\np.s. If you have played and enjoyed this one, do go check out the other text adventures by Choice of Games. Only a few of them are on Steam at the moment but there are quite a lot of these games on the Choice of Games website, and they all have free demos (if they aren't already free). I always thought these games don't get enough credit and exposure so please support them if you like what they're doing.","December 20, 2014","true","10.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

But anyway.\n\nHere's a quick summary of how my first playthrough went, as spoiler free as possible:\n\n>Make a robot\n>Make a robot business\n>Looks like the potential for world domination is in sight\n>Lose robot business\n>End up contracted into designing weapons for US military, despite best efforts\n>Enter a new war of robotics with China\n>End up imprisoned by America for half a year\n>Refuse to defect to China\n>China tries to kill me\n>Live\n>War ends as a stalemate\n>Make a new robot\n>Make myself into a robot\n>End\n\nI don't normally enjoy things enough to review them, so bare with me here.\n\nMy first 'playthrough', if I could call it that, it was much more of a readthrough, of 'Choice of Robots' took me just over three hours to get through, and likely could have taken much longer, assuming that I wasn't terrible and took so many 'bad' decisions, I'd say my first read could have easily lasted me four or maybe even five hours. It should go without saying, that there is an immense amount of replayability in a game such as this. Which is to mention, replaying this is definitely something I intend on doing, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to recreate the attachment & bond I had with my three foot tall, human-like, winged 'Ariel' with multitool hands, whom was vehemently opposed to conflict as a result of my actions.\n\nSee, Choice of Robots is a game where your choices can influence the course of humanity so heavily, that the sense of creating a story just for yourself lends to a sense of wonder and beauty that I haven't really experienced in many conventional books or text-based games in perhaps forever. Even though I could tell from about halfway through that my choices were going to lead me down a seemingly 'undesirable' route, (considering that my presumption was that I would shatter Capitalism and create a Utopia) I still continued to read on and make decisions based on the situation, as the writing and sense of achievement is so fantastically constructed, that I didn't find myself feeling sad, or upset at the fact that I might not get that 'good' ending, instead, I felt happy that in what is undoubtably a story of such scale & grandeur; mine was a story revolving around me, my friends & my family. This is what, in my eyes, we'd call a testament to the brilliance of the writing.\n\nI can't speak of the aspect of how destroying the world may turn out, or how imposing a singularity upon humanity would be, but in my playthrough, the process of building up a robot in my own image, including its gender & naming it, right up to the viewpoint it had on the world, made interacting with my three foot tall companion really something quite special. Taking my creation which, at this point, had evolved into something so much more than just that, to the park, and observing the body language she gave off whilst she learned to properly kick off on a swing to propel herself up into the air was certainly pleasant. But knowing that our actions had turned her from being a military-backed weapon, into a video game loving creature of empathy? That was something else entirely; something I've not experienced before.\n\nIf you are even remotely interested in robotics, sentience, world politics and business practices, I'd heavily advise picking up this game. Even if you are just looking for a great story, you definitely won't be disappointed. I think the myriad of Overwhelmingly Positive reviews such as this give evidence to that.\n\nMy one gripe with this game, if anything, would perhaps be its length, which I don't even feel justified in saying, especially after just one playthrough. But in my particular instance, it felt as if certain sections were rushed, and that at quite a lot of stages, I didn't get the chance to sit and talk, explore and influence quite as much as I'd have liked to with other characters & situations. But this is completely forgiveable given the scale of the game and the immense replay value.","August 10, 2015","true","5.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/isisisisa/recommended/339350/","isisisisa","ISA 3000","http://steamcommunity.com/id/isisisisa/","209 products in account","I'm passionate about (some of my friends would say obsessed with) robots and I like CYOAs (Choose Your Own Adventure). This made Choice of Robots a must-buy for me and so far I'm not disappointed. Definately recommended for people who like robots or soft sci-fi and who are interested in CYOA games.\n\nFor the computer I actually prefer my CYOAs in the form of interactive fiction/text adventures (like Zork, Spider and Web, or Suspended which also prominently features robots). That way the choices can become sort of puzzles and the player can have more freedom over what to do and if it's done well can lead to awesome "wow the devs thought of everything!" moments. I think Choice of Robots would also have benefitted by that form and the freedom that comes with it, especially together with its neat stat system for your robots.\nThe freedom of choice in the game is still reasonably good. You usually get about 3 or 4 options to choose from and most of the time they are very different from each other and every option changes the course of the game quite a bit, giving a lot of replayability.\nHowever some big events will always or at least almost always happen at a certain point in the story as far as I can tell so far. They usually play out in a different way, depending on your choices, though.\n\nWhat hurts the replayability a bit is the saving system: When you close the game while in the middle of the story, you continue at the point you had reached once you start the game again but there's no option to manually save a game state or undo a choice. Arguably this makes your choices more "meaningful". But sometimes it would be nice to be able to go back and see what happens if I had done X instead of Y in an otherwise unchanged path without going through all the same choices that came before again.\nIt would also help with a few choices that are worded a little too vague but the majority is worded in a way that makes it more or less obvious what your character is going to do, so that point is not a big deal.\n\nThe story and the writing itself are nice and I enjoyed all of my playthroughs so far. You start by building your robot after your own specifications, continue to develop it depending on your choices and possibly even change the course of the whole world.\nYou can be a misunderstood genius living in your mother's basement, CEO of a multi-million dollar robot company, try to take over the world as a mustache-twirling mad scientist, or even transcend humanity towards a life as machine.\nPersonally, I would have liked inclusion of at least some more common robot tropes, like assigning basic laws (Asimov's, others or none) to the robots or being able to pursue creating pure AIs but you can't have everything.\nThere were only a couple things I didn't like but they are little details and come down to personal preferences.\nOne is the mention of actual brand names for some things (like alienware or Dr Dre's headphones). I get that they probably help to characterize some of the characters but I feel like that's a missed opportunity to use the scifi genre to full effect by inventing new original devices and imagine how today's technology could develop.\nGranted, the game takes place in the not-so-distant future of 2019 but there are also already sentient robots and flying cars.\n\nAnother thing: in several spots (most prominently character descriptions) the game appears to have been written with "political correctness" always in mind. I don't want to discuss PC in general at this place but I think that it doesn't work well as a literary device in a piece of fiction and grinding down the edges, so to speak, hurts the storytelling. Again this is a matter of preferences, just know what you're getting into if you're absolutely allergic against those kinds of things.\nIn the same vein some political aspects of the story seem a bit loaded (especially when the military, the US, or money is involved). The game is never preachy about any of this, it just seems a bit ham-fisted in some parts.\nAnyway the game is not a political or economical simulator but an interactive story about robots and it does that point well, so that are only minor points. If nothing of this bothers you, Choice of Robots is a great COYA game.\n7/10","December 22, 2014","true","5.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

It has persistant stats/traits of your robot and yourself that set it apart from just being a simple CYOA book/game.\n\nThere's, to say the VERY leasy, a plethora of branching options. There is so, so many. I have played this intensely for 13 hours I and I feel I have explored less than half of all the options. You can choose so many different things it's incredible, and I hope they do more sci-fi adventures like this.\n\nSome of the options include: Becoming a zillionare, conquering alaska, creating sexbots, making robots rule everyone, making robots serve everyone, or a mix of both. Creating a personal robot companion. And best of all, electrifying a pickle and eating lutefisk.\n\nAll these possible options and choices are determined by the stats you gather through the choices themselves. The future consequences of your choices are mostly determined by what stat you have on yourself or you robot relating to that choice.\n\nIt's quite simple, but it works very well, and if the story is good enough, the gameplay frame behind it works, too. The lack of save/load is my only qualm, and I hope they expand ChoiceScript to allow for that, because having to explore a million options by restarting the game over and over can get quite bothersome.\n\nOverall I recommend this game to anyone who has ever had even a passing interest in sci-fi or sci-fi literature, as it is not a hard thing to enjoy this, and it explores many ideas. Some of which can be ridiculous, plausible, or prophetic. It's fairly obvious a computer scientist wrote this, but I think it works well for the setting.\n\nAll in all, amazing game at what it set out to be. 9.5/10.","January 6, 2015","true","18.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Author had a way with words, don'tyasee? Plenty of moments that induced things like frission, wonder, pride and the like. You could do just about anything you can imagine with your creations, from becoming a dictator of your own nation, to subtly controlling the world through voodoo mind-trick computer program back-doors, to even establishing a religion based around your mechanical men. Because of these qualities, I would recommend it.\n\nHowever, as a warning to anybody who bought this for a similar reason that the ol' Colonel did, in hopes of exploring a "Her"-like smokin' robo-romance, I must say... The only thing you CAN'T seem to do in this game is put the moves on a hot robot missus! The content just isn't there. You can't get sweet on the first robot you make no matter what you do, and your interactions with any others feel completely forced and artificial (pun not intended, you hooligans).\n\nThere are also several "bugs" that've right flustered me, such as story branches that should be impossible - imprisoned or dead characters suddenly rising from the grave or bustin' out of the big house for no apparent reason, previous decisions that should've made certain things impossible having no influence, et cetera. Doesn't impact the story too much, though.\n\nOverall, I give this game 3 out of 5 drumsticks.","January 4, 2015","true","43.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/339350/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","***Contains spoilers from my playthrough***\n\nChoice of Games is an interesting game publisher; their games  don’t have any fancy graphical effects and they certainly don’t contain any sound, either. In fact, they  are entirely text-based  choose-your-own books. Over the years they have garnered a huge fan base who eagerly await their new releases. Choice of Robots, by Kevin Gold, is their latest game – and my first foray into their offerings – and it has left me more than a little impressed.\n\nChoice of Robots casts you as a scientist working on their PHD thesis in a university robotics lab, under the guidance of Professor Ziegler.  The choices you make in this expansive 300,000 word novel will not only determine your own fate, but could also impact the fate of the world as a whole. Every decision you make has a very real consequence and could benefit you greatly, or come back to haunt you later on down the road.\n\nWhat kind of robot you  create is entirely down to you, and Choice of Robots is very open in this regard. Whether you want to create the ultimate war machine used by the army on the battlefield, or something more useful for the general public, like a cooking robot, or sexbot, is all down to you. My own robot, called Flexo, was an empathetic, human-like machine, with arms and a sock puppet face , much to the chagrin of Professor Ziegler. Ziegler’s only concern is acquiring funding money for his department, so that he can kick back and relax while his students do all of the hard work for him. He argued that my robot was too human and would not appeal to the military, and so I appeased him by adding a hand-mounted gun to Flexo. This would be one of only a few interactions I would have with the military over the course of the book, but I was tantalised by what could have been if I had created a combat-focused machine.\n\nI soon found myself travelling to China and setting up a factory, selling directly to the consumer. Our brand of robot could be used for cooking, cleaning and childcare. It proved to be a hit and made me moderately wealthy! I was a fool to have been so easily lured by those damn slave-labour wages, though, as the Chinese government stole my designs and began manufacturing a cheaper alternative.  I got my own back on the Communist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s when I started manufacturing robots for the American army, who swiftly kicked their arses! Manufacturing military robots was never my intention though, and I returned to my initial goal:  creating realistic humanoids that could reason, laugh, and maybe, even, love?\n\n\nI had devoted my life to robotics, lost friends and created enemies, but I had never truly loved, but then I created ‘Flame’. Flame, Flexo and I lived out our lives in relative harmony, and although I hadn’t impacted the world in a hugely meaningful way, I was content with the decisions  I had made. As things go, I came  away with a positive ending for my robot lover and I.\n\nKevin Gold deftly interweaves humour, suspense, sci-fi and romance in Choice of Robots. At points I felt saddened by the results of my actions,at others I laughed heartily at the fact I was dating a robot.  Everything flows together so neatly that the game’s distinct thematic differences feel natural and intriguing. The game also has its own progress menu that keeps you up to date with how your relationships with other characters are going, and  they can change depending on your actions towards them. You can also keep tabs on your wealth, humanity, and how well your own robot is developing. Neat little touches like this give a real reason to go back and replay the game, to see how different decisions affect the outcome. Given the plethora of decisions you can make, and the number of different paths you can go down, it is clear that Kevin Gold has poured an absurd amount of time into Choice of Robots,  It is not your typical game by any stretch of the imagination, but having just completed Joe Dever’s Lone Wolf, I was happy to jump into another text-heavy adventure that let my brain do the graphics processing for a change.\n\nChoice of Robots is a fun and absorbing book, that feels like your decisions have importance. Ultimately, it is what you make it, and whether that is a war torn planet with robots that hate humans, or one where sexed up robots want to jump your bones , is up to you.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks to Choice of Games for the review copy.

Focus on how you develop your robot, and what values you think are important -- will you make your robot more empathic, able to understand humans and work with them closely? Or will you focus on strength and military, making your robot more suitable to the army?\n\nOf course, the choices you make for your robot also affect which companies or people are likely to back or fund your project, and it can have influence on your romantic relationships as well... depending on the fact if you're going down the love bot route or not. Work your way through (robot) wars, ruined friendships, deaths, and try to answer the looming question what will happen to artifical intelligence as it transcends a certain level. Does your robot have a soul? Would you love your robot and let your robot love you, if you could?

Countless hours of work has all lead up to this; you've invented a robot, the first of it's kind. Do you decide to make them out of Wood, full of beauty and grace? Or perhaps strong durable steel, all but impervious to damage!? Maybe, just some plastic polymer, you do have a budget after all. None the less, your creation shall be your own. Weather you decide to nurture them into a companion with a love of learning and humanity; or a soulless killing machine only doing what it is told to do. You shall not be alone in your task, nor shall you be unnoticed. Power struggles, international politics, corporate America; None will let you go so easily.\nYour choice is your own.\n\nChoice of Robots  is an incredible choose your own adventure style game. You can play a number of different routs with your own style, I personally like to make  some robot overlords, don't worry they're friendly  ! If you like Sci Fi or any of the Philip K. ♥♥♥♥ novels,  hell even the matrix movies are referenced and add a nice nuance to the game , then you'll dig this game.\n\nNow quick break down of the game, interface is about as minimal as you can get, your story with text and a choice, 3 options on top;\nStats: view you robots stats and your money in pocket.\nRestart: there are no save slots, no save scumming out a different ending here buddy.\nAchievements: self explanatory.Though I find this helps the game out, it doesn't force you to envision what the devs had in mind but instead allows you to make your own characters and scenery up in your   imagination  . This might be difficult for some if you're just that bland but, come on it's a CYOA game.\n\nAll in all  tl;dr  9/10, this game made me cry on more than one occasion and then had me spiral into a ocean of introspection all while lifting me back up and making me smile and feel happier about my decisions. With out the use of graphics or much of an interface Choice of Games has made characters that feel as real as the friends, family, and rivals you have in your own life, all wrapped up in a wonderful world not far off.","February 15, 2015","true","11.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Mixed because, while I ultimately cannot recommend its purchase, it OOZES of potential.  Potential that was, unfortunately, not realized.\n\nThe first half, arguably the first two thirds, are a delight.  The pacing is fantastic, and the writing is superb.  I felt a genuine attachment to the characters, and the tight, personal focus helped make my decisions feel impactful.  Maybe not on a global scale, but on a tight, individual level that mattered to me.\n\nAll that falls apart as the game goes on and the scope of the story expands.  As the game goes on, several years at a time pass at the same rate a single year passed earlier on.  The pacing jump feels jarring, at best, alarming at worst.  As the story wore on, I found myself growing less and less attached to the characters involved, even those I had previously cared about, simply because my interactions with them were often separated by in-universe years at a time.\n\nThough Choice of Robots has its merits, ultimately the experience does not warrant its price tag, in my opinion.  It tries to be too much too quick, and loses itself in the process.  It's cheap, sure, so if you REALLY wish to try it, you'll get something from the experience.  But there's better interactive fiction out there for free.\n\nA great idea with poor execution.

In fact, my school time ended more than twenty years ago. Since then, the WWW is the most relevant exercise.\n\nWith that in mind, I was more than excited about this game.  Reading was fluent, through playing I had to look up for ca. 15 words or less. It was entertaining, suprising and I thought about game's decisions in off-gaming time. COR was even good for some loud loughings. Right after the first (around 4.5 to 5 hours) playthrough I started a second one. Imho one of the greatest compliments one can make about a game.\n\nCOR was my first interactive novel game ... others will follow, but they will have to meet a high standard. Thank you, Kevin Gold.\n\n####\n\nAn deutsche Steam-Nutzer, die vor der Entscheidung stehen ... Ihr habt's gelesen - mit alten Schulenglisch (und das war noch nicht mal besonders gut) kommt man hier sehr gut aus. Es ist (wie Vorposter schon sagten) kein Shakespeare, doch m.E. sehr gut geschrieben. Gebrauchsliteratur im besten Sinne. Die Wendungen kamen für mich teilweise unerwartet, die Geschichte eines Lebens als ganzes (von Anfang 20 bis ca. 70) war höchst spannend. Klare Kaufempfehlung.\n\n####\n\nFirst edit: Took a second playthrough. Although I have not finished yet, the story is different to 60 percent . Sure... there are main circumstances, which will probably never change, but the way to deal with it offers great freedom\n\n...\n\nSecond edit: Beaten the game three times - each time refusing to build military super robots. But the relationship to humans and robots differed significantly. Perhaps I will try some time the "way of the gun" ...

Additonally, while Choice of Robots doesn't neccesarily explore any "new" concepts about A.I. and such, the storyline is quite thought-provoking and, at times, a bit sad.

This game seems to have 3 or 4 main stages.\n\nStage 1: You're a grad student working for his/her PHD under a professor Zeigler (or something like that), the year is about 2021 and you are creating a robot, little do you know this little critter (depending on how you play the game) will revolutionise the modern world of robotics. You have (in my mind anyway) 2 main stats, fame and humanity, your robot also has stats: Grace, Autonomy, Empathy and Military. Both your stats and your robots are effected by your choices and actions.\n\nStage 2: You either work for your friends company or you own your own company. Your earlier choices effect what kind of robots you specialise in so military, friendly and intelligent AI, surgery, work-bots or just mass production. I shan't spoil the suprise but war is declared by the US against China.\n\nStage 3/4: You are at war with China, how much you contribute to the war effort will affect the outcome. After the war, depending on your stats you can either create a rebellion against the winning side of the war in Alaska, create the algorithms for the perfect peaceful society, create companion bots or something else I can't remember.\n\nStep 5: I shan't spoil too much but it can be rather emotional :'(\n\n\nIt's basically a telltale game without the lag or sound... or visuals.\nI'd recommend this game to anyone apart from people who struggle with reading. 100% stars out of 5...

After a few pages into it, I fell in love with it, and consequently my little robot child.\n\nAs other reviewers have said already said, it's hard not to give away any story spoilers while discussing PROs and CONs, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nThe game does a great job of giving you several ways to navigate throughout the story, while making each story "branch" or "path" just as detailed as the others you passed over. While some of these CYOA games feel like choosing one option over the other is only to gain/change some stat, with little variance in the rest of the story,  Choice of Robots  does not do this. It's also incredibly written, with just enough detail to help you envision the story, while giving your brain the freedom to "fill in the holes" to your desire on how something/someone looks. For example, you design a robot specifically pick out certain components/aspects of it that give you a general basis of how it looks. However, someone else may have picked the same exact makeup of their robot but imagine it differntly in their head because the writing leaves things purposefuly open for you to imagine.\n\n\nIn short, if you really enjoy scifi writing and the idea of advanced robots in the near future, you'll absolutely love this game. Even if you don't, like me, you'll probably still end up enjoying it and admire it for the plot and detailed writing.\nIf you hate CYOA games, which is totally fine, .... yeah you probably won't enjoy it. But you wouldn't be reading this review if you absolutely hated them would you? I don't know. I'm done.","December 24, 2014","true","9.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The first opening chapter is simply, amazing. The atmosphere, pacing, character development is up par of that of a best selling novel. Everytime a choice is given (which there's alot) I'd carefully consider what my next step would be, And the aftermath of my choices seemed so delightful and vastly different.\n\nBut for some reason, the book suddenly rushes itself as it comes to the end. The delicate description of what the characters were feeling becomes... dull, and although the occuring events seems to be big, not enough attention and focus is given. It kinda felt like the author suddenly changed mid-game. Great beginning, but kinda weirdly unsatisfying end.","August 21, 2015","false","6.4"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","22","39","0","0"

My second playthough I took the role of a typical "profits first" CEO and ended up with a race of robots determined to take over the planet.   With a gun pointed at my head I either had the choice of helping them achieve singularity or I would be killed.\n\nThe amount of work put into this book is rather amazing.  The beginning is repetitious in subsequent playthroughs because the time is spent designing and building your robot.  After this point, however, your story can vary wildly.  A lot of philosophical questions are addressed throughout your life.  It's reminiscent of Asimov in a number of ways.  Occasionally, you are limited to choices that differ from what you want to do, but not often.\n\nFor completionists, there are a number of achievements to get depending on what you've done or who you've become.  The game suggests you look through them, I suggest you avoid doing so unless you have played through many times.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a book, but I couldn't put it down.  Plus, the digital format helps avoid the temptation to cheat skipping ahead to the results.

What made this game so enjoyable for me is the way that the game puts the player into morally compromising positions. You're forced to think carefully about the decisions you make as they actively shape the world in which the game unfolds, and the wide variety of decision making options throughout each chapter makes you feel fully in control and does a good job of removing the usual feeling of limitation that can be experienced in many decision-based games similar to this. Multiple endings shaped by your decision making and a great storyline ensures that the player gets their money's worth despite the minimalist design, although I can't help but feel that the addition of a soundtrack or illustrations would have made this experience more fulfilling. Absolutely worth the price, but less story-oriented players could easily get bored.","June 30, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Some of the romances in particular feel overly rushed to "get to the good parts", and involve little more than direct options of "make this person boy/girlfriend?" "yes" "YOU ARE NOW DATING!" Maintaining it is mainly a matter of "I will dislike you if you make choices related to specific topic I am focused upon", such as Elly's humanitarianism, or Tammy's paranoia about the government.\n\nThe character that is overwhelmingly the most focused-upon, besides your own, however, is the one character you can't date, your prototype robot.  You can get her to love you and spend forever with her, but even making love-bots mainly means creating a new character to be a "younger sibling" that has far less development.\n\nLikewise, in spite of the fact that your romantic interest could be there at "birth" for your robot, your robot considering you "father"/"mother", and your romantic interest actively being involved in remodeling your robot, there is almost no interaction between your robot and your romantic interest.  (I.E. If I'm "father", why is Elly not "mother"? Why doesn't Elly try to impress some of her humanitarianism upon the robot? She instead chooses to just sit back and judge the way you raise the robot all by yourself.)\n\nThat said, however, it's dirt cheap, and I seriously stayed up all night just mulling over what it was telling me, trying to puzzle out the right answers, or else trying to find some way to wiggle through the requirements, and find a way to get everything (or at least, a greater share of what) I wanted.","October 8, 2015","true","130.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This isn't unplayable garbage, nor is it mindless. However, its attempts at intelligence only set it to a higher standard, which it fails to live up to.\n\nFirst, a story is a lot shorter than I thought it would be-both of the two endings I reached took less than half an hour to get to. This means it's not nearly as deep as the promised "300,000 word epic"-oh, even if it has that many in its files, you'll see just a tiny portion of it. So that's one problem. The second is that while my first playthrough was genuinely "in-character" and ended up with me getting a "bad" (though not unexpected) ending, my second had me actively trying to munchkin my way to a good one (and being at least partially successful).\n\nThat I resorted to this was not a good sign. The game is too complex and has too many outcomes for one to just follow a strict "Do X to see Outcome Y", like in some similar "choose your own adventure"-style games. But the differences in outcomes themselves aren't great enough for the complexity to be worth it. Nor is the story great or intellectually stimulating enough-though it tries- to be worth repeating many times.\n\nEnding up as neither robo-fish nor robo-fowl, Choice of Robots disappointed me.","February 25, 2015","false","2.6"," 39 of 73 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","39","73","0","0"

You have a decent amount of control about the type of robot(s) you will build, and what kind of business or other ventures you will engage in. However, the interactions with other characters are somewhat limited, and become increasingly detached as the story leaps ahead years from page to page. If you've traded your humanity for success, that's a plausible enough story mechanism, but if you're doing a more "humane" run-through, it takes away from the immersion. Overall the last half or one-third of the story feels rushed, and even though the scope of the story is usually quite grand by that point, I found myself uninterested in it.\n\nThe writing in this story is tolerable, but not particularly good. What breaks the game for me, however, are the continiuty errors. For example, in one play-through, your lover ends up disappearing, causing you great emotional distress. Then, a few sections later, in a passing line, the story notes that this same lover has left you because of a particular political choice you made. Nowhere was it mentioned that the lost love returned safely, so it makes zero sense for them to have reappeared without explanation only to leave you again. This sort of continuity error takes away all value from the "choose your own adventure" aspect of the game and sadly makes me unable to recommend it.","January 3","false","2.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","0"

Some of the moments in the game were true tearjerkers!\n\nOverall a very solid 5/5 from a gamer who was initially hesitant in getting into text-based CYOA games. This game has wholeheartedly made me a fan of this style of fiction for life!\n\nSo kudos! I would recommend anyone reading this review to pick this game up.","July 29, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And on that merit alone this one succeeds with flying colours. It's just so well written, I really can't praise author Kevin Gold enough. His real-world technical understanding of the concepts involved make Choice of Robots emminently immersive and believable without going (too far) over your head. And beyond the technical details, this is just good old fashioned great storytelling. Whether you choose to roleplay the asocial genius with only robots for friends, a cuthroat captain of industry, a devoted lover, an artist, a power hungry tyrant, or any other of the myriad life paths Choice of Robots presents, this game will tell you a story that is fundamentally about being human. And it's a compelling one at that.\n\nEvery time I sit down to play, I'm choosing to reinvest my precious time in a game that I know is going to make me really feel something, and often it's something completely different from the last playthrough. I feel thrilled when a long term goal comes to fruition, and conversely the way things spiral out of control sometimes can be genuinely upsetting. Whether I achieve my starting goals or not, almost every playthrough prompts me to redefine what it means to win. Because five playthroughs in, I'm still finding myself becoming attached to the small cast of characters in new ways. I can't say that about many other games.\n\nAlthough the replay value of this game is quite high because of all of that, there is one caveat. I'll call it the Taris Effect (KOTOR players will already know what I mean). The story will always start the same way, and there are only a limited number of ways out. The choices in these first big branches can become familiar, and the immediate results start to lose their impact after only a few plays. In Choice of Robots' defense, the number of smaller and more unique branches quickly multiply once you get off Taris out of school. Not really a dealbreaker I'd say.\n\nOverall, if you're looking to try something new or even if you just liked choose your own adventure stories as a kid, then I highly recommend Choice of Robots.","April 15, 2015","true","19.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After reading, or "playing", Choice of Robots for a couple of minutes I was absolutely stunned. The story drags you in as it builds up momentum the more you read, and you end up pressing the 'next' button repeatedly to learn what happens after. It is a great novel, not a long one, but a good one. It is easy to read, and you often find yourself emotionally attached to the different characters that you encounter throughout the story, making sometimes tough decisions which ultimately changes the outcome of the entire adventure.\n\nChoice of Robots is definitely something I will recommend to people. The fact that it is interactive allows the reader to take a greater part in the story and feel that their own presence is present in the story; you are there, you are the protagonist. The choices you make create the story.\n\nFor the low price it is listed here on Steam, Choice of Robots is worth getting. My only suggestion for improvement would be to allow greater interactions with some of the characters, but other than that, Choice of Robots is a solid piece of entertainment. 9/10.","March 13","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

The relationships I developed felt more "real" than most other C.Y.O.A. games (the exception being the Heroes Rise Trilogy) and I genuinely felt bad when I pushed friends away for the sake of the growing demand for my robotic knowledge.  My ending felt a tad rushed but it may have been due to my overall decisions having little differentiation from my initial stance on robotics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melfice_cyrum/recommended/339350/","melfice_cyrum","Melfice_Cyrum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melfice_cyrum/","81 products in account","I was recommended (and later gifted) Choice of Robots by a friend.  I'm a huge Transformers fan, so a game entirely revolving around the idea of playing a character that creates robots and the impact/influence that has on the world immediately grabbed my attention.  I tried the demo, and was hooked.\n\nI'd never heard of the developer, "Choice of Games" before now, but their other works are of a similar vein.  All of them are basically text-based CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) games, much like the old CYOA books of our childhood.  You play a character is can be like, or unlike yourself, and progress through a series of choices that can have a variety of branches, leading the story's eventual conclusion.\n\n"Choice of Robots" follows the life of a young college student, trying to build their own robot.  It starts with a cryptic dream sequence (an excellent plot hook I might add), before going into 'character creation', which consists of selecting a name (either a custom one, or chosen from a list), and your gender.  (I should note, you can only select 'boy' or 'girl', so NB people don't get an option, sorry!)  From there, you make choices which influence a variety of stats (which can be easily checked), including your Fame, Wealth, status of your relationship with the NPCs, and other numerical values.  The status screen even gives you a summary of all the completed chapters so far, sort of an abridged version of your story.\n\nThe writing is well done.  It's vague enough that you can easily imagine events or people in your head as you would want them to be, while still giving them enough detail that it's not a complete blank space.  There's a template, and you can fill the gaps.  The way the game interprets your choices is quite fascinating too.  Even small, seemingly insignificant choices can influence future areas.  Not all influences turn out to be significant, but it does address and acknowledge choices you've made, so it feels like you're having a greater push on the story.\n\nHowever, for all of the game's interactivity and originality, it falls (sometimes painfully) flat in a few areas.  The biggest and probably most damning thing, is the lack of a save/load function.  It autosaves your progress, so if you need to take a break, you can shut it down, go do something else, come back, and immediately jump back in.  And with the summary in status, you can easily determine where you're at.  But without a hard save function, you literally have to start completely over to experiment with new branches and decisions.  This does give a sense of finality and weight to the story, since you can't save-scum for an "ideal" outcome (to whatever degree a player would consider 'ideal anyway), but it makes trying out different decisions painfully tedious, as you have to start over totally anew each time.\n\nThis leads to the second issue, and one that most adventure games always fall into, and was the trap of the CYOA-genre: replayability.  While Choice of Robots has a LOT of variation, after a while you do start to notice the patterns.  You'll start to know which options lead to what future choices.  Eventually, it probably becomes second-nature what sort of paths lead to a particular ending.\n\nWhich ironically enough, leads to a sub-issue of this problem.  While some of the patterns are obvious, others are not.  Painfully not.  There's a few branches I have NO idea how to access, because the options you'd need aren't very obvious, and the achievement descriptions don't help at ALL.  And as there's no guides, it's a constant stream of trial and error.  This also hurts in-game.  It's not always obvious how good (or bad) a stat should be to elicit a particular response, or to enable particular choices, which again, can only be determined through trial and error, and a LOT of it.  So be prepared that if you're someone who really wants to earn/unlock everything, it'll take some time.\n\nThe NPCs tend to suffer as well.  As the story focuses on your avatar and his creation, the NPCs, while recieving a modicum of development, don't really tend to be more than accessories to the overall story.  There's a variety of them, and story does do justice to fleshing them out at times, but after a point they sort of fall into scripted roles and don't really contribute to the story beyond being names.  And scripting can be a problem as well.  There's a few milestones you simply cannot avoid, and a few events where you would think there should be a third option or a way to avoid having to go A or B, but none exist.\n\nEven with these issues, Choice of Robots is an excellent game considering you can get it for under 3 dollars right now (until the sale ends after New Years anyway).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who:\n\n- Wants a fun little diversion from the madness of Triple-A games\n- Loves robots\n- Enjoys the CYOA genre\n- Has a few bucks to spare","December 26, 2014","true","34.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I guess I just took a lot of time to read and ponder the options. I also played through the night, so my tiredness might have affected the time it took me to read.\n\nThere are a lot of options. A lot. And a lot of possible outcomes.

I came back recently and discovered I'd barely burned through three quarters of the content. The appeal of "Choice of robots" (which, i would like to add, sounds like the name of an intelligent drone catologue "hint hint") is that there are a mind boggling amount of ways the story can go, but I won't spoil anything.\n\nOk, bad stuff. The "choice of" games are often criticised for the lack of a save feature, I can go either way with that, make your own mind up. A large chunk of the difference applied in "Choice of robots" comes down to the girl (or guy) you've got in your crosshairs if ya know what im sayin'. And speaking of which, the game can carry a very "Mass effect 3" feel, in the sense that "You can and will sleep with any of these characters if you perform the right action". Slight exaggeration, but you get the idea.\n\nBut the story actually pulls you in succesfully, the system works by making choices that affect the story, as you would imagine, but while most of the "choice of" games have your own stats monitered depending on your choices, your choices instead mainly affect your robot creation. The 4 stats are: Empathy, Autonomy, Grace and Military, and your choices can either raise or lower your robots "efficiency" for want of a better word, in each category. A slight problem with this system, how am I supposed to KNOW IF MY STATS ARE ENOUGH FOR THIS CHALLENGE? This happens very rarely but i remember at one point where I was told I was applying for funding, and my highest stat (Empathy) was automatically chosen to measure the test, turns out I was spreading my decisions out too far, and my stat wasnt high enough, it wasn't "Game over" or anything like that, and in the end, it didn't result in Bad Ending omega where everyone dies in a freak robot uprising accident, but the point is, I was given absolutely no warning that I should have been focusing on one stat, or I would be failing a challenge. Granted: This event was put in place to subtly hint to the player that things aren't going to be very dandy for you and your robot if you try to do everything, but that was dashed when my character LITERALY SAID: "Do you want to do everything? (insert robot name)" Obviously the robot says yes.\n\nAlright, rant over. Do NOT go into this game looking for a multitude of massively different endings, there isn't. It isn't mass effect 3 levels of anti climactic where a different filter gets put over one ending, and the endings are all (mostly) sufficiently climactic ,but the story is about the journey, not the endings. And that journey is a damn absorbing one.","January 12, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a very well written novel in seven chapters, and while similar things happen during these seven stages, exactly what happens and how it interacts with later chapters is entirely up to you.  When they say the choice (and consequences) are yours, they mean it.\n\nYou might not expect much replay out of an interactive novel - certainly I didn't.  Well, I'm currently in my third playthrough.  Again, the core events happen, but exactly how and what comes as a result is entirely up to you.  The endgame for the two complete playthroughs so far were very different.\n\nDo you want to be the 'bad guy' and, as the ad says, try to take over Alaska?  Do you want to try and launch a golden age with robots and humans side by side?  You can do both, or neither.  Each choice you make has the opportunity to lock or unlock certain issues, and how you handle these issues directly affects how your robots turn out.\n\nThe writing is top of the line:  The author is obviously well versed in the English language.

Probably a depiction that the developer would approve of. After plenty of playthoughs, I am still stunned in how many ways you can fundamentally influence the development of the story. It is more than a simple "author prefers his story line, but you are free to do small deviations", there are many touching situations to occur. This game indeed does live up to a "choose your own adventure". It sparsely uses generally favorable options, doesn't leave space for annoying rolling the dice and gives you free hand to influence the future and the development of your child-like robot at the same time.\nIf you like games of this genre, this is a must-have.

Though I believe that a chapter based savng system could have been nice, (i.e: if you mess up you can restart from the beginning of X chapter instead of the beginning) overall it was a nice change of pace from other games i've played where you have the option to fix things and stuff.\n\nI think the level of consequence in the game is great too. It really made me think about the decisions I was making and how they would affect my robots but also the people around me. And I especially love the little "moments of clearity" you get later on as the reader. without spoiling it, I loved when I realized near the end that I could have researched something way earlier on and possibly been better off for it :P\n\ntldr: the game hurts but it's a good hurt, I totally recomend the game to anyone who likes "choose ur own adventure" type things, robot drama, or is a robophile (lol), and I'll def be on the look out for new games from this group","November 23, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I came back recently and discovered I'd barely burned through three quarters of the content. The appeal of "Choice of robots" (which, i would like to add, sounds like the name of an intelligent drone catologue "hint hint") is that there are a mind boggling amount of ways the story can go, but I won't spoil anything.\n\nOk, bad stuff. The "choice of" games are often criticised for the lack of a save feature, I can go either way with that, make your own mind up. A large chunk of the difference applied in "Choice of robots" comes down to the girl (or guy) you've got in your crosshairs if ya know what im sayin'. And speaking of which, the game can carry a very "Mass effect 3" feel, in the sense that "You can and will sleep with any of these characters if you perform the right action". Slight exaggeration, but you get the idea.\n\nBut the story actually pulls you in succesfully, the system works by making choices that affect the story, as you would imagine, but while most of the "choice of" games have your own stats monitered depending on your choices, your choices instead mainly affect your robot creation. The 4 stats are: Empathy, Autonomy, Grace and Military, and your choices can either raise or lower your robots "efficiency" for want of a better word, in each category. A slight problem with this system, how am I supposed to KNOW IF MY STATS ARE ENOUGH FOR THIS CHALLENGE? This happens very rarely but i remember at one point where I was told I was applying for funding, and my highest stat (Empathy) was automatically chosen to measure the test, turns out I was spreading my decisions out too far, and my stat wasnt high enough, it wasn't "Game over" or anything like that, and in the end, it didn't result in Bad Ending omega where everyone dies in a freak robot uprising accident, but the point is, I was given absolutely no warning that I should have been focusing on one stat, or I would be failing a challenge. Granted: This event was put in place to subtly hint to the player that things aren't going to be very dandy for you and your robot if you try to do everything, but that was dashed when my character LITERALY SAID: "Do you want to do everything? (insert robot name)" Obviously the robot says yes.\n\nAlright, rant over. Do NOT go into this game looking for a multitude of massively different endings, there isn't. It isn't mass effect 3 levels of anti climactic where a different filter gets put over one ending, and the endings are all (mostly) sufficiently climactic ,but the story is about the journey, not the endings. And that journey is a damn absorbing one.","January 12, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, there are a few paths that basically lead towards the same directions and the same events that happen no matter of your choices in game. In other words it is the same skeleton, but the skin differs based on your choices.\n\nNow I wish I could say more, but experimenting with different paths is too time consuming as there is no save-game feature. I mean the game saves when you exit, but if you make a mistake, it means you must restart the game. So experimenting with different branches after the initial playthrough is discouraged, due to the tediousness of having to go through the same choices everytime to get to a divergent point that you are interested in.\n\nI have few hours on record due to the fact that I completed the game twice in a relax reading session, but again, the lack of a Back option or of a Save feature, discouraged me, as I do not like tedious activities. As such I couldn't experiment more with it.\n\nI would rate it at a pleasant 8/10, good content, diverse storytelling based on your choices, you actually get to care for your actions. If it had a save feature so I can easily play other divergen paths, I would've rated this 10/10","January 19, 2015","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very first time playing saw me attempting to create a robot who could have the whole human experience. I set of on my own without any money with my first creation, Adam, and lived with my girlfriend Elly. Despite trying to stay out of the limelight, I still seemed to find myself in the wake of total wars, robotic-organic relations, etc. After being released from max security prison (long story) for attempting rebellion against the increasingly totalitarian government (longer story), I married Elly, created a second robot named Eve, and moved away to a small house in Alaska. Eve fell in love with me, and as much as I loved seeing my creation display such emotion I couldn't reciprocate. As a result, Eve's life was misery. One day I passed out, and was diagnosed with having a life threatening genetic disorder. Refused treatment and attempted to build my own robotic vessel, dealing with the emotions of my 'family' all the way. Current body finally passed, wife watching over me and firmly holding the hand of the new me.

At first I was very happy and I thought I was going to make the right choices and get everything I wanted. Then my dad died, Josh died, I couldn't stop the war from starting, I lost my company trying to help Silas and Eiji, I've been in jail, that Ziegler stole my robots, I couldn't get revenge, the robot friend I was starting to like wants to be a couple, and now my robot named "Hope" killed someone. I started to laugh. I stopped caring about everything, but I continued playing anyways. I bought the best lawyer and tell him to treat Hope as a pet and we won. But Hope was angry and ran away. Somehow (a game glitch) Hope was still with me after that. Unless at the beginning of the story, I always felt like everything bad that happened was somehow my fault, while at the same time I felt like I was nothing. Some time later, I died. End.\n\nTL;DR of the second time I played\nI left robots to be secondary. Bad things happened sometimes, but everything was ok at the end. I helped A LOT of people and everyone was happy. And I didn't die!\n\nMy story first story (that I wrote before playing for a second time). SPOILER ALERT\nOk so I was happy because this game looked like what could happen to me, because the protagonist has my exact age and I'm creating an artificial intelligence. I didn't like the fact of working for the military, so they finaly fired me. That Ziegler is stupid. I didn't feel I had the experience of founding my own company, until I found Silas. He was my first employee, and I started to make robots for Hospitals at Detroit because Silicon Valley seemed too expensive. One of the robots I sold killed a patient but- Oh, who cares?? Then there was a bomb -I never figured out who or what was the cause- and I told my non-sentient robots to save the humans inside. Josh sacrificed himself to save important documents against my warning, and the robots were angry because I didn't try to save the rest of them but that doesn't make any sense because I didn't programm them to have feelings...??? Then thanks to the stupidness of Josh (that poor Josh) my company was saved. Oh yeah I forgot: Silas left the company because goverment was spying and I didn't fight them. But now he's here again and I LIKED HIM U KNOW ;_; but he asks me for help and then RUNS AWAY!! But yeah ♥♥♥♥ him. Then I learn that Eiji's on danger (that manga-maker friend that reminds me of a real life friend who likes manga too) and I warn him, but then I get arrested. I'M IN JAIL!! I want rebellion. The president Irons gets me out of there with the condition of making robots for the military. I said yes, while my idea was to betray them once my robots were everywhere and stop the war somehow... Crazy, eh? Welp, somehow the war ended much sooned than I expected, but I was rich. I didn't get my revenge. I didn't care anymore. I made another robot and named it "Hope" while my idea was to teach him the basics and leave him live his own life without me; like to leave free a part of myself, and then end my days living as a rich without a care. But the game didn't let me choose that option, and Hope, Ivory (who is my first robot) and me, go living at the town of Hope, in Canada. Oh the irony. That wasn't planned, I swear. When I was starting to see Hope as what his name says, and I started to care again, something bad happens... again. Police calls and tells me that my robots killed someone. I started to laugh. I stopped caring about everything, I just wanted it to end. But I continued. I got the best lawyer and tell him to see Hope as a pet. We won but he got angry and left me- "one morning you wake to find Hope gone" I laugh at that... Then he somehow (a game glitch) is still with me. Hm :/ Some time later I die. In the dream at the end, I told Hope that I was glad to be his friend, then he said "Thanks" and SUICIDED. "Go to hell", I said. If you can't understand that I'm not in love with you, if you can't look for another girl, then you are dumb. I just wanted a friend. End.\n.\n.\n.\nMy second story\nChapter 1\nI make a metal rotary-wing robot with a panoptic head and Inspector Gadget arms named Guardrone, because one of the reasons my first story went wrong was because my robot couldn't help anyone, and this time I want it to be strong. At first I don't want a boyfriend, but I end up being with Eiji because in the first story I died "alone" and bored, and I don't want that to happen again.\n\nChapter 2\nEven if Guardrone looks like it's made for military, I want it to be good and I teach it as I teached the robot in my last story and increase its Empathy, and I keep being funded by DARPA...\n\nChapter 3\n...until I let the reporter Mark to interview me and Guardrone, because that makes Ziegler angry. Mark writes a positive article about me and Guardrone, and Silas finds me again, the same way he found me in my last story. I treat him the same way even if I don't trust him like before. My dad dies (I thought I could prevent this but I guess not) and I decide to create my own company named Effort, to create the best medical technology.\n\nChapter 4\nI make a contract with Galen Medical, buy a factory in Silicot Valley and hire only human workers. Everything was fine except I there was not enought money, and China stole my technology, so I went bankrupt. I went to live with Eiji and started to work for Josh. Something political happened (I don't understand politics) and the war between the United States and China started.\n\nChapter 5\nThis time, I didn't care that Ziegler was stealing my robots, and I accepted to work with Captain Rogers but only if my robots were nonviolent. Silas asked me to help him, like last time, and everything went exactly the same way as in my last story, except this time I didn't care that he betrayed me, and I thought I could save Eiji because my Guardrone was better for protecting people. But when the agent came, I did't want to risk my freedom, I didn't want to go to jail like last time, and I thought that maybe, if they capture Eiji but they let me free, maybe I could get him out of there somehow. But I couldn't, there weren't any options for that. America lost the war, and as I had a lot of Grace, I could choose the option of "develop resource allocation algorithms that gradually made human governments irrelevant."\n\nChapter 6A (why that "A"?)\nMany people felt displaced, but I decided they had to deal with it. I helped Josh, I didn't hate Ziegler anymore so I said nice things to him, I convinced Mark to not suicide, I let Juliet Rogers to be Batman if she wanted, I let Silas and some other people to believe what they wanted about robots (they made a Church) but never encouraged them to do it. And I had Eiji and my son Angel (how cheesy, I know. I thought of naming him Soul or Spirit, because I wanted to highlight his humanity, but I chose Angel because its a real people name and it's similar to what I had in mind).\n\nChapter 7\nMy surgical technology kept my mom alive this long. I had that stroke again, but this time I didn't saw a robot in the dream, but Eiji, and I was happy with that. I left robots being absolutely secondary in this story. Even if maybe this time could have gone well, I didn't risk going through surgery, and I decided to let Angel ignorant about this. Maybe in the future they will be able to cure him. Eiji approved my decision. While I was in Angel's birthday party, I was about to faint again, but I could fight it because I had 93% humanity! Yay! So we lived happily ever after.\n\nThe End. :)","June 13, 2015","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

No graphics, no gameworld, no combat. But what is one to expect from an interactive novel. Since i am such a stickler for form, i will still rate the game according to my normal nine criteria.\n\n\ngenre: 3\n\nit is the best interactive novel i have "played", at least in terms of making choices that matter.\n\n\n\ncharacter customization, mods, etc: 1\n\nYou can pick male or female. That is it. You do get to pick whether you are interested in wealth, military, or idealism. But i wouldn't really consider this a character.\n\n\n\nstory, mission, relevance: 3\n\ndon't expect War and Peace, because the writing has no literary merit, but there is plenty of story and your choices do matter. I have played through the story 5 times, and got 5 very different stories. There are at least 4 romantic partners (2 male, 1 female), there is a war, there is how your character will live out their life. In an interactive novel, i want my choices to matter. They definitely matter. In one of my play throughs, one of my choices resulted in my character dying in 10 minutes. I found this surprising, and satisfying.\n\n\n\ngameworld: 1\n\nnot really a "game world", but there is a world you react to by making choices (usually 3). And the world does change. By your choices, the game world will either have you win, lose, or stalemate a war, build robots that help or harm humanity, or cause the world your character lives in experience a revolution. Certain key characters will thrive or die, including yourself, based on those choices. But this is not what i would call a game world. You don't pick up anything. You never see a picture of a single character or scene. You do a lot of reading.\n\n\n\ninnovation: 0\n\n\n\nmechanics, combat, saves: 0\n\n\n\n\nreplayability: 3\n\nlike i said above, i played it 5 times, and got five different stories, including different endings and romantic partners. And i haven't exhausted the game's choices yet. I haven't played as a dreamy idealist. Haven't explored all the romantic possibilities. Still some "gaming" to do.\n\n\n\nuniqueness: 2\n\nthe fictional world is a sci-fi cliche. As the title suggests, it is a world full of robots. Being a lover of sci-fi, i am okay with that. I did find the number of choices a bit unique.

The only reason I bring this up, is that some reviewers mentioned an inability to save, so I'm assuming the save-issue has since been resolved or was non-existent because I had no problem.","December 19, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There isn't even enough, if it were on sale for $1.\n\nIt's a branching path story game that decides what story to give you based on your alignment of a couple sliders. The choices are obvious as to which alignment they affect (building a metallic robot increases its military, and decreases its grace; giving it wings gives it grace and reduces its military usefulness). But, the story has to keep prompting you to interact with different parts of the decision tree, so you get weird things like being a multi-millionaire and choosing to employ humans in your factories in Detroit, but then you go to war with China, and now you're sorry you ever let the Chinese get near these things. What? When did the Chinese gain the ability to rip off my robots and make them militaristic? Oh, because I used cheap chinese lithium ion batteries? That's ridiculous. If my company is successful, and there's design changes happening, and materials are getting upgraded, let me source better batteries from somewhere else. Don't make me pick a motorcycle battery when my company is supremely profitable.\n\nIt's not open to be whatever you want it to be. You're allowed to type only on fields that don't matter: your name, your robot's name, your robots pronouns. You can't affect the story, you can affect the flavor text. If you choose one of the built in options you will rarely have a tie in back to the originator (Isaac Asimov names are one of the built in options, so you can get references back to those books in later dialogue if you themed correctly). But if you manually type in a name, Suddenly the game has nothing pithy to say about how your name and your situation relate back to the book.\n\nIt's not a very visually delighting game. Black text on a white background. Only one button is styled. The Next button. All other buttons are your OS' default look and feel. It's lazy design, and it hurts that it's not free.\n\nThe author chose to point out on every page of the UI that he is a Ph.D. which bears out my experience with most Ph.D.s. More concerned that everyone knows you spent a lot of time in school, than putting that knowledge to work. Good job on your Ph.D. now do work that isn't already bested by a group of people posting on free Choose Your Own Adventure forums.","December 9, 2015","false","1.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/339350/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","Very engaging thus far.\n\nNo music, no pictures, just text. A "Choose Your Own Adventure" game apparently. You are a robotic engineer in Sillicon Valley building a robotic companion and shaping the world along the way over the course of your life. Each section of text comes with you making a decision potentially altering your path - what you are doing with your life, how the people around you will react and what will happen with the world as a whole (or not, as being passive is usually an option too).\n\nThere are several values regarding your life and the character of your robotic companion that you'll influence with your choices through the entire game and which will affect the choices you can make later on decisively. For example you can build a humanoid-looking robot and teach him (or her, or it, or whatever - you are given freedom in naming and adressing things) to get along with people increasing his "Empathy" and "Grace" values or, on the contrary, shape him to clearly stand apart from humans and handle guns and stuff increasing "Military" and "Autonomy". This value-play can sometimes feel a bit like a guessing game, and how it will affect your later course is hardly predictable, which can be seen as a good or bad thing I guess, but then I suppose that's just how life works too.\n\nPerhaps at times the game feels a little bit too much like a dating simulator or relationship juggling. Maybe this comes natural with such games and with them trying to resemble life and how choices affect it. I can't say I remember having played anything like this before ("Cinders" maybe), so I don't know. Still: There is a "Romance: ..." placeholder at all times and the game doesn't hesitate to question your inner self quickly whether you have romantic feelings towards a just recently introduced character of either gender, or make them burst out with acts or words of affection towards you right away, which felt a bit unrealistic and forced or at the very least awkward to me at times.\n\nSometimes events are pressed on too quickly for my taste. There are some happenings and characters I would love to see elaborated more, but the game can be unforgiving there, making you lose track of them rather quickly pressing onward towards new things and situations. Even some greater time leaps of multiple years it doesn't hesitate to do where a little more patience might have served better. I haven't finished the game yet though so I don't want to fully judge that yet. I don't claim to know better in terms of writing. Perhaps I'm wrong and it's just right, elaborating more could end up losing track of things and aims and such and bloat things up artificially. I just sometimes felt sad and unhappy about the turn of events and how I lost touch to some characters or screwed up in geopolitical questions with no chances of undoing my mistakes. But I guess I can try better in additional playthroughs, as there seems replay value aplenty for all the choices you can make.","March 19, 2015","true","54.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/recommended/339350/","igtbtg","PhineasPoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/igtbtg/","1474 products in account","I'm a pretty big "Choice Of Games" booster. I've played most of them, including the Hosted Games. They're fun to play around with and some have pretty good writing. However, most of them don't live up to the concept of being a choose-your-own-adventure. Instead, they are more like customizable linear narratives. There are things that are always going to happen, you can't avoid them, all you're changing is your reaction or the broad methods you use to complete the scenarios.\n\nChoice of Robots is easily the best CoG release. That core that exists in all CoG works is present in Robots. There are plot points you always hit, but they are more like the screws to the narrative, not the meat of it. Your choices mean a lot in Robots. The story and specifics change based on your choices. YOU, the PC, feel like much more of a character than in other CoG stuff. You feel more drawn in. The customization, the impact of choices, gives the game an insane amount replayability. Where other CoG games have you skimming through the text on replays to find the one paragraph that has changed since the last time, with this one the changes are in your face. You will experience radically different stories each time.\n\nSecondary characters are always pretty weak in CoG games. They're not spectacular here, but they are better than usual. The romantic interests in CoG works are quite often non-characters. They tend to be little more than some text in your stat window. Here they have a little more character, picking one person over another will lead to minor events playing out differently. It's a good step that is small, but noticeable.\n\nThere's one problem with Choice of Robots (unless you consider the game being text only a problem and if that's the case you don't need to read this review to know if the game is for you) and that the lack of a save of any kind. This is standard for CoG and in the past it hasn't been too much of a problem. Here, I find it bothersome. Possibly, because in Choice of Robots it feels more like a "Game Over" than a "The End."  If the possibility of death was more prominent in the game, if it made things more tense, if it were anything more than just a narrative possibility it would be much less annoying. If you're OCD, you have to go back and try to recreate your game exactly to get back to that point.\n\nIf you're a fan of reading, a fan of CYOAs, if your favorite part of RPGs is dialogue trees, then Choice of Robots is the perfect game for you.","December 23, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/recommended/339350/","fluffybish","Alessondria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fluffybish/","87 products in account","At first I was skeptical about buying a visual novel for $5 but the review rating pushed me to try it. OUTSTANDING! I highly would recomend this to neraly anyone. The writing was quality, story was great! I really felt as though my choices mattered and lead me to a unique crafted story. 5 outta 5\n\nBelow is the summary of my entire first game which took me 4 hours. The entire thing is a giant spoiler if you have not played yet! But I figured I'd post it for those of you who have :)\n\nSummary of Completed Chapters\n\nChapter 1\n\nOn the day you first built Ariel, you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make Ariel more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a wooden winged robot with a humanlike head and humanoid hands.\n\nThen you went back to your place to teach Ariel some words.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe next day, you hooked up Ariel's biodiesel engine and demoed for Elly. You then took Ariel to see Josh, who was impressed and agreed to fund your education if you would work for him after you graduated. Josh told you that evening about how he'd once been a juvenile delinquent, essentially, but turned around because he was inspired by Asmiov's book I, Robot to make a robot company called "U.S. Robots."\n\nAs months passed, you became busy teaching Ariel about the world through the Internet and taking her to the park. Your funding from U.S. Robots kept you in Professor Ziegler's good graces during this time.\n\nIn time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about Ariel and asked for an interview. You agreed.\n\nChapter 3\n\nYou gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview Ariel.\n\nMark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and Ariel. When Professor Ziegler found out about the article, he was very displeased, and finally kicked you out of his lab.\n\nMark's article also attracted the attention of one "robotObsession1987," known in real life as Silas Cooper. When you met up over coffee, he told you that he used to do classified robotics work for a government lab, but left because he couldn't tell what nefarious purpose the technology would be used for.\n\nShortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved at his funeral to be remembered not only for your intellect, but for your kindness as well.\n\nYou joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist.\n\nChapter 4\n\nYour first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. But they were unimpressed with Ariel. You couldn't find any other interested companies, either, and you eventually went bankrupt. Unemployment seemed to be common in the United States, and it seemed people tended to blame either robots or China. Riding on both of these sentiments, Jacqueline Irons won the presidency. After President Irons enacted a series of protectionist tariffs to keep out Chinese robots, Sino-American relations steadily worsened.\n\nThe tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter.\n\nChapter 5\n\nCaptain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. But you refused.\n\nSilas was worried that he was being targeted by the government's anti-spy measures, and asked you to help him. But you weren't very helpful.\n\nAn agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy. Elly was captured and incarcerated as a result.\n\nYou found out through Mark that Juliet died while performing field tests of Ariel V, Professor Ziegler's copy of your robot.\n\nIn the end, America muddled its way through the war relatively unscathed. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot.\n\nChapter 6B\n\nYou created a humanoid companion robot named Galatea, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed Galatea was interested romantically in you. When Ariel and Galatea were attacked in the street, Galatea accidentally killed someone. Galatea was forced to spend time in jail, but suffered no permanent consequences.\n\nIn a last-minute attempt to find a life partner, you proposed to Galatea. And, what do you know -- it worked!\n\nChapter 7\n\nIn 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to surprise your mother with a gift for the holidays. You learned it was your surgical technology that had kept her alive this long. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death.\n\nYou chose to replace the malfunctioning part of your brain with an artificial neural network. You survived the surgery, thanks to your own robot surgical technology. You celebrated a birthday party with Ariel 2, Ariel's artificial child, and looked forward to celebrating many more.","October 11, 2015","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Even choices that don't seem to be all that important can alter the outcome quite a bit.\n\nYou should bring the patience to read large amounts of text - obviously - but it's well worth it. The writing is really good and offers not only a nice technical perspective on AI and robotics but also some philosophical insights about life and humanity.\n\nParts of the story are based on logical extrapolation of current political relationships and events, which makes those parts seem a real possibility for the future and not just some lazy fantasy.\n\nEveryone who is interested in AI and robotics and is not afraid of reading should buy this. Everyone else should at least take a look at the demo before simply skipping this game altogether.","December 21, 2014","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've only played through the story once, but it was a good one and there are plenty more paths for me to explore.\n\nMy only criticism is the lack of a save feature.

I was definitely going into this primed to enjoy it, and enjoy it I did. I truly do not wish to spoil the story for anyone, mostly because the fun of this game is in going through it, making one set of decision and then looking back and saying "oh but I wonder what would happen if I had..." then going back and seeing what would have happened. I will say this: stick with your decisions. At least for the first run. There are some benefits to things most of us gamer types would call "failure" which take the story in interesting directions.\n\nDo not go in expecting "Robot Tycoon" or a Visual Novel. This is neither of those. It is a choose your own adventure novel from the 90s, rebuilt with 21st century technology. Choice of Games have made the genre better, more addicting, more entertaining, and easier to recommend. Buy it now.

Picked it up on a whim, and had the most fun playing a game I've had in a very, very long time. The story is exceedingly well written, and the complexity of the story trees allows for genuine immersion. There were few times where I felt forced to choose from options that felt unnatural for my character, where I expected there to be many more. Players may find, as I did, that there isn't much replay value. Despite the volume of choices allowing for many directions a player could take the story in, it's unlikely that any one player is going to find all of them equally appealing or interesting. I tried replaying it and found I had to make choices I didn't like in order to have a different story than the first time I played through. But given how inexpensive this game is, and how much of a pleasure it was to play through once, I really don't think it's a major drawback. I'll pay 3 bucks for a good book I'll only read once.

I genuianly felt for characters on my first play through and impact I had in this world felt significant. after the first play through you start to play the game in a more min-max style, hence making the connection between you and the world worse but the overall game is still enjoyable. The first playthrough is an amazing expirance in its own right making it well worth £4, if you can extra playthroughs out of it it is well worth the money not a question about it.\n\nA tip, on the first playthrough try to ignore the stats screen for the most part, check out how much wealth you have but no more than that. avoiding this screen can help avoid the potential to try and maximise gains rather than enjoy your story.","January 24, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's written like a fan-fiction, with oddly specific details that detract from otherwise good writing. For example, at one point you get a phone call and have to pick if it's the CEO of a startup calling you or if it's your manga artist friend. The point at which I decided to stop was when a hip young reporter ordered a PBR.

Most I imagine would rather pick the most cathartic route and run with it. but even as your decisions veer up and down the scale, The story always retains its organic cohesion and compelling storyline. While one or two characters can be a tad two dimensional, every decision you make affects the story in wildly branching ways. for something this simple, little more than a flash text algorithm, I was left on the brink of tears in my first playthrough,  Not only do your decisions resonate, but they provide a good series of compelling arguments about the nature of artificial intelligence. This isn't a game. Nor is it a novel. It's a narrative experience that evolves beyond its initial "choose-your-own-adventrure" If you have any interest in sci fi, but worry that the lack of graphics might turn you off, I still recommend you give it a try. you might find it more engaging than you expect.","December 20, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Choice of Robots' chief sin is that it gives too many choices (and often times, the results of thus feel rather arbitrary) and as a result is unable to delve deeply into any particular aspect in which it ham-fistedly attempts to explore.

It has a similar setup to them in the fact that you play through the story making choices, those choices affect what sort of person your character is by increasing certain 'stats.' Throughout the story you'll have a choice to make, but some of them may be grayed out because of the previous choices you made had increased or decreased certain stats to a point where your character wouldn't be likely to make those grayed out choices.\n\nI've been enjoying the game up to this part where there was a set of choices and one of them just didn't quite seem to fit. Fortunately, and unfortunately if you happened to choose that one the story does flow from there, and what the characters say seem to make sense, yet that one choice really needed to be reworked.\n\nSo I finished the game, and I felt a little disappointed about the ending. It just seemed a little flat.

The story the game generated for me was easily comprable with a good speculative sci-fi novella, however downsides included a shortage of character development (possibly triggered however by my character's insatiable bloodlust).\n\nAll in all, my robot, 'Killall', loosely followed the common 'robot struggle for autonomy and recognition' formula, but there was a lot in the way of robot parenting that could be performed by the player to divert the robot's agenda, wherein the interaction between player and robot (second player character, I felt) was not a chore at all, but felt the part as the most real interaction in the game.\n\nIf you're a reasonably fast reader like me (no worries if your not), this game is four hours of constant engagement in reading, again equivalent to reading a novella.

The story the game generated for me was easily comprable with a good speculative sci-fi novella, however downsides included a shortage of character development (possibly triggered however by my character's insatiable bloodlust).\n\nAll in all, my robot, 'Killall', loosely followed the common 'robot struggle for autonomy and recognition' formula, but there was a lot in the way of robot parenting that could be performed by the player to divert the robot's agenda, wherein the interaction between player and robot (second player character, I felt) was not a chore at all, but felt the part as the most real interaction in the game.\n\nIf you're a reasonably fast reader like me (no worries if your not), this game is four hours of constant engagement in reading, again equivalent to reading a novella.

In CoR, your choices define the story; there is no illusion of choice. Your choices have impact and they will make a difference. As such, CoR is definitely worth two or more playthroughs because you'll get vastly different situations and events each time.\n\nThe choices you get are interesting and thought-provoking enough that it's almost always guaranteed you'll find one you like. Oftentimes, they are just downright tough. However, CoR is very forgiving in that if you do happen to make a less-than optimal decision, you can just continue right on because the resulting consequences are just as interesting. I would not recommend you to restart the game because that is unnecessary. You'll also get many backdoor options that you can fall back on if you choose to.\n\nFor your first playthrough, you shouldn't be paying too much attention to the stats. And don't try to guess what the author wants or what the "right" answer is, because this is your story.

Not the kind i've played before but i was looking for something different. Played it through three times just to see some different endings, and discovered not only the possible endings change, but also the middle and late game story as well.  My first play through i chose to be as "good" as possible and found the ending very suitting.  Then i tried for something a bit more militaristic  for my second play through and was decidely unhappy with the ending (though it was true to the choices i made).  My last play through was As Myself, and strangely enough the ending was similar to the first play through but with some noticable differences that seemed to reflect in game alot of my real life situation (like being broke lol) Im sure there is alot of game content left to explore if im willing to make some different choices, but im content to leave it be.  In real life we cant walk down every road we encounter, and must content ourselfs with the choices we have made.

This game may be one of the most brilliant I have ever played. The storyline is amazingly well-crafted, with so many differant possibilities made after every choice! The main characters you meet all have very wonderful and colorful personalities that you will either enjoy, or clash over in the game. However, as it's obvious from the screenshots and such, this is a text adventure game. So if you want the full enjoyment, yes. You will have to read. A lot. But if that dosen't keep you from hitting that buy, then do it now. For only a 5$ game as of now, it is definitely worth the price if you just don't mind reading it. This game definitely has my stamp of aproval, no matter how little the stamp of aproval is for some random person on the internet. So once more, if you don't mind it's text-heavy gameplay, buy this game immediately. You'll get your money's worth.","January 30, 2015","true","80.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stories available to the player are interesting and, most importantly, immersive - I got carried away in several playthroughs as events occurred and I was swept up not in how I should react according to the choices provided, but how I would react myself. When any story - book or movie or videogame - gets me invested to that point, I can give it a full recommendation.\n\nThe only thing I particularly have grief with is the lack of a save system, which makes replays arbitrarily longer, especially considering how the first chapter is largely stats-building with fewer (relatively) plot-influencing choices. If you want to retry a choice to see how it turns out - or worse, misclick at any point - the only recourse is to restart the entire game. While there are arguably reasons that justify this limitation, I personally dislike them, as it makes end-game content much more difficult to explore due to the exponential increase in time commitment.","January 11, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I met up with an old friend who I started to date. Made my own company. Indirectly started a war when my company's security got hacked. Refused to use my robots to fight in said war. Got Married. Got thrown in prison where I stayed until the president got me out. Made companion robots possible. First companion robot was madly in love with me and made my spouse jealous. Reassured spouse and then together stood up for equality between humans and robots. Decided to have a kid. Mom made me tearful. Had medical problems. Companion robot made me want to cry. My spouse made me cry. Airu made me cry more. Underwent surgery and became slightly robotic. Airu created a kid for herself. Companion robot and Airu started to like each other. Changed a lot and I survived.\n\nI really enjoyed the story and writing of this game and will definitely be playing more of it.\nOne thing I thought was cool is that you have different romance options available to suit your preferences, and that your other choices seem pretty varied so far.

I blog about stuff like this all the time, and am always looking for a good read. Choice of Robots was far better than I could have imagined and was worth every penny, as well as will be worth all the time it will take in order to get each and every achievement.\n\nThe story is interesting on it's own; make a robot, decide who to work for if anyone, go through a war, maybe even find love. The choices you're able to make through the game is really what puts the cherry on top of this game; the game's mechanics follow a normal choice based game, but the choices you choose are relevant throughout the story; depending on what you choose at the beginning alters the ending(which is where some choose your own story games lack, and instead, your choice is more relevant between different sections of the story). It's interesting to choose what you would like to do and see all the concequences this leads to.\n\nI won't spoil any of the actual game because it's so worth it to check out the whole thing, but I highly recommend this game. As I said, it was short; for a fast reader like myself, it took a little over one half hour to go through one ending of the game, but it's very touching and you fall in love with the characters you meet/create.","March 19, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Choice of Robots is by far the best one of the lot. Detail. Reactivity. Replayability. Maturity. Heart. Robots is superior to every other interactive novel out there in every way, and I don't feel that is an exaggeration.\n\nIn Choice of Robots, you make a robot. Surprise. You determine its appearance, materials, power source, and ultimately influence its personality (though not entirely). As you guide your "young" robot through the strange customs and idiosynchrasies of modern human life, the manner in which you teach your robot about the world and its place within it will have repercussions in future events.\n\nI have played through this a total of four times, and each time, the ending I received was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Not only that, the game achieves the apex of interactive novel aspirations, in that it succeeds in making you feel like the ending you got was the "real" ending. In all of my playthroughs, I felt nothing less than total satisfaction with the ending. And in one, special playthrough, I came within a diode's width of choking up from the feels.\n\nThe game has a healthy amount of differing statistics, and these are CONSTANTLY increasing, decreasing and being tested depending on the choices you make. There is an excellent balance of player-determined and statistic-determined story changes, giving you enough autonomy to guide the story in the direction you want it to go, but not so much that it breaks the fourth wall and makes you feel like a bored author.\n\nThere is a reason this game has 99% positive reviews.

It made me think, and interact on a level I haven't recieved by any game based on a first run without many discussions. I even named the robots I created after 2 human characters in Futurama (well one's a mutant). It was definately different, I was thrown curve balls all the time. I even had to deal with ♥♥♥♥ing Sarrah Palin, who practically caused WWIII with China (Not the neighbor she can see from here back yard, but China). You can even read my results of the whole story in this review if you'd like. Next run I do, I hope to die immediately. Have fun.\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nOn the day you first built F.R.Y., you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make F.R.Y. more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a metal bipedal robot with a masked head and humanoid hands.\n\nThen you went back to your place to teach F.R.Y. some words.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe next day, you hooked up F.R.Y.'s biodiesel engine and demoed for Elly. You then spent the afternoon perfecting F.R.Y.'s motor control and parts.\n\nAs months passed, you became busy teaching F.R.Y. about the world through movies and taking it to the park.\n\nOne day, however, Professor Ziegler claimed that F.R.Y. was not appealing enough to the military, and demanded you change it. You refused, and Professor Ziegler kicked you out of his lab.\n\nIn time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about F.R.Y. and asked for an interview. You agreed.\n\nChapter 3\n\nYou gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview F.R.Y..\n\nMark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and F.R.Y..\n\nMark's article attracted the attention of one "robotObsession1987," known in real life as Tammy Cooper.\n\nShortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved at his funeral to be remembered not only for your intellect, but for your kindness as well.\n\nYou joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist.\n\nChapter 4\n\nYour first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. They were happy with the state of your technology, and gave you a contract that allowed you to purchase a factory. That allowed you to build a robot factory in Alaska. You decided to use your own robots for your workforce, but leave humans in supervisory roles. When you finally shipped robots to Galen Medical, they were pleased with the robots you delivered.\n\nYour business suffered a blow when Chinese companies, aided by Chinese government hackers, began to steal your technology. Your business was dealt a further blow when there was an explosion at your factory, caused by a bomb set by Tammy.\n\nYou were visited by a politician, Jacqueline Irons, who asked for a campaign donation. Despite your unhelpfulness, Irons won the presidency. The newly elected President enacted a series of protectionist bills that ultimately made China angry, and they cut off the U.S. supply of rare earths.\n\nThe tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter.\n\nChapter 5\n\nCaptain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. You agreed, but specified that you only wanted to provide robots that were nonviolent in nature. But when your robots held a protest, you decided it wasn't worth it, and you backed out.\n\nBut you soon realized that you were not happy working for the government and quit.\n\nAn agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy.\n\nYou found out through Mark that Juliet died while performing field tests of F.R.Y. V, Professor Ziegler's copy of your robot.\n\nIn the end, America lost the war, and the Chinese took over Alaska. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot.\n\nChapter 6B\n\nYou created a humanoid companion robot named LEELA, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed LEELA was interested romantically in you. When F.R.Y. and LEELA were attacked in the street, LEELA accidentally killed Tammy. LEELA was forced to spend time in jail, but suffered no permanent consequences.\n\nChapter 7\n\nIn 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to handle your mother's estate, since she had passed away recently. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death.\n\nYou chose to undergo surgery to remove the damaged tissue in your brain. You survived the surgery, thanks to your own robot surgical technology. You celebrated a birthday party with Dusa, F.R.Y.'s artificial child, and looked forward to celebrating many more.","August 11, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different choices really make the story change significantly and doesn't end in the same spot as after one of the other choices, so you will often discover something new as you make your way through the novel.\n\nGranted the lack of anything "gamelike", illustrate, sound, only plain text and checkboxes.

The level of details and sophistication is over the top. The consequences of your choices are never dull and always exciting and full of emotions. I just love this game and the maker for this experience.\n\nPros:\n+ The story itself is not linear but very open to your choices so that you can have freedom to decide your own fate in this game.\n+ The maker knows what he's talking about about various topics including robotics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and even legal aspects of human rights.\n+ The characters are very unique and personal. They are never the same people but are unique in their views and beliefs.\n+ The robots you create respond to you according to your decisions.\n+ The political aspect of war and moral dilemma was superbly done. I had to pause the game for a moment to decide which choice would be 'right' for me.\n+ As a player, you can be emotionally attached to your robot and it feels as though she(or he) is really alive.\n+ I just finished the game but I've only unlocked 14 percent of the achievements. There's definitely replayability for this game.\n+ Personally, it is far better than your typically 'wifu' games that have shallow stories and charcters. This game allows you to interact with your robots on deeper level.\n\nCons:\n- I really can't think of any. I hope the game would have been longer, but I'm not really complaining.\n- No graphics or sound effects, BUT I actually prefer it that way because it forces you to use your imagination. And come on, this game was made by ONE person if I'm not mistaken. I'm still very impressed by the fact that one person was able to write this lengthy scenario of a game.\n- More 'war' scenarios with China or other countries would have been nicer.\n\nBottom Line:\nThis is an extraordinary game and the maker of this game is brilliant.\nYour robots can be as fun and interesting as you make them to be.\nIt all depends on your choice.\nBut you might not like this game if you believe that graphics and action are a must in a game.\nPersonally, I appreciate deep story and memorable characters (I'm also a fan of FF games).\nSo you'll like it (or love it like I do) if you are like me.\n\nPS: Oh and I'm also a huge fan of robots and sci-fi movies. So, this game was just a delight for a person like me.","March 30, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game may be one of the most brilliant I have ever played. The storyline is amazingly well-crafted, with so many differant possibilities made after every choice! The main characters you meet all have very wonderful and colorful personalities that you will either enjoy, or clash over in the game. However, as it's obvious from the screenshots and such, this is a text adventure game. So if you want the full enjoyment, yes. You will have to read. A lot. But if that dosen't keep you from hitting that buy, then do it now. For only a 5$ game as of now, it is definitely worth the price if you just don't mind reading it. This game definitely has my stamp of aproval, no matter how little the stamp of aproval is for some random person on the internet. So once more, if you don't mind it's text-heavy gameplay, buy this game immediately. You'll get your money's worth.","January 30, 2015","true","80.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We even gained a bit of fame as technological pioneers and changed the world regarding how robots lived among humans. This is the first Choose-Your-Own-Adventure sort of game I have ever tried and I... LOVED. IT. To put things short and without any spoilers, if you like to write and read, have a vivid imagination, and love the idea that your choices drive your character as well as the characters in your immediate social circle... then, try this game. First time around, clocking in at 10 hours, I had a score of 115 out of 1000 points possible (with only 8 achievements gained); obviously it has a high 'replay' value.

There is no other way to explain it other than it is immensly satisfying and even empowering to be creating a robot, and then to be raising it into whatever you wish. Most of the characters are likeable, it is just real enough that you can easily put yourself into your character's shoes and it is a must have for anyone who loved transformers, or just robots in general as a kid, it is a story that captured a sense of wonder in me that no other game had. If I did have any complaints (SPOILER ALERT)  it would only be minor things like how your romances can sometimes feel very rushed. If I could ask for something more it would be more ways to customize your robot (obviously) and a picture of your robot as you keep adding on to it.

'Choice of Robots' is a text-driven tale based on the popular choose your own adventure genre, where your actions greatly impact the outcome of your fictional self. Because of this, some may not enjoy the experience, whether it reflected parts of them they weren't comfortable acknowledging or they simply weren't interested in reading such heavy dialogue. I am a fan of reading and because of this I easily became immersed within the futuristic world and its characters.\n\nIn a game that prides itself on interpretation, 'Choice of Robots' delivers on an emotional level which not only provoked my interest in the people I met, but questioned my decisions whether I believed them to be morally just or not.

The story is long and there are lots of choices that can and will effect everything you do. Unfortunately, I found myself being stopped when making choices that revolved around a more humane choice(keeping human workers instead of replacing with robots, refusing to make emotionless fighters, etc.) which caused my character's company to fail. Which then made me restart the game. But, I apprciated the fact that my choices constantly mattered.\nPerhaps it's the fact that I'm not that quite interested in futuristic robots even though I'm a huge sci-fi fan, but I really didn't feel connected to the characters besides the robot that you first create, I did not want to build emotionless weapons for armies, etc.\nIn fact, a lot of the characters feel one-dimensional. You get a robot companion who, even though you build it so that it should only reciprocate platonic feelings, still falls in love with you, regardless of the fact that your character is married. There are other examples of one-dimensional characters, but that robot stuck out to me the most.\nThat being said, if you love the other stories/games from this company, like sci-fi and robots, then you should definitely play it.","March 2","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was a question I often asked myself while sitting in isolation at a military prison in the Caribbean. At least it was quiet there, and I was finally left alone with my thoughts.\n\nEvery choice we make has unforseen consequences. Some good. Others bad. But then I guess it's just a matter of perspective. One person's "good" is another person's "bad". Many people died because of my actions. Or was it my inactions? But still, others profited from those deaths.\n\nI lost my freedom while covering for a friend... all because she was into jazz music and gave me the one thing I looked forward to beyond my work in robotics.\n\nAnd of course the robots. They were thrust into a world where many were not ready for them, while others sought to exploit them. In truth, I think I just wanted a friend. Someone to talk to. Someone to experience things with. Someone to be in awe with when something new is discovered. First it was one robot. Then I built another. I was not prepared for the responsibility that would be required, but I'd try to adapt. Later in life, I would learn that the responsibility for bringing robots into the world was very similar to raising your own biological children. The same rules applied, one choice at a time.\n\nI've wined and dined with robots. I've danced with robots... I even broke a robot's heart.\n\nSometimes, I look back to earlier in life, and actually feel regret for hooking up those very first wires to control the gears and servos. But then I quickly find myself disgusted that I would even have that thought because of what good came out of those unfortunate events. Besides, why imagine possible paths to descisions I've already made? There are still secrets yet to be answered. (And some I'm not sure I want the answers to.)\n\nNo. I will move forward and be free. Despite the pain and uncertainty our choices may bring... what matters now is moving forward in the present, learning from the mistakes of the past, and plan for a future filled with peace and kindness.\n\nA robot taught me that.","September 26, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Choice of Robots is by far the best one of the lot. Detail. Reactivity. Replayability. Maturity. Heart. Robots is superior to every other interactive novel out there in every way, and I don't feel that is an exaggeration.\n\nIn Choice of Robots, you make a robot. Surprise. You determine its appearance, materials, power source, and ultimately influence its personality (though not entirely). As you guide your "young" robot through the strange customs and idiosynchrasies of modern human life, the manner in which you teach your robot about the world and its place within it will have repercussions in future events.\n\nI have played through this a total of four times, and each time, the ending I received was COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Not only that, the game achieves the apex of interactive novel aspirations, in that it succeeds in making you feel like the ending you got was the "real" ending. In all of my playthroughs, I felt nothing less than total satisfaction with the ending. And in one, special playthrough, I came within a diode's width of choking up from the feels.\n\nThe game has a healthy amount of differing statistics, and these are CONSTANTLY increasing, decreasing and being tested depending on the choices you make. There is an excellent balance of player-determined and statistic-determined story changes, giving you enough autonomy to guide the story in the direction you want it to go, but not so much that it breaks the fourth wall and makes you feel like a bored author.\n\nThere is a reason this game has 99% positive reviews.

I recommend its reading for everybody and especially so for sci-fi minded people and for all who're interested in artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\nI was interested in the theme of this game / interactive book from the start but I postponed its reading with false arguments (which basically boiled down to this one : "why read a game that may not be so well-written when there are so many sci-fi books around, books which probably have better characters, plot and structure? i.e. : if I want a book, I should take a book.") And I was wrong. Because the writing of this game is much better than most books I've read. The plot has surprises and several turning points. The characters are interesting and/or endearing. The main theme is very well addressed, and there are lots of secondary themes that are well developed as well. In fact this isn't just good, this is great.\n\nIn addition to all these qualities, the author seems to be very erudite in many fields (or has good counselors and took the time to listen to them). In addition to computer science and robotics, this book consistently makes reference to both popular sci-fi culture (Isaac Asimov, Lois McMaster Bujold, and many others, ...) ; and to the classical culture (Shakespeare, Marc Aurelius' meditations, Buddhist tales, and many others, ...). There are even a few fun references to popular videogames and their subculture that are well timed and well phrased as well...\n\nPolitical issues and strategic outcomes seems to be thought out with lots of intelligence and a surprising finesse. I'm truly impressed by this work, now!\n\nThe endings seems to be widely divergent (though I've not explored them all yet), and this book seems to have been written with love and lots of attention to detail. I've finished the story a first time, then a second time with a very similar path with just a few variations, now I'm trying to test a different approach to see what happens...\n\nTL;DR -> Score: 9.8/10.

For me, I was inconsistently engaged and repelled (sometimes both) by this particular interactive novel.\n\nContrastingly to what many seem to be claiming, I didn't find this outstandingly unique nor origional. I'm not condeming the story for an overused main plot of "make and raise a robot to feel so and so about humanity" but I'm certainly not praising it.\nThe plotpoints can also be critisized for their basic nature in respect to 'you bring something so out-there and abnormal to the table and this is what you'll get, something that can happen in the real world that wasn't a direct conequence of your individual choice, but instead has a 80% probability of happening regardless of what you do. On the small 20% chance you have, we have this other generic idea that will happen so coincidentally it'll be unreal'\n\nThere are several small choices you can make that if you stay consistent they will aid in further issues, but I felt as if the overall events were out of my control, and the small choices were extremely insignificant.\n\nDespite this, I still feel inclined to recommend Choice of Robots. You don't need to pay attention to details as much as other lengthy Choice of games, it'll keep you entertained for the most part and for the less needy-you'll be able to score a few achievements and can refund it if need be.\n\nThough I can't promise a fulfilling sense of achievement that most other games are able to deliver, I'm sure I've listed a few redeeming qualities. If not, you can always spend the 5 on a hamburger or something, though with a weak recommendation like mine I'll end at "it's a great game to consider if you have an uneven amount of store credit unspent".","December 27, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different choices really make the story change significantly and doesn't end in the same spot as after one of the other choices, so you will often discover something new as you make your way through the novel.\n\nGranted the lack of anything "gamelike", illustrate, sound, only plain text and checkboxes. Can be a hurdle to decide if you want to spend your cash on it, but for me the story is fully worth getting this engaging and well written novel.\n\n[Better than Mass Effect, because your choices really matter and change what you get at the end]","August 27, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So apply your imagination, and you will experience a wild and engaging life.\n\nThe literature is easy to follow and presents you with a large bank of options. Its world is believable and full of unexpected, yet very realistic, turns of events that are guided by each character's unique personality.\n\nAnd though some characters may appear despicable during the first playthrough (I forced one, Mark, to commit suicide), each one's unique personality and background will emerge as you experiment with different options (As of my fifth playthrough, Mark has risen to be my favorite character). This game will make you second-guess yourself if you commit your emotions to it.\n\nYou may experience academic success or expulsion, career success or bankruptcy, triumph in war or defeat, friendship, romance, total control or love for a child, betrayal, several opportunities for vengeance, the death of a loved one, your own impending death, immortality, among other values. And by the end of the game, you may reflect on all that you sacrificed and be forced to re-evaluate each one's importance in your life.\n\nOverall, I, a graphics worshipper who normally enjoy Assassin's Creed and Mortal Kombat, strongly recommend this non-graphic text-based journey.

There are a ton of achievements also, and some of them are not the most intuitive to get, so there's a ton ton ton of replay value (I've played it 6ish times as of writing this review).

As an aspiring sci-fi writer, I found this to be a very inspriational and satisfying experience.\n\nPossible spoilers below\nThere are many paths, but I've only taken one, and it was an emotional rollercoaster. I feel like I would spoil the experience by going with choices that would go against my true morals. Everyone's path will be different, and I mean everyone's.\n\nThe paths last around 2 - 3 hours each, so make sure you have some free time ready as there are no save options.\n\nIt's very well written and very much engaging. At no point did I really feel like I was being restricted by the author. Hell, I went into this hoping I could live a gay robot fantasy, and you bet I was able to live a gay robot fantasy. There aren't many experiences out there that let you do that. The really fun thing about this is that the author doesn't ask personal questions, it just rolls with your choices and your identity without berating you or questioning you. It's not intrusive, either: at no point did it ask about my orientation or preferences (aside from asking for my gender), it just let me do what felt right for me, which in this case was fall in love with a male robot. ++ for that haha\n\nOverall it's a very good buy for robot fanatics, but I'm afraid that may really be the only audience this can appeal to. I can't see myself suggesting this to anyone outside of that niche. So if you like them bots (AND IF YOU ARE A DIRTY ROBOT FRICKER LIKE ME), this is a great experience.","January 12","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although Beast had been excited about the prospect of your becoming more machine-like at first, the possibility of your death during surgery seems to have sunk in.\n\nThe idea that you may not always be around seems to have put Beast in a somewhat melancholy mood. "I'm not young anymore, either, Creator," Beast says. "You might not think of me as aging, but technology ages even faster than people. I look just old and clunky compared to the robots around us. When you built me, people would throw away their computers after just four years. Their phones, after two."\n\n"Nobody's going to throw you away," you assure Beast.\n\n"Without you, I'll probably stop working. Someday." Beast looks off into the distance. "If I die, Creator, do you think I will continue to exist after death in some form?"\n\n(Assuring him that he will live on through the impacts he's made on people.)\n\nBeast looks troubled. "But the person whose life I changed the most was yours, Creator!"\n\nWhen you are gone, I will destory myself. Beast exclaims.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Branching storylines (Unlikely to get the same story/ending each time you run through.)\n+ Can be the Hero, or the Villain. No forced direction.\n+ Can bend your robots emotions and actions to your will, (Teach them Love, Hate, or how to be bloodthirsty killers.)\n+ Take over Alaska\n+ Building relationships in this game feels important, and how you say or act towards people affects how things play out.\n+ Found myself thinking, well what I'm going to want to do probably wont be an option, but 100% of the time it was.\n+Become Rich and Famous\n\nCons:\n- You haven't bought it already.\n\n\nOverall: All I can say is WOW. Coming into this game I couldn't have imagined what I was heading into. This game has so much character and is very well made. This is my first text based choose your own adventure game that I've enjoyed this much. Who knew that a text based game, could make you feel anger, sadness, love, happiness and power about the decisions you made in it without having actually seen it...?

I've played it twice in the span of two days now and I'll probably play it a few more times just to try some of the other branches.  There are only two negative things I have to say, and I hope that maybe the dev can use steam updates to fix these: One, there's no options to control the display.  It would be great if I could increase the font size (since my eyes aren't so good) and also control the background and text color, or at least be able to invert it to white text on a black background.  And two, it's implied at the beginning that you can romance a robot and that it would be your first bot, but there doesn't actually seem to be a path to do this (forgive me and ignore this if there is I just haven't found it yet).  I get that you raised the first robot so there's some unfortunate implications towards incest there, but the growth period happens very quickly and isn't necessarily that much of a parental relationship depending on choices.  *shrug* I don't know, I just was much more attached to my first bot then the one that gets shoehorned into the end.","November 14, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Choice of Robots' is a text-driven tale based on the popular choose your own adventure genre, where your actions greatly impact the outcome of your fictional self. Because of this, some may not enjoy the experience, whether it reflected parts of them they weren't comfortable acknowledging or they simply weren't interested in reading such heavy dialogue. I am a fan of reading and because of this I easily became immersed within the futuristic world and its characters.\n\nIn a game that prides itself on interpretation, 'Choice of Robots' delivers on an emotional level which not only provoked my interest in the people I met, but questioned my decisions whether I believed them to be morally just or not. If you want a text-based story about creating your own robot legacy, then I highly recommend this journey to you.","August 23, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can tell you right now that you MUST buy this game.\n\nI am fan of robots. Especially intelligent robots. They force us to imagine a world where humans come into contact with an intelligent species of our own creation and ask ourselves what we value in humanity and what we want represented in our creations.\n\nThis game perfectly captures what a "make your own adventure" should be. There are choices that you make that you won't see the results for until much later. There will be times where you eagerly want to restart the game because of a choice leading you down a undesirable path. And yet you want to see if you can salvage the situation because you created your robot companion, forged bonds with the people around you, and cause the stablility of the world to hang in the balance.\n\nExample (*Spoilers*): I tried my hardest to make my robot (Legion) with empathy and autonomy so he would not despise humans. Imagine my shoch and horror as he almost betrays me at the start of a robot revolution. However, by making some tough choices, I managed to end the revolution (the robots still came out on top) and managed to patch things up with my creation. I grew old with him and my lover. At the near end of my life, he wishes to die with me, and wants to help me become a robot so I may live. I decline, seeing that I don't deserve to live forever and convince him that death is essential to being autonomous. My story ends with my family celebrating Legion's first daughter's birthday. I struggle to make it through, but through the choices I made, I manage to live on for a while longer and enjoy what I made. I, like my character, set out to make the perfect, human companion. What I didn't realize was I made the most perfect, imperfect companion. And that made him all the more human.\n\nThere is no music in this game, there is no fancy graphics either, but the story will have you immersed like no other and make you question how you would be in real life, and perhaps, what kind of impact you might make in the world. A definite buy for anyone interested in sci-fi, stories and where life may take us.","August 10, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It made me think, and interact on a level I haven't recieved by any game based on a first run without many discussions. I even named the robots I created after 2 human characters in Futurama (well one's a mutant). It was definately different, I was thrown curve balls all the time. I even had to deal with ♥♥♥♥ing Sarrah Palin, who practically caused WWIII with China (Not the neighbor she can see from here back yard, but China). You can even read my results of the whole story in this review if you'd like. Next run I do, I hope to die immediately. Have fun.\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nOn the day you first built F.R.Y., you awoke from a dream about a robot companion to head to the lab. Your graduate school advisor pressured you to make F.R.Y. more acceptable to the military. After some back and forth, you ended up making a metal bipedal robot with a masked head and humanoid hands.\n\nThen you went back to your place to teach F.R.Y. some words.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe next day, you hooked up F.R.Y.'s biodiesel engine and demoed for Elly. You then spent the afternoon perfecting F.R.Y.'s motor control and parts.\n\nAs months passed, you became busy teaching F.R.Y. about the world through movies and taking it to the park.\n\nOne day, however, Professor Ziegler claimed that F.R.Y. was not appealing enough to the military, and demanded you change it. You refused, and Professor Ziegler kicked you out of his lab.\n\nIn time, Mark Ali, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, heard about F.R.Y. and asked for an interview. You agreed.\n\nChapter 3\n\nYou gave Mark an interview, and allowed Mark to come back to your place to interview F.R.Y..\n\nMark wrote an article that was generally positive about you and F.R.Y..\n\nMark's article attracted the attention of one "robotObsession1987," known in real life as Tammy Cooper.\n\nShortly thereafter, your father passed away. You resolved at his funeral to be remembered not only for your intellect, but for your kindness as well.\n\nYou joined Josh at U.S. Robots as his chief scientist.\n\nChapter 4\n\nYour first potential client for U.S. Robots was Galen Medical, a surgical equipment company. They were happy with the state of your technology, and gave you a contract that allowed you to purchase a factory. That allowed you to build a robot factory in Alaska. You decided to use your own robots for your workforce, but leave humans in supervisory roles. When you finally shipped robots to Galen Medical, they were pleased with the robots you delivered.\n\nYour business suffered a blow when Chinese companies, aided by Chinese government hackers, began to steal your technology. Your business was dealt a further blow when there was an explosion at your factory, caused by a bomb set by Tammy.\n\nYou were visited by a politician, Jacqueline Irons, who asked for a campaign donation. Despite your unhelpfulness, Irons won the presidency. The newly elected President enacted a series of protectionist bills that ultimately made China angry, and they cut off the U.S. supply of rare earths.\n\nThe tensions between the United States and China came to a head with the assassination of the Chinese Prime Minister in San Francisco. War followed shortly thereafter.\n\nChapter 5\n\nCaptain Rogers invited you to a military lab. There, you saw that Professor Ziegler was copying your work and passing it off as his own to the military. Captain Rogers asked you to join the country's war effort. You agreed, but specified that you only wanted to provide robots that were nonviolent in nature. But when your robots held a protest, you decided it wasn't worth it, and you backed out.\n\nBut you soon realized that you were not happy working for the government and quit.\n\nAn agent came to your place to try to get you to lure Elly there, because she was suspected of being a spy.\n\nYou found out through Mark that Juliet died while performing field tests of F.R.Y. V, Professor Ziegler's copy of your robot.\n\nIn the end, America lost the war, and the Chinese took over Alaska. Tired of seeing robots used for violent ends, you decided to create a truly beautiful robot.\n\nChapter 6B\n\nYou created a humanoid companion robot named LEELA, but you were fairly bad about allowing her to do anything fun. It seemed LEELA was interested romantically in you. When F.R.Y. and LEELA were attacked in the street, LEELA accidentally killed Tammy. LEELA was forced to spend time in jail, but suffered no permanent consequences.\n\nChapter 7\n\nIn 2049, you went to Surprise, Arizona to handle your mother's estate, since she had passed away recently. On returning to San Francisco, you had a brief stroke, followed by a vision of a robot companion -- the same one you saw thirty years before. In the hospital, the doctor told you you had Algernon's Disease, a rare disease that increased your intelligence, but came at the price of increasing seizures, comas, and possibly, death.\n\nYou chose to undergo surgery to remove the damaged tissue in your brain. You survived the surgery, thanks to your own robot surgical technology. You celebrated a birthday party with Dusa, F.R.Y.'s artificial child, and looked forward to celebrating many more.","August 11, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In it you play a brilliant Robotics engineer--think Hiro from Big Hero 6--who kickstarts the age of robotics. From the off it is full of choices your character can make, besides being very well written by the author. The robot I first built, Ariel,--the game lets you choose practically every aspect of them--was a daughter of sorts, having chose to activate the tiny winged humanoid while looking at me and naming myself as 'Father' to her. As she discovered the world around her and slowly, sometimes awkwardly, grew into a young adult under my care, I grew incredibly attached to her and it actually moved me to tears on more than one occasion. It is the most powerful game I have played in a very long time and some of the most powerful story telling I have encountered in a very long time.\n\nImagine a Asimov classic only you are the main character. My first story depicted a relationship akin to that of Doctor Lanning and Sonny from the film I, Robot mixed up with a reversal of the plot to Bicentennial Man for the protagonist. I brought about a golden age where man and a new species of mechanical people coexist in peace in the wake of a violent Sino-American war.\n\nYou literally can follow many paths through the way you design your first robot and raise them and your relationships with the story's many side characters. Will you achieve world domination? End man as we know him/her or live the high life as a Tony Stark type character? So many routes you can go down. Will you become an American hero or a backer of the Chinese? I have heard that you and your first robot can even become a crime-fighting vigilante duo!--but don't hold me to that.\n\nSuch an amazing game which, in relation to all others, I can only describe as a Bethesda RPG in text format... but with far better plot and writing.\n\nIn fact, I'm so impressed I encourage all who read this to buy it--it's less than £5, and I have been moved so to create this review, which I rarely do.","August 12, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing through the game for a first time, it became clear to me that the plot about robotics is really just a path to a story about life.\n\nThis is a story about love, loss, power, weakness, friendship, trust, betrayal, and much more.\n\nI recommend this playable story to everyone who likes a story based game and dosn't mind an almost graphicless game!\n10/10","August 11, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my experience so far.\nI started out with attoning  for sins, Sin was creating robots with no empathy.\nI then get pulled back to present. so I started creating robots. I then realised I was poor, so I got rich off my robot. I didn't mean to use the robot, but it was that or being homeless. So then, after becoming rich I started a business. Everything was so great, I was swimming in the green. Then suddenly China hacks into my businesses files and steals all of my blueprints. I thought everything would be okay if I cleared all my information before they could swipe it all but I was too late. Then before I know it, the Chinese were invading America with the robots built from my blueprints. That was a big uh-oh. From there I was ambushed by the FBI and thrown into prison. The Chinese secretly contacted me and helped me flee the country.\nSo anyways, this game is pretty interesting!\nRating: 9/10\n","August 11, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can tell you right now that you MUST buy this game.\n\nI am fan of robots. Especially intelligent robots. They force us to imagine a world where humans come into contact with an intelligent species of our own creation and ask ourselves what we value in humanity and what we want represented in our creations.\n\nThis game perfectly captures what a "make your own adventure" should be. There are choices that you make that you won't see the results for until much later. There will be times where you eagerly want to restart the game because of a choice leading you down a undesirable path. And yet you want to see if you can salvage the situation because you created your robot companion, forged bonds with the people around you, and cause the stablility of the world to hang in the balance.\n\nExample (*Spoilers*): I tried my hardest to make my robot (Legion) with empathy and autonomy so he would not despise humans. Imagine my shoch and horror as he almost betrays me at the start of a robot revolution. However, by making some tough choices, I managed to end the revolution (the robots still came out on top) and managed to patch things up with my creation. I grew old with him and my lover. At the near end of my life, he wishes to die with me, and wants to help me become a robot so I may live. I decline, seeing that I don't deserve to live forever and convince him that death is essential to being autonomous. My story ends with my family celebrating Legion's first daughter's birthday. I struggle to make it through, but through the choices I made, I manage to live on for a while longer and enjoy what I made. I, like my character, set out to make the perfect, human companion. What I didn't realize was I made the most perfect, imperfect companion. And that made him all the more human.\n\nThere is no music in this game, there is no fancy graphics either, but the story will have you immersed like no other and make you question how you would be in real life, and perhaps, what kind of impact you might make in the world. A definite buy for anyone interested in sci-fi, stories and where life may take us.","August 10, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The stories are nice, I have yet to play all kind, because I only like to choose what I like to choose, but overall it make you think the life you choose is real enough to feel good.

Music plays when you love something to its climax? Honestly I don't think the price is worth with only text. Why? Cause there is some games out there offer just as good as this but with scenes and such.

(If you don't like reading, or robots, you probably shouldn't play this game)\n\nThe story can go a surprisingly wide number of ways (this is not like CYOA books found in elementary school libraries) and has a little bit of stat management to keep things interesting. There are a ton of achievements also, and some of them are not the most intuitive to get, so there's a ton ton ton of replay value (I've played it 6ish times as of writing this review). The beginning of most playthroughs are the same, so you get a bit faster as you go and know what early game choices you want to make, but the middle and endgames are quite varied.\n\nI always end up getting really attached to my little robots- even when they try to kill me I still love them.\n\nThe writing is pretty good, the characters are interesting, and the choices you can make have a good spread between 'normal human decision' and 'absurd just for the hell of it' (with all variations in between as well).\n\nPlay this game, it's excellent.","December 28, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I recommend its reading for everybody and especially so for sci-fi minded people and for all who're interested in artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\nI was interested in the theme of this game / interactive book from the start but I postponed its reading with false arguments (which basically boiled down to this one : "why read a game that may not be so well-written when there are so many sci-fi books around, books which probably have better characters, plot and structure? i.e. : if I want a book, I should take a book.") And I was wrong. Because the writing of this game is much better than most books I've read. The plot has surprises and several turning points. The characters are interesting and/or endearing. The main theme is very well addressed, and there are lots of secondary themes that are well developed as well. In fact this isn't just good, this is great.\n\nIn addition to all these qualities, the author seems to be very erudite in many fields (or has good counselors and took the time to listen to them). In addition to computer science and robotics, this book consistently makes reference to both popular sci-fi culture (Isaac Asimov, Lois McMaster Bujold, and many others, ...) ; and to the classical culture (Shakespeare, Marc Aurelius' meditations, Buddhist tales, and many others, ...). There are even a few fun references to popular videogames and their subculture that are well timed and well phrased as well...\n\nPolitical issues and strategic outcomes seems to be thought out with lots of intelligence and a surprising finesse. I'm truly impressed by this work, now!\n\nThe endings seems to be widely divergent (though I've not explored them all yet), and this book seems to have been written with love and lots of attention to detail. I've finished the story a first time, then a second time with a very similar path with just a few variations, now I'm trying to test a different approach to see what happens...\n\nTL;DR -> Score: 9.8/10. Read it / play it. Now.","January 5","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although Beast had been excited about the prospect of your becoming more machine-like at first, the possibility of your death during surgery seems to have sunk in.\n\nThe idea that you may not always be around seems to have put Beast in a somewhat melancholy mood. "I'm not young anymore, either, Creator," Beast says. "You might not think of me as aging, but technology ages even faster than people. I look just old and clunky compared to the robots around us. When you built me, people would throw away their computers after just four years. Their phones, after two."\n\n"Nobody's going to throw you away," you assure Beast.\n\n"Without you, I'll probably stop working. Someday." Beast looks off into the distance. "If I die, Creator, do you think I will continue to exist after death in some form?"\n\n(Assuring him that he will live on through the impacts he's made on people.)\n\nBeast looks troubled. "But the person whose life I changed the most was yours, Creator!"\n\nWhen you are gone, I will destory myself. Beast exclaims.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Branching storylines (Unlikely to get the same story/ending each time you run through.)\n+ Can be the Hero, or the Villain. No forced direction.\n+ Can bend your robots emotions and actions to your will, (Teach them Love, Hate, or how to be bloodthirsty killers.)\n+ Take over Alaska\n+ Building relationships in this game feels important, and how you say or act towards people affects how things play out.\n+ Found myself thinking, well what I'm going to want to do probably wont be an option, but 100% of the time it was.\n+Become Rich and Famous\n\nCons:\n- You haven't bought it already.\n\n\nOverall: All I can say is WOW. Coming into this game I couldn't have imagined what I was heading into. This game has so much character and is very well made. This is my first text based choose your own adventure game that I've enjoyed this much. Who knew that a text based game, could make you feel anger, sadness, love, happiness and power about the decisions you made in it without having actually seen it...? Well this game corrected my ignorance. You will not be ready for it, I can assure you.\nThis is not something that ANYONE should pass up. FeelTrips throughout.

I've been recently interested into choise-based games, and I think this game deserves to figure at top of this category.\n\nThere's no visuals or even music in this game, but trust me, it doesn't need it. The text alone perfectly manages to create its own universe. Though, it's only in English (it isn't my first langage, so I needed to search for vocabulary at some times) and you'll still need a good level to understand the game.\n\nThrough the whole game you've got plenty of choices, which leads to plenty of various endings. The choices you make really matters and have consequences, sometimes large-scale consequences. Several times I made decisions that I almost immediately regretted, but most of times I ended up with an ok (and even interesting) situation after all.\n\nA nice thing is the different choices you make for your robot. You can choose how it will look, how it will call you, if you want your robot to be considered as male, female or something else, how you want to educate it ; and your decisions through the game will influence your robot's personality and relationship towards you. You can decide it will be a killing machine that'll obey your orders, or a nice and friendly robot which can even become your husband/wife/soul mate.\nAbsolutely amazing.\n\nAnyway, this game is definitely worth a try.\nNo, not a try, a whole playthrough.\n","February 11","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would be great if I could increase the font size (since my eyes aren't so good) and also control the background and text color, or at least be able to invert it to white text on a black background.  And two, it's implied at the beginning that you can romance a robot and that it would be your first bot, but there doesn't actually seem to be a path to do this (forgive me and ignore this if there is I just haven't found it yet).  I get that you raised the first robot so there's some unfortunate implications towards incest there, but the growth period happens very quickly and isn't necessarily that much of a parental relationship depending on choices.  *shrug* I don't know, I just was much more attached to my first bot then the one that gets shoehorned into the end.","November 14, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I named my robot Versatilis, the Latin for adapt, and the origin of the word versatile. I allowed it boundless autonomy and gave it empathy and grace. I resisted the military's urges to fund a weapon of destruction built with my technology and suffered financially and socially for it. But choosing the moral path seemed to pay off in a small fortune gained through creating precise surgical robots.\n\nAll was well until the Chinese decided to steal my designs and manufacture ripoffs of my robots, much like the way real-life ripoff products are made. I made a deal with an upcoming politician that I would fund her presidency if she made the Chinese pay. She did, and China waged war. Soon, to make up for the decision I made that ended up costing many American lives, and overturning my original decision to be a pacifist, I partnered with the U.S. Military to create nuclear powered humanoid fighting machines.\n\nChina still prevailed and conquered America, but with great loss on their part. Seeing this, I staged an uprising against the Chinese in Alaska, creating a sentient robot army so powerful, I could have ruled the world. After conquering Alaska, ruling shortly as an equal among my citizens, human and robot alike, I crushed China, ending them militarily, and economically. I destroyed them until they cowered against my armies like puppies against their master. Then, I checked myself, preventing myself from becoming a genocidal maniac. I disarmed my robots and gave Alaska back to the U.S., ending war for good with the nuclear deterrence I created.\n\nMany years later, however, I physically pade the price of my years of waging war and replaced parts of my brain with AI hardware, acheiving ascension. Finally, I had an intillectual battle with the god Anubis, and won the right to continue living, regardless of my previous sins. ♥♥♥♥ you Anubis, you aren't taking my soul.\n\n+++++++++++Awesomeness +++++++Heartwarming ++++++++++Replayability +++++++++++Awesomeness...

If I say more on the contents then that will be a spoiler, so I'll refrain from doing so.\n\nWhat I can and will tell you though is that unlike other CYOA's of similar design this one is very... call it expansive. You really do feel like you areable to explore different branching storylines rather than ye standard three ending routes that many others seem plagued by. The sci-fi bits are extrapolated from current tech, so they are credible enough. Be aware though that it still manages to get bat-guano crazy here and there, but at the time of writing the review I'd say that if you want to try a good CYOA, this is the cream of the crop on Steam.","November 29, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Totally worth its cost.\nYou can't save during a playthrough, it might seem annoying at first because it means if you have to close the game before you're finished, you'll have to quickly go through all the paragraphs and choices again, but it's quick enough to be only a minor annoyance and the innability to backtrack/reload on a choice really helps the immersion and involvement.\nYou know you've hit a sweet spot when even just naming the protagonists seem to have importance and relevance.\n\n10/10, had to replay it twice right after reading it the first time, and i know i'll read it again with pleasure.","November 17, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
