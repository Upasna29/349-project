The game isn't complete yet. It's not even close. And they don't reply to any questions, bug reports or anything. Looks like they got their money and ran off like so many indie dev's nowadays.\n\nUpdate:\nI made a huge bug report topic where I posted every bug I could find over a month ago. I also sent them an official bug report using the form they made for it. Then after not hearing anything from them I sent them an e-mail asking wether or not they were ever going to finish the game. They responded that it's done in their eyes. After stating that many attacks go through walls they replied that attacks are suppósed to go through windows. Are you guys even reading my e-mails?\n\nPretty much everybody who has ever played this game disagrees with the statement that this game is completed. I guess they just confirmed that they took our money and then ran off.\nDo not support these developers!\n\nUpdate:\nAfter a long time I started playing again two or three times for an hour this week and it was remarkably bugless. (I didn't reinstall windows, steam or the game and I'm pretty sure there wasn't an update, so there was no reason for the gameplay to improve.)\n\nI stand by what I said before, but if you are in luck and everything works as it was planned it sure is a lot of fun. Also using cheats can help. I always get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when a zombie does a special attack through a wall, but I just give all my guys Kevlar to compensate for the damage they shouldn't take. Makes it all a lot less frustrating.","December 5, 2013","false","27.5"," 386 of 424 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","386","424","0","41"

Turns out the answer is "a lot".\nBefore writing the review, I completed the campaign, played some Death Lab and Survival.\n\nControlsLacking. There are keyboard shortcuts, which is a plus, but the amount of micromanaging is just annoying. There is no way to give your squad very basic commands like "walk over there, but hold your formation" or even "guard here, look a little bit left or right occasionally". I mean, yes, they aren't trained soldiers, but come on - that's very basic "use your brain to survive" stuff.\n\nVariety / Difficulty / Replayability Personally, I found it too easy. Take an easily defendable position (beware windows), shoot single zombie, run back to squad, profit. If there are hearts, use melee and sneak your way through.  After the hearts are disabled, progress as usual. As this works almost every time, it also gets repetitive. New equipment isn't a necessity, it just achieves victory faster.\n\nThe different game modes. Yes. Campaign is as described above. Then there is Death Lab, which I actually liked. Kind of. It, too, got old pretty fast. Survival mode is a joke. I kind of expected it to be like the campaign, just without the story and a larger or procedurally generated map. Turns out, there are no branches, no loops, no nothing - just node after node, going in a straight line to the right.\n\nSo, is the campaign worth replaying? After all, the store page promises random elements. And again, no. While it does, in fact, randomize the campaign map, the actual nodes seem to draw from a pool of predesigned maps and/or houses. While this in itself isn't bad, there are just too few of those to keep things interesting. Even halfway through my first (and only) campaign playthrough, I never encountered any new layouts (excluding the "story nodes")\n\nBugsJust look at the forums. Also, I played this game some months ago, and the bugs are still there. Chances are they will never be fixed, with the developer disregarding bug reports and calling the game "finished". Again, read the forums for details on this. I can just list the bugs I personally encountered. They range anywhere from "minor" over "annoying" up to "gamebreaking".\n-) Gamebreaking: Rescuing more survivors than you have space for locks you on the "send survivor to city" screen.\n-) Grabbers and Jumpers don't care about walls.  And by that, I really mean WALLS, not windows. I encountered this many times while defending, but I is especially glaring with the survivors hiding behind the "hidden button" doors, suddenly being surrounded by Jumpers halfway. And yes, that also happens before the button is pressed. One time, I actually watched them glitch through the door (Apparently, they cared more about the locked-in survivor than about my squadmates standing directly behing them).\n-) Once hunger and bug-related deaths start to fill up your graveyard, it is virtually rendered useless, as there is no scrolling.\n-) Many more minor stuff (like the game randomly unpausing when giving commands), but really, I won't list them all, considering the much more major bugs.\n\nSurvivors / City Map / ResourcesGood idea, but IMHO, poorly executed. The resources themselves are sparse at first (not a bad thing!), but around the early late-game, they are completely useless. Except for food, of which you will not have enough. By far. Ever. You will have way too much of everything else, mainly because the blueprints drop much faster. By the time you first have enough resources for the first firearm blueprint, you will have found much better ones. Even with reasonable mid-gear upgrades, your squad will have the best equipment far before the campaign is over.\n\nThe survivors... Apart from attracting more zombies on heart maps (IMHO the only difficulty spike over the course of the campaign) they are useless as well. When they don't break your game (see "Bugs" above), they idle around in your cities. "Idle", because it is very easy to avoid the zombies attacking back. In fact, the only time that happened to me was when I explicitly wanted it to happen (Achievement! Yay!). And even if they WOULD need to actually defend your cities - chances are they couldn't. Remember what I said about food a little bit earlier? When you run out of food, survivors die. Seems logical. BUT: The dying survivors are NOT selected randomly. It always hits the most recently rescued ones. Chances are pretty good that those are the survivors manning your cities on the front, leaving them empty.\n\nGraphics / SoundVery good. The graphics fit the gameplay, the music fits the situations, and... yes. Short review, but that's all there is to say about it. I especially liked the Death Lab BGM.\n\nSummarySo, the summarizing question: Knowing everything I do now, would I buy the game again?\nNo. Plain and simple. For reasons, see everything above.","April 22, 2014","false","14.9"," 86 of 99 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","86","99","0","0"

It's still not an impressive game to me.\n\nWow, I played two hours and I think I got all I need to say and there's not even much to say about it. I don't have anything to really say that's positive about this game other than the idea. You're a group of survivors and you need to survive. There are different gamemodes and from what I remember there is survival, campaign(you start with 2 survivors, need to find more, you can secure 'nodes' (locations) across the map and it ties into the repetitive nature of the game and you also have objective locations you need to make your way to), and two others. They weren't very rememberable. Your nodes can also be attacked but I didn't care for the game enough to actually let it happen). The nodes themselves in the campaign mode act as 'checkpoint' spots that you can backtravel to when you fail a mission and you have spare survivors or if you finish a mission.\n\nThe gameplay is extremely flawed with very bad movement controls (click to move squad and  click + hold to designate facing direction for EVERYONE which makes it useless because why the would you want everyone to face in the same direction while you're getting beat up from behind and to the sides). Your squad lacks peripheral vision. The movement itself is held down by a part of the combat that is missing but I'll get to that. There's also these 'hearts' that constantly attract more and more zombies but there's also alarms that do the same thing and from what I could tell, the effects *STACK*. The alarms are only worse than the hearts because the power buttons are almost always on the other side of the entrances to the building but, then again... Some hearts are ominously locked inside a shed that require you to search the house for a code / button amongst the 20-something lootable items all the while getting hit wave after wave of annoying zombies.\n\nWhen a squad member is attacked, it takes about a second for him to react, turn around / face the zombie, and then another 1-2 seconds to actually fight back. The melee is pretty random since even if your survivor is facing an enemy, he doesn't always react immedietally. I don't know if they decided to wank off because they get off to zombies or if they had a brain fart but my character with the axe kept on getting hit first when he should've been able to just chop the brain-dead(literally) zombie away with his weapon. Pistols also have a VERY low range (6 IIRC but another you get has 8, still extremely low) and make it extremely hard to keep range when there's even 3 zombies coming towards you. The zombies also move pretty fast when *not running*, so think on that. If you get a 'horde' after you, chances are you're going to get beat up pretty bad. Now, the thing that annoyed me the most is that there is NO AUTO ATTACK WHILE MOVING. This may seem stupid but attacking something while moving would be entirely realistic and even then this is a video game and the way the gameplay has been built up makes it seem like it would be crucial and yet it's not there. It's like playing a game where you can only shoot when not moving but the enemies move faster than you so you have to stop moving to attack them but you react very slowly, turn around slowly and the enemies keep coming non-stop. Oh, yeah, and you're short-sighted. Overall, the actual gameplay movement is slow and badly done. If your squad could act faster, not be stupid then I'd be kind of fine with it.\n\nThe special zombies I saw so far pretty much mimic the L4D Spitter / hunters but there's more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tacked onto them. The spitter gives no chance to avoid the acid since it's pretty much an immediate effect. The hunter or 'jumper' does as the name implies. It jumps *at* a survivor. No, it doesn't knock him down. It... Hits him. Fast. Or something. I don't know since the animation looks barely any different from any of the other zombies. The worst part is that, again, the effect is immediate. He pretty much teleports to your survivors and he takes a huge chunk of health in a few seconds which mixed with the combat and movement controls makes it pointless to even try to save the survivor (health items are costly to make and rare to find. You're lucky to even find a bandage. I maybe got 3-5 in 10 maps total which is only 60-100 HP for 4 squad members (20 per bandage)). There's also beefier zombies but honestly they only make the fast speed of the zombies and overall stupid intelligence of the AI seem worse than they really are. I got these beefy 'big' zombies pretty early in all of my attempts and I wouldn't be wrong to say they make hordes of zombies extremely unfair and unfun to fight.\n\nThe resource management is pretty neat but honestly it starts to demand a lot as you go on, granted it depends on the size of the node you try to secure or the amount of survivors that you have. For me, I rarely found extra survivors. I was lucky to find even one. I went through 2 large nodes and found a total of *ZERO* survivors, so there's that for you. Now, scrap and wood are rare/excessively common depending on, what I assume to be, RNG(random number generator). Each survivor can carry 6 slots (some items take up 2, a few such as food crates or gas cans take up 4)of items but you can find at least one blueprint for a medium backpack but it takes a lot to even make one. In the end, you will find it VERY repetitive to loot items. When you finish a level, any items on the ground or lootable objects not looted are removed / not lootable on return. It really ♥♥♥♥s the whole experience up especially since you can't loot everything so you have to leave some for the magical zombie genies to steal your discarded crap.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game has a good idea but play a few hours and you might just realize how flawed this game is. Usually I'd be able to persevere but this game enraged me with how unfair and annoying it is that I had to take a breather and just uninstall it. It's unfair, it's not fun at all and the difficulty is centered around bad controls and bad balancing issues. Perhaps I'm just bad at it but I was doing pretty well until I got to the point of mass-spawning of enemies and the inevitable succumbing to the horrible controls.\n\n5/10. It's okay.","April 17, 2015","false","2.0"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","33","42","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/recommended/258050/","Resoula","Resoula","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/","263 products in account","Like flash games? Well here's an over-glorified flash game for you. In Survivor Squad you control up to 4 members of a squad on missions to eliminate all zombies in an area, exploring and looting as you go about it. You can then craft new weapons and supplies at your bases, which cost those same resources to establish. You spend gas to travel from area to area, and there's a store. The fact that I can tell you everything about the game four sentences says a lot about what you're getting here.\n\n-The controls are horrendous. your squad has really little to no AI to speak of. you have to tell them where to move, where to turn, and occasionally where to attack. If they're alone and a zombie sneaks up behind them, they're dead because apparently they didn't hear it a flesh-eating monster running up behind them and think to turn around and shoot it. They only ever turn to shoot something nearby them if a teammate spots is spotting it beside them in their cone of vision that extends about four yards in front of their face, because hooray near-sightedness. And they also don't start shooting until the enemy is halfway into their cone of vision. Making guns nearly-useless, due to the fact that they also refuse to reload by themselves. They'd rather stand still and get eaten than reload. No, YOU have to select them and hit R manually, or they're ♥♥♥♥ed. You also cannot tell them to turn and face a new direction without moving first. Which is a hell of a ♥♥♥♥ing hassle.\n-The "Story" is pathetic. After going easy on you for the first few levels, prepare for story-based missions where you have to help some guy, or retrieve some item, while pushing against an UNLIMITED tide of zombies until you accomplish your goal, with your UNLIMITED ammo, where enemies charge you from all directions, leaving you finding your squad walking back to back a few feet at a time in what is the most boring mission layout I have ever seen in a game.\n-The voice ac- oh wait, there was no voice acting. Or maybe there was and it was so bad I didn't remember it. I'm going to stand by saying there was no voice acting. Leaving you to have to actually READ things others are saying while your squad is being eaten alive because you forgot to check the bottom of the screen to see if they were out of ammo and needing you to hold their hand and hit R.\n\nI'd tell you everything else that's wrong with this game but there is literally nothing else to criticize, the game is too small to have anything else to criticize. At least it has two other game modes, survival and sandbox. Sandbox being essentially story mode but without the story-driven ♥♥♥♥ missions, but it also has no ending as well. Just repetitive gameplay until you die or get bored.\n\n3/10. If I had no other games available, maybe I could push myself to finish the story mode at least, but thankfully, I do have other games available, and if you do too, do yourself a favor. Steer clear so far of this game that you forget it exists.","September 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","41","57","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flowmaster231/recommended/258050/","Flowmaster231","Helena S-119","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flowmaster231/","228 products in account","Survivor squad is a tactical  overhead RTS that focuses on survival in a zombie apocalypse/outbreak. Players must take control of the survivors and scavenge for food, gas, and supplies whilst managing inventory space and surviving hordes of the flesh eating dead.\n\nThere are four modes of play. Multiplayer, where you pick a side of the zombie apocalypse, Humans or zombies. Death Lab, where you have to fight through hordes with a timer and make it to the decon chamber of the next lab. Survival, where you generally just try to survive the apocalypse itself. And finally, Campaign mode, which follows a storyline with unique events and a conclusion.\nThe game itself is incredibly hard and sometimes it isnt fun, but it keeps drawing you back in. The campaign starts out in an empty hospital with the player waking up from an induced coma. You take control of the randomly generated character and wander through the halls until you hear a growling noise, and are pounced upon by one of the dead. A man shoots the undead creature, and you stand up, bewildered and scared. The man explains what happened, in a typical zombie scenario style script, and the two of you go on your merry way.\n\nWait, havent we seen this before? Oh yeah, like in every single zombie themed  movie or television series-Im looking at you, The Walking Dead.  The whole zombie apocalypse thing is getting rather old to the point where this all seems rather repetitive and all the movies, games, and books just kind of glue together into some ominous pulsing conglomerate of gray mediocrity. Im not sure whether to poke it with a stick like a small child, or to ignore it all together. Since we've obviously decided to do the first option, Let me just state that Survivor Squad isnt that good. It isnt bad, but it isnt GOOD. It's OKAY. A lot of games are okay, but this one just strikes me as mediocre and uncreative. And boring. The game itself is a solid thing, like an idiot, but that doesnt make it good. The game has taken to cheekily calling its special infected "Leapers, Grabbers, Spitters" obviously its referring to Left4Dead. There is also a distinct lack of women in the game, like all the women in the zombie apocalypse got teleported to some island in the pacific, far removed from the events of the world. I mean, what the heck! Thats a bit weird, if not a bit mysogynist.\n\nOkay sure, there are some good features in the game, such as occasional variation in maps, the survivors are randomly created and have random names and appearances, there is some good voice acting, and the modes can be genuinely fun if you have hours of your life to just throw into the wind, but thats about it. The game is more or less suited for an alpha rather than a full release, and thats what caught my attention. "Oh hey, this doesnt look done, why is it being released for nine dollars?"\n\nOver all? Six and a half out of ten. 6.5/10.","November 18, 2013","false","8.6"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","40","64","0","0"

The directional revealed light system is quite cool, but I think that people actually have a wider range of view than the 50-60 degree angle presented in the game.

Perhaps some in game explaination, like they know that zombies are inactive during the day, so that's when everyone sleeps because it's safe?  Also the tutorial level could have been a bit longer, explaining stuff like Active Pausing and controlling your survivor's orientation.

It's a nice game, but EXTREMELY unpolished.  Which is unfortunate, because with a month or two of polish this could be a *fantastic* game, rather than just nice.\n\nThe game is a zombie shooter played from a top-down real-time tactical perspective.  You control a squad of up to four survivors, clearing buildings of zombies and scavenging for supplies.  There are special infected a la 'Left 4 Dead', and rudimentary inventory and leveling systems.\n\nUnfortunately, as I said, the game is extremely unpolished:\nThere is no way to queue actions.\nYou can't attack-move, meaning your survivors will walk right by a zombie as it attacks them.\nThe is no cover-system and your only real tactical choice is which way a survivor should face. The result is that every encounter devolves into "stand out in the open with one survivor facing each direction and wait for them to kill everything."\nMost of the levels look and feel the same, causing the game to become repetitive quickly.\nYou spend a significant amount of time doing tedious chores, like searching for the last building or finding the remaining supplies, which could have been easily streamlined.\nThe leveling system is rudimentary and there is no real customization/specialization, so every unit is basically the same.\nMelee weapons are completely useless.\nSome of the artwork looks like it was crudely drawn in MS-Paint.\nNone of these things are terrible on their own, but together they make the game feel bland and unfinished.  My review is right on the border of positive, because it WAS really fun for an hour or two; but the lack of polish causes it to quickly become boring, then frustrating.  The game feels like it's in early-access, but the devs adamently insist it's a finished product.  Which is a shame, because this game has so much unrealized potential.\n\nIf you are a strategy-game aficionado, you will probably enjoy playing this, but maybe wait for a sale.  Everyone else should go play Infested Planet or Doorkickers instead, which are similar games but much more polished.\n\n5/10 stars","January 20, 2014","false","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Part of your play, besides killing everything that attacks you, is finding other survivors, searching buildings to gather supplies, and crafting items to better equip your team.\n\nYou can choose to clear areas with a team of 1-4 survivors at a time, and as the game progresses, there are certain harsh situations you might find yourself in, such as having to diffuse a bomb while being trapped in a building or having to quickly find the switch that turns off the alarm before being swarmed by zombies, meaning you will occasionally need fast reactions so as not to get overwhelmed. Despite what I have read on here, shooting everything in range is not always a viable option (especially when a horde is passing by) and even though the strategic decisions you get to make in this game do not have much depth, there is always the occasional benefit from choosing to be stealthy or using a gadget.\n\nUnfortunately, the game could use improvement as it has several shortcomings. The art style seems poorly made, there are several situations where your movement gets glitchy, the audio is bad, and the game depth is not very satisfying. Overall the basic mechanics are there and are viable, but it seems like they could all use some polishing to make this game good. Despite its shortcomings though, I will not thwart you away from this game as it could be a pleasant casual game for those who are not looking for something complex. I will instead recommend that you watch some gameplay videos before deciding to play it.","June 20, 2014","true","4.4"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

It starts on a bad foot, as every map you play is poorly lit and at nighttime, the  bad camera angle does the game no favors either. It does not have day rotations and and the view gets annoying the more you play. It tries to cover up how ugly or bare bones it by hiding in the darkness, and while that may work for a short time, you see the same map layout so many times it gets old fast.\n\nEven through it says it's random what it has to pick from is so small that every time it feels the same. Combat with melee is mostly useless, yes you can kill silently but the enemy will keep respawning in many maps until you complete a task. That means the more you melee the more you get injured, and that would be fine if there was a better looting system in the game. You never find items of use and you can't trade items, only buy. Nor can you use your items to increase the outposts you build. While you may find blueprints to craft you do not find items such as armor or better weapons, which makes looting a chore rather than fun.\n\nThe combat controls are frustrating as you are limited to control up to four members. If a zombie gets close to your south point the people in the north will turn and shoot south leaving the zombies in the north to get closer. They do not turn around or have any way to accurately keep their focus fire, in one direction.\n\nIt becomes a chore of go to map, see same layout and same combat, fight, loot and move on as the game does not respect your time. I can not find myself to recommend this game.

I did not buy the game (it was gifted to me), but I would not have bought it had I researched it prior.\n\nThe most obvious, glaring problem is the UI and art style. I play roguelike games, so to have a poor UI/art style is a very difficult thing to do in my eyes, but Survivor Squad pulls it off. It looks like a browser flash game from 2005, and it handles just a little better. The UI faces similar issues, it just isn't satisfying to use. I feel like I'm playing a game drawn by a kid with crayons.\n\nThe gameplay was okay. I killed some zombies, I looted some stuff, I progressed. I guess they are going for ultra realism, as each character can only carry a small amount of items. That would be cool if the crafting system didn't require so many materials. In this aspect, it is very grindy, and not in the MMORPG way, but more in the "I'm really ♥♥♥♥ing sick of finding nothing in these chests" way.\n\nI don't see this game improving.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinPole/recommended/258050/","SinPole","inject","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SinPole/","399 products in account","Take control of a team of four of the most generically named idiots as they fight for what's left of Earth, which consists entirely of the same 5-6 buildings in various random configuration.  Experience the thrill of puzzling out unexplained game mechanics, extreme jumps in difficulty, mashing the spacebar every 20 seconds to pause the game, figure out what just happened and micromanage your squad so hard you'll be telling them when to inhale and when to exhale.  Survivors so smart you'll have to tell them when to stop moving so that they can shoot the zombie that just appeared in front of them.  Attack move?  So 90s!  Get with the program!\n\nUse a variety of six guns and four (inlcuding punching) melee weapons, each of which is utterly outclassed by the next upgrade.  If you hate difficult choices, you're in luck, as there's no reason to use an obsolete weapon ever!  They also look dinsticntly different in your character's hands. 2014 technology ladies and gentlemen!\n\nFight challenging zombies and special infected that Are Totally Not From Left 4 Dead 1 or 2.  There's the smo--grabber, the hunt--jumper, the boo--carrier, the spi-- oh it's actually called the spitter.\n\nAnd the gadgets!  I'm very confident there were more gadgets asides from sentry guns, a futuristic area of effect bomb that kills all enemies nearby and video cameras to spot for the sentry guns, but I'll be darned if I can remember them.  There are also several suits of armour in the game.  With the same nuance you'dexpect by now they are linear upgrades with no drawbacks, entirely devoid of interesting decisions to make.\n\nWhen it comes to character progression, the power is yours!  Experiment away as you can reset your perks at any time between missions.  Watch early perks be outclassed in utility by later ones.  Quickly settle in to your favourite character build and get busy wearing in that rut.\n\nThat someone possibly got paid actual money to draw the portraits in this game is unbelievable!  The portrait art is priceless, in the same way a three year old drawing on the wall in pastel excrement is priceless.  It is genuinely offensively horrible, like all the great works of deviantART.  Soldiers are assembled from bits of one another with differening skin tones and some will have helmets.  All have the same terrifying eyes that you will burn clear through your soul.\n\nThe campaign story line is incredible.  Writing on par with George R. R. Martin of Game of Thrones takes you on an epic journey where you will bump into a stranger who will tell you what to do.  And do it you will!  After you've done that, you'll find another man to tell you what to do!  And once you've done that, you'll kill a very fat zombie in a glass cage and the game will end with a credits screen.  A moving tale of redemption and the power of love.  The story is told in a very minimilist fashion which adds to the pathos and dark tones.  Feel your spine tingle with dread as unskippable slow text uncurls on the screen voiced by chipmunks very excited to see one another.  Creepy!\n\nAnd if you want a change from the monotony of doing the same thing over and over again for too long, switch to Survival mode!  It's almost the same as camaign mode, but stripped down of what few choices you had about where to go next and what to defend!  You will go on a one way journey from random map to random map.\n\nWhere the game might possibly be worth a single dollar is in Death Labs mode.  With a limited budget you will assemble a squad of four, picking your weapons, ammo, gadgets and perks.  You start in a lab which resembles a maze strung out between elevators without any scientific research equipment to be seen.  Your goal is to get to the next level of the lab before an ominous decontamination timer reaches zero.  Such tension!  Don't remember that you can pause, hold down shift and scroll around to see items on the ground.  And certainly don't realize that every down elevator has a medkit in it.\n\nEnjoy the utter crap shoot that is lab level 10 on this game mode.  Watch helplessly as a survivor will get pulled away from your group by a grabber, another, another, and then possible another.  All the while being pummeled by every zombie in the tight, tight corridor.\n\nGet this game if you hate your money and you hate yourself!\n\nP.S. ammo is unlimited.  You will always have a full reload.  At no time does the game tell you this.  I wiped on two campaigns before I realized I hadn't scavanged up any ammo as there literally wasn't any.  I guess that's my fault for heavily associating zombie apocalypse survival games with limited ammo.\n\n\nSTORY SPOILERS BELOW\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(P.P.S the fat zombie in a cage is telekentically secreting eggs across the land which are hatching into these zombies.  That is the actual story line.  I am not making this up.  Apparently the eggheads in the lab captured it in their lab, somehow, at the start of the outbreak but before they realised it could just plant zombie eggs anywhere it wanted.)","March 3, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Starting alone with a pistol and ending by storming the final location along your best three men armed with assault rifles and armor. 17 KIA, 36 MIA, 73 Turned away, 35 Survivors. Other gamemodes let you jump right into the thick of it.\nCon: The audio could drive a person mad with injury sounds and door hinges getting played endlessly. You WILL hear what i mean if you play the campaign. Some minor bugs affect playability, for example after defending a zone sometimes a few zombies with be stuck around the map without indicators and finding them is an unnecessary pain as they are clearly stuck because of faulty pathfinding.\n\nOverall: I really enjoyed large portions of the game and was willing to deal with a few annoyances to complete the modes.","February 28, 2015","true","33.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Then you can send them off to dangerous missions to scavenge more supplies and try to learn what happened to the world.\nYou go to several random-generated maps and explore the houses: You can find supplies, places to create new bases (And get more supplies), bombs which will detonate if you don't find a wire cutter, alarms... all of them really helps to add variety to the game.\n\nThe action (And the inclusion of the dynamic pause, like in Baldur's Gate) feels quite right (although I would liked to have the classic "stand ground/patrol/look only in this direction" buttons). It let you order your survivors move around and maybe only will get you in trouble if you go too fast.\n\nBut, on the other hand, there's not really so much content\nAll the places loolks horribly similar. The random generator picks two-three houses from a set of pre-made maps, the street its just empty. All the characters look the same and have almost the same voice. Even the special zombies are all out from Left 4 Dead: You got the spitter, a charger's cousin, and smoker... and of course you need another survivor to rescue him. Still, they work good in the game (hey, they are proven formulas).\nEven the inclusion of events (like the bombs, the hordes or the attack) fall short and after some maps you have already seen everything (In almost every single combination that matters).\n\n\nThere's a lot of good ideas on the game, fairly well implemented, but the general feeling is austere, lacking of both more content graphically and gameplay wise. Maybe you will have to rethink your strategy once or twice but after realizing that sound matters and guns don't, you will be set up to the final boss.\nIts a feeling of "yeah, that's right, I want MORE. And maybe some tweaks on this, and more equipment, and different survivors and..." it's something difficult to critizice, given its indie development, but still, there's a sensation of "we couldn't add fancy stuff to the game" after the second map that just don't go away.\n\nI haven't played the lab mode, by the way, only the campaign.","May 30, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game does look kinda crap, but it is a heap of fun, despite the massively high frustration level that could be likened by trying to mine gold with your skull alone.

Its annoying to control 4 guys as its not really easy or intuitive. You have to control all at once during attacks and you'll try clicking to turn them around or attack something and the zombie will move and then your guy will just run forward to them. This makes the combat/movement system clunky as there is no real way to turn without moving. Also the basic gameplay has problems. You take points but you rarely get what you need and if you craft any materials its impossible to get enough back to make medkits, and you don't usuall find enough. Bandages barely do anything so you are always hurt. Your characters permanantely die which is fine but since they level and the people you have at other locations don't its basically a waste. They should level so you can substitute them in. The other biggest problems is there are branching paths, but that any taken node can be retaken by zombies. Since i had no medkits I had to go a different route, but since you also have to use gas (another annoying variable that just hinders your progress and that you barely find) I had to rest 24 hours. After taking a point I came back to the map and around 5-6 nodes id spent an hour taking were suddenly retaken. I dont have the resources to retake all those points so I said ♥♥♥♥ this game. The cards are already stacked against you they shouldn't just make you suddenly lose all your progress. Too many mistakes and poor game choices. This has mized reviews for a reason. Also has no story and goes nowhere, every level seems about the same. You have no idea if you're progressing in the campaign and how you move forward, or what you should be doing. Crafting is way too expensive. You have 4 guys and it takes 1 hr to get enough to craft 1 part for 1 guy.

I didn't play much with this yet, but the first thing you notice is the crapy controls. There are hundreds of games with similar controlling and they work well, you don't have to learn how to control a new game. But not in this game. You can get used to it somewhat, but this is a survivor game, and you get injuries by the time you push the right button.. For example with the mouse "fire button" you actually deselect your men, and if you figure out why they don't shoot, then you can spend time selecting them again. It's lucky that at least they fire automaticly. Too bad, they can't decide automaticly who's backpack has still space.. They also tend to forget wich way they should look after a single zombie attack from the other direction.. No tactical formation saving either.. So what I am telling, that it could be a good game, but a player should have tested it.. There should be a little more from each: controlling function, automatic behavior, tactical function.","August 5, 2014","false","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, excecution is poor, and the whole thing feels like a browser game. It's much too easy, requires absolutely no tactics or planning, and the only time I died in several hours of gameplay was when an NPC said "I'll be right behind you!" and then sprinted directly into a zombie-infested building, making me run my squad in blindly to try to protect him. In addition, your survivors are psychic and can tell how many zombies are in an area, when a building is clear, and sometimes even where the zombies are, regardless of distance, line-of-sight, sound, etc. Most damning, the controls are clunky, and the majority of the difficulty stems not from enemies, but from clicking the wrong spot and suddenly deselecting all of your soldiers.\n\nTL;DR version: Probably should have been turn-based.\n\nAlso, I've read some of the comments made by the developer regarding bugs and issues people are having, and he seems to be like "SORRY GUYS IT'S FINISHED THANKS FOR THE MONEY KBYE".

They need to add a zombie cap so the level doesnt get overpopulated or for dead bodies to fade out after reaching a certain cap.

Maybe free, it would be relevent, but this game is incomplete, and seriously a dissappointment. Its kinda like when 2K announced they were remaking the famous XCOM game, but then they also announced that they were making it a shooter. Although they did make the new XCOM and did a really good job. Sadly, this product isnt even halfway close to the aforementioned situation. The devs sold this game for 8.99, which is not that bad of a price for a good game, but this game is just bad. Its incomplete, buggy, and if youve been listening to what the devs say, they think that the game being incomplete actually makes it complete. Thats sad. So please, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.

Zombies!\n\nThe controls are very simple and intuitive, altho it took me a little while to get used to right clicking the mouse to move my characters. Even tho it gets a little tight in situations, like when I forget to right click, and end up un-hi-liting my character. My fingers also tend to get confused, which leads to hitting the wrong numeric key, and sending the wrong soldier in the wrong way.\n\nThis game requires some series micro-management of your team if you want to keep everyone alive. This includes setting a rear guard at times, and especially individual movement of characters. Moving everyone all together will leave your defences wide open, as the survivors will not stop and attack enemies until they have completed their movement. So by individually moving them, it allows the stationary characters a chance to provide covering fire for those in transit.\n\nThis game is def worth the buy. It is a fine mixture of some of the finest genres going on right now. Tactics, zombies, looting, survival, gun fights, and procedural generation are all to be found in this game.\n\nhere is some gameplay if you would like to see more --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JlXXhKByd4\n","April 2, 2014","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While in the game, you can pause the game and issue orders to your survivors, which they will carry out when you unpause.\n\nThere's a basic resource management in this game. You can loot different materials from the nodes, which are used for crafting various weapons, equipment, and gadgets. Managing the loot you collect in levels can be difficult and meaningful. Since you usually won't have room for ALL the loot you find, do you collect the loot that will let you build better weapons? Or do get the loot that will let you make better armor, backpacks(storage space for more loot), and healing items? Not too long after starting the game, you get the opportunity to "capture" "large" nodes, which will generate basic resources like Wood and scrap, which are the most commonly used crafting material, and Food and Gas, which are used to feed survivors and let them travel to different nodes.\n\nAs for the bad:\n- There are many instances where enemies will attack through walls, which really screws with the balance.\n- Get pushed through walls.\n- Get stuck in corners.\n- Jam doors shut so you can't pass through them (there are instances where "locked doors" are intentionally, but I'm talking about places they aren't).\n- When enemies are ramming against walls because their occasional "walk in a straight line" mentality won't reach you, they'll sort of all stack on top of each other, with very little visual indication they did so. So what appears to be one enemy will turn out to be 18.\n- All of the above(minus the 'death stack') happening to your survivors as well.\n- Vital interactive environment pieces like buttons that turn off alarms and floodlights wills sometimes be placed in awkward places that your survivors will not be able to reach.\n\nThose are just the bugs I'VE experienced. Others have reported many more. It's been a long time since there's been an update, and I doubt there will be more. Devs have stated that "all promised features are in the game, so it's finished", and other than fixing some game destroying bugs, they've ignored most the rest so far. I'll update this review if that changes.\n\nAs for other issues with this game:\n- The late game is pretty shallow. Early game your trying to scrounge up all resources you can in order to get better weapons, armor, gadgets, and bigger backpacks. Mid game get's less frantic crafting wise, as not only will you have nodes that gather wood and scrap for you, but there's less to craft. Late game mostly comprises finishing the story and maintaining your territories, the crafting and food supply aspect almost completely forgotten.\n- There's some utility features that I wish were in there. Looting the containers in a building loses it's charm fairly quickly, and ordering the containers searched will be tedious. I wish there was a button that tells the survivors to "loot all containers until your full", or something like that.\n- Another feature I wish was there was "back to back". Having the survivors back to back, looking in each direction, is the most common and important maneuver. Doing it manually is clunky as hell, and I wish there was a button for it.\n\nDespite all this, it's still a solid game, as most bugs can be ignored, easily worth about $5, though I wouldn't pay full price.","January 23, 2014","true","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Good when you’re stuck in a rut.\n-the inventory size is a brilliant idea.\n-nice story line\n-gadgets and such are pretty darn cool. Turrets and cameras are my favourite\n\n\nGlitches:\n-Spitters can spit through glass and grabbers can grab and drag squad members through glass.\n-There have been times where I cleanse an area only to have it recaptured the next day; before I can advance. 10/10 on the annoying and rage quitting scale.\n-Sometimes a squad member will prioritise a group of zombies that had been seen and would be easily dealt with by another member rather than the hoard coming at the door. Also when a squad member is attacked by a jumper his buddies either shoot the other zombies before the one that’s pinning him.\n- I have found certain maps, during a defence round, zombies won’t attack the area you are in and instead stay in certain areas, requiring you to hunt for them, which is quite boring.\n- exiting a game will save your squad.\n\nIdeas to improve the game\n-diverse personalities and speeds. A range of movement speed, reloading skills and gadget efficiency would be cool. Certain personalities pick up and improve in certain fields.\n-being able to move non-squad and/or have multiple squads. Moving survivors for defence from town to town as you progress is almost impossible.\n-WOMEN!\n-working at a large facility is required for/improves production\n- implement of buildings such as hospitals, workshops and storage. Hospitals for increased healing, workshops for building or improving gadgets and storage for storing equipment and materials.\n- Co-operation mode aswell as fighting multiplayer.\n\ndispite this i still like and continue to play this game.","January 26, 2014","true","18.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Watching your men shoot zombies is very visceral and exciting.\n\nYou advance through checkpoints on a map, capturing and securing resource nodes in an attempt to exterminate zombies from the face of the earth. You can scavenge new materials, weapons and blueprints from buildings.\n\nMany of the buildings repeat very often. A greater variety of layouts would have been really nice, I have only seen four or five constructs so far.\n\nSpecial zombies are extremely dangerous, and can temporarily disable one of your squad, making it necessary to travel in groups of two or more.\n\nWeapons and armors seem a little expensive, but it doesn't kill the sense of advancement.\n\nOverall, I definitely reccommend this game.

They will keep going to where you told them to go no matter what is in the way and wont attack and of the zombies hanging off of them. This means that there is a MASSIVE difficulty spike when you get to the level 2 buildings.\nThe special zombies are an alright idea but are just taken from Left 4 Dead so they don’t seem fresh and are just run-of-the-mill.\nThe spitters are just over powered as they can shoot through walls and any other obstacle. This means that you could be in a building and then there is spitter goo flying through 4 walls and 3 rooms to land directly on one of my team members.\nThe jumpers are basically hunters from L4D so they are as you can expect and mean that splitting up your squad is a bad idea in most situations. This offers a glimmer of hope to an otherwise frustrating game.\nThe crafting is a good idea because it makes you go back to old locations to gather resources that you had missed before. It also means that you can equip your team with better equipment so that they won't die so fast. You do, however, use cloth to make armour. You also use cloth to make bandages. Because of the stupidity of your squad members, you will be making bandages more than you will be making armour.\nYou also have to defend locations if you leave them for too long. I find that this is a good idea because it keeps you on your toes and makes you clear out the areas adjacent. This does mean that your squad will be really badly damaged or killed. This is because they throw hundreds if zombies at you and this is very difficult unless you have built defences to help.\nOverall this game could be a great game if the problems are either tweaked or sorted out.\n","May 28, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So I search the entire map end to end and can't find any more infected. What's the point in that?

Well here's an over-glorified flash game for you. In Survivor Squad you control up to 4 members of a squad on missions to eliminate all zombies in an area, exploring and looting as you go about it. You can then craft new weapons and supplies at your bases, which cost those same resources to establish. You spend gas to travel from area to area, and there's a store. The fact that I can tell you everything about the game four sentences says a lot about what you're getting here.\n\n-The controls are horrendous. your squad has really little to no AI to speak of. you have to tell them where to move, where to turn, and occasionally where to attack. If they're alone and a zombie sneaks up behind them, they're dead because apparently they didn't hear it a flesh-eating monster running up behind them and think to turn around and shoot it. They only ever turn to shoot something nearby them if a teammate spots is spotting it beside them in their cone of vision that extends about four yards in front of their face, because hooray near-sightedness. And they also don't start shooting until the enemy is halfway into their cone of vision. Making guns nearly-useless, due to the fact that they also refuse to reload by themselves. They'd rather stand still and get eaten than reload. No, YOU have to select them and hit R manually, or they're ♥♥♥♥ed. You also cannot tell them to turn and face a new direction without moving first. Which is a hell of a ♥♥♥♥ing hassle.\n-The "Story" is pathetic. After going easy on you for the first few levels, prepare for story-based missions where you have to help some guy, or retrieve some item, while pushing against an UNLIMITED tide of zombies until you accomplish your goal, with your UNLIMITED ammo, where enemies charge you from all directions, leaving you finding your squad walking back to back a few feet at a time in what is the most boring mission layout I have ever seen in a game.\n-The voice ac- oh wait, there was no voice acting. Or maybe there was and it was so bad I didn't remember it. I'm going to stand by saying there was no voice acting. Leaving you to have to actually READ things others are saying while your squad is being eaten alive because you forgot to check the bottom of the screen to see if they were out of ammo and needing you to hold their and and hit R.\n\nI'd tell you everything else that's wrong with this game but there is literally nothing else to criticize, the game is too small to have anything else to criticize. At least it has two other game modes, survival and sandbox. Sandbox being essentially story mode but without the story-driven ♥♥♥♥ missions, but it also has no ending as well. Just repetitive gameplay until you die or get bored.\n\n4/10. If I had no other games available, maybe I could push myself to finish the story mode at least, but thankfully, I do have other games available, and if you do too, do yourself a favor. Steer clear so far of this game that you forget it exists.","December 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There's a few controls that are frustrating that they fixed in Survival Squad: Guantlets.

Story is non-existent. You keep on searching same-looking black/greyish buildings for stuff while fighting with the clumsy controls and bad AI of your fellows. While you are supposed to scavenge stuff the initial inventory is way to small so that adds further to frustration.\nAlso zombies can retake areas so you might have to refight the levels. RPG elements are kept simple - all characters have the same skill tree. And the art-style is really bad - not like "good" bad but as in "bad" bad.\nThe good stuff? Exciting shooting and tension, lot of blood. But it's not enough to save the game.","August 5, 2014","false","3.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

You have spliters, jumper, grabber, blinder. and it it quite fun to play through.\n\nthe most annoying bug that i found in this game, is that the zombie can attack through walls and connors. I was deploying my squad to a connor in order to defense the house. Then a grabber from outside the house hooked up 1 of my survivors and he stuck in the connors, and i couldn't do anything but reload my autosave file to play again. the same thing happen with spliters.\n\nSometimes, if you control the whole squad and you move so close to the wall of a house, there might be a chance ( not a small chance ) that one of your survivors will appear on the other side of the walls, the result is that he dies because of the horde inside the house before other memebers can come and rescue him\n\nthis game is fun, but some bugs can ruin all your joy. Recommend to buy it when it is on sale. I grab this game with only 1.25$ so it is not so bad to play, but 5 ? i dont think it worths","August 17, 2014","false","11.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Turn-based on world level, realtime with smart pause on node level. Simply but addictive.\n\nI like this game, even if I cannot totally understand the rules. Why no zones (after first) generates resources? How am I supposed to feed survivors, if I haven't enough food? How can I use "market" zone, if I claimed it already? There are more such questions for me, and it keeps to grow while I am progressing.\n\nAlso, it's quite nervous, trying to secure buildings before all hostages will be eaten by zombie. It's most annoying aspect for me (and endless zombies until you'll finish proposed task is second one).\n\nUnfortunately, I got bug in my game when I killed everyone, and secured everything, but cannot claim zone (program thinks there are 10 zombies here), and cannot leave it (by the same reason).

After release on  steam, I felt  the price was *far* too high.  I decided to catch this on steam during the holiday sale.  Again a great deal.\n\nBehold! an update!  I'm very happy with what I've seen in comparison to my old IndieGameStand version.  I'll definitely update this review once I get more time in.\n\nPS:\n1.

Got my money's worth of fun from the game. There's plenty of carnage, a crafting system, leveling options, loadout, and a big map with lots of different locations.\n\nThe bad: It got repetitive after ripping through the first 5 or 6 points on the map. Leveling isn't that in depth. Nothing going on that stood out graphically. The story and all the events encountered were on the blah side.\n\nThe short: It's worth getting if you don't have much else to do, it's on sale, and you aren't looking for something to play for more than a few hours. Otherwise, don't.\n\nI give it a thumbs down since it got boring right around an hour of play. I pushed through another half hour or so of gameplay to see if it got any better.

Got my money's worth of fun from the game. There's plenty of carnage, a crafting system, leveling options, loadout, and a big map with lots of different locations.\n\nThe bad: It got repetitive after ripping through the first 5 or 6 points on the map. Leveling isn't that in depth. Nothing going on that stood out graphically. The story and all the events encountered were on the blah side.\n\nThe short: It's worth getting if you don't have much else to do, it's on sale, and you aren't looking for something to play for more than a few hours. Otherwise, don't.\n\nI give it a thumbs down since it got boring right around an hour of play. I pushed through another half hour or so of gameplay to see if it got any better. It just got more difficult, which is fine. However, nothing else changed much. The game lost my interest.","November 5, 2014","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game tasks you with controller a team of up to four survivors as you try to eliminate a zombie threat in various areas.\n\nThe click to move and hold to set a direction is a nice mechanic however the ability to change facing direction while moving or move backwards etc. would be a nice addition.\n\nPersonally I like the way you scavenge to craft and the ability to tell your survivors to switch between firearms and melee weapons to control noise and crowds. The game isn't revolutionising any mechanics and it may be a little light on its mechanics and progression but the gameplay works and I was entertained.","April 1, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game includes crafting, squad management, and zombie killing. The main question is pretty simple, just follow the red arrows to find the labs and kill the source. Controlling large cities is important as they generate resources.\n\nWhen rescuing cities, visit the different houses and kill all zombies without activating alarms or spotlights that attract more zombies. Turrets are awesome. Important details to be aware is that you have unlimited ammo, that all fights happen at night, and that cities are randomly generated. If you lose a large city and you reclaim it, the resources it provides change. Secure cities by keeping 3 to 4 guys in it.\n\nThe game could use better survivor backgrounds and faces. The faces all look child-like. While there are characters of various races they are all guys. It seems that while some survive the zombie apocalypse, there are no women. The survival mode and death lab mode add additional depth to the game. Cheap and fun game. Worth the price, especially when its on sale.","January 19, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is great for players looking for a zombie game that has shooting and looting! In the campaign you lead survivors from sector to sector. Once you clear the node of zombies you can then fortify it and it can produce resources for you. And survival mode and the death lab mode are great. In death lab you start with a limited amount of points instead of having to scavange and craft them. You can give your 4 survivors guns , melee , armor,  special equipment (sentry guns, cameras, etc) and perks. For a cost that is... Then once that is done you\nmust lead them through lab after lab, but one thing... The game doesn't give you ANY hints to where the exit is.\nYou must search for it while fighting the zombies, and they never stop till you get into the exit.\nAnd it gets even harder the deeper you go.\n\nAs for survival mode, you start with 2 survivors. And you go through building after building,\nkinda like campaign. But you can't never go back... And unlock death lab you must scavenge for\nanything you can find... Food, metal scraps, wood, cloth, and weapons. And after you have enough\nsupplies you can craft the guns , equipment , armor, anything you need. That is if you have the stuff you need.\n\nAnd for the gameplay. It can be really challenging once you get far in on death lab or survivor mode.\nMainly cause the spawner spams jumpers and spitters, but no big deal. The "line of sight" mechanic\ngives you that urge of fear... What the hell is in the dark?!  It also opens you to tactics.\nDo you want all the survivors cramped in one room looting it? or do I send two of them looting while\ntwo stand watch? Either way it can be dangerous. This is where the quipment comes in handy\nfor two scrap (wich is really easy to have) you can set a camera up in a corner to give you extra line of\nsight. Lets you know when your about to die. The sentry gun does just what every other sentry gun does.\nshoots zombies to bits. There is also a dummy that can distract them, a EMP like device that can electrocute\nzombies in a radius. And more...\n\nOver all I highly recommend this game to any gamer.","February 5, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game includes crafting, squad management, and zombie killing. The main question is pretty simple, just follow the red arrows to find the labs and kill the source. Controlling large cities is important as they generate resources.\n\nWhen rescuing cities, visit the different houses and kill all zombies without activating alarms or spotlights that attract more zombies. Turrets are awesome. Important details to be aware is that you have unlimited ammo, that all fights happen at night, and that cities are randomly generated. If you lose a large city and you reclaim it, the resources it provides change. Secure cities by keeping 3 to 4 guys in it.\n\nThe game could use better survivor backgrounds and faces. The faces all look child-like. While there are characters of various races they are all guys. It seems that while some survive the zombie apocalypse, there are no women. The survival mode and death lab mode add additional depth to the game. Cheap and fun game. Worth the price, especially when its on sale.","January 19, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I find this game allows me to utilize tactics I've studied, such as bounding leap-frog movements or how to properly clear a building. There's a lot of strategy involved in every step you take, as well as which sacrifices you will make (what items to bring home, what nodes to capture, etc.). Very fun game, very simple, very cheap. A few minor glitches but they are overwhelmingly outnumbered by the positive qualities, much like you will be if you make a wrong move. HARDCORE: if you lose a squad mate then he's dead. You have to level up your guys and pick a few simple perks from a static perk tree that help define the roles in your squad. You take over nodes to gain resources and you have to manage and defend them by keeping recruits there and keeping them fed. This game is stressful, and makes you worry about your guys and each step you take. Very fun, highly addictive. Worth the money, especially for tactical lovers.","July 18, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes, you will get a combination of random events that will kill your team and you cannot load a save file to recover them. That may leave you with a single survivor, in which case you pretty much lose the game.","December 5, 2015","false","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I really like the concept as well, crawling your way through a zombie infested city and managing your left-for-dead style squad at every turn.\n\nBut this game is broken and unwinable.\n\nI've tried to win twice.  On my first play, I got in a scenario where I could not take and hold a node because it would get immediately recaptured by the zombies in the time it took for my guys to return from base after capturing (a return which was mandatory).  On my second play, I wisely set up a defensive ring so that I wouldn't have to deal with this.  Then, I got stuck in an Endless Loop of defending nodes, because the time it takes to defend on node was enough for another to get attacked.\n\nDevs, I like your gameplay, but this is ridiculous.  There's no reason I should get game-breaking bugs on my first two playthroughs.  Do some playtesting next time.","August 21, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
