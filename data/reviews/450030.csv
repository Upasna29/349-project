It crashes nearly every time a new area is loaded, and the gameplay is tedious, holding your hand so hard as to force you to physically hide from nothing in two separate ways just to teach you how to hide. In addition, the opening section alone has you backtrack at least twice. That's twice in less than 15 minutes. Audio is poor, too. Just generic stuff that adds nothing to the atmosphere. Voice acting is horrendous as well, and the intro video is literally a terrible, 5-minute long meme, with 30 seconds devoted to the player character dancing the Gangnam Style dance to what I'm assuming is generic free music. There's no way the developer took this game seriously. It's Youtube fodder and nothing more.","April 15","false","0.6"," 85 of 97 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","85","97","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/recommended/450030/","underpr1","Undersniper1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/underpr1/","1265 products in account","This is a pasive horror game with some dramatic or scary moments which his sound may impact tension on you. Beginning the game you are worker as security in a nuclear bunker but this explode and your duty is to survive by making a series of instructions and steps to exit. When starting the game you lost but you will start following the instructions they give you to be progressing slowly. In some parts they are very dark and not in others. The game is good because it has that sense of tension because you do not know what will happen to you or where you're going on every door you open. It will be on some occasions you will have to repeat pass through areas where you have walked previously and so is the whole way. It contains some effects of toxic gases other electricity, etc. also it contains some secret places to hide. You make a series of strange noises or even cough moans or such because of toxic gases.\n\nOn some occasions you hear voices like horror and occasionally dramatic moments. There are rare creatures around. Graphics looks old and good at the same time. The sound is ok and strong in some cases. I liked the game and there is of course much more to discover so if what you like is to walk, hide and kill some this game is for you.","April 20","true","20.3"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"
