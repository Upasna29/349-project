There's an equal amount of fun and challenge. The game is no pushover, but even the rough patches are no reason for frustration.\n\nIts a game that oozes that retro style with great chip tunes and sound effects from that Nintendo era. The graphics fit for the most part, but they can be an bit immersion breaking with some of the ugly looking giant dragon heads and the giant boss pictures that kick off each level. The backgrounds and terrain look a lot better and have more detail than the moving sprites in the game.\n\nRight off the bat, this is a game about great controls and an abundance of them. You have a double jump, a dash that rockets you forward whether you're in the air or on the ground, short range sword, wall clinging, long range spells that use mana and you can even charge your spells. The only downside is sometimes its tough to get away from a wall. You can drop, but trying to leap off to a different area is tough. Its best to play it safe and stay on the wall.\n\nThe story is simple, but I'm never one to read a story. The town is in danger, now you must go through four levels to defeat their boss before unlocking the fifth level to stop the true evil at the end. Its a formula that has been done before, but that's no reason to turn away.\n\nEach of the five or so levels has a different theme and spell to find. A haunted castle, an aerial castle, a post apocalyptic wasteland, a frozen cavern, and so on. The levels keep track of your best times and how many items from that level you've collected so there's a reason to go back and speed run.\n\nThese levels are a healthy length and do offer a variety of different platforming action to make each stage feel more unique. One stage has a shooter section and after that you keep the wings to let you jump as many times as you want in the air. Another stage halts the action in two different rooms for you to dodge an array of arrows and another to avoid smashers. The ice cavern lets you ride ropes down to the bottom. It shows that effort was put into the game to make it more than just another platformer.\n\nThe brief tutorial level that spoon feeds you with text as you run through the level such as how to jump over a pit. Then the game opens into a town where you can purchase upgrades and head off to the next level. its a hub world and with every game over, you respawn here with everything but your score in tact. Its a forgiving game. Every item, star, ability and spell you've collected stays with you.\n\nContinues are infinite and each one grants you three lives, but you can purchase more for forty stars. You can also find or earn lives as you play. Each enemy drops one or two stars and you'll need at least one hundred for any upgrade.\n\nThe merchant in town will sell you upgrades for your attack strength, health increase, spell strength and mana recharge rate. There is one passive ability to purchase that will let you attract items toward you like extra lives, hearts and stars. While none of these is a game changer, its more of a reward for your hard work.\n\nBecause you have attack strength and spell strength, that means the enemies take a while to defeat. You need to put a little effort into slashing a slime a half a dozen times. By effort I mean the sword will slash as fast as you can mash that button.\n\nAs for the spells, there are four of them. A simple shot that can charge into a bright blue beam. A triple shot spark that can charge into a shield of eight shots which then throw out in different directions. A bomb that charges into four bombs. Its a skill that feels lackluster. The last spell is the ice spell, which does... lava? No it is just a simple ice spell. The charged variant of it throws out three blades of ice forward and one behind you.\n\nThere is only a small variety of enemies. Knights will charge forward. Slimes just hang out and jump every so often. Ghosts fly in. Birds dive toward you. Flowers spit projectiles in three directions. Oh and spikes they are instant death traps, but this game goes easy on the amount of spikes, but it uses them well.\n\nThen the bosses tend to be the ones with diversity. Each boss has a few different simple patterns and can throw a lot of projectiles. A lot of them will force you to jump to hit them and scurry away to avoid projectiles. They are a good challenge after a long level when you've run out of lives and health.\n\nTaimumari makes you earn some of the collectible items and even hearts that give you full health. The items are found near pits or hard-to-reach places like just over a cliff. While its nothing too difficult, it makes you challenge yourself to get them. Once you have them, you never have to get them again so you can even cheat by just dropping into a pit after collecting the item. People looking for a challenge will avoid the pit.\n\nI did find some minor issues, such as projectiles shooting backward. When new areas of a level would load, the screen would shift around. Its nothing that broke the game and they did seem quite consistent.\n\nFor the price, this is a great game even if the game can be considered short with five deep and diverse levels. Its still well worth the price for any issues that I have with the game.","January 8","true","1.3"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/375520/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","It is so depressingly easy to take the wrong lessons from classic games. Mega Man 2, for example, is a master class in play control, graphics, sound design, and challenge. However, there were undeniably some enemies that were tuned a little too high, and some level segments that presented unfair challenges or could force a restart under some conditions. Taimumari is a retro platformer made by the sort of people who look at the laser beams in Quick Man's stage and think yes, this is the sort of thing we should be shooting for.\n\nThe enormous blocks of poorly-written text the game opens with explain that your magical world had a thingy that could make everyone divine but some dudes messed with it and now everything is disappearing. You play a young, inexperienced mage who gets the quest to save the world thrust upon her for unclear reasons. The pleasant, pastoral intro level eases you into your double-jumps, wall jumping, magic, and dash abilities before depositing you into the hub town. Here you can talk to people, buy upgrades with stars, or choose your next level to challenge.\n\nFor God's sake, start with Sir Fallenstar because his creepy-themed level is the only one that offers a reasonable challenge. All the others devolve into improbable arrays of bottomless pits and instant-kill spike platforms that will force you into Super Meat Boy-esque contortions to pass. Explosion Girl's stage has a long moving platform section where you have to keep perfect pace with your ride, and Roketto's stage (I swear I am not making these names up) has some Flappy Bird-style weaving through spike gauntlets. Passing these obstacles can take numerous attempts, sending you back to distant checkpoints for each retry.\n\nThis alone wouldn't damn Taimumari, because honestly the platforming challenges aren't all that much worse than those of the NES ball-breakers of yore. No, what kills this game is that you get exactly three tries to pass each level. Lose all your lives, and you get kicked straight back to the hub with a big, chunky GAME OVER. You can spend your precious stars on 1-ups, and most levels have one or two hidden away in particularly deadly spots, but that does little to ease the pain of losing your last life on learning a boss and having to re-do the entire 10-minute stage.\n\nIf the game was particularly polished or compelling you could almost make a case to stick it out, but Taimumari can't manage that either. The graphics are strangely flickery all over, especially during scene transitions. Everything is oddly-proportioned, too, with a lot of long, uneventful walks and melee combat taking place at the very bottom of the screen between squat characters. The backgrounds are detailed but the foregrounds and characters are not, especially the larger ones. Weapons are poorly balanced, your sword has aggravatingly little reach, and enemies take a ridiculous number of hits to kill.\n\nI feel like all the right intentions to make a good game were here, but the polishing and balance passes were overlooked or skipped altogether. Unless you like your platformers absolutely punishing, something is going to make you rage in this game. It might be the umpteenth nigh-unkillable enemy, it might be the thousandth death by corner spike, or it might be the laughably bad dialogue between the embarrassingly bad characters. And with a range of threats like that, you're much better off staying far away from this one.","February 26","false","0.9"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","25","36","0","0"

The game consists of 8 levels with a boss fight at the end of each one. There are stars along with other collectibles on each level, and you can use the stars you collected to increase your health and mana bars, and your physical and magic damage. There are a variety of spells to unlock in this game and they are all helpful and necessary to get through parts of some levels. There are three difficulty settings, and although I played on the easiest one, I still found the game a challenge and have gotten stuck on the second to last level.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\n\nPros:\nUnique bossfights and levels\nLots of spells, slow time down, reverse time, or summon a magic shield!\nLots of hidden collectibles every level for completionists\nExtremely challenging, and certain achievements require beating the game without buying any upgrades!\n\nCons:\nGetting powerups can be grindy\nSome English translations were sloppy\n═══════════════════════════════════\n\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nExtremely challenging platformer that reminds me of classics such as the Kirby games. For just a few dollars, this game delivers more than enough content.\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here","December 16, 2015","true","4.0"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","24","38","3","0"

This game had a promising start, player controls are decently tight. Once I got into the field, though, I realized there's no reason/incentive to pretty much ever use your sword, and the game then effectively becomes more of a Mega Man clone. Ultimately, the small frustrations (poor boss design, repetitive nature, etc) just kinda outweighed the fun.\n\nGotta love the Engrish, though.","January 21","false","1.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The intro is barely even legible due to the choice of font/dropshadow and actually hurts my eyes when I try to read it. (There are also no apostrophes as of yet in the sentences where there should have been and I've played 4 of the 8 levels.)\n\nFor those of you asking for examples of the text:\n\nTutorial text for double jump: "Makes a double jump to jump twice as high.". That's all it says, it doesn't say what makes a double jump or anything, that is literally the entire text prompt given to you.\n\nDash ability text: "For dash, use the button . So you can travel long distances in the air and not only." It just stops there... not only what?\n\nRandom bits of dialogue:\n\nH: "Yes, and thats why you are sending me to such dangerous missions!   >_< " (Yes emojis make their way into the actual dialogue text.)\n\nK: "I know. If you would not be able to do this, then no one else would." (Hint: this conversation is supposed to be in the present tense.)\n\nH(after beating boss 2): "Just listen to me, at least! you had been tricked by Warai-kun! Relic that you had stolen destroys the balance in the flow of time in the entire world!" Also, is the protagonist slow or something? The bosses literally tell her before the fights that they are out to destroy the world and she keeps telling them that they are being tricked into destroying the world...\n\n\n\n- The plot itself makes no sense and even lacks basic continuity. You see this in the actual game and even in the plot they write on the steam description. The steam description starts by saying the ancient crystal fell into evil hands, then says that you must find the ones who destroyed the crystal AND somehow return it into reliable hands, THEN calls the thing(s?) that was/were stolen talismans and not a crystal. The actual in-game plot doesn't even follow that description completely and is actually a lot worse. Hell, the protagonists even tells one of the bosses he's being tricked into doing bad things without knowing when he clearly states he wants to destroy the world. The entire plot seriously looks like a bunch of 14 year-old weabs (not meant derogatorily as I myself could probably be considered a weab)  with attention-span issues found each other on chatango and made a game out of their random conversations.\n\n- The battle system is not very well done, your sword swing has no cooldown so it literally becomes a case of mash attack as quick as possible to kill easy mobs. Almost every boss is just flat out designed to be only attacked with your ranged spells. They even tell you that in a convo with the npcs where the protagonist asks if she just has to beat up the bosses and they tell her she'll probably have to use her spells mostly. Hell, the very first boss fight doesn't even let you attack melee, the boss puts up this ridiculous yellow barrier so you HAVE to shoot him. This pretty much results in very dull fights where you climb up a wall and sit there shooting the bosses over and over because most of them can't do anything to you once you are up there.\n\n- Extremely dull boss fights. Bosses don't so much have attack patternS as a single long attack pattern. This means they do have different attacks but they repeat them in the same order in a constant loop making them the most predictable thing in the world. The boss fights pretty much consist of figuring out the best place to stay and waiting for your mana to refill so you can shoot the boss again.\n\n- There is no knockback so when you are hit or you hit an enemy they either keep moving or it stops their animation a bit depending on the enemy.\n\n- The displayed damage values don't actually mean anything. Every attack you do will register as 50 damage no matter what it is until the killing blow which will suddenly show up in a larger font as 200 damage as if you critted the enemy or something.\n\n- There is no game over menu, instead it pops up the regular pause menu (which you never use anyway) with options like continue, exit level, exit game. One would assume in this scenario continue would mean start the level over but it actually teleports back to home base as if you hit exit level anyway so this is entirely useless.\n\n\nThere are a load of other problems, in short: Not recommended.","December 16, 2015","false","3.1"," 32 of 64 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","32","64","5","8"

It's a satisfying and charming little indie platformer that gives you a lot of good gameplay for a very low price. It's also very frustrating at times with some incredibly questionable level design and it incentives grinding for upgrades above almost all else. It feels like a game that could be amazing if it was just a little softer on the player with instant-deaths and very slow money drop rates.\n\nAlso, the game is apparently Russian and it kind of shows. The translation is laughly bad, in a way that's actually sort of charming. Don't expect much of a story here though.\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs up for now because despite everything that frustrates me about it I still find myself coming back to it.
