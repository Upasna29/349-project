"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gogozilla/recommended/344910/","gogozilla","The Skrullmastra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gogozilla/","149 products in account","The top-rated helpful review compares this game positively to 3D shmups like Star Fox and urges the reader to purchase this game immediately if they enjoy the others. Don't do that.\n\nSince the comparison to Star Fox has already been made, I'm going to roll with it. We're going to be focusing on the similarities and differences between this game and Star Fox 64, which might seem unfair once I get into it, but 64 is eighteen years old and this game came out this year.\n\nFirst off, the flying. Your ship (no matter which one you select,) has no real weight to it. It floats gleefully around the screen with such speed that it highlights more especially than anything the stirring lack of actual control you have over it and the lack of any real animation to it. The ship floats where you point it and that's it. No maneuvering, no complexity of control, and no real animation to the motion besides a slight tilt in the direction you're heading.\n\nOkay, the flying's not great, but 3D shmups are more about the shooting anyway. Star Fox 64 had satisfyingly fast shooting with incrimental power upgrades for your lasers. This game SORT OF has a similar upgrade, but it is automatically collected - no challenge there - and only serves to slightly speed up your INCREDIBLY SLOW AND INACCURATE SHOOTING. Your shots don't arc based on motion or follow the angle of your ship, they go forward on a fixed line, meaning you need to line up perfectly with your enemy to shoot them. This would be a small flaw if your ship didn't block most of the screen and make actually seeing and lining up with an enemy an incredibly difficult effort that ultimately only serves to crash your ship into the target and not actually give any meaningful award or feedback for shooting the target down.\n\nThe screen is locked exactly as it is, so your range of motion is incredibly limited. This wouldn't be an issue considering the complete LACK OF DIFFICULTY for most of the game, but sooner rather than later, enemies and their attacks start tracking you. With the screen locked as it is and your ship as floaty and unresponsive as it is, you very quickly start losing life to attacks you've got almost no chance of escaping. This is what we call ARTIFICIAL DIFFICULTY. It's when a stupidly easy game makes a stupid and hamfisted attempt to make itself not so stupidly easy.\n\nThere's little to no variety in the levels. Honestly, the major difference between one level and the next is what enemy or threat you're meant to be shooting or avoiding. There's briefly an in-door segment with metal walls to avoid, but it's not contextualized as a huge enemy ship or planet or base or anything, and once it's done you're back to the completely linear space hallway.\n\nThe visual style is incredibly lazy. Nothing looks interesting or memorable in any way, and the utter lack of animation beyond direct motion kills any sort of interest the bland designs and lazy attacks might generate.\n\nI'd like to say there's something positive to this game to help redeem it or maybe make it more aggrieving that the rest is so lazy and boring, but there isn't.\n\nI can't put in the effort to be mad at a game that didn't have any effort put into at all.\n\nTL;DR Slow, boring, lazy, ugly, and uninpsired. No matter what other games you enjoy, pass this one up. It's not worth your time, let alone your money.\n0/10 (NOT WORTH RATING)","August 23, 2015","false","0.2"," 112 of 135 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","112","135","7","1"

Big explosions would be very nice in a game like this, especially in the year 2015, not seeing more satisfying explosions is disappointing\n\n\nOverall, this game is easily worth it's asking price of $3.99 USD and certainly it's sale price.  While you likely won't be spending dozens of hours in this game, if you get an hour or two of fun out of it total over the next month or two, then it's more then worth the price tag.\n\nAdvice: I would wait until the support is added for a twin stick controller (Xbox 360 controller support) especially if you enjoy playing games like this with a controller over a keyboard.\n\nMy Rating:  65% out of 100 (But this rating is moved up to a 75% considering its low price tag)\n\n\n\n","April 4, 2015","true","0.4"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","37","52","5","1"

Never before have I played a shooter with such poor mechanics, sluggish controls, and awful mission-design. Dodging enemy ships and their bullets should be a relatively simple task, but instead it's messy and somewhat convoluted. This can be attributed to the odd perspective. It's not always clear where objects are in relation to the player-ship. So this results in lots of collisions. The bosses tend to have homing weapons, and they're exceedingly frustrating to deal with. Why? Because the player-ship can't maneuver around them, and the angle makes it difficult to tell where the homing shots are heading.\n\nIn shootemups, dodging a single bullet should be as easy as breathing. The developer makes the game more difficult by increasing the speed of that bullet, adding more of them, giving them unique properties, and so on. It's the constantly building intensity that keeps these games challenging. Sun Blast somehow manages to accomplish the opposite. Dodging a single bullet is far more trouble than in any other game I've played.\n\nThe missions are exceedingly generic and dull. For the most part they're also extremely easy, except for the bosses. Whenever I had to replay the last few stages, because I died at the boss, all I could do was nod my head and think "Yep. I expected this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."\n\nIf I spend enough time with Sun Blast, eventually I could learn to handle it's many terrible qualities.\nBut why? This game suffers from a total dearth of entertainment value.\n\nBefore I forget, let's take a look at this statement: "the best 3d space shooter on Steam". I can't claim to know the Steam Store's library well enough to confirm that this is false. However, I will point out that Space Harrier II is available on the service. While it hasn't aged well, and the frame-rate is worse than Sun Blast's, this relic from the 16-bit era is a much better game. I suppose it doesn't include enough "3D" or "space" to fit the criteria, but it might actually be worth your time.","May 10","false","3.3"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","0"

The music is good. At times it's energetic and sometimes it's relaxing. The graphics could be better. Controls are very simple. Basically you only use arrow keys (movement keys) to move your spaceship and it shoots automatically. In boss battles you can see enemy shooting something like BayBlades, but it's a bit difficult to avoid them. This game has challenge mode. There are two types of challenges: survival and hit. In survival mode you have to stay alive as long as you can and in hit challange you have to shoot as many objects as possible. Sadly some silver medal achievements are bugged, so no perfect game. In overall the game is good and enjoyable.","August 20, 2015","true","4.7"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","26","41","3","3"

I would in no way recommend buying at £4.\n\nI've not played a lot of this game, but I don't really need to: it is a slightly clunky but perfectly playable game. It's the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a bargin bin, but along side the original Virtua Fighter or Pac-Man: Good but dated. Which is funny, because this isn't an old game, it just isn't very complicated.\n\nComparisons against classics of the genre are overly generous, but fans of the genre looking for a cheap & cheerful time-filler will enjoy this game's flatter-by-mimicry content. It even has unlockable 'challenges', which is a nice touch! Add to that the fact that this game will probably run on a toaster and what you have is a nice little offering.\n\n","August 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

Having played it, I would say it more accurately reminds me of an arcade game with a Star Fox feel to it. You have the choice of three ships to play as and each level consists of different types of enemies or obstacles. Survive an Asteroid bombardment, defeat fleets of enemy ships, collect upgrades to your ship, and go head to head with a mothership. I think the game is fun for an arcade-style game. I would have liked to see a little more variety, but visually it looks pretty good for an arcade-style game.","August 22, 2015","true","2.6"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","23","38","2","0"

Wii roots can be seen right away on the loading screen where the player is recommended to keep the wrist strap on at all time. Now just how many play this with a remote like on the Wii?\n\nSo is it any good? Well yes with some caveats:\n\nPro's:\n+ Pricing\n+ Simple gameplay - Pick it up and off you go.  There is even an autofire so you dont need to mash fire button.\n+ Challenge. Simple to learn but achievement stats speak for themselves: Those gold medals are tough.\n+ Content and variation. Yes it's listed below as a Con too but considering the base idea this game tries to get everything out of the formula with excellent variation and details.  Sometimes you fly in space shooting things, sometimes you either fly in space or in a tunnel and try to avoid hitting things. And lets not forget the Boss fights.\n\nCon's:\n- Limited content in the end no matter what. This is one of those small games you pick and play and then put away. Forget about tens of hours of gameplay.\n- Truly casual gamers with no will or skill to advance further will hit a wall relatively quick.

Prior to even redeeming the key I found this an unfair way to represent a new game because Starfox (in my opinion) is the best of the best for that third person arcade shootem’up genre. Putting expectations at that level means that a fully competent title could easily be harshly critiqued or condemned for not being absolutely perfect.\nFortunately, this is not the case for Sun Blast; it is anything but competent. Right from the start the controller mapping is atrocious. O(PS4)/B(360) is NOT the select button, it is the back button. Period. To be fair, that’s nothing a quick remapping would resolve right? Wrong. Attempting to open the remapping section of the options menu hard crashes the game. Every. Single. Time.\nAt that point I figured I might as well try out the actual game to see if troubleshooting would be worth the effort. Spoiler: it wasn’t. The ship you pilot is MONSTROUS; at any given moment over a fifth of your screen is obstructed by it. Shooting can hardly be called that, when you fire the only feedback is a pitiful streak of blue moving awkwardly towards the center of the screen. And yes I mean the center; the depth of the playing field is so janky that it is almost nauseating trying to figure out where your ship is relative to the debris you’re attempting to shoot or avoid. Not a good experience at all.","September 6, 2015","false","12.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Theres 4 levels before getting to that final guy and part of the reason I'm mad at the dam thing is because that giant bar going across the top of the screen that shows your buffs, it gets in the way whenever the final boss fired something at me from behind it and I wouldn't know so I couldn't dodge it half the time.

The game was on sale for 19 cents and has steam trading cards, so for that price I couldn't resist.\n\nThe game is very fun. It is basically an on-rails arcade shooter, that starts off really easy but quickly ramps up in difficulty when you get to the boss battles. I was stuck on one of the boss battles but felt really good after I finally beat the level. The music is great and although I think its the same 2 or 3 tracks, It dosen't become annoying. There are pickups on the levels that make it easier to blast enemies, like a faster gun and a shield.\n\nThe graphics are pretty bad for a game released in 2015. To be honest it looks like a PS2 game and for some reason the game Is locked at 45 fps. Also, when you first launch the game and try to run it in 1920x1080 you'll notice that the screen is cut off. However, if you go to the folder where the game is installed, there is a tool that will fix the problem.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game would be the User Interface and Presentation. There is no real indication of how far along you are in the campaign. When you beat a level it just tales you to the next one. There's no screen that says how many more levels there are. Also there is no way to easily change to another ship, (the game lets you choose from 3 at the beginning of your campaign).\n\nThese problems however do not negate the fact that the core game at hand is very fun. At full price I don't know if I would feel like I got a value.  There is only about 2-4 hours of gameplay, but for 19 cents I cant complain.","October 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I do think the comparisons to Starfox, Panzer Dragoon etc. are just a bit hyperbolic - the game is really only superficially similar to these well-regarded classics. It is ultimately more like a third-person Galaga/Asteroids clones with a few Starfox elements like the tunnel level etc. The graphics and sound are fine, if not technically/artistically impressive, and the controls of the various pilotable spacecraft are very responsive using a X-Box 360 controller.\n\nThere are several different level types, from needing to destroy a certain number of objects/enemies before the timer runs out, surviving an onslaught of obstacles for a certain amount of time to navigating tunnels, and these tend to repeat with the odd boss-battle ad-nauseum. As I've not invested very much time in the game at this time, I can't comment on later levels.\n\nAll in all, it's not a bad little arcadey game for 24 cents (the price I paid during a sale), and I've certainly dropped a quarter into far worse arcade machines for a single play, but I would say that it's definitely a harder sell at above $1 or so. At the right price, it's a simple little arcade game that scratches that certain itch in small bursts, but it's not something I can see myself investing a lot of time in.","August 23, 2015","true","0.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It does feel a little like star fox in the way you control your ships. The graphics are good enough to appeal to the player. Bullet effects are not the best, but you can see the differences when you upgrade your weapon and hear different soudns for each upgrade as well.\n\nControls are pretty crisp and spot on, the game has a ncie difficulty, you don't know what to expect with each new enemy type and they can catch you off guard as they all have different ways of flying at you or attacking you. The game also has some levels where all you need to do is fly through small spaces or through space debris and dodge objects, so a good mix of different levels.\n\nI fought one boss battle up to now and it was a good challenge and fun. I think its a nice game to own if you are a fan of stuff like space harrier or starfox, they captured some of the magic those games had and put it into an indie package at a small price. I recommend it to fans of 3d space shooters.\n\n","August 16, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Let me explain. Each ship gives different controls, one for balanced, one for quicker horizontal movement and one for quicker vertical movement. You can pick 3 different skins for your ship which is a neat touch. There is an autofire option which I left on.\n\nYour progress is saved every 5 levels. The four levels are usually shooting down something like enemy ships or asteroids or just avoiding hitting them. The fifth level is always a boss with different encounters. After playing it a few times a strategy seemed to emerge. For example of the second boss, going in a circular motion while hitting the ship's center right after it's blast seemed to work fairly well. The first boss I criss crossed to and from each of the 4 corners of the screen.\n\nYou can upgrade your ship 4 times with things like better weapons and a shield. These are indicated at the top HUD. These upgrades are both great and frustrating at the same time. Each hit to your hull will also remove one of your upgrades. This right here is the most challenging part to me as it really incentivizes you not hitting anything. Your ship's hull can survive about 8 hits before being destroyed.\n\nEDIT: Oh also the music! The music is really good.\nEDIT2: Oh and go straight into options and uncheck Invert Y Axis\nEDIT3: For some game design comments and commentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFnyrS72BMc","August 19, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I myself am a huge fan of the shmup genre, with Starfox (the original for SNES, not 64) being the first game I ever played to completion, and this game definitely deserves a spot on the shelf with other shmups. Let's get right into it, shall we?\n\nPros:\n- MUSIC! This game has some of the most up-beat, driving, and overall motivating music I've heard in an indie shmup for a while\n- Variation: This game doesn't just ask you to shoot everything. It requires you to master all forms of gameplay presented.\n- Well paced. This game doesn't have a difficulty wall. It gradually eases you into the harder and harder levels. And even as the levels progress, it is preparing you for what's to come.\n\nCons:\n- Control... No matter your ship, you control like you're flying a blimp\n- Graphics: The graphics are lacking a bit. I gather that this is an indie game, but everything looks a bit too flat and uninspired. There's no real art direction other than "Standard space shmup."\n\nI rather enjoy this game and can see myself playing it quite a bit in the future. That said, it's not the best game I've ever played. There is certainly better, but for $2, I'm not going to complain.","November 22, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The enemy variety is solid albeit the love of homing projectiles are a bit annoying.\n\nENEMEMINENIES: The enemies of the game vary per level, ranging from asteroids to various destroyers to large Dune Worms lodged in pipelines that try to kill you and your tiny little ship. As for the bosses, they tend to be similar to ones from Space Harrier where you dodge projectiles they lob at you or large death beams and eat rounds in-between.\n\nSUMMARY: Sun Blast is a rather solid Shoot-em-Up with a vague story, solid tight controls and nicely varied enemies and so on. For anyone with nostalgia, the game will feel very reminiscent, if you don't, it's still a good game. 8.7/10.","August 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is what you get, but in 3D. You shoot enemies, get power ups which make your shots stronger, but on each hit you lose one power up. Sounds rewarding and fun you say? Well, here comes the thing that makes a man turn into a very mad man: every 2nd round is a survival round, shooting won't help you and there are no power ups to get - and you will have to avoid obstacles at quite high speed, often you can't see what is coming next, so you better have a very good guess up your sleeves, or you will lose most of your power ups, ending up with your lame standard shot for the next round. Enemies will be fast later and they will shoot, and they will hit you, over and over and over again. Then comes the boss and you have your 3rd weapon upgrade ready! Let's wreak some havoc hee.... wtf... the boss just shot a homing projectile at you, which you can't avoid if you weren't at a good position when he shot, and another one, and another one... enjoy beating the boss with your standard shot (which is pretty lame) :>\n\nThis could easily have been a fun R-Type style 3D game, i will not dare to name a certain star animals title here, this would be too blasphemic.","January 5","false","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

After buying this game, I was looking forward to what I thought was the PC's answer to Star Fox. I also didn't see a proper sequel to the Star Fox series coming anytime soon. I doubt that Star Fox Zero (the upcoming one for the Wii U; not sure if that's the exact title) will offer much either.\n\nSuffice it to say, I was very disappointed in this. But I suppose there are a few pros. Here's the breakdown:\n\nPROS\n+ Cool textures for the price (I payed $0.24 for it instead of the original $5 price)\n+ Music is okay and works for the game\n\nCONS\n- Levels are generic and repetitive. Environments are quite static. I had to double check this page to see if it was EA (Early Access), but it wasn't, and to be fair, even in EA, games usually have more to them. The space levels are the most generic; you either have a static background and a "starfield" whose simplistic particles keep coming towards you monotonously, or you have a planet under you that appears to be a scrolling surface. In short, this is an inferior Star Fox that borrows from its worst parts.\n- Graphics settings are minimal, consisting only of resolution and a fullscreen toggle.\n- Checkpoints are thrown at you at the end of boss fights that seem to occur every 4 levels, and you only have 1 life, so if you die during the boss fight, you have to repeat those 4 levels, which is frustrating when you beat some of the more challenging levels.\n- Powerups don't seem to change anything except for the appearance of your ammo being fired. The purple stuff in your final weapon upgrade wiggles left and right in its trajectory which may slightly increase the radius making it more likely to collide with enemy hitboxes, but not enough to be worth the effort. If you get enough powerups without getting hit too much, you get a shield, but I can't remember if it absorbs 1 damage before collapsing or if it even does that much.\n- No option to use the mouse to move the ship or to even remap keybindings.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDon't waste your time, energy, or money on this. It's not worth it. There are far better FREE games out there. I am going to ask for a refund (it sounds like a lot of trouble for $0.24, but they shouldn't be able to profit from this). This game is one way to pass the time, but I know of a better way, go play Solitaire! Sun Blast is not nearly as fun as Star Fox, so don't be fooled.","August 21, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you're expecting a fun space adventure like starfox or at least a fun shoot 'em up adventure like Panzer Dragoon, you're going to be dissapointed.\n\nThis game is functional, yes. It plays fine. However, its got bare minimum functionality. You shoot and move through space, occasionally getting power-ups. Don't ask what they do, the game doesnt tell you. How do you use them? You dont. They're auto applied to your ship and you lose them when you get hit.\n\nYour ship (whichever of the three you chose, it wont really matter. They control slightly differently, but its not a major change) is always at the front of the screen and the camera scrolls you forward. enemies/obstacles pop up (and I mean pop up, its like it was made on the n64 the popup is so bad) so you can never tell where they're going to be. The field of view is incredibly small. There is a real lack of any substance. Yeah, you're in space shooting stuff, but it lacks all the things that made games like starfox cool\n\nYou dont see those squadrons of enemies approaching, battling in the background. Sometimes you're lucky if you get a planet background instead of black emptiness with the hyperspeed lines from starwars to indicate you're moving fast.\n\nBoss battles arent anything special either. No cinematics, no sense of danger, no challenge. They just feel like regular enemies with health meters.\n\nAlso, there is no story in game. The game gives you about 0 feedback on anything that is going on. So, read up on the lore before playing, otherwise you'll be lost fighting the most uninspired aliens I've ever seen.\n\nI think I played for 15 minutes. I dont think I'll pick it back up any time soon. Not really worth my play time, and chances are its not worth yours.\n\nIts actually a port of a Wii ware game from 2009. So, dont expect anything of it at all. At 24 cents, I feel like I barely got what I payed for.
