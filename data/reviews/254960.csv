If you love squad-based action/strategy games as much as I do, you will undoubtedly agree. The character progression is great, the loot is bountiful and the gameplay is addictive. But what makes my heart skip a beat is the combination of believable physics with highly destructible levels... Enemies in the next room? Empty that machine gun into the door and catch them off guard. Goons in the basement? Detonate a charge and bring the floor/ceiling down on their head. Pesky fiend hiding in the library? Have your skilled sniper fire a high-caliber round through two walls and a bookcase and right between the ribs... Take all that, set it in an increasingly fantastical version of WW2 (mechs, anyone?) and you have a recipe for good times. If the visuals and presentation were better, even a little bit, this would be fighting for a spot in my 'top 10 favorite games of all time' list.","October 27, 2013","true","22.9"," 136 of 139 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","136","139","0","2"

It has hundreds of authentic and detailed WW2 weapons and equipment, challenging gameplay, attention to detail, fully destructable buildings and cover that realistically break apart and degrade, simple to learn combat system that is the deepest i've seen in this genre, very good RPG systems with Skills and "Perk" style rewards for leveling up with branching trees, 6 different classes each with specific perks and play styles, open ended missions set on levels similar in style to X-COM or Jagged Alliance, excellent inventory system, a choose and build your own squad mechanic with perma death to all squad mates and just an all around charm that lasts through almost the entire experience of both games. I probably forgot to list a few more awesome things, but there are some not so good things too. The Voice acting is rather poor and bland, the game can be fairly difficult to get accustomed to, the story is predictable and dull, the Stealth System never seemed to work very well and toward the end of the game your squad becomes overpowered due to the introduction of some fictional weapons and technology that detracts from the otherwise extremely challenging and detailed WW2 setting.\n\nFULL REVIEW\nTHE GOOD\nThis little known game is actually in my top 3 video games of my lifetime so far. I picked it up used (back when used PC games were sold in stores) at a Gamestop by chance. I saw it, by chance, on the shelf and saw the WW2 theme and all the different guns and cool stuff on the box and i decided to give it a chance. Little did I know..... It would become one of my all time favorite video games and my number 2 series that i desperately want to see get a true sequel. Since i bought it, which was back in 2003 or so, i've never met anyone else who had ever played it and when i saw it on Greenlight, I wanted so badly to see it get onto Steam because of how amazing a Turn-based Strategy RPG it is. It never got any real recognition nor any major awards, which was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me (Journalists only give a real ♥♥♥♥ about games from Big names, like always and forever), but its honestly a ♥♥♥♥ing excellent game.\n\nTHE COMBAT SYSTEM\nIts more or less a hybrid of X-COM and Jagged Alliance. It has Turn-Based combat, which displays percentages on your chances to land a hit or sucessfully throw a grenade accurately. Theres some randomness to the game, sometimes a stray bullet will ricochet and strike an ally, enemy or barrell and cause some damage. Environments are completely destructable. This was the 1st game that had true destructable terrain and cover that mattered in game. It was years ahead in destructible buildings and made on a much smaller budget. The combat, for a turn-based game, is the most in depth of any turn-based strategy games i've played. Its a bit convoluted, but it does a great job of conveying information on any given action. In combat you can literally go anyway you want. You get 6 soldiers, send 1 soldier to a high window to be a sharpshooter, send 2 around the building on a flanking manuever, keep 3 together to flush out enemies and get their position. Once you see them, you can kill them anyway you want. Sniper shot to a specific body part, grenade in the window the nazis are standing at, spray an SMG or heavy machine gun and hope some of the bullets penetrate the wall or blow open a hole to get through to them or you can go balls out and fire a bazooka round at the window, blowing a gaping hole into the building and destroying the floor, wall and any furniture in the area.\n\nTHE WEAPONS AND WEAPON SYSTEM\nThe other awesome part, that i love the most, this game has A METRIC ♥♥♥♥ TON of different weapons. Each with specific stats and all of them are realistic and accurately modeled to their real life counterparts with authentic names. Near the end of the campaign you'll start to fight and comandeer Panzerkleins which do use some fictional weapons, but the rest are historically accurate which always made me giddy. I love WW2 era weapons, and this game has them on lockdown. Not only guns, theres dozens of different grenades, medical items, ammo types, engineering tools and landmines that are all historically accurate too and add some extra depth to your combat abilities and options. They even went as far as to have a "Weapon Familiarity" system, where if your character uses the same weapon for a long time, he becomes more skilled with it. A nice touch.\n\nTHE RPG SYSTEM\nNext to talk about, the RPG leveling and skill progression. You make your main character at the start of the game. After the 1st mission or 2 you then get to choose from a list of soldiers with specific personalities, backgrounds and classes. Theres 6 classes, Sniper, Medic, Soldier, Scout, Grenadier or Engineer. They all start with the class skills at a higher level and develop them as they use those skills. Kill some enemies, your combat skills improve. Patch up a squad mate, your Medic skills improve. As they improve, you can use better items. Theres something like 12 or 14 skills in total and each level allows you to unlock a choice of 3 or 4 different "Perks" on a level tree. Each class has unique perks, though some of them are shared. By the end of the game your characters could be a legendary marksman, an expert medic who can use any medical item and good with a rifle, or a grenadier whos as accurate with a Grenade as an NFL Quarterback with a football.\n\nTHE OTHER COOL STUFF\nCharacter models themselves are extremely detailed in the equipment they carry. If you put some German M-24 Stick Grenades into a characters inventory he will have the grenades hanging from his belt or his chest slings. Knifes, pistols, ammunition all show up and have unique models for what types of ammo they carry. The inventory system itself is similar to Resident Evil 4 or Deus Ex Human Revolution in that it kinda becomes a minigame trying to cram as much equipment in as possible. After you gear up you use a map screen that you travel over to get to a mission. Random encounters can pop up on the map and you can choose to attack random enemies. Theres about 20ish missions, some take a long time to complete, some are short but thats not including random encounters.\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD\nROUGH AROUND THE EDGES\nCan't have the good without the bad. The problems i've had with the game, and i've played both games about 6 or 7 times a piece, were the AI, the Stealth System, the Voice Acting, the Panzerkleins and the Story. AI can be braindead, but it they're still punishingly difficult. Voice acting is very low budget. Panzerkleins make you overpowered at the end of the game and the Stealth system never seemed exactly as it should, though it still functions somewhat.\n\nIN SUMMARY\nI'm out of characters to use, so in summary, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and its positives far, far outweigh its negatives. For $10, its damn worth trying and its extremely replayable. I tried to mention all the awesome mechanics and details but I know i missed or had to leave out a few. Get it for yourself, it never got the attention it deserved. It was a WW2 X-Com/JA Hybrid that was built on the perfect engine for this genre. Its in my top 3 games, its up there with Metal Gear Solid 3 for me and thats saying a lot for a budget game that was $40 brand new in 2003. TRY THIS GAME!!!\n\nAnd if you like it, please spread the word of this gem :)","January 23, 2015","true","30.3"," 109 of 111 people (98%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","98","109","111","4","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/254960/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","I've been playing a lot of turn-based squad tactics wargames in my life, every now and then. And of whole this genre (or sub-genre) I place Silent Storm in the top 5 of them all. Even after 12 years, with out-dated graphics (which is still looks quite decent, though), with some flaws in the late progress in the game (yeah, I guess you've already heard of Panzerkleins) - still it is a masterpiece.\n\nWhy I praise this game so high? There are several reasons:\n\n1) game's mechanics at first seems quite similar to Jagged Alliance. And that's not a flaw, because JA2 was one of the major swallowers of my time in the early 00's, compared only with Civilization 3 and TES Morrowind... More to it, Silent Storm is not trying to wear JA shoes, it walks its own path, and somewhat similar technical solutions only helps to get familiar with the game.\n\n2) Game's setting puts us in the perils of WW2, but, despite the fact it was created by Russians (maybe because of it), it lacks many of typical unnatural cliche, WW2 games usually so full of. I can't say that a gameplot is a "War and Peace" in a new cover, but it is certainly a result of good thought. It is clever all the way through, it is not using dehumanization, so common in the late media (you know, "good guys - bad guys" pattern). Everybody are players in the plot, which makes it sound like a good spy story, with unexpected trivials and rivals along the way. And all of that still plays like Jagged Alliance! You get it now? Nival created a very distinct game, but was clever enough not to distress people with new gamedesign decisions. So it has a very comforting start, and then the tide catches you, and you swim into completely another world of alternative history, where Nazis was not a menace, but just one of parts of the long-going power struggle, with their own hopes to better future... I don't making excuses for Nazis doings in the WW2, mind it! Many of my relatives died because of them, and I hold that score with me. But then again. Axis warmachine was very far of those mindless Ubersoldiers from Castle Wolfenstein, and it is good that at least somewhere soldiers of Axis block shown as they were.\nOh, well, I'm skidded away a bit, talking about game's topic. Let's just say, game gives a very thorough dive into the WW2 reality... and then adding some spice with technologies-never-existed. Most of the players like the game more without that spicy part, but hey! All other stuff is great without any doubts!\n\n3) And of all of the great stuff in that game, one of the most exciting features is the level of destruction you can add to anything around you. By that parameter, Silent Storm stands proudly above all other tactical games up to this moment! Battlefield Bad Company 2? Mercenaries 2? There are so little games where you can level literally everything to the pebble and dustl! But in the Silent Storm it is not only fun to do. You actually training your characters skills with every shot and explosives usage! So please, don't hold yourself! Shoot through walls and ceilings, blow everything apart! Become the weapon of mass destruction! Groovy!\n\nOkay, let's finish all that praising: game has some minor flaws, but they are very little comparing to the amount of fun that game can bring to you. And it is on sale now! Go for it, right away!\nMark 9.1/10","October 27, 2015","true","62.8"," 101 of 108 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","101","108","7","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jusunor/recommended/254960/","jusunor","Jusunor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jusunor/","302 products in account","Besides decent overall game mechanics, there are also some things that make Silent Storm particularly cool.\n\nI have never seen so well implemented environmental damage in any game, it beats all the modern strategy games and even the original X-COM (1994). It is just beautiful to see how building can partially (or entirelly) collapse depending on how many holes you have shot or blown up to its walls. That is not all however, as also the objects (your cover besides buildings) get damaged and in the end destroyed. It is an awesome feeling when after an intese firefight you look at the map and see how a peaceful English town or a industrial complex got turned into a ruined ghost town. These well modelled mechanics aren't of course just graphical (although they do look great for a game this old), but they play an important role regardless of what tactics you use.\n\nAnother thing is the original story, for Silent Storm isn't just another WW2 game that we have seen so many already. It becomes quite clear at the moment when futuristic laser weapons and power armors enter the stage.\n\nBesides those two, there are these other basic features bringing depth to these games, like managing your team members, equipment, gaining experience, varying challenging tactical situations and such. Silent Storm is a well done game with interesting mechanics and other innovations.\n\nIf I had to address some of the biggest issues, they would propably be stability and voice acting. I did experience a few crashes, but they really weren't anything I couldn't cope with, thanks to autosaving even if I did forget to save often enough. The voice acting on the other hand is something between hilariusly bad and making you want to cry, but anyone who doesn't know what eg. Finnish should sound like is propably spared from the worst parts. All in all, we are not really talking about any game breaking issues.\n\nSilent Storm is one of my favourite squad-based strategy games among Jagged Alliance 2 and X-COM series. If you are into these kind of games, I really do recommend trying Silent Storm.","November 30, 2013","true","18.5"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","47","49","0","0"

Take a special squad composed of sniper, soldier, grenadier, engineer, scout, and medic, and take them on different missions with or without allied help, as they use WW2 weapons to take out enemies, capture vital intelligence, and discover a threat to the world that perhaps, trumps the fight agains the mortal enemies... You can play as either the Axis or the Allies (slightly different missions and character choices). This is turn-based tactical combat done right (not that X-COM is wrong, but this game, with destructible environments (try the grenades, explosives, and rockets) and ragdoll physics gives very visceral and satisfying combat (complete with blood spatters on the walls) that somehow XCOM seem to lack.\n\nThe main complaint is the game turned a bit too sci-fi later and that's very annoying, and the end fight is also extremely annoying.

It feels like an Xcom game but without the need for knowing what to research into and all that; it just puts you straight into the action. The destructive environment mechanics work absolute wonders in the game and, in my opinion, has never been properly done in another tactical strategy game like it. There isn't really enough time in the world for me to talk about why the game is amazing.\n\nHowever amazing it may be, it isn't without faults. Its voice acting is pretty obviously bad (though they did improve it a bit in Silent Storm: Sentinels... which is probably the only good part about that game), the graphics did not age well at all and, one thing I never see mentioned is just how badly Panzerkleins ruin the game. It's a nice idea but it really, really takes away from the tactical aspect of the game; Panzerkleins, in my opinion, aren't fun to use, fight or just anything at all, really. While in the sequel, they do include a stat called "Penetration" to compensate for Panzerkleins, even then, they just seem like extremely cheesy units, especially when used by the player, who is essentially unkillable in one due to the AI not knowing what to do against a Panzerklein. It just really muddled the experience for me in an otherwise exceptional tactical strategy game.\n\nAs for the sequel, I do not recommend it... at all. It does try to be a successor to Silent Storm but the content that carried over feels more lazily thrown together than anything so it just sort of ends up being much more bland than the original with a plotline that really doesn't make even the slightest bit of sense (it picks up after WW2, i.e., the first game, and carries on the plot of a secret organization looking to rule the world, yadda yadda, you've seen that coming a mile away anyway and then manages to become even more generic in the sequel, including that you start the game as some random person who was kidnapped for reasons the game doesn't explain and brought into a supposed secretive special forces who just take you in after your escape because... reasons.) and, worst of all to me, has almost no destructible environments at all! That's what really made the first game unique to me was just how you can be creative with how you engaged the enemy but most of SS:S just takes place in either indestructible corridors (yes, including an obligatory sewer level) or pointless destructible maps, such as a mission that is supposed to be conducted in stealth but is one of the few maps that has destructibility in it. Lastly, they added a currency system that just proves why currency should not be a thing in a tactical strategy game with RPG elements since it ultimately just turns the game into farming "Random Encounters" that aren't at all random.\n\nLong story short, I highly recommend the 1st game to anyone who enjoys xcom-like strategy games but do be wary as eventually it does take a turn for the worse once Panzerkleins are introduced and, unless you really and I mean, REALLY like Silent Storm, don't waste your time on SS:Sentinels.","June 1, 2015","true","150.9"," 41 of 45 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","41","45","2","0"

This (IMHO) is really no issue – just simply pretend everything is happening somewhere in occupied France or something.\n\nA really odd game decision made by the developers was to include (later in the game) such things as laser guns, PanzerKlien (near-impenetrable armor that makes soldiers look like space robots), and modern-day-esque weapons.

It's like they took UFO/X-COM: Enemy Unknown, modernised the UI and GFX, and put it in a World War II setting.  ..The fully-destructable environments are awesome, the number and types of weapons is mind-boggling, and the combat is *so* much fun. Takes a while to work out which are the best weapons, and what characters to pick for your team, but once that is sorted I can play the game exactly the way I want to.\n\nSnipers are possibly too-powerful a player-type. And I find most of the soldier types useless. But a friend loved roaming around with soldiers and full machine-guns and laying waste instead.  I preferred the stealthy approach, spot the enemy with my scouts, and use the snipers to take them out. So the game can suit quite a few play styles. ..and when you find some of the stealth-ier enemies, you might have to adjust your strategy.\n\nBoth Silent Storm, and Silent Storm Sentinels are a huge amount of fun, even after all these years.

I wasn't very good at the it, even the first mission (Allies) but I wanted to be. Seeing it on Steam is another win as now I don't have to track down those CDs everytime I build a new PC.\n\nSilent Storm incorporates squad level, turn based strategy action with RPG elements and memorable characters. As a long time fan of the Jagged Alliance series I was immediately drawn to the similarities between the games and soon found myself lost in the eye of a Silent Storm.\n\nMissions revolve around your Allied or Axis specialist squad investigating a mysterious foundation known only as Thor's Hammer and their background dealings with senior Allied and Axis leadership. Most often than not this leads to combat against both Allied and Axis troops but also Thor's Hammer mercenaries who will almost certainly be better armed with you.\n\nAs a big WWII buff and weaponry fanatic I was lost in number of period weapon choices and the attention to detail with regards to ammunition types. Default demage values are a bit odd but there are numerous mods out there that rectify several small issues that in all honesty, don't effect the game that much.\n\nSentinals is a continuation of the fight against Thor's Hammer immediately after the Second World War and introduces new missions, weapons and equipment.\n\nThe only oddity that I know throws a lot of people off the game is the introduction of walking tanks later in the story line known as Panzerkleins. These weapons are incredibly powerful when used correctly but more often than not can be easily defeated with an excellent marksman or hail storms of machine gun fire.\n\nTLDR: 9/10 would Panzerklein again.\n\nAnyone who really enjoyed these games I strongly suggest checking out Hammer and Sickle.\n","July 20, 2015","true","0.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

S2 blends tactical turn-based strategy with action-packed RPG goodness.\n\nThere is a brief training course tutorial to associate you with gameplay, which is niether too bloated nor too shallow and gets right to the point. There are two story campaigns to choose from, one for Allied (US, UK, Russia) forces and one for Axis (Germany, Japan, Italy) forces. You can choose a premade character or create a custom one, starting the game as a lone wolf who will go on to lead a small squad of elite commandos. Each profession (see below) utilizes its own stats and attributes, which can be upgraded as you progress. As with any good RPG - even an aRPG - there is a rather hefty skill tree available for further fine tuning and customization.\n\nThere are six professions: soldier, sniper, grenadier, scout, engineer, and medic. Each offers its own unique playstyle and you will need to utilize the full range of their given skillsets (as a team) to successfully complete your missions. This makes for some really interesting gameplay and near-endless tactical possibilites. Will you have your sniper pick your enemies off from afar? Or will you send in your scout to silently dispatch any sentries and infilitrate enemy lines? The choice is yours! Your engineer can provide new and intersting paths to success, as their primary strength lies not in direct combat but instead in safely navigating minefields or bypassing locked doors. Perhaps you favor the more direct approach? Not to fear, that's why you always bring a medic - ready and able to patch up even the deadliest of wonds and get your soldiers going again in no time!\n\nBetween missions you are returned to your own personal base of operations where you can manage your squad, access your armory, visit the sickbay, or initiate further missions.","December 20, 2013","true","22.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Before Steam took it, it was impossible to find a copy. The only copies I could find were selling for $80 USD on Amazon. And there's almost a reason for that: the devs made this game well -- maybe too well. 10 years ago I found a demo CD with two missions (one for Allies, one for Axis). I played the CRAP out of those two missions for a year. But even then I wasn't prepared for the full version when I found it on Steam a year ago.\n\nPROSE AND KHANS\n\n+Body wounds with varying effects (from bleeding to lowered accuracy to lowering of Action Points).\n+Ability to aim at different body parts using the NumPad, including going for the headshot.\n+If you're good, you can even shoot the enemy's weapon out of his hands.\n+Several different weapon and equipment classifications with a HUGE variety.\n+Amusing voice acting.\n+Somewhat aged graphics that are still awesome.\n+Ability to destroy the environment. Hear someone above you? Use your machinegun to completely take out the ceiling!!\n+Turn-Based combat, but ability to do Realtime or Turn-Based when out of combat.\n+Awesome character classes (Snipers for those who like popping skulls far away; Scouts for people who like to sneak and backstab; Grenadiers for people who like blowing stuff up; Medics because death sucks; etc.)\n+The game seems very extensive and tremendously replayable.\n+The mission progression isn't all linear.\n\n-Relentless AI (think of X-Com: Terror from the Deep. Now slap yourself if you thought that was hard).\n-The game doesn't ease you into things. It's like being a little kid and your dad gives you "swimming lessons" by picking you up and tossing you into a lake. Silent Storm doesn't have much mercy. Probably because its devs are Russian, and Russians are tough.\n-The tutorial is simply the very first mission, in which you're surrounded without a squad and armed only with a pistol (for Allies, anyway. I don't remember Axis). The third mission you have to wipe out an enemy squad, but knock out the officer without killing him -- but it doesn't tell you how to do that. And it isn't easy to do in the beginning. :-P\n\n-----\n\nAll in all, even though after all this time I still haven't gotten very far in the game despite trying hard, I still have to give it a solid 9.5/10, simply because I don't recall playing a game that was almost too good.

The fully destructible environment is so amazing that, after playing this, you'll wish every game had something like that. You'll never know what turn a battle might take, and on Hard it's quite punishing and brain-taxing(which is what makes it so awesome of course).  Careful planning and tactical assessment of the situation at hand often end up resulting in set pieces and event chains that are just beautiful. The character development is executed well too, and it's really engaging to (in time) build a squad capable of taking on several enemies at a time.\n\nI also want to make it a point to mention that because the voice overs are(for the most part) excellent and lively, you'll end up actually caring about your characters and cheering them on. Didn't expect it from a game like this, so it was a very welcome surprise.\n\nIf your attention span hasn't been completely stunted from the whirlwind of today's portable technology, I HIGHLY recommend getting this one.

This type of game seems to be missing in recent years. Released in the early 2000s; you control a 6-man squad from the top down in a WW2 setting. The weapons are concurrent to the setting, complete with corresponding range, accuracy and power; EXCEPT for the bits of science fiction thrown in...I'll just leave it at that. The environments are descructible with beautiful physics. Depending on the weapon, you can shoot through walls, ceiling, or floor...if you're sure of the target on the other side. If you were a fan of JA, the original XCom, or even SWAT 2 (remember that one?), you can't go wrong with this. It's a classic that might even beat those examples given. I only wish i'd discovered this when it came out. In fact, it made me go out and get a copy of Fallout: Tactics, for my library. This came on Steam through Greenlight; while lots of trash comes out of that program, diamonds like this exists.\n\n\nIf you want more specific detail: There are 6 "classes" to choose from, and each class have their own special skill tree, although I've noticed they pretty much overlap with each other. Each character has a class, attribute (strength, intelligence, dexterity) and "secondary attribute" (throwing, melee, sniping etc.) For example: a Sniper class character is likely going to be good at "Sniping"...but that doesn't mean you can't get your Medic to get up to speed at "Sniping" as well. Classes are as follows: Scout, Sniper, Medic, Grenadier, Soldier and Engineer. There's also a "weapons familiarity" modifier each char has with various weapons...as you can see, there's lots of customization that can go into this game.","May 8","true","7.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

However, the map still randomizes, including buildings and vehicle placement, and the number, type, and armaments of enemies on the map.\n\nBoth Axis and Ally campaigns are both great plays. And while you can loot any weapon you see an enemy using, it depends on which side you picked if your base will resupply you in that ammo type. Otherwise, keep hording that enemy ammo. Great game.

It also has simple, but effective RPG system of skill progression with skill trees for each type of character. Those may seem confusing at first, but game has a high replayability value and each type of character definitely worth of try.

Compared to those games it is MUCH more forgiving, as long as you rescue downed soldiers they don't die.  It's set in WW2, with a almost wolfenstien twist, there's another faction with (era appropriate) power armor suits.\n\nThere's more of a focus of leveling up your characters and having them specialize with certain weapons, there is a pretty good list of weapons to use too.  The buildings and such are destructable, it's a bit like x-com apocalpyse where enough fire and explosions will level pretty much anything.\n\nThe graphics aren't anything home to write about and the voice acting is absolutely terrible, picking a male british guy as your character is going to elict laughs out of anyone at how corny it is.\n\nAnother minor gripe I have with the game is that  it seems there's no weight limit or penalties, meaning you should always have a packed inventory.\n\nOverall, if you like the genre you should enjoy this game, while the new x-com defintely beats it in presentation I found the gameplay to be superior.","June 19, 2014","true","11.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Its an older game that I remember trying as a kid some where but it still is a solid one. I like how you can choose both sides, axis and allies, and hire troops to work with you on the batlefield. I like the base and the mechanics. Very few bugs and crashes.\n\nThe game reminds me of jagged alliance and is a great alternitve however I do wish they would have a shop to where you can buy ammo or requisition it for more of a you earned the money you get to buy what you need feel rather then scavanging and waiting for the armory to populate weapons.\n\nOut side of that, that's all I really have to complain about wiht this game. The random encounters do get reptitious though and while not really a bad thing, it lowers the life of the game just a little bit. Also they should impliment a auto loot after each level or allow you to choose the loot left on the ground but seeing how old this game is, I doubt that will happen unless its modded in by the community.\n\nAs its on sale I am very happy to pay 2.50 for the collection.

To sum up this is a good rock solid squad based strategy game. It has been compared it to Xcom and I would say it does in some respects but more to the original classic not the new remake, and for no other reason than being a hard game to master. However once you have mastered it and built your squad up you will start to enjoy those long drawn out gun battles around one doorway and 20+ enemy soldiers! You will die, the game will annoy you with fields of vision causing hair pulling moments and you will be reloading (many many times), but once you get the hang of your squads abilities it will be an enjoyable play for people who enjoy this type of game, plus it’s not that heavy on the wallet.

Buildings crumble, floors splinter,\nthat fire escape you were stood on fell into the street and killed half of your squad. Battlefield 4? HAH!\n\nSquad injuries are dealt with in a convincing way, with most status ailments treatable only by a medic.\nNone of this namby-pamby 'healing glue-gun' nonsense the new XCOM kiddies love, oh no.\nBandages, painkillers, forceps, morphine; you name it, you'll need it. It's WAR, dammit!\n\nMinor Spoilers(?):\nAbout half to three-quarters of the way through the game, you'll find the oddity that is the PanzerKlein.\nI ADORED them, as they freshened up the gameplay in a way I wasn't expecting, but a lot of people despised them.\nYou can mod them out easily enough, but personally I'd wait and see what you think of them.\n\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n----------------\nIf you're a fan of turn based strategy games and like options for different tactical approaches,\nthen you probably already own Silent Storm and Sentinels, possibly even Hammer and Sickle.\n\nIf you don't usually go for turn based tactics, however, it'd be worth watching some YouTube vids\nof the game in action, as some sections can be slow.

It's shows it's age. It's difficult to work with because of it. Be prepared.\n\nNow the good:\n\nI could write pages. This game redefined squad based combat. While X-Com and Jagged Alliance were busy constructing the squad-based, turn-based combat games, this game took that construct and de-constructed it.\n\nThe combination of a physics based-world combined with a turn-based mechanic, make this one of the most unique squad combat games you'll ever play. I tend to play the sniper, and there's nothing more satisfying that nailing someone in the head from across the playing field and having them fly back through the window behind them.\n\nEnemy blocking the stairway down? No problem. Blow a hole in the floor with a grenade and climb down it. Have a large machine gun? Brick wall between you an your enemy? To a weapon with enough damage potential, that's not a problem.\n\nAnd I don't want to spoil the surprise for those who haven't played it, but the game has much more charm than just the World War II aesthetic. It adds a dash of sci-fi 1940s era pulp fiction to it.\n\nIf you've never played this game and you enjoyed X-Com and Jagged Alliance, you're doing yourself a dis-service by not owning this game.","August 23, 2015","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrecat/recommended/254960/","sabrecat","SabreCat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrecat/","166 products in account","Silent Storm is a quirky title. While its WWII setting and stark palette give the impression of a Serious Game About War, a more pervasive lightheartedness comes to the fore as you play. Goofy voiceover dialogue, strangely named NPCs, and the sudden appearance of science fiction elements like beam weapons and UFOs show that the game doesn't take itself quite as seriously as all that.\n\nUnfortunately for the playability of the thing, that sometimes-serious-but-not-really back and forth also comes through in its systems design. You've got a meticulous turn-based tactical simulation, complete with ammo management, multiple firing modes with different balance of speed vs. accuracy, and wounds that impair soldier performance. Maps are brilliantly realistic, with buildings believably functional down to the bathrooms. But for all that detail, many front-and-center features feel slapdash. The AI is terrible, with enemy soldiers staring blankly into nowhere while they get shot repeatedly over several turns. Skill trees are haphazardly assembled, with tepid pinnacle skills, prerequisites that have nothing to do with their descendants, and bugged skills that straight-up don't do what they say they do. The difficulty curve is all over the place, too--hit the right partially-randomized path in the campaign and you'll find yourself steamrolling everything, or don't, and find yourself desperately exploiting the aforementioned flawed AI just to have any chance at success.\n\nFor all those gripes, though, the game hooked me. I love the tension of turn-based tactical play where enemies could be hiding around any corner. Silent Storm's system of hearing vs. vision, where you can spot ghostly outlines representing something you've heard out of sight--are they really enemies, or noisy civilians? only one way to find out--heightens that mood wonderfully. The thrill of successfully cornering and defeating a difficult foe in a close-quarters hunt is a lovely treat, one that S2's style pulls off consistently. And it's worth saying that more than a few of the game's most glaring issues can be fixed with mods, if you care to pursue that route.\n\nI thus give a thumbs-up with caveats to this decade-old title. If you like XCOM, Jagged Alliance, etc., this is likely to appeal to you. But if you're hoping for something as polished as Enemy Unknown, for example, you might better leave this one aside.","October 8, 2015","true","45.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Basically it has not aged well in terms of hardware support.\n\nI did enjoy a majority of time playing this game, until you reach a point in a game where you have to verse invincible mechs. Panzerkleins. They can't even be destroyed with rocket launchers nor point blank 7.92 mauser rounds from an MG34 to the face. To defeat them easily you require "special" items which need to be found without even playing the main missions known as random encounters. The chance of even finding these items are also incredibly slim. You have to find out on the internet where other people were able to get them.\n\nWithout these items it is an extremely frustrating and waste of time as you litereally stand no chance without them. Another awful problem with the game is waiting for your turns are EXTREMELY long. I mean sometimes when there are a large of enemies in the map the AI will take up to 5 MINUTES taking their turn. Absolutely ridiculous if you consider there could be over 50 turns in a really condensed map. Half the time spent playing this game was WAITING FOR MY TURN!\n\nI was able to half this time though with a speed up animation mod with some googling as others have shared this frustrating problem.

It's no XCom. I wouldn't even have liked this in the 1990's, which I presume is when it came out based on the graphics.\n\nI had a feeling things weren't going to work out when I was in the training mission, standing literally right next to an enemy... just standing there, and I shot at him twice with a rifle and missed both times, then he unloaded his pistol at me and missed all of his shots, too.\n\nIn the the campaign mission I attempted, I was outnumbered 4-1 and dropped in the middle of the woods. I was a sniper, so that is exactly what I'm not built to do. There isn't really any room for planning or strategy. You're just sort of there, and enemies start moving towards you. The board is really small, so you can't maneuver much.\n\nEven in the training, I was outnumbered 4-1 and it looks like the game compensates for a weak AI by just spamming enemies at you.\n\nI had to fight the camera. If you're among trees, you can't strip them away to really see what is going on. It's also easy to accidently start climbing over cover instead of moving around it.\n\nI didn't have a very good time here, is what I'm saying.\n\nI'm guessing this is a good game for nostalgia value if you played and enjoyed it when it was new. I absolutely can't recommend under any other circumstances.","May 25","false","1.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/254960/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Silent Storm started out as an interesting tactical squad game that ended as a real disappointment for me. Initially, the character customization, range of classes, and diversity of weapons and equipment seemed to reveal a great deal of complexity in the game. Which to me looked like a lot of fun, or at least that’s what I thought…\n\nGameplay is pretty similar to the older XCOM or Jagged Alliance games so if you’re familiar with either of those you’ll pick up the basics really quickly. The voice acting is pretty silly and the overall story for why you are involved at all is pretty minimal.\n\nAfter about 5-6 missions I realized that realistically, the only classes worth using were sniper, soldier, and scout (engineer and medic are both broken and useless as of patch 1.2) and anything except for single shot rifles and ‘secret’ weapons was totally useless in combat. The enemy AI has a habit of doing really weird things like crouching in high places and forcing you to start combat, but never leaving to engage you.\n\nIf that wasn’t bad enough, the way the game gets you to the next mission requires that you find special clues in each mission. So if you don’t find the right clues you’ll end up like I did, stuck at a mission where I was totally overwhelmed by a sudden special enemy (Panzerklein) against which _none_ of my weapons worked. After experimenting with different approaches over an hour or two, including stealing some special weapons mid-battle, I managed to defeat the enemies…except the game announced a self-destruct sequence that I had no chance of avoiding or overriding.\n\nI decided to throw in the towel after that. I had already rerolled once before just to try out different classes and weapons and by this point the game was getting really tedious and unrewarding. It’s just not worth the self-punishment when there are better squad strategy games out there.\n","February 9","false","22.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Have your scout tucked away behind a sofa? The enemy will walk right up and shoot her in the head, and your scout will never see it.\n* the enemy can be right in front of you standing out in the open, gunning your troops down and your soldier will have line of sight blocked by a leaf, a stray bumble bee.\n*if, somehow you have ambushed an enemy, and you try to move a troop a single square to clear some baffling blocked line of sight issue, the enemy interrupts the movement and guns down your party.\n*throwing a grenade is suicide. Your grenadier WILL frag the party, repeatedly.\n*simply getting one's troops to move where one wants them to go is an ordeal. You will end up wanting them to die.\n\nThe game is basically unplayable without constant save/loading to mitigate its thoroughly nonsensical disconnect between actions and results. With this in mind, I can't even call it a tactical game, and it takes a bewildering lack of ethics to even try to sell it as such.\n\n-8/10: too flawed to be considered a game, or even a "public alpha", but some of the voice actors are entertaining.","July 7, 2015","false","42.5"," 9 of 29 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","9","29","0","0"

Silent Storm Sentinels. Also, a turn based strategic game feels really refreshing in the times of fast paced action games.\n\nI bought them, because the games Nightwatch and Daywatch, which I really love and played hours of hours as a young gamer, are made by the same Developer and base on the Silent Storm Engine. And S² and S³ reminded me sometimes of those times and make me enjoy it partly.\n\nBut Silent Storm isn't well made and has annoying flaws. I stopped playing it, because I couldn't beat the mission with the invincible Panzerkleins ( this  review  explains the issue well). Thank god, you can give up missions and go to the next ones, but no matter which mission I have chosen after that, the game froze right at the start and then you have to kill the game via terminal.\n\nI moved forward to Silent Storm Sentinels. This one feels better and modern and isn't stretched on 16:9 monitors like the precursor. But here we go again with stupid and game breaking bugs.\nYou will get to a level with invisible enemies (it seems   everyone encounters  this bug). Even with the cheat to show all enemies the mission is still hard and nearly unbeatable if you encounter other bugs:\nMy main hero suffers from "Bleeding" which means I lose 10 HP each round. Usually this isn't a serious problem, if you spend 1 or 2 bandages on him. I wasted 10 and he is still bleeding which means, he will definitely die (=game over). Another in my group got some other Penalties (those are negative effects you get by being wounded to bad e.g Bleeding) from nowhere! He was only slightly wounded and then without being attacked he got HP Reduction and Bleeding!\n\nI'm thinking of giving up this game as well and hope I can spare some others of wasting their time.

Instead they get repetitive combat with a flimsy story linking the battles.  JA had a significant economic aspect that could keep you on a fairly short leash, limiting advancement and forcing you to make do.   Good guns were in short supply, ammo was hard to find and expensive.  In Silent Storm,  your supplier gives you free weapons and ammo while every enemy drops weapons and ammo.  After a few battles you have virtually everything you will ever need for this game.   Character progression is broken and many specialty items are not really worth the time.  Why lockpick when you can simply machine gun open locked doors and crates?  Enemy AI is dumb enough that all battles feel exactly the same.    AI in this game simply means "move into visible range then move out if you have enough action points left".    Many missions degenerate from first contact into "lay all your guys into a line and snipe enemies as they come into your field of fire.   And almost all of them will, one after another like lemmings.   Huge piles of bodies do not deter them.  And conveniently they come one at a time so you never have to worry about being overhwelmed.\n\nIt's a shame because the game system has promise but it's far too simplified to make a memorable game.   Feel like blowing ten bucks?   Go ahead - it's good enough for a few hours distraction.   But I was not hooked enough to bother finishing the game.  At least it didn't cost that much unlike that horrible xcom remake where they stripped out all of the aspects that made the original game fun.","October 26, 2014","false","31.5"," 14 of 77 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","14","77","0","0"

None of the current games can't even touch it's toes.\n\nHere are some aspects of the bame that I can think of (they are not sorted in any way, I just write what I think you should know about this game).\n\nIt has destructible enviroment.\nOption to shoot specific parts of body.\nIf you get shot in hand you may drop weapon or accidentaly pull trigger.\nIf shot in leg there is possibility that you wont be able to walk.\nHead - blindnes or deafnes (in case you actualy survive it).\nThe bullets actualy fly (if you miss then the bullet hit something else in its path).\nIf the weapon is strong enough then you can shoot thrue objects (or people).\nGood stealth system.\nYou can locate enemies by hearing.\nDurability of weapons (they get damaged by using and they can jam).\nYOU CAN DESTROY LOCKED DOORS! - No more you can't go hear because there are locked wooden doors and your rocket launcher can't make even a scratch on them.\nClimbing on objects. - You can make hole in ceiling/floor and them climb up/jump down to get somewhere quicker.\nCreating your own character.\nChoosing who is in your squad.\nGrenades can bounce of of surfaces.\nGreat inventory system.\nSize of items does matter.\nYou can choose your stance (prone, crouch, walk, run).\nIt affects your aiming and how hard it is to shoot you.\n\nOk, this is all I can think of right now. Maybe I forgot some thing but other reviews will probably mention them.\n\nAnd now I will tell you two of my favourite moments from playing this game.\nOne is about the great possibilities and the other about hilarious moments I had with this game.\n\nFirst (possibilities):\nObjective: Get into basement of building (Enemy Base) and get files from their archive.\n\nIts heavyly guarded building with couple dozens of guards, machinegund at front entrance. So it is really heavyly guarded.\nThe guards didn't know about me so I decided I will try stealth aproach. At least at the begining of mission.\nAround the base was fence so I send my guy with wire clipers to make a hole in them.\nMy team got to the back doors.\nMy engineer noticed the door was rigged with explosives.\nHe defused the bomb, but unfortunatly it was locked.\nI forgot to bring lockpicks and I had no time to return for them.\nSend my heavy weapons guy to work as "locksmith".\nHe took his woodcutting axe (the doors were wooden by the way) and started making way for the team.\nTeam gets in.\nIt is some office. Nothing useful to steal so we move on.\nGets into hallway. There are two guards.\nThrow grenade. One is dead the other is wounded. Shoots the other one. Other one is dead.\nStairs are on the other side of hallway, together with bunch of guards.\nArchive is right under me, so I would have to get to the staircase then to the archive and the same way back to my exit.\nBut this is Silent Storm and not some lowlevel game from current age.\nI noticed the grenade I threw made hole in wooden floor.\nI send two members down to get to archive and rest holds the guards.\nTwo down in the archive do what they must and climb back up.\nWhole team use the back door to escape and complete the mission.\n\nSecond (hilarious moment):\nSituation: Alies are in the middle of crossroad and three (maybe four, but it doesn't matter) groups of enemies attack them, each from different side.\n\nOne of the groups, consisted of leader with handgun and another four with SMGs.\nFirst one of the soldiers starts shooting. Long burst, some bullets hit his target, but nothing serious.\n*Leader: Can't you shoot more accuretly? Now I'll show you how it is done.*\n(the parts in ** are what I imagined the leader was thinking)\nLeader starst aiming with his gun and shoots.\nBullet hits hight in his soldiers back.\n*Leader: Well, that didn't go as I planed. Let's try again.*\nShoots again. Again hits his soldier.\n*Leader: What the hell!? This can't be right. I'm the leader, I must be able to shoot properly.*\nShoots again. And again. And again.\nBut all he hits is his own soldier.\n*Leader: ♥♥♥♥ this. I never liked this job anyway.*\nLeader takes out fragmentation grenade and throws it.\nThe granade falls right in front of him, in the middle of his squad, killing (ar at least mortaly wounding) everyone in it.\nAfter that I couldn't do anything but laugh.\nIt was one of the most hilarious moments I experienced in gaming.\n\n11/10 Always will be better then current generation of Turn-Based Games.","March 23, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But to had done so would have meant I wasn't playing the game. A lot of people liken this to x-com or other Turn Based Tactical Squad games. And it does it well, cept for the grenade's ranges,(but there is a mod for that.) The inventory management is fairly well done, and the shooting feels nice. IF the screen shots of the game look a bit dated. It's because the game shows it's age. But while it's graphics could use a sprucing up the game play is still solid. And for me that's what counts.

The mechanics on this game aren't the best and I have my own complaints about hiding (it's a little ridiculous) however that doesn't change the fact that this game requires a lot of strategy that sometimes comes with a lot of frustration.

This is to protect my wallet from the effects of the "glitter and flash" that accompanies a game, particularly on its box (then) but (now) with multiple screenshots on Steam.\n\nOne thing likable about this game -- there is a ton of content here.  For those unfamiliar -- it is a squad-level based game that becomes tactical and turned based whenever you alert the enemy (or when you want it to become turn-based).  Stealth in this game is key, there are very few situations in which you can run in with guns blazing and escape without losing a team member.\n\nAnd you want to keep your team members alive because they gain experience that can be spent on fairly elaborate skill trees.  So pretty quickly I learned (at least the way I play the game) that I needed to keep my doctor at the rear of the group.  I liked having a sniper (for obvious reasons) to cover my flank.  WIth a little patience you can position the sniper extremely well so that at a critical time in the battle his shots have a great impact.  After this, I liked having a scount and an enginer, a light infantryman and a heavy one.  THis is the combination that worked for me.\n\nThe player has the option to be either on the allied side or the axis.  The missions are different depending on which forces you play.  And, because of the nature of this game, no two session will be the same.\n\nIt's a difficult game and it can be frustrating.  You have to be patient.  Those bullets hurt your character, this isn't like a FPS when you can pick up a health pack in every room and boost your health.  I'd say the replay value here is medium, after you have played both sides, but the longer I waited the more I forgot and found it interesting again.\n\nEasily one of my favorite games.  Would recommend to anyone who asked.\n","January 10","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have experienced minor bugs, including 20-second lags inbetween when a soldier stops firing and when you can control their actions again. These aren't gamebreaking, just slightly annoying.\n\nGameplay also fits into how you use the character classes available, from snipers to grenadiers. A branching skill tree system makes you plan out what skills to take now in order to arrive at the skills you'll need later.\n\nPersonally, I didn't feel drawn into the story of Silent Storm. The story mission levels were not interesting to me, but the fact you can set up camp and walk around your virtual camp really sells the context of the game.\n\nThe game really sells you are this character, which you have the option to create or pick from available templates. Granted there isn't much you can change about character actions or motives, but you can create your own stories within Silent Storm just because of this focus on context as well as a randomized mission option.\n\nI had a lot of fun, but there were just enough small details to irk me. The lag can get annoying when it happens more often with more participants in combat. You have to return to base to grab more ammo, and the little dot on the map has to physically move over to the 'base' button. I understand building context as a figure moving on an actual map, but the maps just aren't detailed enough to draw you in to the movement. See Mount & Blade: Warband in which they do movement on a map correctly. When you return to base to resupply, there's little interaction with the people who administrate your operation. You just stare at them while changing figures and items on a screen overlay. It breaks the game world interaction to the player, breaks the sense of realism and importance of your role in the war effort. Like no one cares what you do.\n\nAll things considered, I'm at a strong 7 of 10 for Silent Storm","November 29, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all, I don't care about the story. None. If it's this game, even when you put unicorns and magic and all other non-sense, it still will be a good game. This game has good combat mechanic, strategic level-up system, and graphic that still holds up even for today which outweight the cons, in my opinion.\nIz a gud gaem","January 17","true","34.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I pretty much forgot about this game, until finding it on a $team sale. Glad I re-discovered it!\n\nPros: [Partial list, just too much to include everything]\nElaborate critical-hit system, which plays well into tactical decisions.\nBodies as impromptu cover: May allow LOS, but block weapon targeting (reports as 0%).\nPhysics are fun; some kills are priceless.\nKill enemies by destroying terrain features, like guard-towers or even the usual tanks/barrels.\nMuzzle & trajectory can be altered by aiming at particular crtical zones on target!\nLong weapons extend muzzle beyond an adjacent friendly unit (less friendly fire).\nVariance or "spread" of rounds enroute to target,along with minimum and maximum ranges.\nPathing indicator can be set as visible in settings, good for precise troop movements.\nDynamic destination indicator, which displays AP amount requried.\nDouble click for movement in real-time (in settings); priceless for simutaneous commands.\nPause command is also invaluable for simutaneous commands (even to synchronize attacks).\nEnemies can suffer from morale issues and attempt to retreat, when appropriate.\nPathing and flanking abilities of AI.\nVirtually every object and structure are destructible!\nShooting through ceilings, floors, and walls for kills... pure joy.\nEnemies hiding in bushes? Throw a grenade to defoliate the area... lovely.\nWeather and time of day affect accuracy; night decreases visual range.\nVision and detection can be decreased with foliage and even tall grass.\nEnemy and friendly units are aware of sounds (player has sound and vision icons).\nLimited LOS information, where direct LOS has red icons, while non direct have gray.\nEnemy indicators can be used to aim and even jump to enemy location.\nAP cost & chance to hit is reported dynamically, even upon mouse-over while unit is moving!\nGrenade tosses are designed for units to lob them around corners.\nProne position is invaluable for decreased noise, decerase detection, and increased accuracy.\nRolling terrain, rather than just flat maps... one small hump can be incredibly useful.\nThe manual is comprehensive and really shows the detailed level of game's design.\nA plethora of arms and ammuniton to choose from (only about 4 dozen are worthwhile).\n6 character classes, but 3 are rarely desired (Show stealers: Sniper, Scout, Soldier).\nVarious characters, builds, loadouts, and random spawn locations to increase re-play factor.\nCreative uses of grenades and mines: Chain reactions, path blockers, door removers....\nXP is shared, so appropriate units and tactics may be used, rather than awkward ones.\nCamera can spin 360 degrees, along with limited altitude and angle (KB and mouse).\n\n\nCons:\nNo grid overlay and toggle control, which can make planning precise movements awkward.\nNo toggle control for tree canopy, only in settings; this is not good for repeated quick looks.\nNo night vision appropriate to period, not even flares.\nNo equipment to break LOS or decrease accuracyl, like smoke grenades.\nNo range finder. Workaround: Save, shoot, check range in console (if activated), reload save.\nNo control for units to check LOS and cover on map.\nNo way to determine value of a unit's cover.\nNo overwatch feature for snipers, or supression fire commands for others.\nNo fire based weapons, or flammable environments.\nTech trees are generally too costly, with some pertinent skills separated.\nNo information regarding crtical results (activate console and check log if desired).\nNo AoE coverage indicator.\nNo way to speed up time, pass/eliminate ally turn, or know when all enemies are dead.\nAi is basic, either camp or assault. Bad news? Assaults die one by one in corner ambush.\nNo meter for magazine counts (unlike JA2), pop-up only, so set timer to zero in settings.\nSupplies and ammuniton cannot be combined/consolidated.\nNo control over skill upgrades for reserve units at base.\nNo battle-scape inventory screen like JA2, which makes looting awkward.\nMinor bugs, such as KB will issue mass commands, but not all mouse buttons do so.\nSome KB commands omitted, like the sniper scope's extra aim commands (mouse only).\n\nNote:\nNo strategic layer, other than adjusting loadouts and deciding on mission order.\nSci-Fi elements would be less bothersome to some players if it could be turned off.\nBalancing is shot with sci-fi equipment, but a player could choose not to use them.\nManual training is tedious, units become overpowered, but a player could ignore training.\nFacing changes cost full AP every time character sees an enemy, so get "Look for Free" skill.\nLoot is not destroyed in AoE attacks. Which seems odd, but this design is so convenient.\n\n\nOne of my favorites, so if you like one, you'll probably like the other ones too:\nX-COM: UFO Defense and Terror From the Deep\nJagged Alliance 2\nWarhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate\nClose Combat, CC: A Bridge Too Far, CC: The Russian Front (larger than squad & no RPG)\nValkyria Chronicles\nX-Com: Enemy Unknown, but only with the Enemy Within expansion\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe pathing issues, especially with Panzerklein, are attrocious on the last couple maps.\nThe $team version cannot be completed without an unofficial patch (see link).\nBe prepared for some corny dialogue, it is part of the charm.\n\nUnofficial Patch Link:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/254960/discussions/0/792924952303375867/","May 13","true","328.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
