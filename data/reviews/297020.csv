You are a farmer with a shotgun in your hand and must protect your barn from incoming waves of zombi cows. In each wave another type of obscure zombi creature joins the hordes. There are a bunch of cliches dealing of a typical redneck life and leading towards the grand finale: Fight against a Nazi UFO.\n\nThe gameplay is quite challing, yes, but it turns out in higher levels even more repetitive and boring. Although there is a mass of funny elements to discover, nothing remains as necessary remindable. Like a chopper support, nukes or a barn sentry. Wow how interesting.\nThe biggest lack are the uncomfortable controls like reloading each shell for one key hit or to aim precisely in the isometric playfield. Also some bugs are still included in this game.\n\nSo I can just recommend it to players of brute and unstrategical shooters.","November 3, 2014","true","9.4"," 54 of 75 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","54","75","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/recommended/297020/","phantom2450","phantom2450","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phantom2450/","564 products in account","The Culling of the Cows is an absurdist gag game that, while it may provide you with all the rampant bovine slaughter you could ever dream of, is as of now not at all worth the price paid for it.\n\nAs a lone farmer stranded in rural 'Murica, you must overcome the armies of mutant cows, deranged hippies and obese gothic women that a Nazi UFO sends your way. By reading the previous sentence, it should be quite clear that this game is not taking itself too seriously. However, there is a clear difference between random humor with a purpose and random just for random's sake; this game strictly falls into the latter. Culling is basing its appeal entirely on the fact that the player gets to shoot cows...a lot. All of the other plot points mentioned in the beginning of this paragraph receive no explanation besides a single introduction screen per plot point, and are otherwise meant to serve as comedic masks for generic enemy types.\n\nThe game's fundamentals are disappointingly lacking. Gameplay is divided into levels that contain encounters in either standard "Waves" format, a variation of Waves that is only one large wave, or a last-stand turret mode called "Onslaught". The majority of the game's levels occur in the Waves format, with varying numbers and types of enemies and waves for each level. This variety does little to put off the repetition that sets in after a few rounds of slaughtering the same few animals and zombies over and over. The Waves format does allow for some character customization in weapon upgrades, but after a certain amount of experimentation I discovered an order of upgrades that, with moderate skill, could win all the levels. Some incentive in the level design to switch up gameplay styles would have gone a long way. The other gameplay mode, Onslaught, produces some of the most frustrating levels in the game due to sketchy hit detection, though it often provides a refreshing and enjoyable break from the Waves levels as well.\n\nVarious other parts of the game fail to stand out. The soundtrack isn't memorable and the art style has this feel to it that so many indie games seem to have, which at worst could be descibed as "one step above MS Paint". Largely, the game isn't bad-looking; it just has a habit of piling hundreds of multicolored cow corpses on the screen at once, which grates on the senses and leaves a lasting impact after seeing it over and over. Some parts of the game seem to be implemented strangely: controller support, despite being labelled as both "partial" and "full", relegates movement solely to the D-Pad, which is an odd choice. Culling's achievements are also strange: there are only five, four can be attained by the third level (two are bugged to only work with the keyboard) and the fifth is for beating the game. More achievements could help boost replayability, a facet which is important in this game considering it can be finished in just over three hours. Though most levels contain medals to earn for winning under certain conditions, the game doesn't offer rewards for earning the medals, which makes them largely meaningless. Perhaps tying some customization unlocks to medals would solve this issue?\n\nThough this game faces significant issues, I must give praise to the spirit of the developers. They've implemented some features like an internal cheat console, the achievements and trading cards by popular demand. Additionally, their desire to not make this game be simply a joke shows throughout the game. The farmer's voiceover has some genuinely unique and funny lines interspersed throughout the game, which work because the lines are not beaten to death in every level. As long as the developers stand by the good-hearted cow hate that is the root of this game, there's hope that this could turn into an indie cult classic in the future.\n\nThis game has set off on a mission: to spread the need to shoot cows whenever, wherever. It tries to achieve its goals through a game that has significant flaws. Should the developers focus on the problems that plague the core elements of the game, then this title will definitely deserve a second look. As of now, however, there is no way anyone would feel satisfied paying full price for this game. Save up for a sale, perhaps gift this to a friend in jest. Just...beware the cows. The Culling of the Cows gets a D.","December 26, 2014","false","3.2"," 53 of 78 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","53","78","7","1"

I had a lot of fun with it and would give it a thumbs up, if for nothing else then it is good for a laugh when you get gored by a zombie cow.","May 28, 2015","true","4.0"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","19","31","2","0"

There are 2 "gamemodes" you either control a guy running up-down and left-right while shooting, upgrading your weapon, or bring in assist abilities, or its a simple turret shooter. Number of maps: 1. Yes, only 1 map for a zombie defense game. The only difference between the levels are the assist abilities which. There are around 10 types of enemies, most of them basicly the same: cow, a bit faster cow, a bit tougher cow, ect. Controls are clunky. In the main gamemode you can't aim, you have to move your character in the line where you want to shoot. The hitbox are buggy as hell, bullets often go through the target without damaging them. Finishing the game takes around 2 hours, highly repetitive and there is no co-op. The game also highly overpriced (there are much better flash games in this genre for free). If you'd like to buy a zombie defense game which is cheaper, simple but has co-op and runs on a microwave go with the Yet Another Zombie Defense. It's only 2€ and essentially has the same, but cheaper and has coop (also frequently updated).\n\nTL;DR:\nJust don't buy this.\nIt's boring, has zero content, repetitive.","January 20","false","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/297020/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","The Culling of the Cows stands between Plants Versus Zombies (Or old farmer vs zombie cows -- and possibly nazi aliens) and a sidescrolling shooter.\nThis is made by Decaying Logic, the same developers that brought us Radical Roach, which I reviewed a while ago (and was not impressed at all).\n\nWhile I believe this is definitely an improvement over Radical Roach, many of the same flaws and design choices are present in this game, just to a lesser extent.\n\n\nAs usual, I'll start with presentation.\nNot unlike their previous game, the Artstyle is probably one of the defining points. While it feels like flash, the animations are pretty good, although a bit too limited (there is only one animation for each enemy, it seems, as well as the carcass sprite, which makes the field end up looking a bit too monotonous).\nThe interface templates don't really seem to fit the theme, but it's not too bad. Other visuals effects are also subpar, against the cartoony style they were mostly going for.\nThere are a few different areas that slightly change the look of the map, but don't be fooled, as the map doesn't change at all, except for the visuals.\nOne problem I've had with it, is that the dead bodies cover up the screen by the end of the levels, to the point that you can't see new enemies arrive very clearly. That should definitely be changed. Other than that, it's fine.\n\nThe Music is also very similar to Radical Roach. It's not awful, and it has some good moments, but it's very repetitive, and doesn't loop very well, which is unfortunate. It's upbeat, and a mixture between some rock/metal and electronic music which goes for the more arcade vibe than atmosphere. There are some old sci-fi melodies though, which is a nice addition.\nOne improvement that I want to stress is that the music no longer restarts whenever you fail a level! It's a weird aspect to consider, but I think it's very important. It didn't happen in RR, and it was really annoying to listen the song start over and over again. Now, it doesn't happen, and it's a subtle but important improvement, in my opinion!\n\n\n\nSo, let's talk about the Mechanics.\nAs I said, it's has a bit of PvZ in it. Essentially, you have a large lane to defend agains the zombies. There are no specific lanes as in PvZ, you can freely walk around, and so can the enemies. You have a shotgun, different ammo types, upgrades, and assists. You'll also, periodically, be able to call for a crate with a random power-up.\nYour job is to stop zombies from entering the barn, and also avoid being killed by them (if they hit you). Pretty straightforward.\n\nYou have a world map with the levels spread around (unlocking more as you go) with a couple of spreading paths, somewhat like One Finger Death Punch, only much smaller. These levels include a few different modes. There's Waves, in which, well, you fight waves of enemies, and there's a limit number of zombies that can enter the barn; Kill 'Em All, in which there's only one long wave and you can't let any zombie pass; Onslaught, in which\nsome zombies can go through, but you have a machine gun (or a bazooka in one level) and shoot from the top of the barn, not worrying about dodging. And then, there's a couple of Boss levels.\nThe first two play essentially the same, with the exception that you can a few seconds to "rest" between waves. It had very, very little to the overall experience, but hey.\n\nThere's a significant number of different enemies, although a bunch of them are just faster or healthier versions of the previous. Still, it keeps the game interesting when starting out, since you need to change up your play a bit. Later on, new enemies stop coming, and every level becomes waay too similar (which is a feat in a 3 hour game).\nThere are also 3 badges to unlock in most levels -- these make the game harder, but they're barely there to reward you. There are some not to let any zombies pass, or not to miss any shot, but the others are simply about not upgrading your weapon, not using assists, etc. These do NOT make the game more fun at all. On the contrary, you're just shooting yourselves on the foot by limiting variety. It would certainly add challenge, but it's not very interesting challenge, in my opinion. But they're all optional, so it's fine. If you're into that, it exists. Overall, I'd say rethink your design on that.\n\nWeapon upgrades are only on a level to level basis, and not persistent. You can increase the number of bullets, the number of bullets you reload at a time, add a laser to increase accuracy, or do something else that I'm not entirely sure of. I assumed it's reload speed.\nRegarding ammo, you have Spread Shot, Explosive Shot, and Penetrating Shot. These do not stack, much to my disappointment. It could be really fun to have Spread Explosive Shots and just explode everything! But no... there are no synergies. If you purchase both, they'll alternate between them, from what I could tell.\nAssists go from a chainsaw in the barn entrance to an AirStrike, or an Auto Machine Gun, for a few seconds. There are more to these, and they have a cooldown associated. I didn't use any of them, most of the time, because they weren't needed, nor particularly fun to use. You just press the button, and have the game made easier... But it's good that it's there, there's certainly room for different playstyles! Maybe you'd prefer not to upgrade your weapon as much, and focus on "traps", that's totally fine!\n\nAmmo and Upgrades in-game cost money. And here's the big issue I have with it: You start each level with a certain amount. Then, by calling the random power-up, there's a chance you'll get a bit more, but it's generally not significant. So, you'll mostly upgrade your weapon at the start of the level, and then play with that. It's not dynamic at all, as every level played out pretty much the same to me. Sure, I could have forced myself to use different "loadouts", but the one I had worked for me, and the enemies didn't really require different tactics to be beaten. It would have been better to gain money over time, having waves get progressively more difficult, scaling with the upgrades you were able to buy!\nPacing is pretty much unexistant, unfortunately.\n\nWell, maybe I'm being a bit too negative. The fact of the matter is that the game didn't do anything interesting to me. However, it was still somewhat fun for a bit. The kind of mindless fun you need to just pass time. You'll fight dozens of enemies per level, making each field become just a bunch of bloody cows on the ground. It's dumb, but it's somewhat enjoyable. Just not very interesting... Take One Finger Death Punch, for instance. That game is totally mindless fun! But it's far more interesting. First, it's very rhythmical, and you need to be in the "zone" to identify which enemies require which clicks to perfectly complete a level. And there are many different weapon that actually *feel* different, and make you look like a badass, cutting everyone up. I realize that these are two different games, but they both go for a similar feeling, that's why I'm bringing it up.\n\nOne aspect I enjoyed quite a lot was the last Boss. That was a pretty fun fight. Even though it had no upgrades or anything, the 3 phases complemented each other pretty well, and while challenging, it didn't feel frustrating to me. It should have had a few more boss fights, would definitely make the game more interesting.\n\nThat's enough rambling. For the price, I can't recommend it at all. But if this seems appealing to you, give it a shot if the price drops. While I've beaten it in 3 hours, you can get a bit more out of it, if you go for the badges. And the developers seem to update the game from time to time, so it may get better.\nOverall, not awful, but not particularly good either.","November 16, 2014","false","2.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I saw an advert for a free copy of "Culling of the Cows," so I figured I would give it a try. And I am very glad that I did.\n\nPart 1:  Storyline and Gameplay In COTC, you are a farmer who encounters everything from zombie cows to Nazi UFOs on his farm. It is your job to shoot the oncoming cattle and other enemies before they can enter your barn. There is a plethora of upgrades for your weapons, barn, and even "God Abilities." It could be considered a sidescroller (but with no scrolling), but this game will appeal to both arcade gamers and retro shoot-em-up gamers alike.\n\nAs for the length of the game, COTC has an adequate number of "missions" which provide for plenty of hours of fun gameplay. And if you ever, for some odd reason, get bored of destroying zombie cows with a barn-mounted machine gun, there are cheat codes to get you to the final mission and other such objectives.\n\nPart 2: Graphics?  There isn't too much to say about the graphics here. The game could have done well as a pixel graphic game, but I believe that the developers made the right decision sticking with non-pixelated cows. You get an arcade feel from the graphics while still being able to make out sharp lines and appropriate detail.\n\nPart 3: Is it fun?  Of course it's fun! This game is unlike any other arcade-zombie-tower defense game you've played before! Imagine Farming Simulator, but instead of growing crops, you shoot cows, and instead of upgrading your equipment, you upgrade your explosive-bullet extended mag infinite ammo no reload shotgun! This is a game that you can definitely lose track of time while playing and get caught up in the hilarity and epicness of the goals.\n\nValue As I said before, I got this game as part of a special promotion, however, I would gladly have bought this game. It's well worth the money (At time of writing: $1.94, 85% off)! Let's put it this way - you can get a pack of gum or two which might last just a few days, or you can get COTC and have dozens of fun hours of gameplay! The only thing is that I feel like $12.99 is a little bit much to ask for regular price, I would wait for it to go on sale. Definitely a game that you can casually pick up right where you left off, even if it's been a week or two. Would recommend.\n\nAspect        Rating                Gameplay        9                Graphics        8                Enjoyability        10                Value        7\nFinal Points on the Game This game is a definite buy, whether it's 2 bucks or 10. You'll have a great time playing it, and best of all, it has zombies with  no early access ! What's not to love about that!\n\nBe sure to check out any of my other reviews on my profile, and please upvote if this helped you, I hope it did!

The game is essentially a defence title, with an assortment of monsters rushing into the barn, and as the farmer it is your job to prevent the said monstrosities from getting in. If you fail a certain number of times, the stage is over and you have to restart again.\n\nTo mix up the formula some monsters act a little different to one another, along with varying amounts of hit points. To aid the chaotic game play, players can also summon a few tactical skills on the field, along with some limited and temporary upgrades to the shotgun.\n\nRepeat the same formula with increasing difficulties for dozens of stages and you get the general idea of how this goes. Every rarely you’ll get to fight a boss or two, but they’re way too simple to pose a challenge.\n\nThe art style is hand drawn and mostly consistent, like the game play that may not strike everyone’s fancy either, but it sat well enough for me. The biggest problem I had with the game was that it lacked a sense of progression, you’ll upgrade your weapon level after level, but they never stick. There is also little point to divert from the main path and complete every stage, since there is nothing to unlock or to accomplish.\n\nFor the low price though, I would recommend it for a decent distraction.","March 6","true","7.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You play as a farmer defending his barn from ever increasing waves of zombies and zombie cows. There is a large variety of what enemies you face as well as various weapons and defense assists that keep the gameplay feeling fresh.\n\nOne positive addition to the game is the special achievements, which adds to the ways you can enjoy the game.  The interface is simplistic, as is the gameplay. That being said, it is high paced with a feeling of momentum, and a great threat level. If you find it too easy, there are achievements that add a new layer. It can be repetitive, and I would have liked to see a lot more maps.  The weight of your weapon has impact, and it's satisfying to see your enemies explode.\n\nThis game is enjoyable, but has a feeling of 'the same'.  It is a casual game, but it does what it needs to do very well.  I never felt like my time was wasted, or that I wasn't being respected by the game.  If this game looks enjoyable to you, I can easily recommend it.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\n\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","March 23, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This is just like one of those browser games that you can find on Newgrounds or Kongregate that you can play for an hour or two at a time. Give it a try if you like that sort of thing, it’s a small download size.\n\nYou play an old dude with a shotgun defending your farm against (zombie?) cows charging at you on a small 3D field.  You can move up down and side to side but the screen doesn’t scroll. The zombie cows of various speeds and toughness will run from right to left toward you and you need to blast them before they get into the barn you’re guarding on the left side of the screen. To help you on your task, you can purchase gun upgrades and different types of ammo (buckshot, exploding, etc.) in each level, or use “assists” such as sentry guns or firewalls that are free but on cooldown timers.\n\nPros:\n+Simple gameplay that can occupy you maybe 30 minutes at a time when you have nothing better to do. Each level is maybe 5-10 minutes long and not too hard once you get the hang of it.\n+There are some humor elements to the game so even though each level is mostly the same, you can get a couple laughs.\n\nCons:\n-There are maybe 50 levels of the same gameplay and you may get bored pretty quick.\n\nOverall the game is fun for a short time and if you’re like me, you’ll probably be done with it after getting the easy Steam achievements. Play it and forget it.\n","December 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Armed only with a shotgun, you must defend your barn from these zombies.\n\nEven though you have a single weapon through most of the game (the aforementioned shotgun), there's two extra weapons that appear in specific levels: a machine gun, and a rocket launcher. Even then, the shotgun can use four different types of ammo, and there's several upgrades for it, that make it even better at killing stuff. You can also get supply drops (like extra cash for upgrading your weapon, invincibility, etc), and use different abilities to kill the zombies, like providing your barn with a machine gun, or a saw, sending a nuke, etc.\n\nEven though the idea of shooting cows might sound dull at first, there's a good variety of enemies: different types of cows (even cows strapped with TNT, helpful for blowing up nearby cows!), and, as already mentioned, a few human enemies. There's also crows falling from the sky.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, all the levels consist of you defending your barn against waves of enemies (or against a single, large wave), with a few changes: in most of the levels, you're in front of your barn, and the cows can kill you, while in a few "Onslaught" levels, you shoot the cows from the safety of your barn's second floor.\n\nNice game, once you get the hang of it.

That's not saying much though. DO NOT. I repeat DO NOT buy this at any price above 50 cent. You'll find free flash games better than this. The reason you would pay anything above zero is because at the very least it drop trading cards and there is a mild amusement factor thrown in.\n\nPros:\n-Theme. Okay, I like the zombie cows and old farmer as the protagonist.\n\nCons:\n-Hit box. About the worst thing in the game. It is so inconsistent. You can be hitting cows in the head at one moment and in the next watch bullets zip through like ghosts. This is especially evident when old farmer shooting from the barn window as zombie cows dance around. There's been many times when I get hit by a cow just right after a shot just whiz past. Oh yeah, of course it's a one hit kill.\n-Reload speed. You are given a reload button but cannot reload as fast as your thumb pressing on the dang thing. If that's by design it's a really poor choice for a shooter that depends on it. As level progress cows come up faster & faster and in greater numbers. When you have to manage between shooting, reload, inventory purchase, and support from above and you come up blank do to reload response isn't there, it's really frustrating. (FYI, I'm using a 360 controller)\n-Spawning at the start of level. This is old school cheap method of making a game longer than it really is.\n-Repetition. I have to mention this even though it is expected of this type of game. It's the very least of concern (see above).\n\nShooters require tight controls and mechanics which this game does not have, making it not only challenging but frustrating. I simply cannot recommend it. Only get this is it's a bundle filler or given free.\n\n\n","March 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Or so intensely frustrating? At it's core this game is a shooting gallery, but instead of shooting smiling yellow ducks, you're faced with angry rampaging zomby-cows. It's easy to get the hang of but as the difficulty starts to ramp up, so do the games flaws. Each level adds a new and tougher type of cow, as well as a new "Divine Intervention" ability.\nIt is beyond annoying to reach the end of the level only to be gored by a green bull streaking across the screen. This is largely due to the poor movement controls, which are painfully unresponsive and make aiming tough.\nIt is undeniably satisfying to litter the farmyard with cow corpses, but it's simply not worth a whole $12 (I got it from a giveaway some time ago, so I really shouldn't complain)\nI would recommend this game only if you can find it under $2","October 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'd say this is a game worth playing.\n\nMany things were enjoyable such as the following:\n\nPositives:\n♦ Almost Each level is unique\n♦ Every level you beat unlocks new enemies\n♦ Every level you beat unlocks new support items\n♦ Unique way to upgrade weapons\n♦ Breaks between waves\n♦ Random Events in the form of a deployable Crate\n♦ Hilarious story and voice overs\n♦ Achievements for playing the game basically\n\nNow don't get me wrong there are many positives, but still not every game is perfect and this one has the following negative points:\n\nNegatives:\n♦ Accuracy of the shots are slightly off\n♦ Cheats which can be used to get the achievements\n♦ Waves per level are way too long\n♦ Can get repetitive quite quickly\n♦ Little overpriced as I got mine in a bundle and Indiegala gave it away free\n\nImprovements:\n♦ Fix the Accuracy\n♦ Make Cheats only usable once finished the game\n♦ Lower Waves per round (So it feels less repetitive)\n\nOverall, in my opinion, the game is hillarious, fun and worth playing despite the accuracy of shots being slightly off and the slight repetitiveness. Though if you don't use cheats, enjoy easy to get achievements and love a laugh whilst playing a video game, then I highly recommend this for you.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 3.5/5!\n\nPS: If you try and get all the stars for every level in the game, you'll be there for a while making this game have very godo replay value!","November 8, 2014","true","3.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The gameplay itself is repetative, with level after level of Cow Culling as one would expect from the title. Basics of the game include upgrading your weapon so as to blast the oncoming waves of cows, hippies and fat goth chicks. You would think that the gun upgrades would keep the game fresh for a little longer, but every level the upgrades are reset, and thus you just find yourself picking your favourite upgrades at the start of each level time and time again.\nHonestly this game is not worth the money they are asking. I got it with a 75% discount coupon, and even then I am wondering whether what I have recieved is worth it. If you purchase this game, get it for the cards (which is why I orginaly purchased it), and not for the gameplay, but it is quite a steap price merely for cards.","July 24, 2014","false","4.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

But I think of it still as quite a humorous game and it adds up to how much I like it. The upgrades aren't really original same as abilities but still has some potential... if the devs decide to carry the game on.\n\nPros\n\n- Pretty stupid, the story and the overall design.\n- Horribly voice acted, which I think is a good thing.\n- It's fun, as a 5 minute timewaster and nothing more. Expect this to be played for at most 3 hours and then left in your steam library and with the cobwebs growing...\n\nCons\n\n- Fairly limited gameplay, gets repetitive.\n- Not completely original, the upgrades, the style of side scrolling defense and the overall feel, makes me wish this was free as a flash game.\n- Not entirely worth $13 USD, but if you have some money lying around when this is on sale. $3.79 (75% off) is quite the interesting deal.","January 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Even though you are clearly firing a spread of pellets from your shotgun, you have to be very careful that you're not too high or too low to hit the stampeding cow (all of which KILL YOU IN ONE HIT). Again, I'm used to this kind of system from old arcade games, but it feels unfair in this game, especially given the way that cows will run in fast at a diagonal. There's actually a laser sight upgrade for your shotgun, but it doesn't help much.\n\nYour shotgun has a high ammo capacity (especially if you upgrade it) but you have to reload each shell manually by pressing R. (This is more annoying than it sounds).\n\nYou have sentry guns and such that you can activate to kill some cows for you, but you have to activate most of them at just the right time, which is not really practical with the standard mouse+keyboard controls.\n\n...What's that you say? You'll just use a controller with a nice, convenient button for each trap? Nope, sorry, but controller support is AWFUL. You can only move around with the directional pad (the sticks do nothing!), and there are no dedicated buttons for the traps and upgrades. (The game actually tells you "Controllers are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!" when you select it in the options menu. That's the quite the excuse for terrible support...)\n\nAlso, the levels end up covered in so many cow corpses that it becomes difficult to tell which still need shooting (some of the basic enemies stop moving for a second or two, which ends up faking you out) and of course having to climb over dozens of their fallen cow-sisters doesn't slow them down at all.","May 28, 2015","false","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The mechanics basically boil down to a unidirectional horde-mode shooter with Zero enemy intelligence and Zero chance for player creativity.  The "Assists" are so overpowered such that it would be foolish not to use them at each and every chance, and the "Upgrades" are so unbalanced that it would be foolish to not buy the scattershot at the soonest possible instance.  Not to mention the pre-school level shooting mechanics.  For a "shooter", you might expect a fair modicum of skill necessary, but nope, you shoot in a straight line, can't aim, can't angle your shot, just from left to right in a 180 Degree line rendering the whole use of the mouse completely unneccessary other than for the sole purpose of having the "fire" button.\n\nThis would've been fine as a browser game, however, somehow it made its way to steam with an outrageous $13 price tag.

That's it.\n\n\nThe Culling of the Cows it's built around a couple simple notions: shooting things up is fun, and nobody wants to be eaten by undead cows. The game is interesting for a while, but that fades away sooner than later, thus the thumbs down. Keep in mind that the price you pay for it is a big factor: if you get it cheap, the relation cost-value can make the purchase worthy.\n\nCredit is due to the developers for trying hard to keep this game interesting for its duration, adding elements and in-game mechanics aimed at keep things interesting, but it wasn't enough to do the trick. Again, if you are not a thirty-year older that has seen a fair share of this kind of games, your opinion may be different.","July 16, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

You can find it here: http://www.vg247.com/2014/11/09/free-250000-steam-keys-giveaway\n==============================\n\nCulling of the Cows is a 2D sidescrolling Tower of Defense shooter where your job is to fight against zombie cows, bear/badger hybrid thingies and a Nazi UFO.\n\nOther than the occasional assist and being able to buy upgrades that you can earn by killing the zombie animal apocalypse, that's pretty much all you need to know.\n\nThe game is mildly enjoyable for a bit, and then quickly gets repetitive afterwards.\n\nThere are better tower defense games out there that definitely grab your attention better, and you can play a few out there that are free than buying this game (assuming you don't plan to take advantage of the link above or the link expired by the time you've read this review).\n\nBut that doesn't mean this game doesn't hold its own merit either.\n\nCulling of the Cows can definitely be fun for a good portion of tower defense fans, and can probably get a kick out of playing your stereotypical redneck that lost his mind, possibly due to getting probed or losing his mind by wearing foil in the sun to communicate with the "Greenies."\n\nThe only thing that stops me from recommending it to people is its price tag. At the time of this post, it's $12.99. I don't know about you, but holy ♥♥♥♥ that's too much for a game like this.\n\nI'm not sure how long the giveaway will last, but you're better off getting this for free right now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/297020/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: Simple fast-paced, albeit short, wave defender. I'd advice to get it on discount.\n\nIn Culling of the Cows you slaughter hundreds of cows, a couple of badgers and also some hipsters. All of them are zombies though. There's a reason for that revealed at the end but it's totally ridiculous like the whole idea itself. For whatever reason you don't want the monsters in your barn. You got to go through the farm utterly destroying all the undead bovine life forms with your trusty shotgun and (!) the muda♥♥♥♥ing airforces.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, this is rather fun and enjoyable. Voice acting is horrible though but for that matter the game lasts only couple of hours even if you try to ace everything.\n\nEvery level you begin with a shotgun shooting slugs. God promises to sell you better weapons and help along the way because he's a such good guy. He also sends you money to pay for all the stuff. Then you proceed to kill all the enemies rampaging towards you. You got to reload manually so proceed with care and precision. This can be annoying as the hitboxes are quite small. This also makes the spread-out ammo upgrade super useful.\n\nFrankly, you can only shoot forward and you're slow at walking, so sometimes you can't prevent a cow from passing or indeed killing you. This is where assists come in: you can call up airforces, bombings, sentry guns, fire walls, all kinds of overpowered defenses that will mostly take care of your job for you, with brief cooldowns in between. Still it often takes another try to ace any level, especially since that means you can't buy some overpowered weapons.\n\nIt wouldn't stay fresh for long but fortunately it's also quite short, the 40 levels taking only some 2-3 hours to ace. However, the short length is also a curse: it's not really worth the full price. However, at a decent discount or in a bundle, go for it.","January 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the hit collider isn't making it any easier. Especialy in the last level, you shoot at a cow in front of you but the bullet doesn't hit the cow... then the cow kills you and you start the whole level again, the last boss needs 20 bullets to die but you have to start all over just cause you failed to hit the cow in the invisible small collider!!\n- Repetitive.\n- No permanent upgrades to buy??!\n- Doesn't explain what upgrades do... you have to guess\n\nOverall: 6/10.

It has a large map, achievements and cards. Those usually come as a positive. I got the game for free so I'm pretty satisfied. All around it's quite a solid game, however I entirely disagree with the price tag as it should be lower.\n\n>I'd give it a 7.5/10\n>Pros: Solid gameplay, many levels, cards and easy achievements, some sort of minigame levels so it's not the usual defense type, hand drawn(?) graphics, gets challenging.\n>Cons: Gets a bit boring, reset after death so you start again at wave 1 of the level you're doing, price tag.\n\nProTip: When starting a level instantly buy your upgrades and try to get a 3$ bonus from the Care Package. Try to go with 1 level in your Z, 2 in your X, 1 in your C and finally get buckshots. Keep restarting until you get a +3$ and you're on for an easy game. Try focusing your earning on the X and Z first.","November 9, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a funny little gimmic which is basically a nazi ufo turns the cows into zombies. So it's not that serious.\n\nGraphics:  The art style is okay, nothing special. Looks like a flash game.\n\nSound:  The enemies have good sounds (except that annoying crow) just like the weapons. I think the voice over work is rly cheesy sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. The music is repetitive as hell you won't stand it longer than like 2,3 levels. The problem is basically there is a 30 sec loop and nothing else except for the menu music.\n\nGameplay:  You have to shoot down cows and other enemies in front of you. There are many types of enemies like super fast cow,\ntank cow, a crazy cow that comes at you in a crisscross and many more. So the enemy variety is good. But the algorithm is easy: Is this guy ahead of the others? -> shoot OR is this guy faster than the others? -> shoot that first.\nThere are game modes like simple turret sectons, boss fights, 1 big wave, normal wave. You can upgrade your shotgun in the previous 2. There are ammo types like birdshot, buckshot, slug... each is different but I think the buckshot is your bread and butter because it shoots in a cone. And the awkward hit detection (or the sense of position I'm not sure) is really annoying and it puts you out of the mood. You can also upgrade your ammo capacity, reload speed, fire rate, and you can attach a laser pointer on your shotgun. These upgrades can be obtained by your starter and drop money. You can also call for a care packege which contains money or powerups like unlimited ammo, unlimited health, slomo... for a limited time. But I walked through them almost every time because of the awkward sense of position.\nYou can also call aids like air strike, napalm barrels, nuke and other over the top stuff.\nThe game gets really repetitive after 30-60 minutes. There is only one level type (The Farm) but it indicates like there will be other themes but no... just the farm.\n\nReplayability:  There are achievements per stage but you mustn't use the upgrade system or the aid system to earn these which defeats the only good thing in the game.\n\nOverall:   Pros:\nSetting\nNice upgrade system and air support bonuses\nGore\nTrading Cards\nCasual fun time for a few hours  Cons:\nOnly 1 weapon (except for the turret segments)\nAnnoying hit detection and sense of position\nMusic is bad and repetitive\nLack of variety in levels\nQuestionable game design\nThe Extras menu leads you to nowhere...\nHIgh price!\nVerdict:  It's not worth 11 euros for sure. If you want some mindless fun for a few hours then buy it on a sale. I had some fun but I had many many frustrated moments as well. It's an average game at best. Won't kill you but won't save you.\nMy recomendation is neutral but the actual price lowers it a little bit. Oh and if you want to play it the "fun" way it lasts 2 hours.","January 6, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticRebirth/recommended/297020/","PrismaticRebirth","PrismaticRebirth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticRebirth/","777 products in account","Introduction:  The Culling Of The Cows is a game very similar to what you would find on a free flash game website. It is a game in which you, playing as a farmer armed with a gun and various "assists", must fend off waves of enemies by moving up and down the screen, shooting in the proper "lane" the enemies are approaching from. While the game offered some mindless fun, I cannot fully recommend it as it does not do anything innovative to the genre, especially a genre that is overloaded with many other games (that are, not to mention, free).\n\n\n\nGameplay:  As previously mentioned, many users of flash game websites will immediately find something familiar in the gameplay. Moving up and down the screen, you must kill the approaching enemies, which happen to be mostly cows, before they reach you or the barn behind you.\n\nEach level of the game gives you a number of credits to spend for that level specifically, with more credits being available through supply drops that can be used periodically during the level. These credits can be used to change the type of gun you are using as well as upgrade your gun.\n\nYou start each level with a standard rifle that only fires in a straight line. You can purchase a shotgun, which fires bullets spread over several "lanes", another rifle which fires penetrating bullets, and a rifle which fires explosive bullets.\n\nFor upgrades, you can improve the size of your clip, how many bullets you reload at a time, and how many bullets you fire at once. You also have the option of purchasing a laser sight for your gun. All of these upgrades are applied, even if you switch weapon types.\n\nWhile there are choices in weapon types and upgrades, realistically, there is not much of a choice. The credits given to you for a level - including supply drops - was never really enough to purchase multiple weapon types after purchasing the - almost required - upgrades. The shotgun is quite plainly the best weapon in the game with little point of using anything else; the ability to attack multiple lanes at once is extremely invaluable and many of the enemies that take more than one bullet to kill are all killed by one shotgun attack anyway. The only upgrades that are needed are clip size upgrades and how many bullets are reloaded at once. The laser sight is essentially useless once the player gets used to the game, and increasing the number of bullets fired at a time does not really affect anything even if not using the shotgun.\n\nAn important aspect of this genre of game is the enemy types. While there is enemy variety, your gameplay style does not need to change as a result to this. It would have been interesting if a different gun type was needed for certain enemies; however, this is not the case here. Every enemy approaches in a straight line apart from one and, as mentioned before, a shotgun will kill every enemy in one hit regardless. While the game does promote "strategic value", it quickly becomes mindless, especially as the waves get longer and longer.\n\nBesides your gun, you also have access to assists. These assists are provided free of credits and gated only by a cooldown, with different ones being provided for each level. Nearly every assist is simply a screen clear, in a "get out of jail free" way. I personally felt this made the game far too easy, and only used them on a handful of occasions. To put it in comparison, the later levels give you five different assists to use, each with their own cooldown. With each of these assists clearing the screen on their own...it is highly overpowered, to the point where the player no longer needs to fire their weapon at all.\n\nMost of the levels of the game follow this format. There are "Onslaught" levels, which places the player in a barn and gives them infinite ammo and "Kill 'Em All" levels, which have one big wave opposed to several small waves. There are two boss levels, which play very similarly to the standard levels.\n\n\n\nArt & Graphics:  Shown by the screenshots, the game looks very similar to a flash game. The graphics are a bit more polished, however it is nothing special. As the playing field gets completely covered with the bodies of the zombies, it becomes more and more difficult to appreciate the graphics that do exist.\n\n\n\nSound:  There is only one music track in the game from what I heard, and it repeats very quickly. The death sound for each enemy is always the same - the black cows always make the same sound, the green cows always make the same sound, etc. With the sheer number of enemies later on, the game quickly becomes a mess of these sounds. Even on a very low volume, I was still annoyed by this mess of sound.\n\n\n\nReplay Value:  The game took nearly three hours to complete all 40 levels. As part of a free update, each level has three "challenges" to complete which are revealed upon beating the level the first time. These challenges include letting no zombie into the barn behind you, not upgrading your weapon, not using assists, and not missing a shot. There are Steam achievements for the game; however these are all earned by naturally completing the game.\n\n\n\nPrismatic Complaints:  There is an "Extras" option on the menu that does not work. The player must press the reload button for every time they wish to reload. While most of the enemies in the game are cows, there are four non-cow enemies, slightly ruining the theme of the game.\n\n\n\nClosing:  While I do find the idea of zombie cows amusing, and the death animations for the player had me laughing, I cannot recommend this game when there are many other games that do it better while also being free.","April 6, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not exactly worth the value that I put into it, but putting money aside, this game is essentially a 2.5D Tower Defense game featuring Zambie Cows. You're the last living redneck living off the face of some rural area and your belief in God has given you the ability to receive care packages to take more undead cows down. Pretty unique if you ask me.\n\nAs far as gameplay mechanics go, I wish it was playtested a bit more. I probably did not play this long enough, but aiming the cows is just as hard as reloading; you only reload one buckshot each time you press the reload button, and there are times where the bullets go past the cow. There was an upgrade that allows you to have a laser sight on your shotgun, but it's not exactly as helpful as you would expect. (The cows are transparent to these laser sights)\n\nThat being said however, it's not a bad game.

While the visuals are amusing, and the story should make it a shoe-in for satire and over-the-top comedy, it's just dull. The nail in the coffin, however, is the controls: they're clunky, uninspired, and death happens often because one is fighting against combat and evasion. Hats off to those who put hours into the game; I only put in 26 minutes and uninstalled it afterwards. It's a cute game, but if it means paying money for it, I recommend giving it a pass. Even for free, there's better out there.","March 12","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A defence 2d shooter, where you play as a jewish farmer defending your farm from zombified cows that run madly at you to eat up your soul, coming from some unknown source. Having quite a bit of fun so far, pretty hard tho, i reccomend using a controller for the sidescrolling levels and a mouse for the infinite ammo roof shooting levels for best confort. The level progression is really good, it does really get harder as you go along, but mot so much, the final boss is quite tough, and guess who you fight? A jews worst enemy: Nazi UFO! It was the nazi's new plan to exterminate you, using cows instead of camps, ♥♥♥♥♥ brilliant! I really enjoyed playing this game, the upgrades are intuitive however if u wanna get 100% you will have to refrain from upgrading substancailly increasing the games difficulty!\n\nEdit: I managed to beat the final boss: Nazi UFO, the first part needs to be carefully planned out then u rely on reflex and improvisation! Overall around 6 or so hours of gameplay...\n\nAbout people saying it feels like a cheap flash game, well maybe, but what the game is in doesnt affect the game itself much, there are other factors, hovever unlike a browser flash game, as i mentioned before, there is gamepad support which makes the games so much better for waves levels, as reloading on the keybard is a pain in the ♥♥♥, but also hi res full screen support, which no flash games have, maybe unity but not cheap flash, flash is almost obselete btw, i do however feel like 9 quid is wayy too much for this game, max 3 quid i would say, for me it has a kind of retro 2d style of graphics like in games like golden axe, except HD textures, the farmer looks hillarious BTW, really used all the jewish steroetypes like a ♥♥♥♥♥ massive nose!\n\nThe game may not be impressive from a technical standpoint, but it sure is fun to play, which is what counts for me, and more importantly, it runs on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC!! 60 ♥♥♥♥♥ FPS aswell, great for weak computers, proving that old computers still get ocasional fun games for them, you basically have the retro games older than 2005 (10 years old) and the un-demanding moders ones, not sure when this game came out, but im assuming newer than 2010.\n\nDo i reccomend buying this game at full price? Definitely no! Look for steam offers and givaway sites if u want to play this game, probably loads of poeple have steam keys for this game from past givaways, so look to buy or trade it off them for dirt cheap.\n\n\n8/10","January 2","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Barn on the left, Zombies come from the right, kill them before they get to the barn. Survive multiple waves to beat the level, but be careful, since if the Zombies touch/hit you, you will die instantly. To compare it to another game, its a lot like the "The Last Stand" Flash game, and I'm talking about the first 'The Last Stand'. Also one of the more difficult parts about shooting is that you can only shoot strait ahead of your character, as in you can't use the mouse to angle his gun to the upper/lower rows.\n\nOther than the basic shooting, with your Shotgun, there are 4 other aspects in fighting.\nAmmo - There are 4 ammo types: Normal, Buckshot, Piercing, and Explosive. You need to pay for these.\n\nSupply Drop - When you press the Supply Drop button, a crate will fall from the air, a delivery strait from God(seriously). It can contain various temporary powerups like 10 second invincibility, Unlimited Ammo(10sec), or even basic Cash Drops. When a Drop is called, the ability is placed on cooldown, and can be pressed again when it goes off the cooldown. This is free to use.\n\nAssists - This is where God himself, I'm serious here, helps you out. Like placing a giant saw in front of your barn door to kill advancing zombies, or a turret that randomly shoots, or a wall of fire in the middle of the screen. They are brief, like 10 seconds or something, and go on a cooldown after used, but they're useful. These are Free to use.\n\nUpgrades - These are 4 simple upgrades for your Shotgun, they are: Clip Size, Reload Speed, Shoot Speed, and a Laser Pointer. You need to pay for these.\nEach level you start out with a certain amount of cash. These can be used on the Ammo or Upgrades. You can get more cash from Supply Drops. The higher the level, the more you start with. And for the record, Ammo and Upgrades to not transfer to other levels.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed The Last Stand, or anyone who likes this type of game.","November 22, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also like the overall art style and atmosphere. Neither of these help to save the gameplay though which I found very redundant and at times overly difficult. The main reason I wouldn't recommend this game though is simply because of the small and incosistent hit point of the shotgun. I often miss shots that I feel I should've gotten from this and this gives away the fact that this an indie game. I don't know if this was on purpose to make the game more difficult or this is something that resulted in amateur programming but for me this was a gamebreaker. It's a shame too as I felt the game would've been really fun if it wasn't for the shooting hit points.","August 23, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s the kind of goofy flash game you would see on Newgrounds back in the day, but not one you would ever be expected to pay for. The movement is a little stiff and the shots don’t actually seem to register correctly about 1/3 of the time, which is exacerbated by the flat south park-esque characters giving you no good indication of depth down range. I played it for around 20 or 30 minutes and was quite bored, then booted it back up when I noticed an announcement on the Library page: Cheat Codes Added. Generally cheat codes end up ruining the fun of a game, but in a game like this maybe skipping to the excitement would keep me engaged for at least a while longer. I activated God Mode, unlocked all the upgrades, and added an MG nest to the top of the barn; awesome right? Except it wasn’t. There wasn’t any big spectacle, the MG was anemic at best, and God Mode only lasted roughly 15 seconds.\n\nI don’t know if I’m missing something or if there are some shady things going on because the overall consensus is Very Positive at the time of writing this. I got this as a free key from some bundle website a while back and I almost regret having it in my library. It functions enough to be acceptable on a flash game website but I’ll be hiding it in my Steam library and never touching it again.","October 7, 2015","false","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is farily straightforward... survive waves of zombies (mainly cows) and complete the game. While playing, you do get all sorts of abilities and upgrades that you can make use of. The only negative critic that I have towards this game is that it's incredibly easy and can be completed in under two hours. In that sense I don't think paying $12.99 is quite worth it, also since at this stage there are only five achievements who are also very easy to accomplish. Other than that, this game is really fun to play, and I would definitely recommend anyone giving it a shot, especially if you can get the game for free :)","October 2, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a base, which is a barn, obviously, and you got to keep the undead cows away from your barn using your shotgun. You can upgrade it with money you get at the beginning of each level, but it isn't much, and gaining extra dosh in a level is rather RNG based, so you got to make those upgrades count.\nAnyways, you can also buy other ammo types, use assists that may help you out in a pinch, ask for a supply drop which gives money or a powerup.\nThere are quite few game modes, not just the usual survive-for-x-waves. After completing a level you unlock the next one(s) and play those! You'll start getting more money to upgrade your weapon, but new cow types are also introduced so the game wouldn't get boring and it works. There are fast cows, exploding cows, drunk cows etc…\nAll in all an amazing game. I mean, instead of zombies you have cows!\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsmCOOY-TFA","October 19, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise it's way too expensive for what's inside of it technically and content-wise.

Here are the issues:\n\nRepetitiveness:\nObviously in any tower-defense type of game you are going to see some repetitiveness involving the levels that you play. However, I feel that this game does an okay job when it comes to level variety. There are 3 types of levels that you can play,  but they are all basically the same type of level just with a minor change that doesn't make it stand out to the others.\n\nLag:\nAlthough I do not usually write about lagging issues in a review due to me playing on a laptop and it usually being on my side of the experience, there is a major issue that needs to fixed ASAP. This has to do with the dead bodies left on the screen. If you notice in any other tower-defense game such as Plants Vs. Zombies for example, the bodies always disappear after a short while of sitting on the ground. This game does not do that, and I found that as I progress on through the waves of enemies, their bodies stay laying on the ground and actually cause the game to slow down and lag making it nearly impossible to successfully complete the level.\n\nSo is the game fun? Yes. I enjoy this game very much cause it does a great job at being a game that is challenging while still being fun. Is it worth $13? As it stands, no. The only reason I got this game was through a key giveaway for the game and I of course enjoy free games. I was shocked however to see that the price of this game to be $13 when stopping by to write a review. The game needs a lot of work before it would be worth that price, but if you don't mind it go ahead and buy it however I will not recommend this game for these reasons.","May 28, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

COTC is simple and harkens to the classic flash game setup, but one thing that most can't deny is that it's downright polished, and lovingly polished at that.\n\nYou have a shotgun. God supports you with farming equiptment and artillery strikes. There is a nazi UFO flying around. There are cows. Zombie cows. There are also some normal zombies sometimes. No one cares about those. You shoot them til they're all dead, as of God's urging.\n\nThis is all you need to know, and honestly, it's not for everyone. The insanely cheap pricetag demands some respect, and there is a surprising amount of content to be had, with a wide variety of levels and challenges, on top of some badge challenges that, while have no incentive, are a fun thing to try and aim for. There are multiple shell types, and each are fun to mess around with, but the buck shot is usually your best bet. You get the point.\n\nThe artstyle is absolutely lovely, and the voicework, while obnoxious after a point, is surprisingly competant and hammy.\nThere is an ending, and an overall plot, which has a kind of sweet if you can get past the final boss (it's a doozy, trust me), but for basic stupid arcade slaughter, you'll absolutely get your money's worth.\n\nNot for everyone, and arguably not worth the full price.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to whatever the developers do that isn't a bunch of jigsaw puzzles.\n\n","September 15, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also like the overall art style and atmosphere. Neither of these help to save the gameplay though which I found very redundant and at times overly difficult. The main reason I wouldn't recommend this game though is simply because of the small and incosistent hit point of the shotgun. I often miss shots that I feel I should've gotten from this and this gives away the fact that this an indie game. I don't know if this was on purpose to make the game more difficult or this is something that resulted in amateur programming but for me this was a gamebreaker. It's a shame too as I felt the game would've been really fun if it wasn't for the shooting hit points.","August 23, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

But, I would not recommend it for these following reasons:\n\n- Game have "full controller support" but you can't even config control option. So is not playable for people use AZERTY keyboard. Plus, you have to press R for reloading every single bullet and it will made your index finger tired between moving to D and rapidly pressing R after a while (if it can change to Space button would be nice, but dev gave a middlepinger right in our face).\n\n- Until now, I still don't now what Z,X and C upgrade for (all I now is V get you laser for better aim)? No intruction as far as I remember, too (or I've skipped it, I means ain't nobody got time for that). Hover your mouse on it to show what it do is a basic thing that all game need.\n\n- Talks about mouse, because you aim by moving, so dev should make it keybroad only (for laptop users), or you know, a ♥♥♥♥ING config control option. By made this keyboard and mouse, your left hand have to handle so much things (moving, reloading every ♥♥♥♥ing single bullet, upgrade, call supply, change bullet type) while all your right hand do is right click to shoot (left click to alt-fire but you can only do it when using first type of bullet, and you move so slow which means you gonna stick near your base, far from those cow, which means it's useless for 99% of the time).\n\n==> Conclusion: There are better flash games out there and they're free. Don't buy this game even 90% off, wait and find free key online. Only buy as gift to ♥♥♥♥ off your Curry friends (which I wouldn't recommend, too).","December 31, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

A defence 2d shooter, where you play as a jewish farmer defending your farm from zombified cows that run madly at you to eat up your soul, coming from some unknown source. Having quite a bit of fun so far, pretty hard tho, i reccomend using a controller for the sidescrolling levels and a mouse for the infinite ammo roof shooting levels for best confort. The level progression is really good, it does really get harder as you go along, but mot so much, the final boss is quite tough, and guess who you fight? A jews worst enemy: Nazi UFO! It was the nazi's new plan to exterminate you, using cows instead of camps, ♥♥♥♥♥ brilliant! I really enjoyed playing this game, the upgrades are intuitive however if u wanna get 100% you will have to refrain from upgrading substancailly increasing the games difficulty!\n\nEdit: I managed to beat the final boss: Nazi UFO, the first part needs to be carefully planned out then u rely on reflex and improvisation! Overall around 6 or so hours of gameplay...\n\nAbout people saying it feels like a cheap flash game, well maybe, but what the game is in doesnt affect the game itself much, there are other factors, hovever unlike a browser flash game, as i mentioned before, there is gamepad support which makes the games so much better for waves levels, as reloading on the keybard is a pain in the ♥♥♥, but also hi res full screen support, which no flash games have, maybe unity but not cheap flash, flash is almost obselete btw, i do however feel like 9 quid is wayy too much for this game, max 3 quid i would say, for me it has a kind of retro 2d style of graphics like in games like golden axe, except HD textures, the farmer looks hillarious BTW, really used all the jewish steroetypes like a ♥♥♥♥♥ massive nose!\n\nThe game may not be impressive from a technical standpoint, but it sure is fun to play, which is what counts for me, and more importantly, it runs on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC!! 60 ♥♥♥♥♥ FPS aswell, great for weak computers, proving that old computers still get ocasional fun games for them, you basically have the retro games older than 2005 (10 years old) and the un-demanding moders ones, not sure when this game came out, but im assuming newer than 2010.\n\nDo i reccomend buying this game at full price? Definitely no! Look for steam offers and givaway sites if u want to play this game, probably loads of poeple have steam keys for this game from past givaways, so look to buy or trade it off them for dirt cheap.\n\n\n8/10","January 2","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the visuals are amusing, and the story should make it a shoe-in for satire and over-the-top comedy, it's just dull. The nail in the coffin, however, is the controls: they're clunky, uninspired, and death happens often because one is fighting against combat and evasion. Hats off to those who put hours into the game; I only put in 26 minutes and uninstalled it afterwards. It's a cute game, but if it means paying money for it, I recommend giving it a pass.

The game is farily straightforward... survive waves of zombies (mainly cows) and complete the game. While playing, you do get all sorts of abilities and upgrades that you can make use of. The only negative critic that I have towards this game is that it's incredibly easy and can be completed in under two hours. In that sense I don't think paying $12.99 is quite worth it, also since at this stage there are only five achievements who are also very easy to accomplish. Other than that, this game is really fun to play, and I would definitely recommend anyone giving it a shot, especially if you can get the game for free :)","October 2, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This could easily have been a free flash game on Newgrounds and probably would have been a few years ago.\n\nThat said, the game is a lot of fun for what it lasts (about 2 hours). Anyone who loved Plants VS Zombies will feel right at home with the general atmosphere and charm that pervade it.\n\nThe game could have definitely used a little more playtesting; not because it's broken or anything, but because of how easily exploitable it is: the spread gun (activated by pressing 6 on the keyboard) is incredibly overpowered, and will easily dispatch hordes upon hordes of enemies without any difficulty, completely eliminating the need for accuracy. Couple that with readily accessible upgrades for larger magazine, faster reloading and fire rate, and you will soon put up a barrage of fire that won't let anything through.\n\nAlso overpowered are the special "killstreaks", like sentry guns and helicopters, which are fine per se, but have cooldowns that are way too short, making them easy to spam, especially when you get four slots of them.\n\nExtra challenge is available under the form of medals for each level, daring you to play without upgrading your gun or using any special ability, although as far as I could see, the game doesn't seem to offer any reward for completing them.\n\nDefinitely get this while it's free or when on sale for under 2 bucks for an evening of quality uncomplicated entertainment, just do not fork out the absurd $13 asking price which, in the end, is the only major flaw of this cool little game.","May 27, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're a farmer killing zombie cows and hippies with shotguns while yelling random things about Alex Jones and such. You have ammo and weapon upgrades along with support each level in the form of sentry guns and stealth bombers. It's pretty much your average tower defense shooter.\n\nAll in all it provided me with a good afternoon's worth of entertainment. I enjoyed it, but the price is way too steep.
