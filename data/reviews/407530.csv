"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhettorical/recommended/407530/","Rhettorical","Rhettorical","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhettorical/","156 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSure, it's not a perfect game, but it's exactly what I've been waiting for. I played ARK for hours and hours and ended up feeling like the whole thing was pretty pointless. All the servers were filled with RPers, and even the PvP servers were mostly passive. In this mode, though, it's an all-out brawl.\n\nPros:\nFast-paced. No more waiting around for nine hours to tame one stupid Trike. And you get tons of resources from harvesting.\nSkill matters. I'm constantly outplayed by people who know their way around the game, exactly how to aim, where to go to avoid being pursued, that sort of thing.\nQuick matches. I only lasted to the end of a match once, and it was still only like 40 minutes. Most of the time I'm terrible enough to lose in the first 20.\n\nCons:\nBuggy. Nothing that would make me not want to play, but I usually have to restart the client after a match, or it won't let me join a lobby. I've crashed to desktop during a match once.\nLaggy. Again, nothing serious, but it happens from time to time. It helps to filter by server region, something that's not enabled by default.\nIntensive. I have a nice PC with a very good GPU, and I have to put everything on Medium to maintain a stable 60fps. It's nothing like other people are saying, though. Just knock down your settings and you'll be fine.\nWait times. I don't know why there's no "Start" button when a lobby is full. I've seen the timer tick down from 5 minutes only to have half the lobby leave when it reaches a minute because they're impatient.\n\nOverall, very nice for an Early Access title. And, because it's free, there's really no reason not to play. It's a lot of fun.","March 31","true","5.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/campchack/recommended/407530/","campchack","Breezycheeks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/campchack/","45 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI purchased Ark Evolved and played this game through the custom games menu long before it was standalone. Ark Survival of the Fittest more fun and lasting than Ark Survival Evolved, and it is free.\n\nSOTF is 35-minute matches similar to the Hunger Games. Last man standing, everyone starts naked in the middle and gets forced back to middle by the end of the match. This is an eSport game and the top 10 ladder players each month win cash prizes, up to $3500 for being rank #1 and $700 for rank #10 in *each ladder*. There is no cash shop *at all*. It is meant to compete, not to make friends and build a community. It is a "rinse and repeat" game - you start over at level 1 and naked each match.\n\nArk: Survival Evolvedis similar to Rust but with Dinosaurs, however the official servers will never be wiped and there are no plans for new servers anytime soon. This means playing Ark: Survival Evolved is playing at the mercy of the Alpha Tribe who has invested thousands of combined hours to make their bases and their dinosaurs 100% invulnerable to you. The only way to succeed in Evolved as a new player is to farm thousands of cementing paste and buy your way into the Alpha Tribe.\n\nUnless you are a core member of an existing Alpha Tribe I doubt you will play Evolved for more than two weeks. It takes this much time to build the basics, have some fun and realize that everything you do is futile when a single Giga destroys your entire base in seconds.\n\nSurvival of the fittest however has no futile efforts. It is really just a quick competition of your combat prowess and building rotation. I have won as a dino tamer. I have won as a marksman with guns or arrows. I have won games by default because everyone else died. I have won with explosives and with narcotic tripwire. And I have lost many more times again.\n\nI will play Evolved again one day, when more official servers are released. There is no reason to be a slave for an Alpha Tribe when you can carve your own glory, gaining rank and prize money in SOTF.","April 25","true","443.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

They released a patch to fix the FPS problems, so you should be able to run it more smoothly now!\n\nWITH LINKS TO HELP WITH YOUR FPS! IT WORKED FOR ME. ALSO SOME TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS ON THE BOTTOM.\n\nFirst, I want to start off by saying that I never commented on any games before. But I am a big fan of SOTF ever since it was just a mod in ARK survival evolved. After seeing all the bad reviews, I feel like I have to type something to help this game grow bigger.\n\nI do agree with most comments about the bad FPS issues. I do noticed a big drop in FPS in SOTF comparing to ARK survival evolved. But ever since I download a game booster and did some minor tweaks following the links I am going to post on the bottom, I did see a big increase in my FPS. So hopefully it will help you guys as well.\n\nAlso, if you have never played ARK before and wanted to try out the game, I do agree that this game is pretty brutal for new players because you are going to die A LOT. But again, who didnt die A LOT when they first started out with ARK? U die from hunger, thrist, cold, heat, other players, or dinos. This is just part of the game. And personally, I like a game that is challenging. I think that having this do give other players who are not good with PVPing a better chance to win against people who are great with crossbows and guns. While you are dying off to all the events and dinos, the good players are ALSO facing the same events and have a chance to die as well.\n\nSecond, I do agree that unranked lobbies take too long to start sometimes. It will be great if they add a voting system in the lobby, if more than 50% vote to start, let's just start the game. It's much better than forcing a certain amount of tribe numbers before starting.\n\nOverall, I love SOTF. I don't have the best FPS in this game, but the game mode and the graphic is awesome. I love the fact u can try to tame dinos to win the game, or u can simply go tech and craft guns (if you are good at pvp and have awesome frames). Unlike other royale battle i've played, I have yet get bored on this game mode because there's so many different ways to can go to try to win a game instead of doing the same thing EVERYTIME. Trust me, u will get better if u don't give up.\n\nSIMPLE TIPS for new players:\n\n1) Don't run into the center. If you have good frames, go ahead and run in. But the center really dont have any items worth enough for you to get killed within the first 5 mins. (Basically, u want to run down, find a safe spot in the wood, and rush for spears, bows and arrows, before going out in the open)\n2) Pick can get you - Thatch from trees, Flints from rocks, Meats from dinos. Hachet can get you - Wood from trees, Stone from rocks, Hides from dinos. You get fiber and berries by picking bushes. And u get chitins by killing bugs/scorpions and chopping them with hachet after they died.\n3) If u happen to be by a red drop without other players, loot it. It gives you really good stuffs.\n4) DO NOT stay on the beach for too long. You will be found very easily and get kill.\n5) Cloth armor can help with heat and hide armor can help with cold. U might need 2-3 standing torches with megacold too\n6) Nacroberries(BLACK) can keep your unconscious dinos from waking up. Just put it in their inventory and force feed them if u think they will wake up before taming is done.\n7) Stimberries can help you recover your stamina (It's great if u are running from dinos or other players). Keep them in your hotbar. But they will drain your water level (the yellow, blue, and purple berries will increase your water level)\n8) Try not to start a fire if u dont have to. It tells people where you are. DO NOT use torches at night unless you are freezing. (The little ice cube icons appears when you are freezing, and your health will start going down at that point)\n9) Don't chop down the whole tree or rocks, when trees fall and rock explode. It gives out your direction\n10) If you run into big shiny golden metal nodes, stay by it, gather, kill and tame dinos. Once u get to level 20, u can make forges to burn metal to ingots. Make smithy and make some good gears and weapons. (Metal picks give you more metals too)\n11) When you are looking at your inventory to craft or simply to check things. ALWAYS lie down on the floor before doing so, it's harder to see you that way. (Of course, if you are lying down on the beach, people are still going to see you)\n12) If your bones are broken (U will see a broken bones icon appears), the only way to recover your health is to laydown. Walking around will kill you. So find a safe spot and lay down if you are not being chase)\n\nHopefully these tips can give you guys some head start and prevent u guys from dying too much. I'm gonna post the two links i've used to help with my FPS on the bottom. Good Luck and Have fun everyone.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yQc8ncqLfM\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=475747492","March 19","true","321.1"," 290 of 375 people (77%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","77","290","375","22","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stabbybobby/recommended/407530/","stabbybobby","stabby bobby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stabbybobby/","13 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBias:  I have played quite a bit of regular ole Ark, and I like it just fine.\n\nSo as of this review, I've been in 2 matches so far.\n\nWhich brings me to my first problem:  The lobbies.  A free-for-all needs 25 players for a ranked match, and even when 25 players were in the lobby, many times, the game failed to start.  I would have played more, had the lobbies functioned a little better.  I also suspect that some people are abusing the finickyness of the lobby system to disrupt normal gameplay.\n\nOnce you get in a game, you are placed in a giant bubble in the sky, where you can talk smack, plan your plans, or otherwise occupy your time.  It is important that you make your character, make your tribe, and possibly your flag, as soon as you can.  Press L to form a tribe, by the way, for those who don't know.  I am hoping that the devs can get this whole rigamarole straight, as it's probably driving people away from the game.  Perhaps an out-of-game way to craft your character, flag, and set up a 'quick tribe' to use once you get in a match?\n\nAfter a period of time, you are descended to the playfield via a beam, where you are free to run amok.  In my first match, I mostly played stealth and lasted quite a while, until I encountered a man taming a trike.  I felt good during the fight, like I was winning, but the trike woke up and he whistled it onto me, and I died, caught between a trike and a hard place.\n\nSecond match, I stealthed to an area with several good specimens of beast, and tamed myself an ape.  With that ape, I then went ape, killing 3 other players.  The fourth player was able to mount his anky and overcome my element of surprise, and his trike and stego ended up finishing me off.  I was close, though.\n\nThat is all pretty good.\n\nI recommend this game with the expectation that it will improve over time.  Ark was nearly unplayable when it came out, due to FPS issues, and now, even on my modest old computer that most would be embarrassed to own, I can play it at 40 FPS.   Ark: SOTF does run a bit poorer than that, but with a little tweaking, it ran well enough for me to score numerous kills and make numerous direct hits with bows, spears, and slingshots.\n\nSome people will be surprised at the suddenness with which one can die, but I enjoy that aspect, as even a guy on a rex can be killed by bugs when he stops to drink or loot a fallen enemy.\n\nI haven't tried the tech path of play yet, but it suspect it's risky until the end, when it all pays off.  4-5 combatants I've faced were hidden, attempting to make guns and armor to counteract dinosaur mount power.  At least 2 of them made it farther than me.\n\nWhich brings to another point:  When you die, you are immediately ejected from the game into the menu.  I appreciate why spectating is a bad idea, but at least having a scoreboard to see who won a match would be nice.\n\nIn the lobbies, you can see your own simplified stats, but I can't figure out a way to vew other people's stats.   Related to the above point, it would be nice to know who you were up against, as well.  Maybe something to note how often a person has killed using their mount, vs melee weapons, vs ranged weapons, etc.  I would like to know if a player in a match is an axe murderer or if they want to skulk in the shrubs waiting to bushwack the 2nd to last tired competitor with a shotgun to the face.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\nThis is a game that is still in development.  It has some problems that may be game breaking for some.  It is based off of Ark:  Survival Evolved, and has most of the elements of that game, including crafting and heavy inventory management, so it has a learning curve.  It demands a lot of your system, and may not play at framerates that some are used to.  It is frustrating not being able to get into a game from the lobby.\n\nThat being said, it has a lot of potential, was fun for the 2 matches I've played, and it has freaking dinosaur shotgun giant ape cannibal with a spear fights.","March 21","true","1.8"," 103 of 132 people (78%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","78","103","132","21","0"

That's where its counterpart, ARK: Survival Evolved plays a role.\nThe conditions of the game is altered to enhance the tension such as dramatic elements, extra aggressive dinosaurs and so on, so forth.\nAlthough the difficulty of the game is rather subjective since you're able to set up your own game and customize the majority of the match functionality, so it all depends on which environment you've been brought upon and the way you survive.\n\nPerformanceAs the game is in its early access stage, much like the main game there are still some optimization required and as it seems on both games the developers are actively working and communicating with the playerbase.\nWith some tinkering in the options it is adequate for the modern mid-end computers.\n\nThere are some quirky and irritating bugs scattered around in the game, but arguably forgiving ones.\n\nVisuals and audioPersonally I find this game very beautiful and kind on the eyes, there are appealing optical flares and the fur texture are cleverly applied.\nThe audio in majority is very fitting and appropriate for the selected scenarios. There is enough options to personalize these features to your own likings.\n\n\nThe verdictIt is a very intriguing representation of survival versus player spiced up with jurassic creatures kind of game, however if you ever feel like to settle down and play in a more laid-back player-versus-environment manner, ARK: Survival Evolved would be an appropriate game for you.\nIt holds great potential to continue as a game that is cared for by the developers but then again, don't quote me on that.","March 15","true","2.6"," 196 of 287 people (68%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","68","196","287","24","0"

(this can be humourous sometimes and fustrating other times!)\n\nEvery decision will have a consequence and its about making the right decisions to win. Lots of different strats that can be employed.\n\nSpeed and effeciency is of the essence, you will always need a third eye in your back to survive.

Yet the near overall opinion is that this game is a lug of crap.\n\n\nPros:\n=The 'hunger game' survival mechanics are fun.\n=The main menu interface is slick.\n\nCons:\n=100fps in ARK = 1-3fps in SoTF *see update below\n=Development is now 'branched' into two groups...any professional coder can tell you this is a terrible idea.  Maybe if ARK was complete and out of 'early access' it'd be okay, but the amount of bugs this will introduce will become increasingly obvious over time.  It's already bug-ridden in ARK and SoTF.\n=The challenge 'waves' are creative, but cause massive lag and seem kinda odd.  Like hey let's spawn 15 bugs right on top of each player?  Maybe instead of random generated swarms or something moving through land...\n=Time spent in the lobby can be up to 10-20 minutes since it requires that the lobby be full for an extended period of time before a match can start.  It should allow the players to 'vote to start immediately'\n=The hit-boxes / syncing isn't working correctly.  I'll snipe a dino in the head & it'll show that my arrow is in there, but a 'tribemate' will see the arrow in the chest or arm.  Vice versa when he's doing the shooting.\n=Where's the tutorial for players new to ARK?  Even bots or an empty map on solo mode would at least help out the new players...despite how much I loved killing helpless new players.\n=Harvesting rates are broken periodically.  I'll sometimes get 1-2 wood from a tree per harvest and then 20+ from another.\n\nThere are other games out there that do the same thing SoTF does, but much better.  This is a major waste of time/ resources for wildcard.\n\n\nSystem Specs:\n\ni7 67k @4Ghz\n4-512GB ssd samsung 850s\nMSI GTX 970 4GB 256 GDDR5\nMSI ATX DDR4 Motherboard z170A\n725w psu\nDual monitors @ 24"\n\n\nUpdate:\n=Made a lovely discovery a few days ago.  For whatever reason Windows 10 dual-monitors cause issues with SOTF.  They decrease FPS from ~25 to ~1-3 when both are active.  If one is active it's fine.  However, with ARK it can handle both at 70-100FPS.\n\n=Since some people are complaining I didn't spend enough time enduring the 1-3fps so I've given a more detailed review above of the cons.  I still don't recommend this game as it's just not fun for me with all the bugs/glitches and slow match setup pace.  That's my opinion and you're welcome to try it out to form your own.","March 16","false","3.5"," 1,210 of 1,912 people (63%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","63","210","1","117","69"

It is a free to play Alpha with no tutorial, watch some youtube clips of sotf tournaments if you need help getting started. In saying that here is my personal account of my first game in the stand alone version.\n\nEntered a free for all lobby, 24/25 people, instant start wooooooo.\nGet in game, rush the middle, get a stone hatchet, and so it begins...\nStalk two players in the middle battling it out, spear chucker vs sling shotter, (not racist, he was chucking spears).\nSling shotter knocks spear chucker unconscious, here's my chance, I sprint in, pull the spear from his comatose hand and run that little ♥♥♥♥♥ sling shotter down. Kill 1.\nLoot her lifeless corpse for any tricks up her sleeves, HIDE ARMOR SET ♥♥♥♥ YEAH!!!!! Turn to my fallen brother spear chucker, thank him for the assist, and smother him with a pillow/spear to the face. Kill 2.\nLoot his dead betrayed body, STEAK, AND ARROW GALORE!!!\nBack on the hunt, I spy ♥♥♥♥ boy no shirt wearing only his enticingly tight low rise leather leggings in his inventory. In spear chuckers memory I hoist my pole and lodge it deep down his ear, just like all the ladies love it. wink emoticon Kill 3.\nI have accomplished everything, and at the same time nothing, no tames, no weapons, no bueno. Quickly craft a bow, drop two Dilos, Spitter, and swallower, (Blackinola voice-"Ladies"). Make my way to the beach where I discover the most splendid of all things.\nMore luscious than Beyonce's thighs smothered in coconut oil on top of a pile of bacon covered in maple syrup... A downed Rex mid tame...\nI spy the tamer, a choice must be made, go for the kill, or the sneaky tame steal... "HE'S IN HIS INVENTORY!!! BLOOD!!!!!!!!!!" I fire a tranq arrow right at his kisser, alas he exits inventory and the dual commences. Spitter and Swallower pounce but quickly go down like the hoes they so truly are.\nHere it is, mano-e-mano, the battle for the rex. we both land two shots each, when out of no where...\nBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZ!!!\nA swarm of meganura overcome me, I'm forced to run to the water... but then a thought occurs to me... I double back, charging the would be rex tamer, he's confused (And I suspect slightly aroused).

Even then, when I was commited, PvP was very sparse, most of the PvP servers didnt actually encourage PvP and people spent most of their time building up bases rather than in combat.\n\nSOTF throws that all upside down. Depending on your team size (FFA, 2v2, 4v4, 6v6), depends on how long the game goes for and how quickly you can build up a collection of items/dinosaurs to fight with. But they are small self-contained chunks where you have to compete with a heap of other players to be the last man standing. Its a rush, its very exciting and there is a lot happening in a short span of time.\n\nThe only downsides are for the new guys, theres no real tutorial or idea on how to play so those from original ARK have an advantage at the start. It still needs more polish thats for sure and as always, ARK is rather poorly optimized.\n\nStill its incredibly enjoyable and I prefer it to regular ARK.","March 23","true","13.2"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","44","59","5","0"

I put about 20 odd minutes into this game.  That being said  joined 4 lobbies, and they all took absolutely forever to start. Whether I spectated or was waiting.\n\nI heard this next statement from several players at once in a room, so I'm just taking it from word of mouth.  I was wondering what was taking so long to start.  Come to find out; the host of the room can't force start it.  The room has to hit the required number of players set and it'll start automatically.  Um... a game where you can have 100 players in a room, and a host can't force start it? Really?\n\n(EDIT) Now all games start within after 5min timer.  After a minimum of 5 people join in, which isn't bad.\n\nI haven't even played the game [that much].  I spectated for a bit.  So how can I give it a thumbs down? Give me a sec I'm getting there. The game plays fantastically.  Seeing a Tribe member hop on the back of a white haired version of King Kong just to smash oncoming tribes members and their dinosaur beast was something I longed for.  The lush forest had great detail with the grass blowing in the wind almost without pattern.  This game is like the modern Crysis.\n\nI gave this game a thumbs down, while its fun to play, there is no real tutorial to go on in this free to play mode. After getting thrown into the game it'll just be trial and error until you get the drift.  Which takes me, personally, longer than I'd like.  From my experience there is alot to take in in survival games and being on a timer doesn't help.  I expected as much, but still hoped the Dev's who released this version wouldn't assume we all came from the B2P game.\n\nThat being said.  I highly recommend you play the actual original ARK game to get down the basic features, and become familiar with the creatures and hud, then play this SotF version.

There is a massive adrenaline rush playing ffa.  It's fast enough to squeeze a game in when you have a little downtime but long enough that you are invested in whether you win or lose.  I played Ark Evolved before SOTF so that helps with learning the game.  I strongly suggest looking at the guides people have posted first; this will greatly enhance your enjoyment of the game (so you don't die in the first 5 minutes).  I'm a very competitive person so watching my score climb is very satisfying.  Unfortunately you will run into people teaming or exploiting the game the same you find in most games.

Poor Performance:  While it is no secret that this game is not fully optimized, I have had no problem running it on my mid-tier computer (Consistant 40fps).  Even on a lower tier computer, simply turning down some settings can easily get you a playable 20fps.\n\n2. Long game wait time: While I agree that they should impliment a force start of some kind, I have only found this to be a problem when you get into the longer matches like 4 and 6 man teams. In free for all, I have never had a problem joining a lobby quickly. It is true that this game has a longer wait time than most, but I think it has been greatly over exaggerated.\n\nFor a Free-For-All game, I estimate the avg. wait time to be 3-5 Minutes\n\nThe wait times increase as you get into larger games simply because there are more players who need to join.I do not think that the wait time is that large a [problem as the matches are fairly long (if you dont die right away), so your lobby time to play time ratio is pretty fair.\n\n\n\n3. Some strats are better than others: Yes this is actually a complaint I saw. What I think they were trying to say was that the strats are unbalanced.\n\nThis is a truth of any game! Some strats will always be better than others, but I thuink so far, Ark has done a pretty good job of keeping the game balanced.\n\nI do not think that there is any one strat that is a guaranteed win, as there is always a way to counter. There is room for improvement in the balancing of strats, but currently I do not see this as so much of a problem\n\n\n\n4. Unfair matchmaking system: The Ark ranking system does not accurately express a players skill, and there are many ways to "grind" to a higher rank.\n\nThis being said, I think that the fact that players can play against the best players in the game is a good thing. The match making system is pretty much just random, so any player can play with any other player unless the lobby leader changes the score requirement.\n\nWhile this may be frustrating at first to new players, it is good that players are constantly playing against people who are better than them at the game, as this helps everyone improve.\n\nIt is always fun to just beat down on some noobs, but playing agaisnt people of all ranges of skill offers the best gameplay experience. A range of skill allows for you to get kills on those who are worse than you, but also keeps players from just winning every game they play.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR This game is not perfect. That being said, it is still in early access and it is evident that the devs are working hard and listening to what people are saying. Many of the "problems" that people have with the game can be easily fixed, or are aspects of the game that just make sense to have.\n\nThis game has a very good concept and while there are some problems that need to be addressed, it is still very fun to play and there are small issues that are worth dealing with.\n\nReal issues:\n\n1. Hackers\n2. Lobby Leaders can't force start\n3. Dinosaurs have a tough time traveling through trees (this is very annoying)\n4. No way to mute people\n5. If I think of any more then I will list them here but hey only 4 issues that pretty goood.","May 14","true","72.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Another issue is that the dinos will glitch through your house which will annoy the fu.ck out of you. Dinos also take a while to tame, which isn't a bug but is very annoying.

I just tried Don´t starve thogether and this game and love both of them. While many people seem to have problems with Framerate, I can run it smoothly on epic configuration. Such a surprise for me.\n\nTrying to figure out what to do isn´t very hard but keep in mind this: from stone axes to rifles  for pro players is just a 5-10 minutes thing. So be prepared to eat some bullets while still strugling to build your thiny narcotic arrows. search for some guides on youtube or livestreaming from pro-players to learn how to deal with other tribes and dinosaurs (and almost everything that moves, swims or flies). And of course to learn how to craft very quickly in order to put some bullets inside others skulls.\n\n\nWhile playing in tribes, be prepared to be betrayed sometimes by other players: By accident* or because their antisocial skills overcomes the very objective of the tribe.

It a very hard game that is very easy to be casual in. So far I have waited at most 5 minutes to get into a game and this was at 4 am cst. Every match was full.\n\n\nThe pro:\n\n\n-Intense hunger games style game mode (don't slack off or you will die right away).\n\n-Way more variants to choose from over the original mod (FFA, 2pl team, 4pl team, 6PL TEAM!)\n\n-gameplay is smooth as butter and your shots (for the most part) hit where they should.\n\n-Start with all engrams unlocked which, imo, is a huge QOL inprovement.\n\n-Winning earns you permanent hats!\n\n-Insane replayability (many different creatures to tame and build your strategy around and the loot drops are always wildly different causing you to change your tactics on the fly).\n\n-Graphics are still as gorgeous as they were on the full game (Im running on medium with no FPS issue whatso every).\n\n-HOLY CRAP THEY FIXED THE LOAD TIMES! For you that didnt play before, it used to take the mod at least 3-5 minutes to load. Now they have a beautiful lobby system in place and the loading on the same hardware is nearly instantanous. HUGE plus in my book.\n\n-FREE!\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n-Undeniably, there is still some compatibility issues. It seems like the better your hardware, the worst the game will run. When I booted up the game I did have to spend about 5 minutes in the settings to tweak it to run smooth (expected from any game let alone one that is Early Access). My reccommendation is to turn sky quality and ground clutter all the way down and then if you still lag, you should start lowering the resolution scale. If it still lagging for you there, then there are more advanced tweaks to use that will adjust the launch commands. Still lagging after that? Your PC is too bad or too good and not optimised for the game (give it a few weeks and come back they are always updating!) For reference, I am running 8gig ram, a GTX750, and an intel i5.\n\n-Many racists and immature children that you have to confront in the lobby and game. While I take a sick pleasure in killing these guys first or stalking them to toy with them, some may be put off by this. Remember this is a mod and there is no moderation unless you go on the unofficial servers.\n\n-Ingame chat (both voice and text) is lacking. Not the biggest of issues because Discord is almost always better anyways.\n\n\nOverall, I am very shocked and pleased with how this mod came out in the standalone version. I would have payed again for it, tbh. It is that good and only going to get better. The fact that they just decided to release it for free and do a huge tourney is just amazing. I really hope they continue to optimize the game so that more can play and that they continue to add QOL features. As far as the content already in is concerned, its nearly flawless (compared to how it was 6 months ago).\n\nGreat game...would take a venom arrow to the head and pass out again... 8.5/10 (and could be an easy 9-9.5 with the cons fixed up).","April 1","true","35.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Do people not think that patches are a thing? If there's an issue like that, they'll fix it, what you should be commenting on is the gameplay, which I'll get into now.\n\nIt's fun, really fun.\nConsidering my main gripe with the original game was that taming speeds and resource gathering rates were too low, making that hard earned rex that fell into a pond filled with piranhas and couldn't get out due to bad AI so infuriating I wanted to rip my hair out. But in this, the matches are so short and sweet, and the taming speed upped, so if you do lose your dinosaur either in combat or to the again, horrific AI (please sort this out), it doesn't feel like such a blow.\nIt's rare a game really gets my adrenalin pumping, and this did it just splendidly. For first time players to an ARK game it might take a while till you figure out how everything works, but for old time ARK players you should be good to go.\nMany of the original hassles have been exchanged for a more streamlined gameplay so you use the short amount of time you have to the best of your ability.\nYou need to go into gameplay with a plan. Not having one will probably get you killed.\n\nAlso, it's FREE. You really can't expect more from this. This has certainly quenched my thirst for a MOSA game till The Culling goes on sale.","March 24","true","2.8"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

Which might be fine but it should be mentioned before you install a 10gb download, 35gb installed game.\n\nI absolutely hate when games crash my computer.  Not the normal "every once in a while a game crashes your computer or freezes up"; not the "I have not restarted in a week, I have installed a bunch of other new stuff and I have 232 other processes running and 143 tabs open in 3 different browsers" kind of crash.  I ran this game for the first time after a restart and with minimal other processes running and...\nFour crashes in the first 30 minutes of playing.  This is not acceptable.  Two of the four crash restarts wanted me to error check my main hard drive on start up.  Two crashes were lockups with frozen screen, one crash the computer clickws off then back on seconds later, and the last crash was a Win10 BSoD with an error about trying to write to read only memory.\n\nThe game runs unbelievably poor for a competitive, online PvP game.  Server lag and frames per sec drops are frequent.\n\nI know it is early access but be forewarned the polish has not been applied to this game in anyway yet; all polish has been added solely to the marketing end of their operation.","March 18","false","0.5"," 45 of 86 people (52%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","52","45","86","12","0"

And when we actualy did get into the game, we ended up being kicked, without the game telling us why.\n\nSo unless you enjoy being in a lobby full of 9-year-olds who just found out what the N-Word is, that enjoy joking about jews, and sleeping with your mom, for 20 minutes straight. This game is not for you.\nIf you somehow do have the patience to sit for 20 minutes straight, before getting into a boring-♥♥♥ game that doesn't give you any sort of instruction on what the hell you're doing, and you for some weird reason actually enjoy it. This game is for you.\n\nThinking about how horrible this crap is, makes me want to start a rope-fund for the developers who made this piece of garbage, considering that they have spent quite some time on Survival Evolved (which is a great game).

Now I'm here playing a simular game on a PC, and there's no tutorial to help new players like me.\n\n\n\nFist of all, the FPS is movie-quallity for me, runing at around 30 FPS, AND DON'T GIVE THIS GAME A NEGATIVE REVIEW ABOUT FPS, IT'S YOUR COMPUTER'S BUILD. Anyway, there's more complaints I have with this game:\n\nTHE LOBBY OF VOID: Great! Another game where we wait FOREVER just to play the game! I have only escaped the lobby and ACTUALLY played the game 2 TIMES, then died right after I got into the game. But during a [u[1-hour session in the LOBBY OF VOID[/u], I'm finding myself with 7 naked men, all of them chose weird body builds (Like big heads and tiny bodies, migets with mucles, EVEN HUGE PEOPLE!), RUNING AROUND, PUNCHING PEOPLE AND DANCING, and talking about "When will the game even start?!"\n\nThe other problem about the lobbies of void is that I don't want to have to join a session with OVER 20 PEOPLE.\n\nNow, here's the problem about THE PLAYERS: After everyone FINALLY BEAMS DOWN ONTO ACTUAL LAND, everyone goes up to the loot and starts chasing other players and killing them. This makes some people get no loot and instantly lose the game. I need the loot, but everytime I try to get some loot, some jerk has to kill me. Not fair, not cool. Nope, not dealing with this. So I just turn away from the loot and ANOTHER PLAYER runs up to me and kills me.\n\nPlus, too many players make a session too long and too hard for new players.\n\n\n0/10 Would rather BUY ARK: SE instead of playing this game fetched from the landfils in [insert country name here]","March 23","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerribleLogicYouTubeOfficial/recommended/407530/","TerribleLogicYouTubeOfficial","FaZe_Frank","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerribleLogicYouTubeOfficial/","59 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nARK: Survival Of The Fittest is basically a jurassic Hunger Games. You can choose to play alone in Free-For-All, or play with up to 3 others in 4-man tribes. This game has a small learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a very fun game!\n\nPros:-You can tame dinosaurs. Dinosaurs. These dinosaurs help you carry more items, and attack enemies for you. These dinosaurs typically deal more damage and have higher health than you, so it's definitely recommended to tame more than one.\n-Nice graphics and atmosphere. The graphics in this game are very nice to look at and are very detailed. Sometimes, in the midst of the chaos, it's nice just to take in the scenery around you. The world was very beautifully designed.\n-Hilarious character customization. This game takes character creation to a whole new level. Not only can you choose the basic stuff: hair color, eye color, size of your character, gender, etc., but you can also over-exaggerate these features like crazy! If you wanted to, you could make a character that is 4 feet tall with very muscular arms and very skinny chicken legs, and so much more!\n\nCons:-Requires a powerful graphics card. This game is kind of poorly optimised. If you want this game to run smooth (or over 30 FPS), you must use a good graphics card.\n-The learning curve. If you've played ARK: Survival Evolved, this most likely won't be a problem for you. But, if you were like me and just started off with this game, it is certainly a challenge when you're first learning how to play this game. Learning how to tame dinosaurs, how to get good loot, and how to use some weapons can be a challenge. Just be prepared to face players with more skill than you, and be patient. You will learn how to win, it's not too hard!\n-Evolution Events tend to be a little broken. Evolution Events are random events that occur that are specifically designed to endanger the player (with the exception of a few events: Double Taming, Food of the Gods, Harvest Bounty, Herbivore Drop, Supply Overload, Super Loot Crate). Some Evolution Events, such as Mega Heat, are kind of broken. For example, with Mega Heat, the player must remove all of their clothes to help cool off. This wouldn't be such a problem if the Event didn't maintain that heat. You could even swim in the river and constantly drink but still lose health due to the heat. Of course, these aren't big issues, just be careful when the events occur!\n\nTL;DR... This game is very fun. It has awesome graphics, as well as an amazing atmosphere. It gives you the ability to tame dinosaurs and create silly characters. Although, you will not be able to run this game smoothly unless you have a good graphics card. The learning curve is a challenge to get used to, but isn't too big of an issue. The Evolution Events are designed to kill you, and are very good at doing their job.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend you play with friends; free-for-all is very hard if you're not very good at the game, and random players aren't always good teammates.\n\nAfter playing this game, I rate it 8.5/10. It's fun, and it's free, so why not give it a chance? Good luck in the ARK!","June 4","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This new version definitely has my support. Compared to the old SOFT, the lag and matchmaking is over 9000 times better than it used to be. Leveling and gearing up to fight other players is easier as well, dinos dont just roflstomp you the moment you see them and the loot drops are far more balanced.\n\nArk's new SOFT is a perfect 5/7. (If you dont get the joke please look that up lol.)\n\nAlso, highly recommend watching the bushes, with the foliage higher than it used to be, players can hide in them easier.

Yes, the game setup is quite crazy. Yes, the lobby part takes ages.\n\nBut the matchmaking is genius, especially for playing with friends. The gameplay has many different paths to achieve victory, and survival. The best part about ark is its low tech gameplay (all the high tech stuff in the original ark actually destroys the game setting for me), and in this game mode it works out better than the standalone.\n\nThere are no hidden costs (yet). This is a truly free game, with well evolving mechanics.\n\nKill dinosaurs, build bows and that hide armor, or just build that cloth armor and go spears, or go guns, or go mass tame, or go tame something cool and level it up, or go for the middle crate, ohnoes arctic monkeys!\n\nCons\nGosh, that lobby is buggy. And why do I have to restart the game because the party system is broken. Oh come on, devs, just because UDK allows you to do everything by click and drag, please dont become lazy! Fix that UI!

Hail to the King rockets are a mess.\n3.  Sniper rifle scope.  Why.   It's an instant win.  If it didn't tell you if you were going to hit it would be 100% reasonable but at it's current state it's a mess.\n4.  The mic in lobby is horrible.  It's a micspam mess.  It is a mess of small children screaming and idiots spamming soundboards and music into mic.   A time limit to how long mic can be on at a time or some sort of limiter would be incredible.\n5.  Better matchmaking:  letting the highest ranked players (people in the 1900s average score range) into a lobby with an average of low 1500s is an absolute mess.  People that haven't gotten much experience get wiped before they get a chance to learn leaving them not wanting to play the game.  Set up an automatic matchmaking system if possible, joining near level players with eachother rather than a cluster♥♥♥♥ would be fantastic.\n\nAt this current state I would give the game a 7/10 just because of how drawn you get into it after learning more and more.

Hail to the King rockets are a mess.\n3.  Sniper rifle scope.  Why.   It's an instant win.  If it didn't tell you if you were going to hit it would be 100% reasonable but at it's current state it's a mess.\n4.  The mic in lobby is horrible.  It's a micspam mess.  It is a mess of small children screaming and idiots spamming soundboards and music into mic.   A time limit to how long mic can be on at a time or some sort of limiter would be incredible.\n5.  Better matchmaking:  letting the highest ranked players (people in the 1900s average score range) into a lobby with an average of low 1500s is an absolute mess.  People that haven't gotten much experience get wiped before they get a chance to learn leaving them not wanting to play the game.  Set up an automatic matchmaking system if possible, joining near level players with eachother rather than a cluster♥♥♥♥ would be fantastic.\n\nAt this current state I would give the game a 7/10 just because of how drawn you get into it after learning more and more.

There's no tutorial, and if you have no experience with Ark: SE its not easy to figure out. But that doesn't mean its not a good game. Everyone who actually knows how to play loves it.\n\nAs for the lag, any decent PC with processor thats better than an i3 will run it. And I can find a $500 pc with an i5 after 2 seconds on google. If you can't afford that you probably shouldn't be trying to play modern games, sorry to say. The game is not hard on your video card, my laptop has both intel integrated and Nvidia GeForce. I've turned off the GeForce and can still run it on epic graphics using just the integrated. As I said, the processor is all you have to worry about, as it does use a ton of CPU. But again, its 2016.

Usually tons of people just hang out waiting for a match to start...that never does, so people bail and "sniper" other servers cutting other people out...It needs over hauled.\nThen creating a tribe, you have to press L to do it. One idiot was saying: "Press TAB" which is not the right button, and I got booted for not creating a tribe fast enouhg (I learned later it is L not TAB).\nThen once in game, I spent the entire time building up a nice arsenal and weapon stash as people dying all over the place... So I take one step out to begin the fight...killed by bees and I have to REDO the entire "hunt for server" experience...It is bad.... They need to reduce the environment issues (becase we are not here to build houses and get protected from animals under 30 min...) and they need to have large map where we hide and prepare and every 5 min, shrinnk the radius in random chosen spot, that way we adapt and get closer to each other.

Now I'm here playing a simular game on a PC, and there's no tutorial to help new players like me.\n\n\n\nFist of all, the FPS is movie-quallity for me, runing at around 30 FPS, AND DON'T GIVE THIS GAME A NEGATIVE REVIEW ABOUT FPS, IT'S YOUR COMPUTER'S BUILD. Anyway, there's more complaints I have with this game:\n\nTHE LOBBY OF VOID: Great! Another game where we wait FOREVER just to play the game! I have only escaped the lobby and ACTUALLY played the game 2 TIMES, then died right after I got into the game. But during a [u[1-hour session in the LOBBY OF VOID[/u], I'm finding myself with 7 naked men, all of them chose weird body builds (Like big heads and tiny bodies, migets with mucles, EVEN HUGE PEOPLE!), RUNING AROUND, PUNCHING PEOPLE AND DANCING, and talking about "When will the game even start?!"\n\nThe other problem about the lobbies of void is that I don't want to have to join a session with OVER 20 PEOPLE.\n\nNow, here's the problem about THE PLAYERS: After everyone FINALLY BEAMS DOWN ONTO ACTUAL LAND, everyone goes up to the loot and starts chasing other players and killing them. This makes some people get no loot and instantly lose the game. I need the loot, but everytime I try to get some loot, some jerk has to kill me. Not fair, not cool. Nope, not dealing with this. So I just turn away from the loot and ANOTHER PLAYER runs up to me and kills me.\n\nPlus, too many players make a session too long and too hard for new players.\n\n\n0/10 Would rather BUY ARK: SE instead of playing this game fetched from the landfils in [insert country name here]","March 23","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

The game also took over an entire hour to download on my pc. just for perspective, Skyrim took less time than that to download on this pc...and Ark: SOTF isnt even the full 20 dollar game. so relly, just dont even waste your time with this one like I did.\n\nalso, forgot to mention, the whole time i was "playing" the game kept spamming its "you leveled up" song 5 times for every time a person either, left the game, or died, or (of course) whenever you leveled up. which happens a lot. its pretty much constant actually.","March 19","false","0.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

Its not that my PC is bad, its capable of running this, but for some reason, whenever I join a server the game is just black with no display. I can still pause and I've tried changing resolutions and using windowed, etc. And you're practically forced to install a program to play on certain servers, you can play without it, but the game will exit itself offering it.

The idea sounds appealing, but in its current state the implementation fails on virtually every level: from hardware requirements to character creation to team building to gameplay. Teams should be made from lists while in a chatroom setting. Not made by running around a virtual room in the sky trying to create a team. With the extreme graphics required for this game (Low setting recommends GTX 770 with GTX 500 being lowest requirement), character customization should be far more advanced than it currently is. As far as gameplay is concerned, a simple tutorial for new players would go a long way so they don't have to learn on the fly against players who already know the tricks. Lastly, FPS is pitiful in this game and the game should automatically launch on the lowest setting. For unsuspecting new players this game could crash your computer if you simply open it and try to start a match without tweaking graphics options.

Highly unoptimized. You only get 15-30 fps on your $200-$250 graphic card.\nif you're expecting to meet some dinos here, dont even try. All you get to see is BUGS. Thats some dank meta sh*t right there.\nBlackscreen Simulator of 5.000.000 BC\nConclusion: stay away from this toxic devs. The original ARK has been out for almost a year and literally no performance increment. Now they tryna split the game and make one for eSport? 4head KappaPride","March 18","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBALATRON/recommended/407530/","TheBALATRON","BAD LUCK FUCK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBALATRON/","10 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOne of the best and most addicting games I’ve ever played thus far. What ARK: SOTF is to me is a fun and innovative survival game that takes the pvp element to new heights. What makes this game so great is what I call the perfect pvp trifecta: Players, AI, and Environment. Those 3 things combined make or break your experience, they each can help or hinder your gameplay and that to me is what a pvp game should be. What most cool is that you can really step aside form pvp and play the game and survive al in one go.\n\nThere are many pros to this game and as with a game especially an early access there are always some cons.\nRight out the gate I must say my first play through convinced me this game is nearly perfect as is. It was really solid and felt as if it could be ready for its final debut with only a couple of updates. But the more I played I came to the conclusion that some things could be a lot better. Keep in mind this is my opinion and may not be so technical exact or straightforward in regards to the game, but more a wish list of sorts.\n\nSteam does not allow such a long reveiw, so for my full reveiw/wishlist for the game i would highly recommend you check this out! https://creators.co/@TheBlueMarauder/3893350\nIt is very insightful and well written and i hope the developers of the game will also read it. Please if you like it pass it on.","April 30","true","144.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With plenty of tamed dinosaurs and guns all around it becomes a blood bath in the center at the end of it.\n\nPeople complain about it being laggy and saying it runs like ♥♥♥♥ but I think this game runs great While I admit my set up is a very recent build (i7 6700k) my girlfriend is running it on her pc (AMD phenom ii) which is pretty old.","April 18","true","196.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The idea sounds appealing, but in its current state the implementation fails on virtually every level: from hardware requirements to character creation to team building to gameplay. Teams should be made from lists while in a chatroom setting. Not made by running around a virtual room in the sky trying to create a team. With the extreme graphics required for this game (Low setting recommends GTX 770 with GTX 500 being lowest requirement), character customization should be far more advanced than it currently is. As far as gameplay is concerned, a simple tutorial for new players would go a long way so they don't have to learn on the fly against players who already know the tricks. Lastly, FPS is pitiful in this game and the game should automatically launch on the lowest setting. For unsuspecting new players this game could crash your computer if you simply open it and try to start a match without tweaking graphics options. I'll try again in a few months once they've worked out some kinks.","April 2","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Game runs fine with decent hardware. Not sure why people claim "need high-end hardware to get more than 10 fps".\n\ni7-4770K\nGTX 970\nMedium settings 1440p @ 40-60 FPS\n\nThis game is a LOT better the than the original mod from Survival Evolved. Same basic mechanics of course but the developers have been working hard to create a more streamlined experience.\n\n> The new lobby system is much cleaner and makes way more sense than before. Players all join a lobby before entering the floating platform area which is great because it allows players to join matches quicker than before and auto-start the game. Before, some players would take like 3 minutes to join because of HDD speed I suppose and it would slow down the filling of server.\n\n> The game types are nicely balanced having FFA, 2, 4, and 6 player tribe games each with their own time limits and gathering rates.\n\n> The inclusion of stats in this game is a nice touch although it is rather bare at the moment having only wins, kills, deaths, and a general score representing skill level. I would like to see more stats such as kills with weapon type, resources gathered, items crafted, dinos tamed, etc. I'm a nerd for detailed stats.\n\n> One thing that is a little annoying is the absence of a graphical setting limit. Players with high-end computers have to lower settings to minimum just to have a fair chance at spotting other players/dinos. I understand the developers want the game to be accessible to more players but it is a shame because this game looks beautiful at medium and higher settings. People complaining that the game isn't optimized are just crying because they can't play the game with a GTX 950 or Intel iGPU.\n\n> Did I mention the game is Free-to-Play? Sooo why the complaints anyway?\n\nOverall, a great game. This game only has 53% rating (at time of writing) because people "think" devs have moved more focus/effort to this Free-To-Play offshoot of Survival Evolved. Keep in mind Survival Evolved is still in Early Access and they are still improving the game so I don't know why people are complaining.","April 12","true","51.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its like a game maker from Hunger Games colaborated with John Hammond from Jurassic Park. If you play this game you will most likely die in the first minute of every game you play until you develop a strategy.\n\npros:\n-can create player to look like the hunchback from 300\n-you are programed to poop\n-dinos breed like rabbits\n-completely scavangable environment\n\ncons:\n-all players look like they are offspring of Sloth from the goonies "HEY YOU GUYSSS"\n-can poop but not pee\n-dinos are everywhere and eat you\n-can punch trees down (side effect of ARK CO. Steroids)\n\nThe only real complaint I have for this game is the game lobby takes about 5 minutes to even start the game, I dont need 4 minutes to decide how large I want my players feet to be. Being a free to play game makes it a definate try for all those who like adernaline, laughs, and occasional satisfaction.","May 7","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

With plenty of tamed dinosaurs and guns all around it becomes a blood bath in the center at the end of it.\n\nPeople complain about it being laggy and saying it runs like ♥♥♥♥ but I think this game runs great While I admit my set up is a very recent build (i7 6700k) my girlfriend is running it on her pc (AMD phenom ii) which is pretty old.","April 18","true","196.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Anyone who has spent enough time with the normal game understands the groundwork and foundations already present within the game. Optimazation is a key concern but that simple is the case with most Early Acess games.  Expecting a perfect experience while the game is under heavy development is simply foolish and selfish.\n\nI want to also note that a game like H1Z1 now charges for both experiences as people who have never even played the main game can enter in and get to see about of what ARK is about. My advice for anyone coming into this without any playtime in the main game. Give it a download and then have a few games to see what kind of game your in for. There are ways to optimize your game across many rigs but I am not going to state them here. Good luck within the ARK and remember, never stand under a Bronto.","March 25","true","44.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

At this point, I don't even understand why they would bother making a mac client, when it's nearly unplayable. (I doubt the amount of players playing from Mac Pros stationaries will be high...)\n\nBesides that, the first day I downloaded it and wanted to play with a friend, I couldn't. Reason? They had released a new patch for the servers and for the Windows client, but it had not been released for OS X yet, so the multiplayer game I downloaded through steam couldnt even connect to their servers.\n\nThe game itself is very buggy besides. There was a few things (such as trying to draw my own tribe flag), which is a part of the basic UI of the game, which just downright crashes it. Also the game was unable to run in fullscreen mode (only windowed worked), even though I set it to fullscreen (the UI elements became messed up then, and when the battle actually started, it converted back to windowed-mode even though I still had it in in fullscreen mode).\n\nLong story short. Stay a long time away from this. I wasted too much time on it just giving it a chance, because I liked the concept.","April 26","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are plenty of basic tutorials on Youtube or in the Steam Guides for new players to look through, and as long as you have a mid to upper tier gaming PC you should be able to handle it. But any less than that and it might not run (see: poorly optimized).\n\nHaving almost 500 hours in Ark: Survival Evolved, I didn't think SotF would add that much to the base game to cause it to deserve its own application, but looking back I think dividing the games up was a good choice. I'm rambling, but just know that I love this game and recommend it to anyone looking for an intense survival match.","May 12","true","19.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Instead of just surviving and building, "living the life" on a dinosaur island, players are thrust into hunger games style battle where everyone has to fight to the death. The biggest difference between the two games is that in Survival of the Fittest servers and progress is not permanent, it is on a per battle basis from what I can tell.\n\nThis is pretty much where you would go if you wanted to try your hand at "competitive" ARK. There was some shenanigans when the game first came out, everyone is afraid SotF will take away dev time from the main ARK, I dont think it has but I cant be sure as I have not been following it. The game does not run quite as well as ARK: SE, but I still recommend you try ARK: SotF  if you are interested in the ARK games or just looking to try something new.","April 29","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I run this on a gtx 660 and it runs fine on medium settings, both real ark and this. Too be fair though, there are parts of the map which cause fps drops, but usually bounces back up soon after.\n2.Don't be bad\n3.There are guides for a reason. Besides, just play. Like any fps it takes time to get good\n4.Play an updated version of the game. It's in early access, and there are updates constantly. Each time it fixes things and adds new things or mechanics to the game. The game has changed a lot.\n\nLike all games, you aren't good when you first start, unless of course, you are just a natural. However, most people are not a natural, so it takes time to become decent and know what to do. I'm still learning how to play this game, as I am constantly finding new strats and things to help me.

With the insurance money I recieved from the house fire that resulted from the computer exploding, I was able to buy myself a new supercomputer. I live out of my car now because the computer used up all the money that a new house would have cost. But now I get 10,000 fps and the game looks unreal!

It was so exciting to build and at the same time watch your back. I also liked the battles, taming building etc.\n\nBut lately, there have been too much updates that changed the game too much for me. I think the developers team, which is great, listend too much to the (new) community. I think the latest updates made the game too arcade.\nFor example, you used to make your saddles after taming a dino, now it's just there right when you tame it.\n\nAnd even then i could see through it, but what they have done lately is spawning too much Rexes and Spino's through the area. Every battle is just about how much Rexes you've got. I also dont like it that they changed the length of the games. 1 player is great, 2 is also good, but the 4 player should be just 1,5 hour at least.\n\nI'm not a regular survival/build game type, but i was like addicted to this game mode for quite some time. I just reinstalled it and i'm gonna watch if things are better.\n\nStill a great game, but dont change too much i would say.","May 22","true","147.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The satisfation you get from winning is huge because of all the work leading up to that moment and the 1v1 gets my heart beating so fast that it feels like I'm gonna have a heart attack, it's a thrill!!\n\n*THERE IS A HUGE LEARNING CURVE IF YOU NEVER PLAYED ARK* New people wanting to learn should check out YouTube videos of others playing, it really helped me improve my game. You can also search Ark Wiki. I spent hours getting the hang of it since you only get one life per game and for someone new it can get frustrating at times but the fun outweighs that for sure.\n\nThe difficulty makes it all that much satisfying though and I hope they don't make it easy mode to help Bobs out because it WILL RUIN THE GAME!\n\nThe only major issue I have is that the wait time to join is far too long for me. I feel like I spend a third of my time in Lobby/Bubble.\n\nSome things need to be fixed (ELO rating system) but this is still Early Access and updates are being pushed out constantly and I'm happy to help test it!\n\nThe negative reviews you see are from people playing on computers that can't handle the game. With a 980 Ti I run at an average 60 fps on Epic (with shadows on low) Yes it is a demanding game but it also looks great, recently there was an update to help improve FPS for people with low specs.","March 29","true","726.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

For instance, the game gives players a wide variety of strategies to utilize, from crafting high-end weapons to taming dinosaurs. Unfortunately, with the immense size of the arena, encountering players before the final 5-10 minutes is unlikely, unless you know the popular spots on the map. Taming dinos seems to be the best strategy right now, since teching leaves a lot to be desired in terms of equipment. At best, unless a Fabricator is made, you can have a basic shotgun, a basic pistol, and a basic rifle. The equipment degradation on these weapons is perhaps a bit too fast, as it almost forces techers to construct back-up weapons. Crafting ammo also consumes a copious amount of resources, and you can only progress as fast as your forges smelt iron.\n\nOverall, in its current state, I'm iffy on recommending it, but it is free-to-play, so there's nothing to lose should you be interested in a Battle Royale game with dinosaurs.","May 13","false","64.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

There are no purchases in the game, which im very happy about. I cant speak for later on in this game's history, but for now its COMPLETELY free.\nJust very enjoyable, awesome gameplay and the music is really awesome.\nCons:\nIn two of the four games ive played, ive tried to get across a small river. Both times ive been murdered by piranhas that swarm you, and kill you very quickly. This happened both times very early on.\nThe lag issues: Most of the time, especially on ranked servers, I get OK fps. However, the game tends to spike alot, seemingly at random, and when you open your inventory. That is what really annoys me. I have no idea what creates the spikes, because its random.\n\nOther than the random lag spikes ( which i've heard can be fixed)  Survival of The Fittest is an awesome game, and I would definitely recommend it.","March 22","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's very much like "Hunger Games with dinosaurs", which is an often used and quite accurate explanation of the game. In reality it is a spin-off free stand-alone gamemode to ARK: Survival Evolved. For those that enjoy a quick fix of PvP combat without the danger of losing hours of work invested in an aesthetically pleasing base, this is for you.\n\nI really enjoy playing Survival of the Fittest. It could use some work without a doubt, but that doesn't currently impact my enjoyment of the game. Since it's free, I would definitely recommend it. (See below for how one of my typical games go.)\n\nVVVVVVVVVVV\n\n> Select 2-player team lobby\n\n> No one wants to be my friend, so I go solo :(\n\n> Cornucopia is for people with a deathwish, I go foraging to get early levels and gear\n\n> Find a beach near a loot drop\n\n> Kill a two-man tribe by myself, ambushing them without taking a hit to myself\n\n> Build up an army of trikes and ankylos\n\n> Make it in to the top 10 players\n\n> Evolution event: The Beast Within\n\n> Nearby Brontosaurus attack my trike and ankylo army, drawing them far away and eventually killing them\n\n> Get aggroed by a Carnotauros, tranq it and begin to tame it\n\n> Evolution event is still in play, nearby 3 stegosaurs aggro to me\n\n> I die to a swarm of angry stegos.\n\nGG, would die from stupid randomness again.","March 18","true","40.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Keep in mind that this is a Early Acces\nand this means that it is around alpha stage. Also a lot of the comments made on 17 march\nwere on the launchdate of this standalone version. Keep in mind that ARK will update very\nfrequently so multiple fixes will follow each other up soon.\nif you have a decent PC, You could try the following settings:\nUse the following setting for a low end 4GB GPU, if you have a 2GB GPU use\nlower resolution and try to play with the settings while being in spectator mode.\nResolution scale about: <------o---------> or <--------o-------->\nWorld Tile Buffers: High/Epic\nView Distance         High/Epic\nAnti-Aliasing:          Medium\nPost Processing:      Medium\nGeneral Shodows:   Medium\nTerrain Shadows:    Medium\nTextures:                 Medium\nThe game will not look as beatifull as it is but if you try to use the maximum settings in a Alpha state game like\nARK which is a GPU intencive game, you will experience optimalisation issue's for sure.\nIf the settings above didn't help then I'm srry but you're PC isn't good enough for this game (yet).\n\nI hope this helps the most of you guys! Keep the hope up, theire is a really active team working on this game\nso bug fixes and optimalisations will come up soon!\n(I'm sorry if there is bad grammer use of English, It is my second language)","March 18","true","21.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The people who play this nonstop are the only ones that constantly keep winning. I think winning 200 games is a little extreme and there should be alternate methods of earning this skin on the main game. The 0.001% of players who obtain the skin will probably not even play the main game anyway.\nThe idea of the game is nice, But seems like this game is appealing too much to hardcore players maybe streamers.\nThis is definatly not something to casually play with your friends.\nMy negative review comes out of dissapointment not because of the game but the requirement needed to actually obtain something decent in the game. Please do not say "You have to earn something in the game" The purpose of the skin is to be used in the main game. The people who win so much are probably not interested in the main game anyway. The Giganotosauras skin should be SEPERATE from this game and offer the players who achieve the 200 wins something else. Like a skin for a gun, their player or skins for dinos obtained in the actual Survival of the fittest itself. Out of my 20 games i've havent one once and i've never seen anyone with a Giga on this version of the game. I believe the Requirement for this skin is a slap to the face for the Players who play PvE on the main game. Just look at the xbox players they basically get a bionic skin handed to them. Meanwhile PC players are forced to compete on this game for a bionic skin. This is absurd and not very good for the health of the game with 99% of players agreeing about the skin being impossible to obtain.\n\nPersonally, i will be staying away from this game and will stick to the main game. Maybe PvE players should just wait in their bases until some actual eye candy is released for PvE players aside from holiday events.","March 23","false","14.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I played ARK for hours and hours and ended up feeling like the whole thing was pretty pointless. All the servers were filled with RPers, and even the PvP servers were mostly passive. In this mode, though, it's an all-out brawl.\n\nPros:\nFast-paced. No more waiting around for nine hours to tame one stupid Trike. And you get tons of resources from harvesting.\nSkill matters. I'm constantly outplayed by people who know their way around the game, exactly how to aim, where to go to avoid being pursued, that sort of thing.\nQuick matches. I only lasted to the end of a match once, and it was still only like 40 minutes. Most of the time I'm terrible enough to lose in the first 20.\n\nCons:\nBuggy. Nothing that would make me not want to play, but I usually have to restart the client after a match, or it won't let me join a lobby. I've crashed to desktop during a match once.\nLaggy. Again, nothing serious, but it happens from time to time. It helps to filter by server region, something that's not enabled by default.\nIntensive. I have a nice PC with a very good GPU, and I have to put everything on Medium to maintain a stable 60fps. It's nothing like other people are saying, though. Just knock down your settings and you'll be fine.\nWait times. I don't know why there's no "Start" button when a lobby is full. I've seen the timer tick down from 5 minutes only to have half the lobby leave when it reaches a minute because they're impatient.\n\nOverall, very nice for an Early Access title. And, because it's free, there's really no reason not to play. It's a lot of fun.","March 31","true","5.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I played ARK for hours and hours and ended up feeling like the whole thing was pretty pointless. All the servers were filled with RPers, and even the PvP servers were mostly passive. In this mode, though, it's an all-out brawl.\n\nPros:\nFast-paced. No more waiting around for nine hours to tame one stupid Trike. And you get tons of resources from harvesting.\nSkill matters. I'm constantly outplayed by people who know their way around the game, exactly how to aim, where to go to avoid being pursued, that sort of thing.\nQuick matches. I only lasted to the end of a match once, and it was still only like 40 minutes. Most of the time I'm terrible enough to lose in the first 20.\n\nCons:\nBuggy. Nothing that would make me not want to play, but I usually have to restart the client after a match, or it won't let me join a lobby. I've crashed to desktop during a match once.\nLaggy. Again, nothing serious, but it happens from time to time. It helps to filter by server region, something that's not enabled by default.\nIntensive. I have a nice PC with a very good GPU, and I have to put everything on Medium to maintain a stable 60fps. It's nothing like other people are saying, though. Just knock down your settings and you'll be fine.\nWait times. I don't know why there's no "Start" button when a lobby is full. I've seen the timer tick down from 5 minutes only to have half the lobby leave when it reaches a minute because they're impatient.\n\nOverall, very nice for an Early Access title. And, because it's free, there's really no reason not to play. It's a lot of fun.","March 31","true","5.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/campchack/recommended/407530/","campchack","Breezycheeks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/campchack/","45 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI purchased Ark Evolved and played this game through the custom games menu long before it was standalone. Ark Survival of the Fittest more fun and lasting than Ark Survival Evolved, and it is free.\n\nSOTF is 35-minute matches similar to the Hunger Games. Last man standing, everyone starts naked in the middle and gets forced back to middle by the end of the match. This is an eSport game and the top 10 ladder players each month win cash prizes, up to $3500 for being rank #1 and $700 for rank #10 in *each ladder*. There is no cash shop *at all*. It is meant to compete, not to make friends and build a community. It is a "rinse and repeat" game - you start over at level 1 and naked each match.\n\nArk: Survival Evolvedis similar to Rust but with Dinosaurs, however the official servers will never be wiped and there are no plans for new servers anytime soon. This means playing Ark: Survival Evolved is playing at the mercy of the Alpha Tribe who has invested thousands of combined hours to make their bases and their dinosaurs 100% invulnerable to you. The only way to succeed in Evolved as a new player is to farm thousands of cementing paste and buy your way into the Alpha Tribe.\n\nUnless you are a core member of an existing Alpha Tribe I doubt you will play Evolved for more than two weeks. It takes this much time to build the basics, have some fun and realize that everything you do is futile when a single Giga destroys your entire base in seconds.\n\nSurvival of the fittest however has no futile efforts. It is really just a quick competition of your combat prowess and building rotation. I have won as a dino tamer. I have won as a marksman with guns or arrows. I have won games by default because everyone else died. I have won with explosives and with narcotic tripwire. And I have lost many more times again.\n\nI will play Evolved again one day, when more official servers are released. There is no reason to be a slave for an Alpha Tribe when you can carve your own glory, gaining rank and prize money in SOTF.","April 25","true","443.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Instead of free roaming you are forced into a "Hunger Games" set of combat and survival. The map will continously force the players to the center of the map, so there will be a winner.\n\n\nMost of the people giving negative reviews are most likely players who haven't played the original, or their computer isn't strong enough to handle the graphics.\n\nThis game is very fun, and even better with friends or having a team with mics.\n\n","March 20","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It may be free, but it is exactly the same as the original "Ark: Survival Evovled."\nThe only difference is that this is a gamemode created within the game itself. Instead of free roaming you are forced into a "Hunger Games" set of combat and survival. The map will continously force the players to the center of the map, so there will be a winner.\n\n\nMost of the people giving negative reviews are most likely players who haven't played the original, or their computer isn't strong enough to handle the graphics.\n\nThis game is very fun, and even better with friends or having a team with mics.\n\n","March 20","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are no purchases in the game, which im very happy about. I cant speak for later on in this game's history, but for now its COMPLETELY free.\nJust very enjoyable, awesome gameplay and the music is really awesome.\nCons:\nIn two of the four games ive played, ive tried to get across a small river. Both times ive been murdered by piranhas that swarm you, and kill you very quickly. This happened both times very early on.\nThe lag issues: Most of the time, especially on ranked servers, I get OK fps. However, the game tends to spike alot, seemingly at random, and when you open your inventory. That is what really annoys me. I have no idea what creates the spikes, because its random.\n\nOther than the random lag spikes ( which i've heard can be fixed)  Survival of The Fittest is an awesome game, and I would definitely recommend it.","March 22","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Runs like complete **** even on high end machines.  The community that plays this is horrible.  New players are dumped into the game with no tutorial or understanding of what to do.  The developers attempt (very poorly) to manually moderate the game itself by telling people not to do things that ruin the enjoyment for all.\n\n------\n\nSimply put, this game is just terrible.\n\n- Runs like garbage on mid-high end machines unless you turn graphics way down\n- Gameplay is very boring and slow after first hour (assuming you know what you're doing)\n- VERY grindy\n- Gank city!  Enjoy getting killed over and over for almost no reason.  It was bad in the original game but this one is 100x worse (it's supposed to be a fight to the death but it gets stupid really quickly)\n\n- Developers try to moderate the issues by telling players not to do things such as make teams but it's manually enforced so unless they catch you, it's free gank city for most of these "cheater" types.\n\n- This just a modded version of the base game.  It's a kick in the **** to players who paid to suppose the regular game because the "best" version was released for free here.  Sadly, this version is still pretty terrible to say the least.","April 18","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The lumpy, hard, painful to pass kind.\n\nMy rig is well over the recommended specs. Don't trust those when you see them, thinking your mid range or even high end rig will run great and exceed. The lag and slow frame rate were horrid. The controls were clunkier than platform shoes from the 1970's. Both games I did get to play w/o trouble getting into a server I got killed off by laggggggggggg that froze my game up and made the controls unresponsive, while I got stomped by a big, angry Triceratops the first time (because I saw him coming and thank you lagggggg I can't move- and then it comes to and I am dead...), and killed by a one shot that I saw coming but couldn't evade due to being stuck frozen in mid leap.\n\nNO optimization at all. NONE. I can run Subnautica on High (experimental) settings,  40-50+ fps every time with no lag.. This? Had to set to low, then custom settings given to me by a friend just to be able to play at all.

You can up your FPS by entering a line of launch code before you start the game, but even with my 3.8ghz processor, i still seemed to freeze up. However, I'm used to playing video games on a laptop from 2006, because that's what I had to use before I got my beast computer, so I can deal with the freeze-ups. If you're, like I said, able to look past the performance issues, it is a very fun game. Reminds me of my days on a Minecraft Survival Games server. If you're able to get some supplies without anyone killing you immediately, (which isn't very hard, just know when to cut your losses) and actually able to get to the game, it's very interesting and tense to know at any moment, someone or something can just come up and kill you with a few well placed surprise attacks. The sense of helplessness corresponding from this is really what gives this game appeal. I know there are alot of reviews down there saying, "♥♥♥♥ this game, i died before i could get any starter loot" or "game runs like ♥♥♥♥, at least the uninstall button works" but if you give the game a few fair shots, like I did, you can see what this game really has to offer. When I booted up the game, I gave it three good, fairly long matches, (fairly long meaning, I didn't die immeditately and was able to survive for at least 10 minutes) and because I gave it a fair shot, I know I'll be coming back to this game. I don't know for exactly how long, but it'll get a good run.\n\n-6.8/10 Doesn't run the best, but fun nonetheless.\n(hey, that rhymed!)","March 31","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are some bugs that annoy me, but they aren't very "game-breaking". The framerate issues aren't too bad anymore, but it does drop every once in a while which is something they need to fix. Another issue is that the dinos will glitch through your house which will annoy the fu.ck out of you. Dinos also take a while to tame, which isn't a bug but is very annoying. If you overlook these things though you'll have a very fun time playing. The game is bassically The Hunger Games just with dinosaurs which is a W to me, and plus its free to play so theres nothing to lose.\n\n\n**EDIT**: I was straight AAAAAZZZZZZZ when I posted this so dont mind this review.

Poor Performance:  While it is no secret that this game is not fully optimized, I have had no problem running it on my mid-tier computer (Consistant 40fps).  Even on a lower tier computer, simply turning down some settings can easily get you a playable 20fps.\n\n2. Long game wait time: While I agree that they should impliment a force start of some kind, I have only found this to be a problem when you get into the longer matches like 4 and 6 man teams. In free for all, I have never had a problem joining a lobby quickly. It is true that this game has a longer wait time than most, but I think it has been greatly over exaggerated.\n\nFor a Free-For-All game, I estimate the avg. wait time to be 3-5 Minutes\n\nThe wait times increase as you get into larger games simply because there are more players who need to join.I do not think that the wait time is that large a [problem as the matches are fairly long (if you dont die right away), so your lobby time to play time ratio is pretty fair.\n\n\n\n3. Some strats are better than others: Yes this is actually a complaint I saw. What I think they were trying to say was that the strats are unbalanced.\n\nThis is a truth of any game! Some strats will always be better than others, but I thuink so far, Ark has done a pretty good job of keeping the game balanced.\n\nI do not think that there is any one strat that is a guaranteed win, as there is always a way to counter. There is room for improvement in the balancing of strats, but currently I do not see this as so much of a problem\n\n\n\n4. Unfair matchmaking system: The Ark ranking system does not accurately express a players skill, and there are many ways to "grind" to a higher rank.\n\nThis being said, I think that the fact that players can play against the best players in the game is a good thing. The match making system is pretty much just random, so any player can play with any other player unless the lobby leader changes the score requirement.\n\nWhile this may be frustrating at first to new players, it is good that players are constantly playing against people who are better than them at the game, as this helps everyone improve.\n\nIt is always fun to just beat down on some noobs, but playing agaisnt people of all ranges of skill offers the best gameplay experience. A range of skill allows for you to get kills on those who are worse than you, but also keeps players from just winning every game they play.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR This game is not perfect. That being said, it is still in early access and it is evident that the devs are working hard and listening to what people are saying. Many of the "problems" that people have with the game can be easily fixed, or are aspects of the game that just make sense to have.\n\nThis game has a very good concept and while there are some problems that need to be addressed, it is still very fun to play and there are small issues that are worth dealing with.\n\nReal issues:\n\n1. Hackers\n2. Lobby Leaders can't force start\n3. Dinosaurs have a tough time traveling through trees (this is very annoying)\n4. No way to mute people\n5. If I think of any more then I will list them here but hey only 4 issues that pretty goood.","May 14","true","72.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

(and not freemium or any other underhanded buisness model... just free)\nGoing through the other reviews I mostly see people down-rating it for reasons that no longer exist, or more likely, are simply problems on their end.\nThis review system fails to represent the way ARK: SOTF is now.\nIt doesn't help that these alphas get rated as though they're proper final releases.  People need to understand that people using an alpha program are actually supposed to be there to try and break ti however they can, and report the findings.\n\nAnyway that being said, the whole optimization issue is probably the most legitimate negative issue I will give to people's complaints so far.\nBut, I do run it on an Alienware 17 from like 4 years ago that has never been upgraded, I have found a nice medium between graphical settings that still gives me a somewhat pretty world, and hangs between 35-45 fps.  More than enough to play the game well and not have to deal with nauseatingly poor textures and such.\nTheir Dev Jat is very interactive with the community and plays on teams with popular streamers to feed us live information on twitch, which is very comforting.\nShouting out to typeForced to help getting focus onto improving these reviews to reflect more where ARK sits currently.\n\nI would totally recommend this as a playable game to enjoy just for the fun of it, seeing how that's all I do, I'm not really into sending bug reports, but take my hat off to those who do.\nThis is how great games are built, and any exemplary outcome is ALWAYS a long drawn out work in progress, more people just need to understand that.","March 30","true","114.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Secondly i have a decent PC with new graphics card and 8gb ram and there are still some fps issues. Finally the game is not very biginner friendly as it matches up first time players with high rank/win rate players. Overall its not a bad game if you can look past these annoying issues and maybe others that you come up with.","April 1","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was only able to make it into 2 games out of 5 lobbies I entered. Before I even did anything, the game froze and prevented me from doing anything during the first game. During the second game, I finished my character customization, if you can even use that term for the crappy GUI that appeared, and then the game wouldn't spawn my character. Unless the developers can actually make the game work, I would recommend that you don't waste the 42 GB worth of storage involved in downloading this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DankDarko/recommended/407530/","DankDarko","Bakersfield Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DankDarko/","190 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWow, this game was amazing when it was just a mod to the full game but man did they put in some serious work polishing it up. It a very hard game that is very easy to be casual in. So far I have waited at most 5 minutes to get into a game and this was at 4 am cst. Every match was full.\n\n\nThe pro:\n\n\n-Intense hunger games style game mode (don't slack off or you will die right away).\n\n-Way more variants to choose from over the original mod (FFA, 2pl team, 4pl team, 6PL TEAM!)\n\n-gameplay is smooth as butter and your shots (for the most part) hit where they should.\n\n-Start with all engrams unlocked which, imo, is a huge QOL inprovement.\n\n-Winning earns you permanent hats!\n\n-Insane replayability (many different creatures to tame and build your strategy around and the loot drops are always wildly different causing you to change your tactics on the fly).\n\n-Graphics are still as gorgeous as they were on the full game (Im running on medium with no FPS issue whatso every).\n\n-HOLY CRAP THEY FIXED THE LOAD TIMES! For you that didnt play before, it used to take the mod at least 3-5 minutes to load. Now they have a beautiful lobby system in place and the loading on the same hardware is nearly instantanous. HUGE plus in my book.\n\n-FREE!\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n-Undeniably, there is still some compatibility issues. It seems like the better your hardware, the worst the game will run. When I booted up the game I did have to spend about 5 minutes in the settings to tweak it to run smooth (expected from any game let alone one that is Early Access). My reccommendation is to turn sky quality and ground clutter all the way down and then if you still lag, you should start lowering the resolution scale. If it still lagging for you there, then there are more advanced tweaks to use that will adjust the launch commands. Still lagging after that? Your PC is too bad or too good and not optimised for the game (give it a few weeks and come back they are always updating!) For reference, I am running 8gig ram, a GTX750, and an intel i5.\n\n-Many racists and immature children that you have to confront in the lobby and game. While I take a sick pleasure in killing these guys first or stalking them to toy with them, some may be put off by this. Remember this is a mod and there is no moderation unless you go on the unofficial servers.\n\n-Ingame chat (both voice and text) is lacking. Not the biggest of issues because Discord is almost always better anyways.\n\n\nOverall, I am very shocked and pleased with how this mod came out in the standalone version. I would have payed again for it, tbh. It is that good and only going to get better. The fact that they just decided to release it for free and do a huge tourney is just amazing. I really hope they continue to optimize the game so that more can play and that they continue to add QOL features. As far as the content already in is concerned, its nearly flawless (compared to how it was 6 months ago).\n\nGreat game...would take a venom arrow to the head and pass out again... 8.5/10 (and could be an easy 9-9.5 with the cons fixed up).","April 1","true","35.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I was having some graphical issues with the game and I was having a lot of crashes as well, but once I got those resolved, the game has been running very smoothly.

The game is very addictive though, but the more I play it the more I unlike it.\n\nThis is kinda screwed up. No matter how good my armor or my weapons are I can't win. Only getting armor and dinos will probably work. Weapons are only good against players and not against dinos. The game shouldn't be a game where you just sit in the dinos like a ♥♥♥, I want to play a game where it is more about getting good stuff and battleing player-player.\n\nBut on the other hand the weapons are way too strong against other players. A longneck rifle can one-shot an enemy player. And a simple bow with tranq arrows can raise the torpor really quickly.\n\nI think the SOTF idea is good. But combining it with ARK makes it harder to play. My computer is not so good but I need some quality to see the enemies on long range. I have around 25 fps but it drops some times, especially in combat wich sucks. The game shouldn't be about having a good computer. Even though my computer is that bad it wasn't dirt cheap. Even with overclocking I don't have enough fps. The fps drops may also be CPU related. My 4 core 3.7 GHz CPU should be enough but it isn't.\n\nThere are some other tasks in the background that takes CPU power:\nSteam, Skype (not really needed, but if you are playing with friends it's good), some windows tasks and other stuff.\n\nIt might also be hard drive and ram related but I don't think they make the worst problems.\n\nThis game is early access though, I'd really like to play it when it's done but not right now.","April 22","false","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As of right now, there are no official servers in the unranked game mode so it can be difficult to find a game. It took me about an hour to get into an actual game.\n\nParticularly for those of us in the Oceania region, most populated servers are over 250 ping. And we all know how laggy that would be.\n\nOn the plus side; it is a fun, fast paced version of the original game with a hunger games feel to it. And FPS are still pretty solid, even on random dinosaur drops.\n\nAs it stands currently, until there are offical servers I cant reccommend this game for anyone in the Oceania region for the simple fact that we shouldnt have to wait an hour to play a single 45 minute game (which generally doesnt last that long anyway)","March 18","false","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

But the thing that can make the game no fun is the world border moves SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fast imagine this, your trying to tame a spino and you lose your stego knocking it out stupid turtles attack the spino so you attack them you let them chase you untill they stop agroing you, your spino hasn't been eating anything and it's torpor is almost down then you have 30 seconds to get our of the so called, ring of death, you feed it narco berries and then run you waste all your stamina TWICH before you almost get out, btw 143.5 stamina yeah twich that's just stupid.  I still like it, I just refuse to play anymore of it untill the world border speed is turned down, or the time lemit, which will lower the border speed.  So I hope you get this after playing, IDK how pepole tame spinos in this game, it just doesn't make since to lose all the time because of world border/ring of death.  Can sombody tell me how every youtuber plays on a server with 1 hour and 30 minute games and having a taming speed faster than a fat kid can eat a peice of cake.  What I do like about it is the way the cosmetics work, instead of having to buy items on a store or, finding them by playing more often, you get it from winning games and playing (but it's more rare than some game like TF2) so I do like this game I just wish I could play without dying because of ring of death or game freezing and then unfreezing with a giant spear in you head.  So if you want to play go ahead it's fun just beware of the world border.","April 24","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was only able to make it into 2 games out of 5 lobbies I entered. Before I even did anything, the game froze and prevented me from doing anything during the first game. During the second game, I finished my character customization, if you can even use that term for the crappy GUI that appeared, and then the game wouldn't spawn my character. Unless the developers can actually make the game work, I would recommend that you don't waste the 42 GB worth of storage involved in downloading this game. In all seriousness, getting a blue screen of death is more entertaining than this lump of code that doesn't even deserve to be called a program.","April 15","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I once had 3 spears break in a row after striking a small dino 4 times.\n\nhaving the game graphics on a higher setting can cause severe FPS issues. This isnt an issue with my PC but rather the servers\n\nmaps should display your exact location and your allies' too. It is way to easy to get separated in the dark or in jungles.\n\nThe death barrier, although being a good idea, is annoying when you get to the finale in the centre, meaning players with knockback dinos like the trike or the Yeti (Not its real name but it represents one heavily) can knock you out the arena, meaning you die a very underwhelming death after grinding for 30 mins - 2 hours.\n\nsometimes events like harvest famine last way too long and basically make it impossible to do anything, especially if it happens twice in a row.\n\nstarvation and dehydration occur way to quickly on the 4 and 6 player tribe game modes.\n\ncarniverous dinosaurs take almost 10 - 20 minutes to tame unless you sit there and spam kill other dinosaurs to get prime meat, and the glitchy physics and stupid AI of them mean they can get stuck behind small rocks and sometimes wont even bother to find a route to you and will sit there and perform an uphill treadmill while you get ripped to shreds by a pro player who has half the maps population of dinosaurs behind him.\n\nthis game is great for players who work as a team, providing they COMMUNICATE which is nearly impossible as I usually end up as the only English speaking player in the entire lobby...\n\nIf you dont mind the long grind, the dodgy and glitchy physics and the mic spam at the start of every game from the 12 year olds who got a mic for christmas then this game is for you!\n","April 8","true","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the thing that can make the game no fun is the world border moves SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fast imagine this, your trying to tame a spino and you lose your stego knocking it out stupid turtles attack the spino so you attack them you let them chase you untill they stop agroing you, your spino hasn't been eating anything and it's torpor is almost down then you have 30 seconds to get our of the so called, ring of death, you feed it narco berries and then run you waste all your stamina TWICH before you almost get out, btw 143.5 stamina yeah twich that's just stupid.  I still like it, I just refuse to play anymore of it untill the world border speed is turned down, or the time lemit, which will lower the border speed.  So I hope you get this after playing, IDK how pepole tame spinos in this game, it just doesn't make since to lose all the time because of world border/ring of death.  Can sombody tell me how every youtuber plays on a server with 1 hour and 30 minute games and having a taming speed faster than a fat kid can eat a peice of cake.  What I do like about it is the way the cosmetics work, instead of having to buy items on a store or, finding them by playing more often, you get it from winning games and playing (but it's more rare than some game like TF2) so I do like this game I just wish I could play without dying because of ring of death or game freezing and then unfreezing with a giant spear in you head.  So if you want to play go ahead it's fun just beware of the world border.","April 24","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DankDarko/recommended/407530/","DankDarko","Bakersfield Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DankDarko/","190 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWow, this game was amazing when it was just a mod to the full game but man did they put in some serious work polishing it up. It a very hard game that is very easy to be casual in. So far I have waited at most 5 minutes to get into a game and this was at 4 am cst. Every match was full.\n\n\nThe pro:\n\n\n-Intense hunger games style game mode (don't slack off or you will die right away).\n\n-Way more variants to choose from over the original mod (FFA, 2pl team, 4pl team, 6PL TEAM!)\n\n-gameplay is smooth as butter and your shots (for the most part) hit where they should.\n\n-Start with all engrams unlocked which, imo, is a huge QOL inprovement.\n\n-Winning earns you permanent hats!\n\n-Insane replayability (many different creatures to tame and build your strategy around and the loot drops are always wildly different causing you to change your tactics on the fly).\n\n-Graphics are still as gorgeous as they were on the full game (Im running on medium with no FPS issue whatso every).\n\n-HOLY CRAP THEY FIXED THE LOAD TIMES! For you that didnt play before, it used to take the mod at least 3-5 minutes to load. Now they have a beautiful lobby system in place and the loading on the same hardware is nearly instantanous. HUGE plus in my book.\n\n-FREE!\n\n\nCons:\n\n\n-Undeniably, there is still some compatibility issues. It seems like the better your hardware, the worst the game will run. When I booted up the game I did have to spend about 5 minutes in the settings to tweak it to run smooth (expected from any game let alone one that is Early Access). My reccommendation is to turn sky quality and ground clutter all the way down and then if you still lag, you should start lowering the resolution scale. If it still lagging for you there, then there are more advanced tweaks to use that will adjust the launch commands. Still lagging after that? Your PC is too bad or too good and not optimised for the game (give it a few weeks and come back they are always updating!) For reference, I am running 8gig ram, a GTX750, and an intel i5.\n\n-Many racists and immature children that you have to confront in the lobby and game. While I take a sick pleasure in killing these guys first or stalking them to toy with them, some may be put off by this. Remember this is a mod and there is no moderation unless you go on the unofficial servers.\n\n-Ingame chat (both voice and text) is lacking. Not the biggest of issues because Discord is almost always better anyways.\n\n\nOverall, I am very shocked and pleased with how this mod came out in the standalone version. I would have payed again for it, tbh. It is that good and only going to get better. The fact that they just decided to release it for free and do a huge tourney is just amazing. I really hope they continue to optimize the game so that more can play and that they continue to add QOL features. As far as the content already in is concerned, its nearly flawless (compared to how it was 6 months ago).\n\nGreat game...would take a venom arrow to the head and pass out again... 8.5/10 (and could be an easy 9-9.5 with the cons fixed up).","April 1","true","35.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I Already wanted ARK but when this game came out I wanted to test how well it would run and it did lag. Alot. But very soon it worked and I was amazed and am definitley getting ARK! THIS IS NOT A SCAM! I thought it would be a scam since it is free but I was COMPLETELY wrong! My only cons about this game is the occasional lag and the meganeura. The lag gets better the more I play. The meganeura is an ingame creature that is basically a giant wasp. They come in MASSIVE swarms and kill me 9/10 times. Usually on beaches.

At this point, I don't even understand why they would bother making a mac client, when it's nearly unplayable. (I doubt the amount of players playing from Mac Pros stationaries will be high...)\n\nBesides that, the first day I downloaded it and wanted to play with a friend, I couldn't. Reason? They had released a new patch for the servers and for the Windows client, but it had not been released for OS X yet, so the multiplayer game I downloaded through steam couldnt even connect to their servers.\n\nThe game itself is very buggy besides. There was a few things (such as trying to draw my own tribe flag), which is a part of the basic UI of the game, which just downright crashes it. Also the game was unable to run in fullscreen mode (only windowed worked), even though I set it to fullscreen (the UI elements became messed up then, and when the battle actually started, it converted back to windowed-mode even though I still had it in in fullscreen mode).\n\nLong story short. Stay a long time away from this. I wasted too much time on it just giving it a chance, because I liked the concept.","April 26","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm glad I didn't spend money, if I did I would get a refund. if you had to buy this game and it had a demo I'd say try the demo to see if it'll even run first.","March 31","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","1","3","2","0"

I run this on a gtx 660 and it runs fine on medium settings, both real ark and this. Too be fair though, there are parts of the map which cause fps drops, but usually bounces back up soon after.\n2.Don't be bad\n3.There are guides for a reason. Besides, just play. Like any fps it takes time to get good\n4.Play an updated version of the game. It's in early access, and there are updates constantly. Each time it fixes things and adds new things or mechanics to the game. The game has changed a lot.\n\nLike all games, you aren't good when you first start, unless of course, you are just a natural. However, most people are not a natural, so it takes time to become decent and know what to do. I'm still learning how to play this game, as I am constantly finding new strats and things to help me. Read/watch guides.\n\nI wrote this review as nearly all of the negative reviews are garbage and bogus.","June 3","true","162.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","1","3","3","0"

I've enjoyed every single match I've played so far even if I died in the first fifteen minutes. I was having some graphical issues with the game and I was having a lot of crashes as well, but once I got those resolved, the game has been running very smoothly.

It's very much like "Hunger Games with dinosaurs", which is an often used and quite accurate explanation of the game. In reality it is a spin-off free stand-alone gamemode to ARK: Survival Evolved. For those that enjoy a quick fix of PvP combat without the danger of losing hours of work invested in an aesthetically pleasing base, this is for you.\n\nI really enjoy playing Survival of the Fittest. It could use some work without a doubt, but that doesn't currently impact my enjoyment of the game. Since it's free, I would definitely recommend it.

But, of course the first thing that I did upon opening the game was go straight to theoptions to set the resolution to 1920 x1080. This now has me zoomed in, So i can not even see or click the apply buttons. o-o If anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this, please tell me! I have already deleted the game and redownloaded it, I have also tried altering the resolution in the Steam launch settings, but this also bore no fruit.

It's like playing a MOBA, but instead of killing things and getting gold to buy items, you get to harvest materials and craft the items you want.  Last game some dude holed up in a corner and mined enough metal to build a pistol and killed me and my bow and arrow with it.  Also dinosaurs.  Way better than lane minions.  And more heartbreaking.  It's amazing how attached you can get to a bit of computer programming in 5 minutes in game.\n\nGreat game!\n\nedit: including my specs since that seems to be a big deal.\n\ni7-5500U\n8GB RAM\nNvidia GeForce 940M\n\nMy laptop isn't a fantastic gaming machine, so I turn the graphics down a little bit.

Keep in mind that this is a Early Acces\nand this means that it is around alpha stage. Also a lot of the comments made on 17 march\nwere on the launchdate of this standalone version. Keep in mind that ARK will update very\nfrequently so multiple fixes will follow each other up soon.\nif you have a decent PC, You could try the following settings:\nUse the following setting for a low end 4GB GPU, if you have a 2GB GPU use\nlower resolution and try to play with the settings while being in spectator mode.\nResolution scale about: <------o---------> or <--------o-------->\nWorld Tile Buffers: High/Epic\nView Distance         High/Epic\nAnti-Aliasing:          Medium\nPost Processing:      Medium\nGeneral Shodows:   Medium\nTerrain Shadows:    Medium\nTextures:                 Medium\nThe game will not look as beatifull as it is but if you try to use the maximum settings in a Alpha state game like\nARK which is a GPU intencive game, you will experience optimalisation issue's for sure.\nIf the settings above didn't help then I'm srry but you're PC isn't good enough for this game (yet).\n\nI hope this helps the most of you guys! Keep the hope up, theire is a really active team working on this game\nso bug fixes and optimalisations will come up soon!\n(I'm sorry if there is bad grammer use of English, It is my second language)","March 18","true","21.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's got a long way from completion but atm it's still really fun (even though it does have a lot of optimization problems for lower pc's im gonna be honest my pc costs 2K and still can't run it all on high).","March 20","true","47.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It may be free, but it is exactly the same as the original "Ark: Survival Evovled."\nThe only difference is that this is a gamemode created within the game itself. Instead of free roaming you are forced into a "Hunger Games" set of combat and survival. The map will continously force the players to the center of the map, so there will be a winner.\n\n\nMost of the people giving negative reviews are most likely players who haven't played the original, or their computer isn't strong enough to handle the graphics.\n\nThis game is very fun, and even better with friends or having a team with mics.\n\n","March 20","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are no purchases in the game, which im very happy about. I cant speak for later on in this game's history, but for now its COMPLETELY free.\nJust very enjoyable, awesome gameplay and the music is really awesome.\nCons:\nIn two of the four games ive played, ive tried to get across a small river. Both times ive been murdered by piranhas that swarm you, and kill you very quickly. This happened both times very early on.\nThe lag issues: Most of the time, especially on ranked servers, I get OK fps. However, the game tends to spike alot, seemingly at random, and when you open your inventory. That is what really annoys me. I have no idea what creates the spikes, because its random.\n\nOther than the random lag spikes ( which i've heard can be fixed)  Survival of The Fittest is an awesome game, and I would definitely recommend it.","March 22","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(and not freemium or any other underhanded buisness model... just free)\nGoing through the other reviews I mostly see people down-rating it for reasons that no longer exist, or more likely, are simply problems on their end.\nThis review system fails to represent the way ARK: SOTF is now.\nIt doesn't help that these alphas get rated as though they're proper final releases.  People need to understand that people using an alpha program are actually supposed to be there to try and break ti however they can, and report the findings.\n\nAnyway that being said, the whole optimization issue is probably the most legitimate negative issue I will give to people's complaints so far.\nBut, I do run it on an Alienware 17 from like 4 years ago that has never been upgraded, I have found a nice medium between graphical settings that still gives me a somewhat pretty world, and hangs between 35-45 fps.  More than enough to play the game well and not have to deal with nauseatingly poor textures and such.\nTheir Dev Jat is very interactive with the community and plays on teams with popular streamers to feed us live information on twitch, which is very comforting.\nShouting out to typeForced to help getting focus onto improving these reviews to reflect more where ARK sits currently.\n\nI would totally recommend this as a playable game to enjoy just for the fun of it, seeing how that's all I do, I'm not really into sending bug reports, but take my hat off to those who do.\nThis is how great games are built, and any exemplary outcome is ALWAYS a long drawn out work in progress, more people just need to understand that.","March 30","true","114.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But, of course the first thing that I did upon opening the game was go straight to theoptions to set the resolution to 1920 x1080. This now has me zoomed in, So i can not even see or click the apply buttons. o-o If anyone has any suggestions on how to fix this, please tell me! I have already deleted the game and redownloaded it, I have also tried altering the resolution in the Steam launch settings, but this also bore no fruit.

For a base game that is still in Alpha, Ark and Wildcard have been doing great work. Constant updates, no stale energy from the devs or the community, and now we have a free, standalone Survival of the Fittest game.\nOk, it's full of noobs, and Bobs and Joes and lots of people that have never played and don't own Ark Survival Evolved, but that's ok. I'm not rating the people. I'm rating the game, which is addictively fun.

The game is very addictive though, but the more I play it the more I unlike it.\n\nThis is kinda screwed up. No matter how good my armor or my weapons are I can't win. Only getting armor and dinos will probably work. Weapons are only good against players and not against dinos. The game shouldn't be a game where you just sit in the dinos like a ♥♥♥, I want to play a game where it is more about getting good stuff and battleing player-player.\n\nBut on the other hand the weapons are way too strong against other players. A longneck rifle can one-shot an enemy player. And a simple bow with tranq arrows can raise the torpor really quickly.\n\nI think the SOTF idea is good. But combining it with ARK makes it harder to play. My computer is not so good but I need some quality to see the enemies on long range. I have around 25 fps but it drops some times, especially in combat wich sucks. The game shouldn't be about having a good computer. Even though my computer is that bad it wasn't dirt cheap. Even with overclocking I don't have enough fps. The fps drops may also be CPU related. My 4 core 3.7 GHz CPU should be enough but it isn't.\n\nThere are some other tasks in the background that takes CPU power:\nSteam, Skype (not really needed, but if you are playing with friends it's good), some windows tasks and other stuff.\n\nIt might also be hard drive and ram related but I don't think they make the worst problems.\n\nThis game is early access though, I'd really like to play it when it's done but not right now.","April 22","false","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I Already wanted ARK but when this game came out I wanted to test how well it would run and it did lag. Alot. But very soon it worked and I was amazed and am definitley getting ARK! THIS IS NOT A SCAM! I thought it would be a scam since it is free but I was COMPLETELY wrong! My only cons about this game is the occasional lag and the meganeura. The lag gets better the more I play. The meganeura is an ingame creature that is basically a giant wasp. They come in MASSIVE swarms and kill me 9/10 times. Usually on beaches. Over all though I LOVE the game and can't wait to get ARK: Survial Evolved!","April 29","true","16.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

But the thing that can make the game no fun is the world border moves SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fast imagine this, your trying to tame a spino and you lose your stego knocking it out stupid turtles attack the spino so you attack them you let them chase you untill they stop agroing you, your spino hasn't been eating anything and it's torpor is almost down then you have 30 seconds to get our of the so called, ring of death, you feed it narco berries and then run you waste all your stamina TWICH before you almost get out, btw 143.5 stamina yeah twich that's just stupid.  I still like it, I just refuse to play anymore of it untill the world border speed is turned down, or the time lemit, which will lower the border speed.  So I hope you get this after playing, IDK how pepole tame spinos in this game, it just doesn't make since to lose all the time because of world border/ring of death.  Can sombody tell me how every youtuber plays on a server with 1 hour and 30 minute games and having a taming speed faster than a fat kid can eat a peice of cake.  What I do like about it is the way the cosmetics work, instead of having to buy items on a store or, finding them by playing more often, you get it from winning games and playing (but it's more rare than some game like TF2) so I do like this game I just wish I could play without dying because of ring of death or game freezing and then unfreezing with a giant spear in you head.  So if you want to play go ahead it's fun just beware of the world border.","April 24","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was only able to make it into 2 games out of 5 lobbies I entered. Before I even did anything, the game froze and prevented me from doing anything during the first game. During the second game, I finished my character customization, if you can even use that term for the crappy GUI that appeared, and then the game wouldn't spawn my character. Unless the developers can actually make the game work, I would recommend that you don't waste the 42 GB worth of storage involved in downloading this game.

I once had 3 spears break in a row after striking a small dino 4 times.\n\nhaving the game graphics on a higher setting can cause severe FPS issues. This isnt an issue with my PC but rather the servers\n\nmaps should display your exact location and your allies' too. It is way to easy to get separated in the dark or in jungles.\n\nThe death barrier, although being a good idea, is annoying when you get to the finale in the centre, meaning players with knockback dinos like the trike or the Yeti (Not its real name but it represents one heavily) can knock you out the arena, meaning you die a very underwhelming death after grinding for 30 mins - 2 hours.\n\nsometimes events like harvest famine last way too long and basically make it impossible to do anything, especially if it happens twice in a row.\n\nstarvation and dehydration occur way to quickly on the 4 and 6 player tribe game modes.\n\ncarniverous dinosaurs take almost 10 - 20 minutes to tame unless you sit there and spam kill other dinosaurs to get prime meat, and the glitchy physics and stupid AI of them mean they can get stuck behind small rocks and sometimes wont even bother to find a route to you and will sit there and perform an uphill treadmill while you get ripped to shreds by a pro player who has half the maps population of dinosaurs behind him.\n\nthis game is great for players who work as a team, providing they COMMUNICATE which is nearly impossible as I usually end up as the only English speaking player in the entire lobby...\n\nIf you dont mind the long grind, the dodgy and glitchy physics and the mic spam at the start of every game from the 12 year olds who got a mic for christmas then this game is for you!\n","April 8","true","18.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the thing that can make the game no fun is the world border moves SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fast imagine this, your trying to tame a spino and you lose your stego knocking it out stupid turtles attack the spino so you attack them you let them chase you untill they stop agroing you, your spino hasn't been eating anything and it's torpor is almost down then you have 30 seconds to get our of the so called, ring of death, you feed it narco berries and then run you waste all your stamina TWICH before you almost get out, btw 143.5 stamina yeah twich that's just stupid.  I still like it, I just refuse to play anymore of it untill the world border speed is turned down, or the time lemit, which will lower the border speed.  So I hope you get this after playing, IDK how pepole tame spinos in this game, it just doesn't make since to lose all the time because of world border/ring of death.  Can sombody tell me how every youtuber plays on a server with 1 hour and 30 minute games and having a taming speed faster than a fat kid can eat a peice of cake.  What I do like about it is the way the cosmetics work, instead of having to buy items on a store or, finding them by playing more often, you get it from winning games and playing (but it's more rare than some game like TF2) so I do like this game I just wish I could play without dying because of ring of death or game freezing and then unfreezing with a giant spear in you head.  So if you want to play go ahead it's fun just beware of the world border.","April 24","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is very addictive though, but the more I play it the more I unlike it.\n\nThis is kinda screwed up. No matter how good my armor or my weapons are I can't win. Only getting armor and dinos will probably work. Weapons are only good against players and not against dinos. The game shouldn't be a game where you just sit in the dinos like a ♥♥♥, I want to play a game where it is more about getting good stuff and battleing player-player.\n\nBut on the other hand the weapons are way too strong against other players. A longneck rifle can one-shot an enemy player. And a simple bow with tranq arrows can raise the torpor really quickly.\n\nI think the SOTF idea is good. But combining it with ARK makes it harder to play. My computer is not so good but I need some quality to see the enemies on long range. I have around 25 fps but it drops some times, especially in combat wich sucks. The game shouldn't be about having a good computer. Even though my computer is that bad it wasn't dirt cheap. Even with overclocking I don't have enough fps. The fps drops may also be CPU related. My 4 core 3.7 GHz CPU should be enough but it isn't.\n\nThere are some other tasks in the background that takes CPU power:\nSteam, Skype (not really needed, but if you are playing with friends it's good), some windows tasks and other stuff.\n\nIt might also be hard drive and ram related but I don't think they make the worst problems.\n\nThis game is early access though, I'd really like to play it when it's done but not right now.","April 22","false","15.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
