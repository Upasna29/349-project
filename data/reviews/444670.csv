Really fun, furious futuristic racing with a brilliant twist. Colourful graphics, great soundtrack, a promising start.\n\nThe gameplay is tricky without being infuriating. You can ease yourself into the flow of the game with various options that make things a little more forgiving; The AI and tracks have variable difficulty. Create the race you want.\n\nWhat sets this out from other future racers? Procedurally generated tracks, vertical shortcuts and GIANT SPACE BALLS. That's the genius of it. Can't wait to see what's next for the game. *FIRST IMPRESSIONS VIDEO BELOW...*\n\nhttps://youtu.be/k6tfMPHNKWo","May 11","true","0.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Tracks are incredibly twisty, turny and bumpy. They remind me of audiosurf tracks, or rainbow road from Mario kart. Racing down these is a blast.\n\nEven cooler though, is that you have the ability to roll off of these tracks and skip ahead. Since the tracks are constantly going downwards, you can simply fly off of the edge and land somewhere below. You have a set amount of time to do this, or else you'll respawn back at the last gate you past through. This adds a great risk, great reward mechanic in the game, where skipping ahead could gain you the lead, but not timing the jump properly could cause you to fall behind.\n\nThere are multiple gates throughout the levels, that once you go through serve as a checkpoint, and will fill your boost meter. You may use this boost while racing down the road, or falling through the air to make sure you land back on the road in time before you respawn.\n\nThere are a decent amount of game modes to keep you interested.\n\nThere's the basic racing mode where you can customize the amount of local players, AI difficulty, track length, track complexity and the environment look. There are currently only 2 environments as of the time I'm writing this review. It's not important that there aren't many, as they're completely cosmetic, but I like that the option is there. They give the game a fresh look every new race.\n\nThere's also a survival mode where you don't get any respawns, and simply try to go as far as possible without dying.\n\nThe time gate mode has a timer constantly ticking down to zero, and you are required to go through a special type of gate in order to gain some time back.\n\nCurrently both of those game modes are singleplayer only, so I would really love if more players would be able to play those together in the future.\n\nThere is a career mode and online mode currently under construction, but I can't comment on them as they aren't available in the current build I'm playing.\n\nI'm very happy to see that the game gives you a lot of graphical options to tweak, which is very nice. Sadly, on the other hand the game doesn't control as well as it should with PC controls. Playing the game itself is fine with a controller or keyboard, but the menus are SLIGHTLY frustrating to maneuver. There's no mouse support in the main menu, which can be annoying. I'm hoping the simple stuff like that will be fixed, because I don't really have any problems with the game itself.\n\nIt's a great idea for a game, well executed, and I honestly can't wait to see the online mode available. The music is some pretty decent techno to get you into the moment, and compliments the look of the world quite well.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun, and unique idea for a racing game!","May 16","true","1.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

I miss the old days of having friends over and raging over a game of Mario Kart!!!\n\nThe Pros:\nI LOVE cheating!\nGreat Graphics\nRequires thinking ahead, and the tracks are randomized every time.\nControls are intuitive and easy to learn (I played with a controller)\nWould make a great party / drinking game\nVery fun, and skill pays off.\nThe music is great, although not many tracks.\n\nThe Cons:(There really arent too many.)\n\nFew levels to choose from (I'm sure this will change soon)\nBouncing can sometimes be unpredictable, but hey. tough luck, STOP CHEATIN!\nNo online play as of now.\n\nOnce this game is finished I believe it will be, and should be in every competitive online players arsenal.\n\nIf you liked this review, Sub to my page! I review all sorts of new games!!! Thanks! =)","May 11","true","0.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You race down a winding path with no edges and attempt to get down the farthest or the fastest (depending on mode)... to do that youll be flinging yourself off the edges and aiming for the track below to gain a huge advantage. They balance this by allowing you only 5 seconds off the track, meaning you have to pick your shortcuts carefully.\n\nThis game is VERY early access at the time of this review, with online multiplayer and career mode being absent. The modes and local multiplayer it does offer though I do feel justifies the price.\n\nSurvival mode is much like the iOS orginal in that you are just trying to get the farthest down the hill,  speed isnt a factor. This mode is great for high score challenges with friends.\n\nRacing mode is a new addition, and like the name suggests youre racing down a predetermined length course against ai or local opponets. When online multiplayer is completed I expect this to be the main mode I play.\n\nAnd time atack mode, which has you going through gates every 10 check points to gain more time to go farther. In my opinion this mode goes against the spirit of the game but it does offer an interesting challenge as the check points get farther and farther away.\n\nAll in all its far superior to its iOS counterpart, the controller support alone accomplishes that. A game where you spot your landing like this just doesnt work great when youre tilting your screen around. At 8 bucks I feel like there is enough there right now to justify the purchase, but waiting for updates and a sale may be your best bet if you arent sure from the trailer and this review.","May 11","true","0.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At this price of $8.50 it's ok to buy it but the game itself feels empty, there is so much stuff to be added and that's why this is on Early Access. Things like more sound effects and music (main menu doesn't have music), an exit button (you have to press alt+f4 to close the game). Everything else it's good, the game just came out a few hours ago and I really wanted to buy this. Online multiplayer it's coming soon so you should buy it to practice the mechanics of the game.","May 11","true","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have not played it with friends yet but I'm looking forward to a play session full of screaming and rediculous actions.","May 13","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is common that what is shown in trailers and in description is vague, but what you see is what you get. Crazy steering, a good balance between luck and execution, competitive in the best way, where even the 8th place scrub can come in at first if they execute a great move.\n\nThis will be amazing with friends, where even skilled players can be beat by their scrubby friends, and for good reasons.\n\nA true gem, worth its pricetag, and I can't wait until the new content comes out.","May 23","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
