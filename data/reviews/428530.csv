It runs like Contra or Bionic Commando. To me, it’s the kind of game you sit down and stream to your tv and pull out a couple controllers and a couple beers with your bud and enjoy a low-stress goofy ‘splosion game. For it’s price, it’s worth its salt.\n\nI've placed my first gameplay footage into the videos section tied to this game.","February 27","true","0.3"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","14","21","3","0"

The hand drawn graphics are crisp and easy on the eyes, nothing is too hard to see when it's coming at you.  The music is excellent, totally gets me jacked and ready for the day.  3 different game modes was a good touch, and real helpful for when you're awful and die a lot (like me).  Definitely a game that will be great for killing time.","February 27","true","0.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Once I actually read the light-hearted, silly humour of the level objectives, and heard the "voice acting", I'll have say, although very short, at least it's a solid, working game and not an Early Access cancer destined to die before birth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3gMUGsWJc4&list=PL3gilQXLG8aDbeSGGUENLz-knPJWUAbGE&index=15","May 3","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/428530/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","The Runs\n\nI've taken a well-deserved hiatus from writing recently to settle into my day job, enjoy time with friends and family, and to play more Counter Strike than is healthy. The stresses of writing and communicating with third-parties was beginning to take its toll on me, making an otherwise fun hobby a slog. Having had enough of that, and yearning to get back into writing I opened my bursting mailbox (I will get to all of you BTW) and plucked out the first game that caught my eye. "It couldn't possibly be as bad as it looks" I thought. Oh, boy, was I wrong.\n\nMachine Gun Train Run harks back to a simpler time when side-scrolling shooters, like the legendary Contra, were ten a penny. You're cast as either the Red Guy or the Blue Guy, and are hot on the trails of an evil, train-robbing organisation called "A.S.S.H.A.T". Such humour...\n\nTrain Run is a mindless, side-scrolling shooter featuring forgettable enemies, forgettable music, forgettable "story" and forgettable art. It's a completely bland and anaemic take on a classic genre, and has the audacity to ape its contemporaries, without having made even a modicum of effort to entitle it to do so.\n\nThe entire game is a bit of a joke, you see, and one that is incredibly self-aware, at that. Everything from the "hand drawn" Microsoft Paint styled art assets, to the tiresome linear design, and even the uninspired and dim-witted AI shows how little care has gone into creating this game.\n\nShooting wave after wave of enemy scum is the most basic joy a gamer can have, but Machine Gun Train Run makes it positively tiresome. Enemies are brainless and can only fire from the direction they are facing, their movement patterns are predictable and easy to avoid; they're just entirely unremarkable. Things get no better in two-player either.\n\nInstead of only one person disinterestedly mowing down waves of enemies, you'll have two. So that's double your boredom, folks. Friends don't let friends play bad games. Remember that.\n\nThere's limited enjoyment to be had from a game that offers no carrot at the end of its stick. Don't expect any upgrades, guns or incentives to tide you through the game's short campaign - there are none. Playing through the first level pretty much exposes you to every trick the game has up its sleeve, and both my friend and me had reached our breaking point with Train Run long before the last stage.\n\nThe game seems to be reviewing quite favourably on Steam, but I'd urge caution: there are far more enjoyable experiences out there that don't cost £4. Poking yourself in the eye with a stick is a great example.\n\n\n","March 7","false","1.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I like that it isn't too challenging, yet not too easy. I'm not very good at 2D shooters so this balance keeps me coming back for more. It's a great game if you just want to shoot some enemies and chill out. The visuals are colorful and inviting, which is nice, because it allows you to focus on what is happening on the screen.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys 2D shooters.","February 28","true","1.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Fun visuals and great audio, escpecially the "un-pause!".  As someone that is not the best 2d shooter gamer I really enjoyed the balance between diffculty and fun.  I strike a great balance.  The best example of this is the ability to play through a level using the checkpoint system, but unable to advance to new levels and get a high score as when you die you lose your score even at checkpoints.  Would definetly recommend this game.","February 28","true","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
