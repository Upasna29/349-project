In terms of technical disasters on the PC, this is right down there with the likes of Bully PC version + Dark Souls PTD PC. While Dark Souls: PTD was at least very functional before even modding, Deadly Premonition is absolutely NOT. This is a very basic PC port, lacking of many of the typical PC features we're accustomed to. First off: the game is locked in 720p, so nevermind any sort of 1080p support. Don't expect any sort of fancy graphics bells + whistles officially, either. Durante's DPFix Mod is going to be a must for PC gamers here, if they have any sort of higher-end monitors + graphics cards; especially if they want to bump the resolution past 720p + even make this aging game look a bit more modern.\n\nAlso, the game has crazy-issues with crashing to the desktop (CTD) frequently. You might want to even run a LAA (Large Address Awareness) program to make the game force using 4GB of RAM (since it runs even more horribly, without it), since this game has performance issues where it'll begin at 60 FPS (frames per second) when you start, eventually winding up - slowly, but surely - to a crawl. And if the game hasn't hit a crawl yet and crashed, give it time - it likely will. Saving constantly for most gamers anytime you get a chance will likely be a must.\n\nWhile I did not try using KB-mouse, the game was a console-game: so, it was built around a gamepad. While you can change the controls configuration in the game's sart-up config/splash-screen for the gamepad, you're better off not doing so - b/c some keys might not even function properly, if moved elsewhere.\n\n****END OF BUYER BEWARE SECTION***\n\nNow, onto the actual game itself...\n\nWhat do you get when you cross an open-world game, a surreal David Lynch movie/TV show, survival-horror games (Resident Evil + Silent Hill series), and numerous brutal detective movies involving ritualistic murders (i.e. the movie Seven)? You get Deadly Premonition, one of the strangest, odded, weirdest, unique + most interesting games of this era. If any game has "cult classic" written all over it in this era, this game would certainly easily fit the bill. Also, this game is a flawed-gem + an absolute diamond in the rough in numerous ways, if I've ever seen one.\n\nThe story + plot goes like this: Francis "York" Morgan (who the player is, BTW) is a FBI Agent that comes to the small town of Greenvale, in an attempt to try to solve a bunch a murders occurring from what looks to be a serial killer. I don't want to spoil too much more + go off into the deep end here, as this is just the tip of the iceberg with this game's story, plot + characters; since this stuff should be experienced by the player, first-hand.\n\nAnd boy, are there characters in this game! Most of the characters in this game do have something that make them stick-out in their own way, as either unique, bizarre, different, hilarious, ridiculous, or God knows what. The colorful cast of characters is always interesting + intriguing: for example, the lead "York" talks to himself a lot, and refers to someone named "Zach"; and there is a character that's filthy rich, wearing a gas mask and having his assistant speak in rhyme and poetically. Characters don't get often as unique, interesting, eccentric, hilarious (whether intentional, not intentional, or who knows on some occassions) than often what Deadly Premonition has on display here.\n\nThe story + plot are also no stranger from this type of insanity, madness and colorful-ness, as well. While the plot starts off with a typical detectives are out to "catch the serial killer theme," it doesn't take long to eventually graduates into something much more weird, interesting, strange, unique, bizarre - and then eventually go way off into the deep end, by the time the game finally finishes. Gamers will no doubt be replaynig the game; looking at an analysis online (or two, or three, or more); and having debates with their friends about things they couldn't figure out + things that are purposely left hanging ambiguously.\n\nThe controls and gameplay feels like it's right out of other classic survival-horror games. Think of the control-pad approach for Resident Evil 4 (especially since you can't move when you aim) - and you have the right idea. Combat always feels like it should with a controller: it feels solid. Areas often have their own "Nightmare" version of an area, which feels like it's plucked right out of a Silent Hill game. There are even QTE (Quick-Time Events) in this game here and there, though this game doesn't really hammer you over the head with them, unlike some other games (i.e. Fahrenheit AKA Indigo Prophecy).\n\nPlayers, by performing main-quests and side-quests, can make money - all so that they can buy more guns, melee weapons, ammo, med-kits, and other things to keep them on their journey Some quests, they can only be taken during a certain time of day - so, you might miss quests if you don't do them where they're placed in a game's Chapter or during a certain time of day. This could cause fans to replay the game, to see and experience more on an actual replay of the game. Quests varying from racing to get someone or something to another area; playing darts on a board; to just talking to NPC's and trying to get information out of them. That just doesn't tip the iceberg here, of what this game has on offer - as the game is constantly keeping the player immersed into the game, the world, the story, and especially the characters.\n\nThe game certianly lacks a lot of polish, in many areas. Sometimes, the game's sound effect doesn't sound strong, when hitting an enemy with a weapon. Sometimes, the dialogue isn't that juicy or great; while other times, it's fantastic. The quality of the graphics are nothing to write home about here, as it looks like a game that maybe should've been released on the PC years ago and/or this new version should've been updated with modern resolution support (1080p and above) + graphical features. Worst of all - as I've already stated, this game is an absolute technical mess, in terms of how this PC port was handled.\n\nDeadly Premonition is a flawed-gem + a cult-classic, unfortunately riddled with having of the worst PC ports that I've ever seen - but it's an absolutely unforgettable experience, once you can everything in working order...hopefully, for the time being. It's a great gaming experience, when it's working. An experience that, per playthrough, likely will take the player 15-20 hours or so - if we're not counting all the crashes, frustrations, and other technical blunders that might cause the spike in the time-played. According to Steam, I had around 32 hours with this, if you count all of that madness; while the game itself had me clocked in around almost 20 hours. Unfortunately, this great game is brought down quite a bit because it's unfortunately riddled with an abysmal F-grade of a technical PC port - to the point that even mods can't even close to fix most of this game's technical mess. Even the absymal PC port couldn't stop me from trying to finish this fantastic game.\n\nGame Experience = A\nPC Port = F.\nFINAL Overall Grade = C.","October 21, 2014","true","32.4"," 293 of 321 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","293","321","3","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/247660/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","I had originally played Deadly Premonition on the 360 during May of 2010. I was visiting my grandmother and was out with the family at Best Buy, where an uncle of mine was considering getting a printer. Being the dork I am, I went to go check out the video game section, and there were a few copies of Deadly Premonition lined on the shelves. The cover caught my interest as a horror fan, and the cheap $20 price tag sold me on it to make a blind purchase. When we got back from our day out, I put it into the 360 and started to play.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition, and something that has remained true, is that I love its soundtrack. A few select tracks are used maybe a little too often, but the music perfectly fits the odd tone of the game, and is pretty damn catchy. Even as I am writing this review, I find myself humming a few of its tunes. This is a case where the soundtrack isn't just good, but is a big part of this game. I am convinced the game may not have been as well received by as many if it didn't have this off-kilter soundtrack that really gets you into the mood for the oddness the game throws at you.\n\nThe next thing I and about anyone else will notice is that this game looks dated. It's something of a miracle that a game in this graphical condition was released as a published disk-based console title in this day and age. It looks dated, but then controversially I would say the look fits the game. It sort of sets you into a set of expectations for the sort of game you're about to play. This may be backwards logic, but if the game had looked amazing I feel a lot of people would of found the actuality of the game to be lackluster to its looks. And as the game goes on, the odd facial expressions and clunky animations become very amusing. Notably, the Director's Cut does update the graphics some, but honestly its hardly noticeable.\n\nThe rest rolls from there. The controls are a bit awkward, but you adjust. The first chapter isn't all that great, but it gets better. And before you know it, you start getting hooked into the game. I know I did. And it's the type of game you want to talk about.\n\nHeavily inspired by Twin Peaks (to a point in development the game got in legal trouble for far too many similarities that they had to change it, back when the game was known as Rainy Woods), the story follows the same basic premise; An FBI agent goes to investigate the homicide of a local high school beauty in a small pacific-northwestern town, but the town has a darker side the FBI agent discovers as he gets deeper into the case. The town is Greenvale, and our character in Deadly Premonition is Agent Francis York Morgan (but just call him York, that's what everybody calls him), an offbeat FBI agent who solves cases through odd measures, particularly of note in the fact he uses a system he calls profiling (that basically results to magic to figure out what happened by collecting clues), and see's shapes and messages in his morning coffee and newspaper that gives him clues to things to investigate. He also talks regularly to some unseen person named Zach. Many will quickly put together that 'Zach' is actually York's way of talking to the player, who only he seems to realize is watching everything, and who only he interacts with.\n\nDeadly Premonition has unforgettable characters. York stands out, as the player really begins to form a connection with their odd agent, but the rest of the cast are just as good. The likes of Emily, George, Thomas, Mr. Stewart, Polly, and the rest of the colorful cast will last with you long after the game has been completed.  And the story legitimately begins to get gripping. Like the rest of the game, Deadly Premonition tells an odd tale, and honestly some of what occurs in the game is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow you'll legitimately care what's going on. That is when you're not laughing your ♥♥♥ off, as the game is somehow both intentionally and unintentionally hilarious at the same time.\n\nBut it's more than just that, this game manages to actually be touching, and I found myself more emotionally involved with this game's story and characters than most any other game I've played in the last few years. And while I don't want to get ahead of myself, the last few hours of the game's story are unforgettable. Saying bye to York and the rest of Greenvale is up there as one of the hardest things I had to do as a gamer upon coming to the close of the game.\n\nDeadly Premonition is not just, 'so bad it's good' (though definitely parts of the game are just that). The game does some things absolutely wonderfully, really stellar and uniquely. But it does other things terribly, absolutely horribly. It has flaws, a lot of them. But somehow most of these flaws become strangely part of the whole experience. They sort of blend in with everything else and become part of the overall experience of Deadly Premonition. Not everyone will like Deadly Premonition, but the title since I've played it has taken on a fairly big cult following, and for good reason.\n\nDeadly Premonition is more than the sum of its parts. The game has obviously a lot of heart in it, and it shows. But it also is loaded with flaws, and that also shows. But somehow, the heart put into this game and the elements that make it amazing shine above the cumbersome driving, or the glitches the game has, or the fact the game has a few annoying QTEs. The term, 'experience', in games gets thrown around a lot these days, but this truly is what Deadly Premonition is. An experience.\n\nAnd it's not a short one either. The game should take someone 15-20 hours to complete the first time. To do the side-quests easily adds another 5-20 hours (and you should do the side-quests, they're rather fun and most all of them add additional cutscenes and character depth, plus some of them reward you with handy items, like quick-travel or a weather doll or infinite ammo weapons, or even just new cars and suits).\n\nThe PC port has plenty of flaws. There are many fan-made work around's and patches made to help, but these still exist. I was lucky that I didn't run into much, but the game did crash a couple of times for me, and there's this weird thing with the game where the longer you play it without closing it and re-launching it, the slower over time the FPS will get. It's hardly a perfect port, and some will definitely be turned off by this.\n\nBut it's also definitely the best version of the game. And if you haven't experienced Deadly Premonition before, you definitely ought to at least give it a try, maybe stick around for the coffee.\n\nDeadly Premonition is not a masterpiece in a traditional sense, and it's too flawed in ways to be named a good game (maybe okay at best). But Deadly Premonition is probably one of the best gaming experiences you could have that's released in the last few years. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll be hit with feels, and you'll panic. When all is said and done, we need more games like Deadly Premonition. It's the mid-tier game in one of the purest forms, flawed and arguably bad, but with so much heart and enjoyable elements you may not care, and hardly any game will put a smile on your face as much as DP does.","May 4, 2014","true","44.9"," 233 of 258 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","233","258","0","6"

In concept the game itself is fantastic, but technical flaws narrows the overall appeal to an already niche title. I loved the game, but I feel it's only fair to recommend it with some caveats.\n\nIt's a murder mystery with quirky characters. They give the game a lot of heart and fans of the TV show Twin Peaks and 80s pop culture should find some things to love. The juxtaposition of horror and comedy is something special.\n\nBasically this is an open world survival horror game where you drive around and look for clue to further the story. If I remember correctly there are 50 side quests as well. I really liked that many prizes for completing side quests were useful (unlike many open world games). You normally travel by car which is a jarring, experience. The car controls very poorly and has a blind spot where the frame of the windshield is. Opening the large map takes up half the screen and does not display all of the information that the menu map does. As bad as it all sounds, you do get used to it, and fast travel options open up with the right side quest completion. I would say the driving was my biggest peeve.\n\nThe combat is familiar to anyone who has played Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space. The controls are a stiffer than expected in the previously mentioned games and aiming is not as easy. There is some required melee combat and all weapons break after a few uses. I was ok with this considering that it's a survival horror game. I never was weaponless during my playthrough. there is not a lot of enemy variation though so be ready to hear "noooo i dooon't want to dieeee!" about over 9000 times.\n\nThough Deadly Premonition still contains a fair amount of jank, it only adds to the wealth of charm within. The end result is a ridiculously original masterpiece that hearkens back to an era where the gaming landscape had more room for wildly imaginative budget games, a far cry from the abundance of focus tested blockbusters that are prevalent today.\n\n\nI love whistling this theme!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OUP_Z3iZPs","December 31, 2013","true","27.9"," 147 of 162 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","147","162","0","7"

This.  RUDDY.  GAME.\n\nShould you play it?  Yes, absolutely.\n\nCan you play it?  Possibly not.\n\nLet me explain, (briefly, I promise) this was originally a console game, following the adventures of FBI Investigator and friendly neighbourhood schizophrenic Francis York Morgan who is a walking mix of cliche and man as he attempts to solve a savage murder in a small town in America.  It has some driving and fighting elements but is mostly investigating and talking until you get to do these bits.  It has great atmosphere, is immensely cheesy and there was apparently a court case against it from Twin Peaks for plagiarism.  It feels like Twin Peaks' and Swery65 had an illicit trist and Deadly Premonition was the inbred offspring - perfectly normal until closer inspection.  As soon as the console game, which was a lot of fun if you like a disturbed American comedy murder, was brought to PC, things went wrong.\n\nAnd oh so wrong.  The graphic quality was hampered to allow it to play on lower settings but the settings were not made accessible to the player so we can't ramp them back up.  The glitches  like walking and falling through walls and floors and tipping over vehicles are just the tip of the iceberg.  Crashes are horribly frequent with some players reporting a crash every hour of play, like clockwork, others getting crashes at certain points like when the camera is on a female characters legs and then again randomly in car parks.  And other points when it simply switches off for no apparent reason but doesn't allow itself to be switched back on without a full restart.\n\nTwo full patches later and these problems are still occuring - there are also external patches that can fix the graphics issue.  It's pretty much unplayable but the game itself is FANTASTIC.  It's fun and strange and shocking in places and I recommend the game itself.\n\nBut can I recommend getting it on STEAM?  Probably not.  I've been playing for about 33 hours now and I still haven't completed the second episode, purely because crashes and bugs have made me restart 5 times.  If you can get it on a console, do so, though it's expensive.\n\nAlternatively, here's some quick tips to help make it a little easier:\nRun the game in Admin mode (right click the game icon and click "Run as administrator")\nRun in compatibility mode in Windows 98 if you have Windows 7 (WindowsXP Sv1 if you have Windows 8) that should fix the problem with aiming up and down\nSearch for DPfix.ini in Google - it's a graphical fix patch, follow the creators instructions (not necessary and only useful if you have a really good PC)\nUse a controller - it will make your life easier, especially forthe driving sections, which are hilariously bad","October 24, 2014","true","59.8"," 116 of 132 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","116","132","2","0"

Then there was word that devs were planning to release patch to fix all this mess, and they really did after some time. So it's been a month already after the games release till I could play this game but it was really worth the wait, I was already hyped for this game for a long time but it turned out to exceed my expectations like 10 times, and after this patches game was fully playable with no crashes, controller support and thanks to durante with desirable custom resolutions. I played many games this generation but there were only two games that brought me that sense of excitement and joy of gaming that I had only as a child, first game was Dark Souls, and I thought I wouldn't enjoy anything else like that until second DS game was released, well now as I write this I have completed this game 100% and can safely say that it's definitely is in my top 10 games of all time if not in top 5, it just makes me sad that this masterpiece in not  very successful saleswise compared to mainstream 5-7 hour meaningless soulless shooters, but I do hope that as gaming attracts more and more mature audience and is slowly becoming as mainstream as movies, there will be time that developres can take the risks and make games such this one without any fear of failing.","December 2, 2013","true","52.5"," 66 of 78 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","66","78","0","0"

I, however, mostly enjoyed the game so I wanted to give it a "Thumbs Up."  If you approach the game the right way then you can really minimalize the impact of the crashes.\n\nThe game is a moderately open-word survival horror game.  The controls are a little clunky, especially the driving, but I suppose it fits the genre.  The music is whimsical and the dialogue is funny, if not at times very corny... but again the corny lines fit with the genre and the "bad horror movie from the 80s" type vibe the game gives off.  The story is enjoyable and intriguing.  A fun little aspect is that the game does it best to make the small town of Greenvale feel lived in.  That is to say:  each NPC moves around the town depending on the time of day, and the weather—so you may have to search for them accordingly.  The graphics are not very good, but they aren't that bad.  There is a user-created mod that can improve the visuals.\n\nAs mentioned, the bad side of the game really boils down to bugs and crashing.  Now as for bugs, I didn't really experience any "bugs" when I played, I did experience crashing, however.  But really, it wasn't that bad.  Here is some advice:  check out the “stickied” thread about troubleshooting.  Make sure to repair PhysX.  I personally did not install DPfix (which is a user-created, unofficial mod) because it only fixes visuals (which don’t bother me) and it may actually cause more problems than it fixes.  Lastly, be sure to save often.  Like: even if you just saved 5 minutes ago, if you reach another save point, save again.  This way if and when you get a crash, you don't have to replay a ton of gameplay.  This will help make the crashes a minor annoyance rather than a game-destroying problem.\n\nThere are also 50 side-quests in the game which actually offer rewards that are valuable in the main campaign—so you may find yourself wanting to do them even if you don’t care about achievements or “completionism.”  Many guides and such will recommend you do the side-quests during chapter-replays... I however, recommend you try to do as many as you can during initial playthroughs of a chapter.  This is because during a chapter-replay you can't save until you finish the replay, which may cause you to lose some progress if you encounter one of the aforementioned crashes.  If you try to do as many side-quests as you can during initial playthroughs, you will be free to save often preventing progress loss.  Some side-quests will require replays to do, simply because of the mechanics… for those I recommend chapter 7, because you can quickly end the chapter-replay, save, and then start it up again to do more side-questing.  Then just rinse and repeat until you’ve done everything… that’s how I did the side-quests and the occasional crashes were endurable.\n\nIn summary, the game is good, and worth the experience... in my opinion.  This is especially so if you enjoy the genre, or enjoy heavily story-driven games.  It will require some troubleshooting and some tolerance for bugs/crashing.  If you decide to follow my advice, and do a little planning and save often, the crashes that you will encounter won't set you back that badly, and you will probably enjoy the overall experience of the game.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 6, 2014","true","32.2"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","53","66","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiledflooring/recommended/247660/","tiledflooring","G.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiledflooring/","426 products in account","A game that understands the player, and uses its entire design to promote both its understanding of player experience and atmosphere. Contests with The Stanley Parable in making player choice contextualized in a way that matters and acknowledges the player's motivation without compromising it, unlike many Triple-A titles that garner more praise. A truly amazing game, and one worth playing at any cost. If more games were like Deadly Premonition, the world would be a better place.\n\n\nUnlike almost any game before it (with the exceptions of The Stanley Parable and Demon's Souls), Deadly Premonition understands the unique and powerful triad of Player, Character, and Narrator. At no point in the game is any of these functions invalidated.\n\nMany users comment on how "weird" the game is, or how the graphics are outdated or the controls clunky, and this is important. The game's major aesthetic is that exact cognitive function: It means to play like a PS2 game, look like a PS2 game, and even ape PS2 games. Secretly, though It does all of these things the best way possible: By actually constructing and improving upon the foundation it attempts to make fun of. Deadly Premonition is the unique and rare game that actually constructs on, as opposed to strictly deconstructs, what came before. You may hate the controls, and you may think the graphics are outdated, but if any of these things were changed its own aesthetic would clash with itself. These choices were deliberate, intelligent mirrors for the game's internal design and direction.\n\nDeadly Premonition is surprisingly one of the most intelligent games I've ever played. No matter how strange, unexpected, or uncomfortable it might be it is a game that understands what games can do. It fully utilizes the medium, and for that, it deserves a perfect score.\n\n10/10","November 4, 2013","true","26.5"," 57 of 75 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","57","75","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/247660/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Every generation of video games has a set of titles that completely flies under most gamers’ radar. Games such as Killer 7 and Snatcher are among those that fall into the elusive, Cult Classic category. See, a Cult Classic game is one that hasn’t really been met with commercial success but has garnered a dedicated fanbase despite that fact. Now, as a lowly gamer I can’t do much about these games and I wish more people actually played them, but I’ll be damned if I don’t do my part to at least spread awareness about games that I think deserve much more attention than they are currently getting. One of these games is Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut. Deadly Premonition: The Director’s Cut is an HD remake of the same game released in 2010 on Xbox 360 and PS3(Japan Only). The new game sports updated visuals, move support and some new DLC, scenarios and an extended ending. It would be hard to categorize this game into one specific genre; if I had to try I would say that Deadly Premonition is an open world third–person murder-mystery survival horror adventure game.To play Deadly Premonition, you need to approach it with an open mind. This is not your typical run-of-the-mill video game. No, instead this game has some of the worst visuals and controls you’ll ever encounter, not to mention the new HD remake has some framerate issues as well. But do not let this deter you from the game as absolutely none of that matters when you’re playing it. Deadly Premonition follows Agent Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent investigating the murder of a young woman in the quaint little town called Greenvale. York (As he likes to be called) takes the case due to the mysterious and intriguing M.O of the killer – red seeds are always found near the body of the victims. York has to work together with the denizens of Greenvale to help bring in the bad guy and restore order to the once peaceful town. Sounds like your average detective plot right? Well, it couldn’t be further from that. Without getting into too many spoilers, the plot takes numerous twists and turns that send you on a journey of self-discovery and has you second guessing what the truth is.The real hook of Deadly Premonition comes from the charm its characters and environments exude. Everything and everyone is bursting with personality. Agent York for example has a special friend named Zach; what makes Zach so special is that no one else can see him or knows about him besides York, even if he talks to Zach in front of another character. York constantly talks to him in his head throughout the game, and you’re always wondering if Zach is real or just some imaginary friend. York also seems to be very knowledgeable about movies. When driving around in your car York will often talk about various movies with Zach such as the classics Tremors and Goonies. Another example would be the Deputy Sheriff, Emily Wyatt, who bears a striking resemblance to the actor Naomi Watts, for no apparent reason. The town of Greenvale feels very homey and you often feel like you’re in an episode of Everwood. I think Access Games really nailed the look and feel of Greenvale.As mentioned before, Deadly Premonition is an open world game of sorts. The game has a timer for each day and main objectives have to be completed within a certain time frame. The main objectives push the story forward and this is usually where the survival horror aspect comes into play. These sections have you exploring linear levels gunning down hordes of creepy enemies in classic Resident Evil 4 over the shoulder style. While these sections do little to scare you, they are entertaining enough to keep things moving forward. York can use a multitude of weapons ranging from his handgun to breakable melee weapons such as a pipe or spade.You can partake in numerous activities and interact with various NPCs in the game. You could, for example, spy on one of the officers while they’re having supper in their apartment. I kid you not, you can literally look into their window and stalk them and watch them do completely mundane things like eat or sit on a couch. But that is where the real beauty of Deadly Premonition comes in. It is then up to you to explore and find these gaming gems, and trust me some of them will have you in stitches from laughing so much. There are also numerous side missions that are given to you by certain NPCs; they are not easy to find as some NPCs are only active during certain times of the day – you have to be sure to talk to them at that time or you might miss out. The fact that those NPCs go about their daily lives independent of you, the player, really makes the game feel alive.The game has some catchy tunes and the voice acting is particularly good at capturing each character’s unique personality. The same can’t be said about the sound effects, though. The graphics are really bad. This game looks like it was made in the PS 2 era, even with the updated graphics, but the bad graphics give the game a certain extra charm. If you are open-minded enough I promise you will have a one-of-a-kind experience that you will not soon forget. The PC release though, has its fair share of problems, including poor performance, and a resolution locked at 720p. It’s a bit of a bad console port, to be honest – though one wonders if this adds to the charm. Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, it’s good. Overall 7/10.","June 24, 2015","true","11.4"," 60 of 80 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","60","80","6","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tramor/recommended/247660/","tramor","treep-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tramor/","1293 products in account","The actual game itself gets a wholehearted recommendation. Though the gameplay is certainly rough around the edges--to say the least--there's an immense amount of charm, humor, and Lynch-esque eccentricities found in the fictional town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition was never a "so bad it's good" game, but rather a genuinely good experience saddled with a low budget and a couple of design pitfalls. The main issues lie in the combat. The game's director SWERY65 has been on the record stating that the "shooting bits" were not actually a part of the game's original concept. The combat was the last part of the game developed in what seems to be an effort to give the game a broader audience appeal. And it shows. Killing enemies in this game is by no means a dreadful or broken experience, it's just a very barebones and arguably pointless affair--some shallow padding until you reach the next chunk of entertaining story exposition and exploration of the game's quirky world. I'd argue that most people played the Dreamcast classic Shenmue for the exploration, character interaction and investigation segments rather than the just-OK fighting-game showpieces sprinkled throughout. As it follows in Shenmue's footsteps in many ways, Deadly Premonition should be treated in the same regard. Do enjoy the warmth that Greenvale has to offer.\n\nIf you can.\n\nThe lack of resolutions higher than 720p in this PC port have already been discussed and criticized--and then fixed, by the same dude who made the Dark Souls PC fix. DPFix, however, does not fix the lackluster native controller support and constant crashing. You can go find additional third-party mapping software of course, but as this is originally a console game and advertises controller support on the Steam store page, the exclusion is a bit disappointing. The crashing, on the other hand, is not as immediately remedied. It seems very temperamental and varies from system to system, but across my two Windows 7 and XP machines I've had nothing but instability. I have tried putting the .exe in Windows 98 compatability, numerous restarts, and other tweaks found from various discussion threads. But the game still crashes at the worst, most pivotal moments (like before I can get to a save point) or slows down to an unplayable framerate. The framerate is momentarily fixed by a full system reboot, but the sluggishness and screeching halts always return again and again. I've never seen this kind of thing happen in any other game.\n\nSo in a bit of frustration and resignation, I've uninstalled this game and returned to finish the original, Xbox 360 version. But I feel like I'm missing out on the definitive experience. The Director's Cut provides some nice touch-ups, like a better map system, less washed-out graphics, marginally improved driving controls, some extra cutscenes, and an easier default difficulty setting, which basically lowers the sometimes ridiculously high health bars on the various enemies throughout the game. Though there's much talk these days about the dumbing down of modern games--that they're too easy--I can assure you that toning down the frustration in this game is definitely a good thing. Anyone who has spent 30 minutes killing one of the "wall-crawler" enemies in the 360 version should be able to attest. It's attrition, a hurdle, not a fair and invigorating challenge by any means.\n\nSome people have been able to play this port to completion, sidequests and all. Maybe you're one of them, maybe not.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumbus/recommended/247660/","lumbus","lumbus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumbus/","755 products in account","I recommend Deadly Premonition to everyone who likes kind of weird characters, good storytelling (that takes it's time) with multiple perspectives from different points on the timeline. You should be stress resistant, because the game will probably crash just before your next save, so you will do some things twice. That should not bother you. It is a kick, because the game itself is not much of a challenge. If you can live with the flaws and see it as an Indie game you got for less than 3 bucks, it is an immersing adventure.\n\nSince the beginning I like the habit of the main character "York" to talk to "Zack". It feels like he is talking to you, the player. It is fun to see other people being puzzled by the actions of the protagonist (as talking to Zack, a person no one can see) and not asking a question. That's what you as the player do: make a list in your mind of things you want to find out and hope that you will get your answers to the right time. Or at the end, at least. Because of the way the story is told you may guess some things and resolve some mysteries for yourself, but I assume that you will still be surprised sometimes. You won't find an answer to everything in the game, like with most scary stories, but that's fine. You will get all important answers to what is important in the game's universe.\n\nSome insights of my journey with the game:\nI was well aware of bugs because I read other reviews. I installed DPfix.  I can highly recommend that. By doing so, crashes did not occur too often and because I saved a lot I managed to play the game without becoming depressed. ;) I can only complain about spending too much time on loading screens. Moving the game from my HDD to my SSD did not seem to boost the time on loading screens. Too bad.\nIn chapter 7 I started to explore the vast world. I should have done that sooner (chapter 2) to have advantages in the game early on. In the first chapters you have time limits, but the game is nearly in real time, so you can do side quests. No worries. Do them! I got my radio, which allows me to drive to different locations in no time without really doing it] after chapter 21. I could have saved a lot of time, not driving myself through the world. You find information about the side quests in the game and also through the descriptions of the achievements.\nAfter you finished a chapter, you can replay it. During a replay you cannot save. A replay is nice if you want to do side quests that may be easier in that level or not doable in another. Everything you gain will be available in any other replay and also in your current game progress. A replay only changes at the end (if you save after finishing the chapter) your inventory, trading cards and the quests you finished. So if you keep dying in your current level, do a replay to get food and medipacks in your inventory. Nice cheat. :)\nI used the replays after I was stuck in chapter 22. I was too lazy to open the archive and therefore I did not find an important key. The game is in general, amazingly straightforward, because it shows in red where you need to go to or interact with to proceed. That is nice, as you always know what to do. (But you still have to solve the puzzles by yourself, the game only indicates where the important puzzle is.) You are never lost.\n\nI like the chilling atmosphere of the game, the horror story itself and especially how it is told. One last hint: Don't miss to have lunch with your colleagues. Eat with them in every chapter possible. It's fun!\nI am happy that the reviews I read convinced me to play this (indie?) gem.","June 28, 2015","true","39.4"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","32","41","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fhexsans/recommended/247660/","fhexsans","Fhex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fhexsans/","149 products in account","I would love to recommend this game, really I would. It has a really nice plot, the minigames are suprisingly fun, the shooting action, while stiff and rather easy, feels pretty rewarding. It plays almost as a homage to Twin Peaks with a little bit of Silent Hill thrown in for good measure, and I absolutely oved it for all of its flaws (it even got me into Twin Peaks)... until the game would not let me pass through a certain point because of a gamebreaking glitch involving the time. And I couldn't go back because there's only one save slot.\n\nThe truth is this pretty damn good game can be downright unplayable because of the number of glitches and bugs that just seem to absolutely ruin the game. I'm not talking small things like stiff animation and bad lighting, I'm talking glitches that can literally mean you must restart your game or your computer in order to move on... or have to start from the very beginning. I cannot, in any good heart, recommend this game because it has terrible memory leaks that usually cause the game to crash after about an hour or so. When it isn't that, it is a game glitch that I have read is linked to the in-game clock. In a word, if you're outside at exactly the wrong time, the game will crash to desktop until you smoke to let the time pass ("smoking" in Deadly Premonition is akin to waiting in Skyrim/Fallout/Oblivion, except it requires an item) until the next day or until the crash no longer exists. If you've SAVED outside or if you do not have smokes or enough supplies to last until after you smoke, then you're screwed and you MUST restart your game. If this game had multiple save slots, it could be salvaged by saving in multiple slots, but sadly it does not. Sometimes, I have heard that running the game as administrator or setting compatibility mode can fix these bugs, it is not a sure thing for every player. The game, for as good as it is, is broken.\n\nIf you're still willing to try this game, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend against that, you should DEFINITELY be sure to back up your saves whenever it is convienent for you (at least every time you exit the game). You can do this by going to the game directory on Steam and going to the "savedata" folder. If you can remember to do that, and if you're patient, then you should not have any major problems with it.\n\nBarring that, the game is also a pretty bad PC port with very limited graphics options right off the bat. Thankfully, at least for the graphical options, DPFix exists and allows you to change resolution, allows you to alter antialiasing, DOF, etc. It also allows you to change textures and models, allowing for the game to actually enjoy limited modding capability. Related to that, the controls are rather stiff outside a controller, but, for me personally, I could get used to them. If you're not a fan of them, I'd probably get a controller if you can. The controls, from what I have heard, are still not very good on controllers, but they're at least better.\n\nHowever, if you can get past all of that, the game is a whole lot of good. Voiceovers, especially for a budget game such as this, are actually quite good, although the translation can be a bit stiff at times in the subtitles. The characters, too, are quite memorable, if not stereotypical (although that's pretty much intended). The main character, Agent Francis York Morgan, is actually fleshed out very well as a quirky and sometimes downright schizophrenic special agent for the FBI. Think of Agent Cooper from Twin Peaks except downright crazy sometimes. Dialog is really where the game shines, with very strange characters you can talk to. The game, even though its a horror game at its core, can be very funny with some of the things the characters do and say.\n\nThe minigames are actually quite a nice touch to the game. The game's spin on darts is actually kind of interesting, but a bit too easy sometimes if you understand the game. Fishing is a bit boring, but straightforward. Racing is a bit tedious sometimes because of the stiff controls but can still be kind of fun. There are a few other fun bits-and-bobs too, like drinking coffee, that do add to the immersion of the game.\n\nThe more horror-related parts of the game, including the shooting sections, can be quite disappointing at times, but other times they can actually be really suspenseful (most definitely including some of the times you encounter one of the antagonists of the game, although I won't spoil more than that). The shooting itself is quite stiff, but sometimes getting a headshot can feel quite rewarding. The enemies are not incredibly interesting or difficult, but can get you unexpectedly at points. However, I will concede that I am a bit biased on this as I have had trouble getting past the 9th chapter for the reasons listed above. You may want to check other reviews for views on this specifically.\n\nThe game is open world, although it is not entirely open world like Grand Theft Auto or Far Cry (e.g. you can't go in some of the forests and in specific places). The locations, too, are sometimes a bit vanilla at least as far as exteriors go (the lumbermill, for example, does not look very run down from the outside, especially the bunks and the streets). Exploration isn't a huge deal with this game, although it does exist. Driving also is very stiff and not incredibly exciting, but it gets the job done. A lot of the problems with driving, though, stem from the controls, as stated before.\n\nSidequests can be hit or miss, in my experience, depending on the quest. Some of them are either fetch quests that don't really have any interesting spin on them (e.g. [MINOR SPOILER] the sherriff's first quest [END MINOR SPOILER]) or really, not even that much of quests at all. However, there are some that do require some detective work and actually do add quite a lot to the game. Definitely worth playing through them, though, in my opinion.\n\nTo wrap this review up and summarize the main points:\n\n[CON] The game is incredibly gamebreakingly buggy in some points, with memory leaks that can cause frequent crashing or gamebreaking must-restart-the-game crashes that require you to start again. No extra save slots which causes the latter type of glitches to require a hard restart if you do not manually restart your game.\n\n[CON] Bad PC port with very few graphics options out of the box and poor, stiff controls.\n\n[CON] Shooting, driving, and open-world mechanics aren't the best, although they have their redeeming qualities\n\n\n[PRO] DPFix can fix graphical and control-related problems to a degrees, and allows for minor moddablity to the game.\n\n[PRO] Very good plot with incredibly interesting characters. The voiceovers, for the most part, are pretty good too\n\n[PRO] Can be very suspenseful at some points and actually cashes in fairly well on being a horror game\n\n[PRO] Decent sidequests and minigames\n\n\nAll in all, for most people, I simply cannot recommend this game to most people in general because the game is very, very, very unstable and very prone to bad glitches and crashes. However, if you're willing to accept its flaws and can be sure to back up your saves incredibly often, then maybe Deadly Premonition is the game for you.","December 22, 2014","false","37.2"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","26","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/X-pert74/recommended/247660/","X-pert74","X-pert74","http://steamcommunity.com/id/X-pert74/","613 products in account","This is a tough thing for me to do, given that Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games I've ever played, but I can't honestly recommend playing this version of the game. I first played Deadly Premonition on the Xbox 360, and that version had its issues, of course, but it at least functioned out of the box. I installed the latest version of DPfix (0.9.5 as of this writing), and that helped, but it didn't fix the constant runtime errors that would pop up during gameplay, causing the game to stop functioning. Usually they'd pop up after an hour or so of gameplay, but sometimes later (if I was lucky), or sometimes much sooner (if I was unlucky).\n\nEven if this version wasn't completely unstable, I still wouldn't recommend playing this over the 360 version. While this is the "Director's Cut", the story by and large is exactly the same, with the exception of a few added cutscenes at the beginning/end of each episode. The storyline is perfectly capable of standing on its own without these added scenes, so playing this version of the game just for them (especially if you've played the original game before) is not worth it. If one really wanted to see them, I'd recommend viewing them on a video site, rather than playing through this version for the sake of seeing them.\n\nThere are some other things regarding the game design that have been changed; most notably the controls. The original game featured Resident Evil 4-style movement, in that moving up or down would move your character forward or backward, while moving left or right would turn your character in those directions; camera remaining behind your shoulder the whole time. There were also some parts of the game (very few; only a small handful) where the normally over-the-shoulder camera would switch to a completely different angle, again reminiscent of Resident Evil (in this case, the classic horror-style games). One complaint the original game did receive had to do with these controls, so in the Director's Cut you can instead move in any direction, while moving the camera completely independently of your character. As far as basic maneuverability is concerned, this is an improvement, though I would argue it's not really necessary, as the original game's movement controls were just fine, if not entirely self-explanatory. The aiming and shooting mechanics are virtually untouched in the Director's Cut, aside from moving aiming control to the right analog stick (if you're playing with a controller). You still have to stand in place to aim and shoot, so this aspect of the controls remains faithful to the original. Whether you consider that a drawback or not will depend on your preferences.\n\nWhile general movement is improved by the new controls, I think keeping full control of the camera during every moment of gameplay was a bad change to make. This is most apparent in one of the side quests, in which you push boxes around a maze. This puzzle-like gameplay was shown from an overhead view in the original game, but here in the Director's Cut, the camera is moved closer to your character, as if you were in a normal area. This makes trying to solve this block puzzle unnecessarily much harder to do, as you can no longer see the entire playing field; thus making it much more likely that one will make a mistake, and thus have to restart the block puzzle from the beginning. This was much less of a hassle to complete in the original game. There are also some other scenes which originally had fixed-camera perspectives, yet now don't. These other scenes' original perspectives aren't nearly as important as the block puzzle's, but this was still a change that added nothing to the game.\n\nThis is a relatively minor change, but the green tint the original game had was removed in this version. This doesn't really affect the game that much; the graphics are mostly identical otherwise, and if you've never played the original game, you won't find yourself missing it. I personally miss the green tint, as I felt it helped add to the atmosphere, but I wouldn't consider its removal a deal-breaker on its own.\n\nThe only other significant addition to the game is some bonus features, such as alternate outfits for certain characters to wear, as well as a house in town for the main character to rest at. This, again, is unnecessary, and the fact that time and effort was spent on frivolous things such as this, as opposed to fixing any of the graphical deficiencies in the game, or refining the level and quest designs, or even fixing some translation errors in the text or bugs that the original game had, is disappointing. The original Deadly Premonition was a pretty unpolished, buggy game, and this retains all of the bugs that version had, while introducing several new ones of its own. Over three years passed between the release of the original game, and the release of the Director's Cut on the PS3, followed soon after by this PC port. Were the developers really not able to fix any of these problems during all this time; not even the grammatical/spelling errors that are prevalent throughout the game's text?\n\nIt hurts me to write this, because at its core Deadly Premonition is a game I truly care about. Its story (which I won't go into detail about at all, as it's one that should ideally be experienced with as few spoilers as possible) is incredibly compelling and well-written, managing to mix multiple themes and moods in a way that fits well together; after my first time beating the original game, I found myself reflecting on the game's events and characters time and time again. Every character in this game is incredibly memorable, and the majority of the work by the game's voice actors is very well done. The actual gameplay itself... has its ups and downs. The game's world is very interesting and has a number of secrets to be found, as well as multiple unique characters who maintain their own schedules and lives as the game progresses, somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The sidequests are mostly good, and stand out from each other pretty well, while at times giving essential rewards for completing them.\n\nThe game's combat is often derided, which is understandable. Most of the combat areas in the game are terribly designed, being repetitive, dull, and often way too long for their own good. It's as if the developers spent most of their time on the main storyline and sidequests, and rushed to include some combat areas at the last minute, having absolutely no time to playtest them. As with many other things, none of this is changed in the Director's Cut; if you hated the combat in the original game, that's still an issue here. All I can recommend to deal with it is doing certain sidequests as soon as possible, and using their rewards to help make the combat less tedious.\n\nTo sum things up, Deadly Premonition is a very unique, memorable experience; one that as of now, I feel is best had on the Xbox 360. If Deadly Premonition seems like a game you really want to experience, and you have a 360, I recommend searching out a used copy of that version instead, and afterward (if you feel like it) watching the extra cutscenes online. If you have a PS3... I haven't played that version myself, but from what I have read online it at least doesn't crash after every hour of play. If neither of these platforms are available to you, and you absolutely have to play this game, well... then you might want to take a chance on this PC version; preferably during a sale. Remember to download the latest version of Durante's DPfix prior to playing, and make sure to save as much as possible, lest you lose your recent progress due to a crash. Also back up your saves often; fortunately they're easily accessible in their own folder inside the game's files.

Absolutely.\nDo I recommend this version of Deadly Premonition on Steam? Well that's going to need explaining.\n\nDeadly Premonition is, in as few words as possible, Twin Peaks: The Video Game, you play as Francis York Morgan, a quirky FBI Agent is brought out to the town of Greenvale in order to solve the death of a young woman, who York believes was killed by someone who has done similar murders in other towns, all with the same connection of mysterious red seeds, along the way he will meet with and help out the town inhabits in any way he can to bring him one step closer in solving his biggest case so far.\n\nBasically my recommendation of this game comes with an asterisk, you have to be able to enjoy quirky plotlines, weird gameplay, and have a basic love for Twin Peaks or a number of other David Lynch like things, that being said even though the Director's Cut of this game fixes a lot of problems and adds in a few extra bonuses, there are still core issues with the game that must be suffered through in order to enjoy the game's story, for example this game has an open world but with no fast travel unless you do a side mission half way through the game, but before that you have to drive everywhere, and the map system is not the best, add in clunky shooting mechanics and missions thrown in just to add filler and you have gameplay that is not the most exciting thing in the world, not to mention the graphics look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game.\n\nBut even with the issues this game has I fully recommend it, the story is interesting, bizarre, and downright insane at times, and will leave you wanting to see what happens next, though you may have to suffer some gameplay to get to the good part... or some bugs.\n\nWhich brings me to the second part of this, the PC version of this game has issues, many, many issues, I recommend people to check out guides and the forums to understand some of the fixes, if you have a Playstation 3 I feel that version of the game is the best to get, but if you are unable to and PC is your only option, be ready for random crashes, weird texture bugs, slowdowns, Windows 98 compatibility mode, and many hours fooling around just to get it to work right, if it even works at all, but who knows you might be lucky and the game works perfectly, at any rate know that going in.","June 13, 2014","true","6.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","1"

That is true, not only because of its progressively more mystic story and the many weird citizens of Greenvale but also because of the peculiar mix of gameplay and technical elements. Many parts of the game are great, others are so bad they're good again, some are truely (ragequit inducingly) bad. Deadly Premonition is a very rough gem; it's seriously flawed but the game has real character.\nWhile I had a lot of fun with the game, playing it was quite frustrating sometimes. After the ending credits rolled I was left unsure whether I should be sad it ended, or glad that I won't have to experience any more of it. All in all the positives outweigh the negatives for me but I only recommend the game to people with patience in combination with high tolerance for bugs and broken gameplay.\n\nFor a little bit more detailed impression of some aspects I start with the technical side as this is where the most frustrating flaws of the game lie: The PC version of Deadly Premonition is a terrible console port. From what I read on various websites the game was already quite buggy on consoles; on PC most if not all of these bugs are still there but others were introduced on top of that as well.\nFor starters I experienced a half a minute up to 5 minutes long blackscreen before any cutscene would play. Because an intro cutscene would play before the start screen everytime the game starts and another one - summarising what had happened in the game before - everytime a game is loaded, this issue already made just starting the game an annoyance. Now add periodic crashes into the mix and the annoyance level is upped to eleven. The game crashed about two dozen times in the course of the game, mostly in the worst situations possible ("Oh, you just beat a sidequest in which you have to refight stronger versions of all bosses in a row without being able to save inbetween and you're just two steps away from a savepoint? Why don't you do it again? TROLOLOLO!").\nDeadly Premonitions allows you to replay already finished chapters in order to pick up missed collectables or do sidequests, however during such replays saving is disabled until the chapter is finished, making crashes even worse than in the regular playthrough where often enough a savepoint is closeby.\n\nUsually the crashes appeared somewhat randomly but then the game crashed everytime on the transition from chapter 8 to 9. Setting the compability mode to Windows 98 eventually got me through that part, though.\n\nAdditionally to long loading times and crashes there are some bugs with quests: After replaying earlier chapters quest items (especially temporary ones like keys for locked doors) are sometimes deleted from the inventory and can not be retrieved in normal ways. This happened to me once with an item needed for a side quest before I could finish said quest; in the end I had to change my savefile with an hex editor to get it back.\nBefore playing I got the recommendation to play the game with a gamepad because, like many console games, it's supposed to play better that way. Turns out my gamepad (an old BigBen pad) isn't supported and because of the way gamepad integration is done in this port programs like x360ce or xpadder don't work with it rendering it impossible to use my gamepad. Still I found that keyboard + mouse controls worked well enough most of the time, only the handling of additional cars that can be bought later in the game is horrible.\n\nGameplay: Deadly Premonition's gameplay comes pretty close to what I wished Alan Wake, another game inspired by Twin Peaks, would be like: Almost at any time the player can choose to ignore the mainquest for a while and freely roam around the town of Greenvale, learning more about its citizen by questioning people, starting sidequests and searching for collectables.\nAt some points the game throws a puzzle at the player. The puzzles are few and they're really easy but it's still more than Alan Wake had to offer, which was mostly composed of cutscenes and filler combat. Speaking of which, a flaw Deadly Premonition shares with AW is boring, repetitive and clunky combat. Reducing the amount of combat or even removing it completely would have been an improvement in my opinion. In order to make up for less/no combat I would have loved to see the "Profiling" feature expanded.\nProfiling, for me, is the #1 area where the game left a lot of unused potential. From the role profiling plays in the story one could assume it's a core part of the game but in the end it's pretty dull: At a crime scene the player sees a couple of noisy pictures showing the circumstances of the crime recreated by Agent Francis York Morgan, the game's protagonist, and now has to search for clues. Each found clue makes some of the pictures now appear clearly visible. And that's all.\nTurning these profiling sessions into puzzles, maybe even letting the players make their own deductions, leading to a branched-out (to some degree at least) storyline, would have vastly improved the whole game and further increased the incentive to replay finished chapters.\nSo I didn't really like combat and the lackluster profiling that much but still both is 'okay' and far from gamebreaking. The one thing I hated about the gameplay are Quick Time Events. I hate QTEs in general but Deadly Premonition has some of the worst QTEs I've ever seen. An especially annoying QTE in the game makes you press buttons, apparently randomly chosen from four possibilities, in rather short time; be too slow or press a wrong button first and it's instant "gameover, try again!" (including going through several black screens). Fortunately QTEs aren't that abundant but they were closer to making me quit the game for good than any of the technical issues.\nDeadly Premonition plays a bit like a Japanes horror shooter (think Resident Evil or Silent Hill) combined with an adventure game and a little bit of open-world.\n\nStory/characters/music:\nThe thing I enjoyed the most about the game are the wonderfully eccentric characters. It's full of well written, funny dialogues that are made even funnier by the often completely inappropriate background music. Or rather "foreground" music, sometimes and seemingly random the music gets louder than the speech (like in a couple of other cases, the overall oddness of the game makes me unsure whether this is a bug or if it was than on purpose). Deadly Premonition can be very surreal sometimes. Still there are many scenes with a more serious tone (it's all about a murder case after all) and those work very well, too.\nSetting, characters and story are heavily inspired by the TV series Twin Peaks, therefore the aforementioned absurd dialogues are not surprising. Twin Peaks is among my favourite TV shows, so I highly enjoyed Deadly Premonition's setting.\nHowever from time to time the game draws a bit too heavily from its inspiration: some details about characters' backstories that get revealed through side quests are no big surprise if you've seen Twin Peaks.\nThe main story line is, several parallels aside, mostly original, though. For the most parts it's well written and interesting but, especially towards the end, it gets cheesy and loses some of its charme. Biggest problem I had with the story was that, without need, the game gives an extremely obvious clue regarding the solution of the case very early on and no character, not even the alleged super-profiler Agent York, considers it during the investigation. Of course, from a meta perspective the game can't just end before it even really started but why bring a thing like that up at all then?\nAgain I can't rule out that it wasn't done on purpose, though; maybe in order to lampshade B-movies from the 80s which are a recurring theme throughout the game and plotholes like that are not exactly a rare occurence in those movies.\n\nTl;dr in comment section","January 18, 2014","true","44.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","2"

Puedes andar a tu bola por el pueblo y tienes repartidas por todas partes un monton de misiones secundarias (la gran mayoria de ellas solo aparecen bajo condiciones especiales cómo por ejemplo de ciertos horarios o solo en días lluviosos) , la gran parte de ellas tienen que ver poco o mucho con la investigación de la trama principal y cómo he dicho antes, puedes incluso resolver el misterio de la trama en base a pistas que arrojan las misiones secundarias y las actitudes que tienen las personas del pueblillo. Esto creo que es algo que muuuuy pocas veces se ha visto en otro juegos.\n\nEl inicio es ESPANTOSO, no puede haber una peor primera impresión, te muestra precisamente las peores caras del juego que son la faceta shooter, el sonido muy pobre (incluyendo los efectos sonoros de unas ardillas que ya lo vereis por vuestra cuenta), los efectos de impacto tan poco creibles y esos arboles tan feos de los que antes he hablado. Si eres capaz de resistir esa primera media hora de juego, os aseguro que el juego os atrapará con todo lo que viene.\n\nOtro aspecto muy curioso y que desata polémica es la banda sonora, es otra de esas cosas que hace única al juego, la mayoría de pistas se repiten cómo el ajo y en muchas ocasiones te quedas con cara de wtf? cuando de la nada aparece una melodía que poco o nada tiene que ver con el momtno que se vive en el juego. Esto ya es muy subjetivo pero tengo que decir que la banda sonora me fascina, sobre todo el tema The Goddess y el del silbidito que tan famoso es.\n\nEn resumen, es un buen juego, un grandioso juegos que suple de lleno algunas carencias con mushisimas bondades, si eres amante de las buenas historias, de las historias originales y de las tramas bien contadas, este definitivamente es tu juego.","December 30, 2014","true","40.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

His name is Francis Morgan a.k.a York who has a split personality named Zach who helps him in his cases, every time he takes a sip of coffee he gets a random fortune or a message from it (I wish my coffee could do that) & he has a unique talent of collecting clues then automatically getting his "Profiling" skills running in his brain (The way he already knows what's going on is amazing, Sherlock Holmes would be proud). The game's strengths are the story, characters, the open world of Greenvale, the amount of side missions you can do (There are also trading cards that you can collect) & the strong plot twists but there are downsides to this game like the combat for example but I'm not going to mention them because the game forgives it's flaws by having cheesy charm (It's hard to explain).\n\nOne of my friends gave a perfect word for this game which is "Bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy" (I played a lot of disturbing games to the point of being desensitized) & I have to agree because the game has one of the weirdest characters in gaming history like Sigourney for example who is obsessed with warming her pot (Not the drug you idiot) & I can't forget the transformation that Thomas had with a red dress later on in the game (Thomas get the ♥♥♥♥ off drugs). The story to this game is your typical who murdered this person scenario but the way the game feeds you the character's backstories & the amount of thinking is brilliant, this game forces you to not trust everyone but it slowly weeds out your guesses (Me, my friend & my family were having fun trying to guess the murderer & we were all talking about theories on who the murderer is). The fact that the game is a combination of Resident Evil's combat (Resident Evil 4 mostly) & the open world sandbox of Grand Theft Auto is a nice combination from the game director SWERY a.k.a Hidetaka Suehiro so I hope future game devs use an open world sandbox in future horror games.\n\nOverall this game is a good example on how to make a good horror game without overusing cheap scares like jumpscares when the main thing you should be afraid of is the unknown & to be aware of who you trust (If I missed anything then be sure to leave feedback so I can edit my review & I forgot that shaving your beard gives you money).","January 27, 2014","true","3.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","2"

But it fails: You cannot to go to the toilet, you cannot wash yourself (just the clothes), etc.\n- It tries to be Resident Evil, but it fails in its mediocre clunkiness and boring repetitions, including stupid quick time events\n- It tries to be episodic, but doesn't make sense there at all. Episodes 1 to 3 take forever, eposides 4-7 are rather short and should just have been episode 4 if it was ment to be comparable\n- It tries to incorporate psychological elements into the game, but fails miserably. Nearly all characters have psychological problems galore, they just stacked probably everything they thought they heard about psychosis and mutiple personalities. You will meet more psychopaths laden with stories from their childhoods in the small town of this game than in an average psychiatry of a very big city.\n- On top of that all: It unnessessary slows down action and progress by long loading times, unskippable intro (which is a problem due to the many chrashes), opening doors very slowly, etc.\n\nThe store page tells "Part suspense-filled horror, part action-adventure game, Deadly Premonition offers an open-world experience packed with locals to meet and places to discover, as well as numerous side quests and mini-games (...)". Describes the game well: They threw together lots of things, all of them at mediocre quality and rather early-access-like than finished. So the customer ends up holding a mixed bag of everything a little bit in his hands, but nothing really usable. Just like someone added every spice available in his kitchen to some food, hoping for it to become tasty. Most times, it won't.\n\nTo sum it up, and to cite the main characters himself: "Zach, this is a waste of time!". Yes, it is, it kills quite some time playing it, always at the border between quitting due to all it's clunkiness but still providing something that makes you want to continue in the hope of it becoming more enjoyable, which sadly does not happen.","January 18","false","24.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcelus7/recommended/247660/","marcelus7","Marcelus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcelus7/","247 products in account","Pros:\n- From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There're not many open world survival horror games like this out there.\n- Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D\n- Let's talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it's scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player "go there!...is funny isn't it!?" for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000's but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that's my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time!\n- The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP).\n- The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it.\n- OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a "pro" but is not a "con").\n- The OST is amazing! Point mother ♥♥♥♥ing period!\n- The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now).\n- Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding.\n- If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details.\n- "DP Fix" exist! (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438) As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;)\nNow we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.\n\nCons:\n- Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT.\n- You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!\n\nNotes:\n- You can find "Pillow Stains", the song from the former form of DP called "Rainny Woods" check the trailer on YouTube: www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbbhwO7pRHA within the game ;) just explore the map. Song: www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9zfSVmMbjM\n- Don't waste your first playthrough without doing side-quest.\n- DP Fix recommendations:\n1) Desactivare the DEP for the .exe\n2) Create a shortcut of the .exe to achieve the borderless mode.\n3) Run the .exe with W98 compatibility and admin rights.\n4) If you have some .dll problems just follow the Steam discussions. Every OS is different.\n5) You can now use Sweet FX to bring the Xbox 360 grading.\n6) There's a horrible Memory Leak problem within the fullscreen mode. Use borderless as mentioned before to solve this on many cases. This also will solve the issue of the Alt+Tab freeze and the steam overlay.\nMany other issues and workarounds can be found here: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director's_Cut\n- I would add many things but they could be spoilers. I would recommend you to visit my friend Whitney's Page "Welcome to Greenvale" www.facebook.com/welcometogreenvale and her YouTube: www.youtube.com/user/shhistoricalsociety\n- Another recommendation from YouTube after beating the game: www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7DGK2U387Q","May 11","true","29.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It does so many things right and the way it continues to surprise me at every turn is something I've never experienced before.\n\nHowever, like when your awesome, kind, with-a-heart-of-gold-sweet-and-nice, but drunken uncle - who's usually the very best to hang out with, has the best stories, and showers you with genuine life wisdom at every opportunity - one day feeds your face a blank stare while he feels you up, it hurts like a m0ther£ucker.\n\nIt feels so disgusting and wrong that you feel your bones ache, no matter his "good" intentions. And you know without a doubt, and with an indescribable sadness, that if it hadn't been for that specific unmentionable perk of his, he would have been THE greatest person ever, in all of history.\n\nIf Deadly Premonition would have gotten a decent PC-port IT would have been the greatest game ever. Instead, like your uncle's dark, ugly advances at you, it makes you suffer CTDs every hour or so, if you want to continue reaping the amazing benefits you get by playing.\n\nAnd God help me, there's a REASON why I can't put it away despite that suffering; there's a reason I'm prostituting myself by still playing it. And I can't fathom or even remember any other title I would have done this for, thus my having to save at the towns phone booths every chance I get.\n\nBecause:\nJust like your drunk uncle - who feels you up every now and then, which feels so god damn wrong and unpleasant - the same guy has also recently provided the cure for every known sickness on earth, has the solution for world peace at hand, and is in the process of providing every common man with space travel to the new planets (yes, plural) he's discovered.\n\nJust like that, it is a fact that the pesky, murky river of epic coding failure in Deadly Premonition also contains, not gold nuggets, but straight up gold BARS, of proportions previously unheard of.\n\nAnd if you had that knowledge, could you, or not, look beyond your uncle Deadly Premonition's one recurring fault? Could you grind your teeth and hold on, just until the unpleasantness went away, just a couple of minutes with restarts every now and then, so he could deliver - to you and the world, yet another great moment? A moment you're not even sure what would entail this time around, but you knew it would blow you and the rest of the world away, and contribute to the ascension of man, soon rivaling the almighty himself?\n\nI'll let you think about that for a minute while I leave you with this:\nThis game has some of the best parts of Twin Peaks in it, combined with certain awesome moments taken straight out of the Seven movie, and lots and lots of the greatest kind of quirkiness - which always feels entertaining and amusing rather than annoying.\n\nEven with the horribly easy and janky combat present; if they would only have done a decent port of this game, I would have given it top credit, just because of the big balls they had to make something so extraordinary.\n\nIn the land of generic FPSs, a dime a dozen Early Access $h1t3, and copied to boredom 4x games, Deadly Premonition is the undisputed king, emperor, and penultimate ruler when it comes to creativity and fun storytelling. As of now, it is unfortunately a title you will have to suffer quite a bit of CTDs to play through, but to me that suffering have paid off in abundance.\n\nI am really not sure I can put it away, and I'm considering just taking small breaks every CTD and just naturally continue playing from my latest save point. There is no other great title, big bag of money, or warm and tight hole that would have me spinning 'round its little finger like this.\n\nI'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm probably letting uncle Deadly Premonition get away with it. Maybe you should too.","November 3, 2014","true","33.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","6"

The game has a very ugly graphics, nightmarish control vehicles and map interface is very weak but in my opinion the game makes up with a great story. About the game itself I must say that I played very nicely. The game takes on the character of the young FBI agent who comes to a small town in America to explain the mysterious murders. The game offers us an open world but it is boring and the tour it is very tiring. The advantage may be some side missions. Some of them are interesting and usually after finish it we get cards or quite useful stuff, weapons, suits or new cars. Soundtrack is good but sometimes goes weird music and i mean (using a Emilys car). The game has a very interesting but sometimes strange characters but for me another big advantage. Interface in the game you can get used to but this map is total fail. I personally love this game for amazing story and great characters and that joined to my favorit list.

DEADLY PREMONITION is one of the most memorable games I have ever played, but sadly not always for the right reasons. There is so much wrong with this game it’s not possible to list all its flaws in a brief review like this. Suffice it to say, it runs terribly on the PC with the longest load times I have ever encountered and more glitches than I could shake a stick at. The graphics are pretty awful (I used the DP patch which supposedly improves performance and graphics but it still looks like something from the early 90s). The controls are awful and if I hadn’t discovered a tweak that fixes a ridiculous aiming problem I would probably have given up on the game. The combat is hideous too, with the aforementioned dreadful aiming system and poor mechanics. Even the UI is an irritating mess. And yet despite all this I’m glad I stuck it out until the end (incidentally, despite having completed the game I only found a handful of the many side quests, as they are often time-sensitive and way off the main story track). So what’s good about DP? Well it certainly is quirky, and it’s easy to see why it’s gained such a devoted cult following. At its core DP has a very strong story backed up by solid voice acting. It has many weird and interesting characters and some crazy dialogue. Although it is derivative (Twin Peaks and Silent Hill are often-used comparators, and rightly so) it still has a unique personality. There’s no doubt that if DP had been produced to the same standard as a AAA game it would be outstanding. But unfortunately I can only recommend it if you have a slight masochistic streak, as, it appears, do I. There’s a five-star game in here struggling to get out but due to all its faults I can only give it 3.5/5.","March 13","true","38.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It's nearly unplayable, even with the DPfix installed. It crashes randomly so I had to replay parts of my missions several times. That remains only fun for so long. After the crashes the game suffered from terrible slowdowns, most likely related to a memory leak. I can only take so much before I get frustrated and stop playing. Deadly Premonition is one of the few games I will never take a look at again. And that's disappointing, because I usually love mysterious stories and Resident Evil styled gameplay. But please note: the game is slow gameplay wise: with every door you open, every car you enter, everything you climb on the game will trigger an animation. Boring... And it removes you from the experience at the same time.\n\nI can hardly recommend this because of the poor port, but as a game it's not all that terrible. Heck, it can sometimes even be enjoyable.

It will definitely stay within my top 5 games for a long, long time. I plan to at least do a second and third playthrough, if not more.\n\nBefore buying, there are 2 things that you must know:\n1. This is the very definition of a cult classic. If you find yourself only enjoying huge budget AAA games and never really straying into anything else, then perhaps this is not the game for you. This game must be played with an open mind, as it is very unique. Also, it is worth mentioning that the game really doesn't pick up until an hour or so into it.\n\n2. The PC port is not very good. I would only recommend buying it if you have intermediate computer skills, as you are going to have to edit a few files as well as apply a user-made patch, DPfix.\n\nThe story: Simply put, it's amazing. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent sent to the small town of Greenvale to investigate the murder of a local teenager. The story quickly picks up from here and sucks you in. I wish that I could be less vague about the story, but I risk ruining the game's 20+ hour run. This is the kind of story that keeps you wanting to play the game to see what happens next. It takes many sharp turns and streches across several different genres, including, but by far not limited to: horror, mystery, survival, comedy, and even some romance. I consider myself to be good at predicting storylines in games and movies, but even I could not predict hardly any of this game. It truly kept me interested until the very end. Speaking of the end, you may just shed a tear.\n\nCharacters: The characters in this game are incredibly varied and all have distinct personalities. I will certainly not ever forget any of them. The voice acting is great and really helps to bring the characters to life.\n\nGameplay: The driving is pretty awful but far from the worst I've ever played. The pause menu map only shows your immediate surroundings and cannot zoom out, rendering it useless. You'll have to pay close attention and learn the town if you want to get around. While this map issue was mildly annoying, it made the game a little more challenging. The rest of the gameplay is good, but nothing new or super polished. I would recommend using a controller, as the keyboard and mouse control for this game just feels clunky. The game is open world and each character has a routine that they do. This is important to remember, as they may not always be home for you to ask questions. There are some points in the game in which you must wait a certain amount of in-game time before moving on to the next portion of the story. This gives you time to explore all that there is to do in Greenvale, including a ton of side missions and collectible items.\n\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is great, and very memorable. I love the acoustic guitar song that plays at the main menu and at various points in the game. Each track suits the level that it was designed for, and nothing seems out of place. The only complaint I have is that the music volume levels occasionally overpower dialogue in cutscenes.\n\nOther thoughts: The game crashed to the desktop about a dozen times during my playthrough. The crashes all occured at set points in the game's story, so they are not random. There are some suggestions to remedy this with a quick search online though. I had luck passing these crashes by setting the game's launcher and .exe to Windows 98/ME mode and running as administrator. I am using an AMD gpu with the latest drivers (15.7.1 at time of writing) and Windows 7 64 bit.\n\nBottom line: If you don't mind the possibility of some technical issues and you are a fan of survival-horror/mystery games, by all means, buy this game.","October 10, 2015","true","24.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There is no 'yes' or 'no' for this game. Hell even if steam had it there isn't even a 'neutral' or 'maybe'. There is simply an\n'I don't know'. So this game has what I think is an interesting story line but it is done very poorly. It has bad graphics, glitches, and it crashed a lot for me and others at points in the game (though I think someone MAY have made a mod to fix this, I never checked.) to the point where I couldn't see the epilogue because it crashed every time I tried but there is still something appealing about this game I can't explain well. The core story is very interesting. The only problem is that this game could have been much better if they took out the bad combat system and spent the money on other parts. Not being able to change the resolution and the 'DP.exe has stopped working' though are the big part for me.\n\nThat being said I will still re-play it some day because I still like the story. As for anyone who wants to buy this game, You have to be aware that it doesn't feel good and have to go in with low expectations to enjoy it's random storyline. I guess that's the best way to put it. I would give it a...uhh...to be realistic 5.5/10 but I'm still not 100% sure how to rate it. You'll just have to buy the game when it's on sale as long as you can live with what the problems I stated to understand why this game is so good-bad. Though this game is a port and doesn't seem to crash or have most these problems on console so it may be worth buying it on an xbox than on steam.","August 18, 2014","false","21.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

While the premise sounds generic and cliche, Deadly Premonition is anything but that and is by far one of the most unique games I've ever played. Deadly Premonition features dated visuals, mediocre gameplay and more bugs than in your backyard yet it's still an extremely memorable and unique experience that shines most brightly on it's plot and narrative.\n\nWhile I'm first and for most gameplay over everything when it comes to gaming, Deadly Premonition is one of the only, if not the only game I'd recommend based on it's setting, plot and characters. The game is a mixture  of Thriller, Horror and Dark Comedy blended together in a extremely unique manner.\n\nWhile you may be put off by the dated, crude presentation and bugs this game possesses, it's still an experience that I couldn't recommend enough if you can overlook it's faults. It's so bad that it's a masterpiece, think of the film Troll 2 which is widely regarded as the 'best worst film' of all time and is an absolutely hilarious masterpiece for all the wrong reasons. The gameplay itself is somewhat reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 but has some awkward controls, thankfully this does little to affect the game as the focus is on it's incredibly strong writing.\n\nThe story is absolutely brilliant thanks to the writers eccentric and quirky style, there really is nothing out there like this. Again I do recommend caution when buying this game, you'll need to tweak a few things in order to even get the game to run and there are a few mods which enhance the visuals and allow the game to be played 1080p but that aside this is an experience that should not be overlooked if you're a fan of crime stories and unique writing.","June 9, 2015","true","33.7"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","2"

It can require a lot of messing around to even get it to run, and if you want it to run higher than 720p then you will have to install mods to achieve that. I would personally experience drops in frame-rate followed by the game crashing approximately every 2 hours on my setup but your problems may vary! (The director’s cut does have some pro's compared to the original even though it is a bad port - the controls are improved and the combat is easier - in a good way)\n\nIt's a testament to the compelling nature and uniqueness of this game that I would gladly put up with such an experience.\n\nYou play as FBI Agent Francis York Morgan who is called to a remote town called Greenvale to investigate a murder of a young woman - and it doesn't take long to become clear that there is something very strange indeed going on. The game has been compared a lot to the TV Show 'Twin Peaks' and it is a clear influence - for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it combines mystery with quirky characters and absurd happenings and this game is no different.\n\nIt is full of weird, cliché (in comedic fashion) and intriguing people - everyone has their own odd quips and interactions that make the game interesting and fun. It can be confusing at first as you try to decide if the game you are playing and the dialogue you are hearing is serious or not - but soon you will lose yourself in the combination of mystery and absurdity and want to experience all that Greenvale has to offer.\n\nThe game is all about the experience and storyline - you will drive around town and engage in combat throughout much of the game - neither of them are anything special. They are both very archaic and along with the graphics are not what you would expect in a relatively modern game. For my experience though I never had any particular problem with either of them, they are just not what make the game enjoyable. However, although the driving itself isn't great, there is something very pleasureable about travelling around the town and engaging in your day to day tasks like going to lunch with your police colleagues or going to a bar in the evenings to play darts and talk with the townsfolk.\n\nIt is the mad characters, the crazy music, the twists, the absurd and even genuinely touching moments that shine in this game and keep you coming back. I have never really ever experienced a game quite like it and (although I would love one) I will perhaps not play another like it again.\n\nA very unique game - one with plenty of flaws but also so much to love. I would recommend all people with an interest in story-driven games to try it out.","November 6, 2015","true","33.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Clumsy driving, a clumsy "open" world, but both things are charming and make you feel bit nostalgic. Or imagine 4D Sports Driving/Stunts with NPCs!\n\nImpressions:\nThe main character has a pleasant and calm voice and truly deserves all credit he gets. The main story by itself is alright, but I sometimes found it hard to care about certain secondary characters the game wanted me to care about.\n\nThey really wrote dialogue lines for each character, each hour and each day, which is incredible.\n\nThe action sequences can get old towards the end, but at least they contain a fair share of little puzzles.\n\nAs for the Twin Peaks similarities: I watched all episodes prior to this and I think DP has its very own spirit, probably because in TP, they never show how the locations are actually connected and thus it feels very small, like all houses are clinging to each other - whilst Greenvale seems\nvast, with lots of generous space. TP is about claustrophobia in a tiny town, DP is more about agoraphobia, the fear of being lost in a grand space and too many possibilities.\n\nI got the warp thing pretty late in the game and I almost drove everywhere in realtime because I enjoyed it.\n\nThings Deadly Premonition taught me:\n* How to read road maps under difficult conditions\n* "Bad" graphics are great graphics. I found most of the interior spaces quite pretty and the nature outside appropriately dull. (Seriously, this is what real nature looks like. A bit samey, green, not overly exciting.)\n* The value of a good car radio. Of my 50 hours+ in DP, I must have spent 15 hours listening to the honky Police Car Theme only, though there were other cars with different music, but the police cars are the ones you'll use mostly.\n\nVerdict\nIf you ever wanted a driving game with a story that isn't about a young hotshot's way to fame, this game is for you. Well, it certainly was for me. GOTY 2013!","January 4, 2014","true","68.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The near Frankenstein nature of this mish-mash of tones and mechanics will undoubtedly remind you of many products too.\n\nIt's not remotely a serious game, though it does have its serious moments and it benefits heavily from them. The much-touted awful combat becomes merely mediocre if you play it with a gamepad - and you should play it with one. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is exactly as mysterious as it tries to be (though in no small part due to its poorly-veiled source material) and even the art direction is consistent and visually appealing, graphical glitches and some aging NPC models aside.\n\nThe point is that many people have recommended Deadly Premonition on the basis that "it's so bad it's good". This isn't true. Deadly Premonition is a geuininely good game that has won a cult following despite its shortcomings - I fought tooth and nail to fully complete it simply because I enjoyed it.\n\nBut I wouldn't recommend that you play it, because I can't be sure you can.\n\nIt took me a good 45 minutes just to get it to start without crashing. Beyond that I was fighting through runtime errors, outright crashes, even the odd Blue Screen of Death - any moment in the game that had me go longer than 20 minutes without a save point was a nerve-wracking nightmare. These aren't some faintly annoying bugs and this game is infamous for its port for a good reason. Right up until the very end my playthrough was plagued by some unseen demon.\n\nFor the technologically savvy there is a unique and memorable gem here that has been sadly soiled by its monstrous technical issues. For everyone else, move on. Watch a playthrough on Youtube because it really is worth experiencing, even if second-hand.","November 3, 2014","false","49.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

What I expected is a detective game with paranormal twist, like Murdered: Soul Suspect. Long story short, it is not even close and fails in almost every aspect. Usually I leae positive reviews, but this game is really poor.\n\nThe gameplay is really boring, almost every part of it feels like a filler, leaving nothing interesting or captivating in the end. The game consists of several 'activities':\n\n1) Zombie shooter. It's very consolish (no wonder here), you walk around, shoot zombies in the head, collect weapons they sometimes drop and other items like coffee (any item is highlighted by bubbles visible a mile away). In certain rooms you can access your toolbox (an extra inventory, very gamey), save, sleep or change your suit (what for??? it's completely pointless).\n\n2) QTE sequences. They are brutal. You have less than a second to press a needed button, and there are several in a row. How about mash A and D - Q - R - mouse left click - E? The only way to succed is to die several times before you learn the entire sequence beforehand.\n\n3) Roaming around the town to get some quests that should earn you better weapons or some other stuff. Thankfully its optional because this is one of the most boring things I've ever saw in a game - bland town, bland streets, bland graphics. It's like a very poor attempt of a GTA clone. Another filler to extend the gameplay time IMHO. A side quest I completed consisted of finding a sports equipment lost in a police station for a police boss... fascinating!!! :)\n\n4) Watch long cutscenes with conversations. They are really weird. All characters lines, models and animations are so bland I couldn't believe it. You get a cop which is like a dumbest cops from all police movies combined. You get a police chick obviously interested in protagonist. You get a farmer which is ye olde standard farmer, salt of the earth. There are two kawai small boys who are like angels. And there is a main protagonist - yep, he is FBI agent with paranormal abilities! This is so new, wow, how could they invented that???! The entire game is like they took a standard B movie characters from 100 poorest movies of all time and made them even simpler than they were. It's hard to explain, but the entire story and characters feels like a caricature.\n\nSo a typical story mission consists of speaking with your police buddies (with long pauses and poor animations), driving a car for 10 minutes through incredibly bland looking landscape, watching another conversation where you act like a cop from B movie (or maybe Z movie?) and your buddies act like actors from 4th grade school theatre, then going in alone (of course), navigating a dozen rooms shooting zombies and collecting pointless stuff, then facing a boss and dying multiple times in a row before you learn that QTE sequence (good dog!). After that, if you are lucky and the game didn't crash (happens with a fix as well sometimes) you watch another conversation and the day thankfully ends.\n\nIncredibly bad and unfitting music adds the fun.\n\nThis is it. If there is a brilliant story, it is hidden too well under all this filler. I would think I don't like this game because I don't like Japanese games overall (they are too weird for me), but I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect which is also a console Japanese game. This one is simply a poor game with no detective gameplay. Heck, there is hardly any gameplay at all.","November 17, 2015","false","5.8"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","1"

There are some computers that the game just will not display properly on. It's fine on my AMD PC, but my Nvidia laptop can't display any text without severe distortion (both run 64-bit Windows 7, and have the same issue with Amnesia the Dark Descent). I don't know why, but if you can get a demo from somewhere to test whether it works, or check the forums, it might help. Also, this game is available on Xbox 360 and PS3, if you find the PC version isn't for you, although the PS3 version is the same as the Steam version (The Director's Cut).\n\nThis is one of the few buggy games I would recommend to people, and there are very good reasons why. For starters, it's horrifying and unique. The story sticks in my mind the way that Walking Dead has, and may I say, even more so.\n\nDid you like Twin Peaks? Do strange events picque your curiosity? Then this game could be for you. You play the role of a FBI agent with a split personality. The twist here is that you, the player, are treated like the secondary personality. York needs your help to solve a cross-country murder spree, which brings him to the town the game is set in.\n\nMr Francis York Morgan is thust into a stunningly creepy town that appears norma on the surface, but harbours secrets in almost every home. Help York to stop the Raincoat Killer, and oh so much more. Scratch away the surface and look deeper, take your time and explore the world, talk to people each day, and you'll experience the best this story can offer you.\n\nPlease, if you feel you can handle a few bugs, give this game a go if only for the plot. Save often lest it crashes (but I've had to do that with Saints Row 4 about the same number of times). This game isn't about combat - it's about everything else. Solve the puzzles, find rare items for townsfolk to help you in your mission, remember the past and recount the present.\n\nIf you fancy something strange, and you don't mind rough edges, *please* try this game. Wait for a sale if you're unsure, but don't let it pass by without trying it. Even a year after playing it, the 36 hours I spent in this world are still etched in my mind.

There's plenty of stuff here to strike down on. Poor graphics, the ocasionally terrible gamedesign, wonky animations, weird soundmixing, awkward gameplay, the map, bugs and the list goes on. But you would miss out on a truly unique and great experience.\nDP is the best FBI-sim/Twin peaks ripoff that money can buy.\nThe story is the games strongest point, a weird journey that's totally unpredictable and fascinating. The games protagonist is Francis york morgan, a schizophrenic fbi-agent sent to investigate a murder in the small town of Greenvale. He is by far one of the coolest characters i've ever played, and the story and game largely rests on his twisted persona. The relationship with his other personality, Zach, is interesting and in the end truly touching.\nOne of my favourite things about the game is the contrast between the wierdness, surreal parts and the ordinary mundane small town life. You can just cruise around, doing sidemissions and talking to the people of greenvale. also you can eat lunch, every game should give you the option of having lunch with some of the games characters.\nThe day/night cycle is pretty slow, so you have plenty of time to hang around.\nThe dpfix mod fixes some of the worst graphics and will enhance the experience alot. With that installed, just enjoy this game. It's sometimes terrible, other times beautiful, but always worth your while.

This is probably the most overhyped game I've ever played. I've read tons of reviews on different sites and in Steam and almost everyone claims DP to be an uncut diamond, an underestimated masterpiece, a unique experience and so on. After playing it for almost 25 hours and coming up to the end I felt kinda... frustrated.\n\nI must say that I really enjoyed its atmosphere and the first half of the story. I had no problems with graphics, poor animations, sound, controls etc. Everything was absolutely fine for me. I don't understand people who say it is a bad port, cuz it looks and is being played MUCH BETTER than on PS3. I don't understand the ones who play it with gamepad either cuz aiming with mouse is 100 times better. Everything was great for the first half of the game, but then...\n\nFirst of all, the game pretends to be open world. With side-quests from different civilians. Bla-bla-bla. All these "quests" are like "find an old lady's picture in HER ROOM" (probably she became absolutely blind in her years, I don't know), "find dead daughter's dress (in her room ofc)", "find sheriff's dumbbell", "find sheriff's assistant's keys" and so on. You got my point, right? Of course, there were some interesting quests like searching for dead man's bones and a map with secret passage BUT SUDDENLY...\n\n...the game stops to be openworld! For nearly ~4 or 5 last hours it becomes a straight 3rd person corridor shooter. And developers don't even warn us about this like "guys, soon you will be unable to complete your quests and other stuff" and just push you through till the end. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ quests I didn't finish! ♥♥♥♥ exploring! Surprise, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nAnother thing, last, but not least. ATTENTION! SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this if you still decided to buy and play this game!\n\nImagine that you are playing first Silent Hill, you enjoy every second of it and in the end of the game Alessa turns out to be a giant Godzilla with rocket launchers and a big pink ponytail. This is what I felt during the bossfights with George and Kaysen. I understand, that this is a Japanese game, it is supposed to be odd and weird, but Swery, seriously, is it some kind of trolling or were you just high? What the ♥♥♥♥, man?\n\nThank you for reading this if u did. I am not going to persuade you not to buy this game, I am just sharing my own opinion.

The best way I can describe this is L.A. Noire meets Silent Hill, and that is some pretty hefty praise coming from me. The action could definitely be annoying, not unlike Silent Hill, but the story and all of the little touches elevated the game well above the sum of its parts. Looking back, I wonder how many of the deadly sins the "big bad" committed throughout the game. I could think of a few right away once I realized his persona. My only regret is that I didn't start chasing the side quests early enough to get them all done, and I really can't recommend the experience enough.","October 8, 2014","true","32.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Yet I do recommend everyone to play the game at least once. This game must be experienced!\n\nHere are just some examples as to why the game is so bad-\n\n1. It's glitchy, it crashes a lot, and has lengthy loading screens\n2. Animations are silly\n3. Action is bad\n4. Voice acting is meh\n5. Gameplay is wonky\n6. Too many useless, lengthy driving sections (Driving was a horrible forray!)\n7. The map was frustrating to use for any sort of direction\n8. The ending after the climax and when everything was said and done really dragged on.\n\nThroughout the game there were multiple annoying, odd, or awkardly hilarious things. For example -\n\n1. I know the game is supposed to be "open world" but the world was downright boring.\n2. You have frequent conversations with your apparent imaginary friend which range from  hilarious to downright ridiculous.\n3. The soundtrack is always oh so appropriate. Especially the whistling song: that one's my favorite. (Sense the sarcasm)\n4. There are random big ♥♥♥ flies everywhere!\n5. If you use the siren in a police car for too long you get fatigued according to that indicator bar and you cant use the siren again until the bar goes back down. Also, if you leave the car after the bar has been maxed out, you yourself will be fatigued causing you to limp until the bar goes all the way down. I didn't realize it took so much effort to have a siren running in a police car.\n6. The dialogue!\n\nExamples of the aforementioned dialogue. And these are just a few of MANY -\n\n1. "My coffee warned me about it"\n2. "Who is that one Hollywood writer? Oh yeah, Joel."\n3. Quote from the fat guy in the game, "Chickening out now would be like leaving after appetizers."\n\nSo much to love here! Now go buy the game and load it up. Here are some tips for when you do -\n1. Always run through doors. It takes less time\n2. Running the game in compatability mode for windows 98 made the game crash less and it seemed to load faster in-game. Some of the cutscenes became laggy, although.\n3. About halfway through the game there's a mission where you follow a suspect in your car. It's super frustrating because driving is horrible. On top of that, the guy you're pursuing fluctuates between going 15-25 mph aka the slowest driver of all time. There is no good way to regulate your speed so you end up in "stop-and-go" traffic without any traffic. And here comes the tip... Don't accidentally bump the siren. You'll immediately have to start the mission over after what feels like 20 minutes of following the stupid ♥♥♥♥! GAH!\n\nIn a nutshell: This game is so bad it's good.\nOverall the story interested me: it kept me playing and wondering who done it... that and all the beautifully horrendous presentation! Truth be told, the game did wrap up nicely and there were a few unexpected things that made it at least sort of satisfying to complete. I recommend people to at least attempt a playthrough and one playthrough should be enough. I probably will never play this game again but, it sure did leave me with some fond memories!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiteflamekyo/recommended/247660/","whiteflamekyo","Kyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whiteflamekyo/","498 products in account","1. The Port,\nLet's get this out of the way. The port is bad. No graphics options, 720p only. This can be fixed by using the DPfix by Durante, and downloading HD fonts, HUD and icons.\nThe game likes to crash for many reasons and in many different ways. Most of them can be prevented by smoking cigarettes (in the game, but I can assure you it also helps IRL), editing the exe file with CFF Explorer, running the game with compatibility mode set to Win98, running the game in window mode and/or changing default controls to a gamepad.\nThere's apparently a bug that corrupts your save file, but I luckily haven't encountered that one.\n\nDuring my 29 hours of gameplay at least 5 of them I had to replay because of the crashes. Googling, setting and fixing stuff to be able to even play the game took me around another 3 hours.\n\nIt was worth it.\n\n2. The Gameplay.\nDeadly Premonition is an open-world survival horror detective action adventure game. You can explore (by foot and by car) the town of Greenvale at your leisure, doing side activities, like quests, fishing or collecting stuff. However, you need to eat and sleep (or drink coffee).\nDuring the main questline you mainly travel around, talk to people, solve simple puzzles and shoot some undead zombie-like things. There are also boss fights.\nThe combat generally resembles that of traditional survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Walk away from the enemies, turn around, prepare your weapon and shoot.\n\nThe attention to detail is especially worth the praise. You need to wash your suits and shave if you don't want to look like a hobo. When you pass another car at night, its front lights reflected in your own rear-view mirror will blind you for a brief moment. And car mirrors don't even work besides that. Other mirrors you encounter do work fine though.\n\nLet's not forget about the ridiculous, idiotic and totally uncalled-for QTE sequences. They're so bad, it makes them almost good.\n\n3. The Story.\nFBI agent Francis York Morgan arrives in the town of Greenvale to investigate a case of murder. Then appear the aforementioned zombie things making the whole plot a hillarious mess. The story is great, even though it doesn't make much sense. At least there are some nice plot twists and everything gets explained by the end of the game.\nThe cutscenes and dialogues are simply a piece of art. Thanks to the music completely unfitting the situation in most cases, they are genuinely funny.\n\n4. The Characters.\nThis has to be the selling point of DP. There's a lot of different characters and the great most of them have personalities of their own. York himself is quite an individual. He talks to his second personality, Zach, all the time, even with people around, without a trace of embarrasment. He's also a walking bag of strange habits and mannerisms.\nThe whole Greenvale looks like an uncanny valley. Getting to know those people is totally worth the effort.\n\n5. The Summary.\nDon't be discouraged by all those technical problems I mentioned (and those that I did not) - Deadly Premonition is a great game and the quality of the PC port doesn't change that fact in the slightest.\n\nObjectively 9.5/10.","May 27","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabgreen/recommended/247660/","cabgreen","cabrini green kun~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabgreen/","173 products in account","Deadly Premonition is a notoriously polarising game, lauded for its similarities to David Lynch's Twin Peaks, and criticised for everything that it is on a technical level. It has a doom-laden yet sleepy atmosphere, it mixes the grotesque with the mundane to excellent effect, its characters are fascinating, its hero is a monotone FBI agent that follows his dreams and intuitions with deadpan seriousness, its musical themes expose and mock the manipulative nature of music in games/tv/movies (corporate training video jazz played in dramatic moments, dissonance when ordering a sandwich), and so on.\n\nAnd yet when talking about its parts, the game is terrible. The horror sections of the game are awful because you can't walk and shoot at the same time. The map is unnecessarily large. It's sort of impossible to stumble into the wide range of side-missions available. The game has to be played with the its wiki open somewhere in the background and so the experience is never totally random or immersive. Accessing items and maps is difficult. Even then the map is impossible to use. Driving is awful. The animations look like The Sims c. 2004. And so on.\n\nAnd so it's more than the sum of its parts, and this is why those in defense of Deadly Premonition have made the case for it as an example of 'games as art'. As a work of fiction, it's very good, and as a game, it is awful.\n\nBut so it is worth comparing to other games that favour things like atmosphere and narrative over technical game-ness. To the Moon and The Walking Dead, for example. These games are adored by critics and gamers alike, but on the level of gamerliness, don't really add up to much. The Walking Dead's parts can be described as a glorified point-and-click, To the Moon as sort of the same but with even less agency on the player's part. So why is Deadly Premonition hated when those others are loved?\n\nThose other games knew what they were, and so they cut unnecessary 'game' parts out to streamline themselves as works of interactive fiction. But with Deadly Premonition, you're forced to play it. It makes the mistake of thinking that it could ever work as a conventional game.\n\nYou will drive for ♥♥♥♥ing hours, memorising directions from the map only accessible from the pause menu. You will yawn as York walks through doors but first checks what's behind them and this process somehow feels like it takes hours. You will yawn as you shoot ghosts from a stationary position. You will quit the game as you take a wrong turn somewhere and your car turns around really slowly and then hits a tree. You will wonder why the map is so large as you are driving for ♥♥♥♥ing hours and memorising directions. And these are all relevant criticisms because you're forced to do all of this and all of this will happen\n\nAnd yet you will delight in York's schizophrenic monologues to his imaginary friend Zach. On tedious drives you get Patrick Bateman-esque descriptions of 80s films and film scores, both insightful and disturbingly relatable. You will want to check up on townsfolk as they're genuinely interesting. You will wince as York mentions cutting off peoples' heads, peeing in their skulls, and drinking it, over dinner. You will be seduced by the game's drowsy tone, and every now and then the shift into horror will genuinely disturb you because for an hour or so you were comfortable. You might even get scared of the Raincoat Killer, although encounters with him are Quick time events and so feel like minigames.\n\nYou might not care enough to solve the mystery at hand, but as with Twin Peaks, this is beside the point. If you're happy to settle in for the experience rather than the game, Deadly Premonition is well worth your time.","July 7, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever.\nThe plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder.\nSo pretty much it is Twin Peeks.\n\nGameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue.\nFrancis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver.\nHe is Smug and a ♥♥♥♥ to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as "Zach" But I will not spoil how that ends.\nYork is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear.\nSpeaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it.\n\nThe gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless.\nYou probably will learn your way around the town.\nOr you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving.\nWhile you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the ♥♥♥♥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant.\n\nIn the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! "The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary."\nThe enemy’s you fight "all 1 of them" are called Mysterious Shadows.\nThey look like zombies with clown make up on.\nAnd they make stupid noises when they die.\nThe shooting works but it won’t blow your mind or anything but it works.\nMelee weapons work decently.\n\nThe game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief.\nIt's baffling when it happens.\nThe game in general is "unintentionally" funny.\nThe other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant.\nThere is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk.\nHe has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the ♥♥♥♥ing time.\nThere is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is.\n\nDeadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10\nAlso I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem.

It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.\nThe most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation.

Dialogue sometimes cuts off near the end of a sentence, music suddenly stopping while driving around, awful car controls, from the game randomly crashing, the impractical purchasing system which makes you buy one SINGLE item over and over instead of in bulk, its lengthy driving around town sequences (although teleportation makes this bearable later in the game), right down to some of its spoilerific achievements (seriously don't read them).\n\nBut on the other hand you've got a weird and wonderful world with a host of fascinating quirky and cooky characters you'll be talking to, in order to unravel a mysterious murder that has happened in this quaint little town as FBI detective Agent Francis York Morgan, who in and of himself is a very unusual man. In this, you will uncover an intriguing storyline of who-done-it that never gets stale or boring and makes the game very compelling. There's also a host of extra things to be done in Greenvale, with its numberous side quests, fishing and racing.\n\nIt is because of its story and characters that this game belongs in the upper echelons of "Weirdest game I've ever played", ranking up there with the likes of Gregory Horror Show.\n\nIf you can get past its technical faults, its definately one to experience.

So left it untouched until i got myself a good controller. DP's port is awful, honestly - no proper screen options and locked resolution, so it looked a bit weird on my monitor. A lot of bugs and glitches here and there, and it crashed on me every couple of hours or so, luckily nothing fatal enough to prevent me from beating it. But it did turn the rest of the game into "from checkpont to checkpoint" and sometimes made me worry about losing my progress more, than about what's actually going on in there.\nBut, aside from all technical troubles, Deadly Premonition is a pure gem. It's weird, it's strange, it's silly and charming, with not that good voice acting, hilarious face animation, great humor, old graphics, memorable characters, amazing soundtrack and interesting story, that will actually hit you in the face with a huge hammer in the last chapters - assuming you didn't give up earlier because of everything above.\nTL;DR an absolute must-have for everybody, who loves really good stories and can show some patience for clumsy gameplay and technical issues in order to see it all.","April 15, 2014","true","52.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Luckily theres a fix for most of the issues and if you disable steam overlay, you can play it, crash free prettymuch. Just dont alt+tab or do anything outside the game while playing.\n\nI absolutely love this game, its very story/character focused and both of those two are just batshit insane in a very charming way. The characters are so much fun, the story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The gameplay however is clunky, weird and feels like some really old Japanese RPG's in many ways and shares the many gripes that Jap games in general have, which would be clumsy menus, unnecessary button prompts here and there ect, but oddly enough, it didnt bother me that much. Killing baddies is kind of funny, but the general atmosphere is great and quite spooky at times too.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that get this on some console if you want to play it without any issues from the start, or get this PC version and be prepared to fix its many issues.

Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it.

But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.\n\nDeadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic "who dun it", story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.\n\nThe gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,\nbad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.\n\nNow, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed.  In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So far so good. Exceptionally good soundtrack I must note. Can't say much about the story yet, other than it starts off intriguing. Main character animations are cringe-worthy. The game obviously lacks the AAA (or AA) shine, and sometimes feels very amateurish, as far as gameplay goes. In a B-movie kind of way. Other than that the game looks promising so far, honestly.\n\nTrue state of the allegedly insufferably horrible port quality - it's definitely not good, but I don't think it's something overly serious or gamebreaking. Game lacks any kind of video settings (not even a resolution), controls are a bit clunky (until you get used to them) and are very obviously designed for consoles and feel kind of forced on PC. Other than that it runs fine so far, no crashes, no compatibility issues, no FPS drops, steady 60FPS here on a mid-range laptop (850M, i7-4710HQ, 8GB RAM, Win 10 64-bit). Meh, maybe I just got lucky.\n\nOnce I realized and accepted that this is no AAA game, it's pretty good so far. Looking forward for finishing it.

Bought this a second time on sale because it's good and I like the developers.\n\nWhen Deadly Premonition released years back, it was slammed by mainstream sites such as IGN for its subpar graphics and archaic controls.  Technically these reviewers pointed out the flaws this game has as a reviewer should, but they missed the magic this game seems to have for the players that love it.\n\nFor everything this game seems to get passable or "middling", there's something that makes you smile.  Driving is boring, but the conversations York has with himself make the long trips you have to take early in the game worth it.  You also do unlock and find better weapons and even some helpful abilities that make going around town easier later in the game.\n\nFans of Twin Peaks will get a more out of Deadly Premonition than other players.  I'll even go so far as to say that this is a must play if you like Twin Peaks.  There are plenty of subtle and not so subtle nods to that short lived television series.  The protagonist loves his coffee.  The town this game is based in feels quite similar to Twin Peaks and has quirky, memorable characters.\n\nThis was one of my favorite games of 2010.

The gameplay is pretty generic with a bit of quick time action buttons and inventory management of sorts resident evil style.\nFor achievement hunters, most of the achievements will be from doing the side quests or looking for items scattered around the map so expect to spend over 30 or more hours if you plan on getting 100% in the game. There will be a lot of driving around and there is no GPS guidance other than a huge arrow pointing main quest location, so you will need to use the map occassionally to find yourself around to the next point.\nGot the game for free during a bundle promotion, but I would say the game is worth it at a discounted price of atleast 50%.

I've never seen anything anything like it and I probably never will again. It's unique in many aspects, but the most important ones are: setting and pacing.\n\nIt's set in Greenvale, a fictional small town in USA, which has become the scene of a brutal, ritual murder. The player controls an FBI agent sent to carry out the investigation. There are many similarities to Twin Peaks as the game generally tried to capture the "feel" of that TV show and referenced it many times. This is why I consider this game unique - you're not shooting up gangs, terrorists or whatever, you're slowly getting to know inhabitants of Greenvale and drive from one place to other talking to people and trying to make sense of the case. While the game has quite a few action sequences, they're not what's most important, in fact they are very easy and poorly done.\n\nWhat's bad about this game? A LOT. While it's an open world "detective" game, it's very linear and doesn't have many opportunities for the player to show off his cleverness. The controls for both the character and cars are clunky. The game generally, from player animations, to map design, lacks polish. The PC port is atrocious, probably the worst I've ever seen. Graphics are PS2 tier, don't even try to play without DPfix and SweetFX. The game regularly crashes, always loads slowly, doesn't allow alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, has broken sound on non-stereo audio configurations, etc etc...\n\nDeadly Premonition is completely broken, there's no point in listing all its technical flaws, because there are just too many of them, Yet I'm still recommending it.

Through its many flaws, terrible vehicle controls, Bad Port, awful and stagnant level design and PS2 graphics, I really love this game. Its dark humor fantastic and sometimes hilarious soundtrack and its over the top ridiculousness make it amazingly addictive. I had no trouble in playing this for 2-3 hours straight, Except for the Driving control,it's making me crazy,just a little turn and the vehicle twist around lol but i'll get used to it. It has its moments of absolute brilliance for instance the opening sequence will astound you in how well it is put together.  The dialogue is incredibly silly but it adds to the overall experience. Imagine every silly and funny line in every video game ever and condense it down into one pot, That's what deadly premonition is. It will leave you thinking 'was this all a joke or were they serious when they made this?' If it was a joke they are geniuses, if they are serious they are geniuses. To sum up, one of the most special video-gaming experiences of the year.

It's not without its flaws, like a subpar combat system and bad graphics (even for the time), but it's totally unique and isn't afraid to experiment, something sorely lacking in other games.\n\nIf you own a Xbox 360, play the regular version there instead of this one. The little improvements of the Director's Cut aren't worth it, since this port suffers from common crashing issues and some bugs.\n\nHowever, a bad port is still better than not playing Deadly Premonition, so if this is your only option of experiencing the game, go for it. Just be aware of the following:\n\n- Check  the PC Gaming Wiki[pcgamingwiki.com] and its tutorial on installing DP Fix, SweetFX, better textures and solutions for crashing;\n\n- Always run the game directly through DP.exe instead of Steam or other methods;\n\n- In order to get an item that will make navigating through the game much easier and more pleasant, do Side Missions No. 004 & 005 (George's sidequests) as soon as possible;\n\n- Do not read the description of the Trading Cards before finishing the game, since some of them contain spoilers.\n\nF...

Story, characters and atmosphere are simply great. It is an open world mystery thriller with a strong resemblance to the TV series Twin Peaks by David Lynch, which is quite unique as far as I know. Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it. After many entertaining hours it was hard for me to say goodbye to Greenvale in the end.","August 8, 2015","true","48.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.\n\nDeadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic "who dun it", story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.\n\nThe gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,\nbad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.\n\nI cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.\n\nNow, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed.  In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.\n\n","August 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They have their routines, and what they have to tell you will change based on where and when you encounter them. Additionally, each of the game's side quests is an occasion to know more about those who live in Greenvale.\nAs a result, the world feels alive and inhabited, more than the vast majority of the open worlds I played, and I played a lot of them.","September 20, 2015","true","49.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Bought this a second time on sale because it's good and I like the developers.\n\nWhen Deadly Premonition released years back, it was slammed by mainstream sites such as IGN for its subpar graphics and archaic controls.  Technically these reviewers pointed out the flaws this game has as a reviewer should, but they missed the magic this game seems to have for the players that love it.\n\nFor everything this game seems to get passable or "middling", there's something that makes you smile.  Driving is boring, but the conversations York has with himself make the long trips you have to take early in the game worth it.  You also do unlock and find better weapons and even some helpful abilities that make going around town easier later in the game.\n\nFans of Twin Peaks will get a more out of Deadly Premonition than other players.  I'll even go so far as to say that this is a must play if you like Twin Peaks.  There are plenty of subtle and not so subtle nods to that short lived television series.  The protagonist loves his coffee.  The town this game is based in feels quite similar to Twin Peaks and has quirky, memorable characters.\n\nThis was one of my favorite games of 2010.

So far so good. Exceptionally good soundtrack I must note. Can't say much about the story yet, other than it starts off intriguing. Main character animations are cringe-worthy. The game obviously lacks the AAA (or AA) shine, and sometimes feels very amateurish, as far as gameplay goes. In a B-movie kind of way. Other than that the game looks promising so far, honestly.\n\nTrue state of the allegedly insufferably horrible port quality - it's definitely not good, but I don't think it's something overly serious or gamebreaking. Game lacks any kind of video settings (not even a resolution), controls are a bit clunky (until you get used to them) and are very obviously designed for consoles and feel kind of forced on PC. Other than that it runs fine so far, no crashes, no compatibility issues, no FPS drops, steady 60FPS here on a mid-range laptop (850M, i7-4710HQ, 8GB RAM, Win 10 64-bit). Meh, maybe I just got lucky.\n\nOnce I realized and accepted that this is no AAA game, it's pretty good so far. Looking forward for finishing it.

Do you have a PS3? If so, turn it on and download this classic. It really is one of a kind at the moment with no other game to compare it to. Sadly the PC port is a right pain in the a$$! I had to fight with it for way too long, starting my game over because of saves that corrupted.\n\nBy the time I was done trying to get the game to work, I was afraid to mess with any of the add on content and played it in windowed mode in fear of it crashing. With that in mind, this game loves a good crash more than Nascar fans. If I could I would tell you it was worth it since the game is amazing when it is working, if you overlook the low budget that is.\n\nYet, you might not at the moment have any other choice but to play it on PC. If you choose to endure that path, get ready to fight for your right to play the game without problems. Now with the port aside, the game is far from perfect at times even seeming to be broken in places. The vibe it sets and the story it tells is just so cool that you learn to live with the many flaws and ugly graphics.\n\nAlso it does have one of the most annoying boss battles I can remember right at the end, but this game is still great and different.

My coffee warned me about it." Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P\n\nI want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, "But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me." Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.\n\nThe small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think that’s the biggest strength in this game. It’s interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.\n\nThe gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, it’s quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and don’t flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5.\nThe worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as you’d expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.\n\nSecond? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1’s and those budget games you’d find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.\n\nSo yeah… vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In  the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I don’t know the development cycle and I don’t know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didn’t focus in… but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P\nOh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you don’t save… so it’s up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).\n\nThere are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:\nhttp://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_mods\n\nHope this helps… so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)","March 28, 2015","true","46.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This port is, to be frank, atrocious. I experienced a dozen crashes or more, three during the end credits alone. Furthermore, you need to use fixes to change the in-game resolution. The graphics lie somewhere between badly aged and horrible. And finally, the game mechanics are often stiff, walking on the border between being boring or laughable. Using a gamepad is recommended.\n\nBut with that said, what is offered if you fight past these issues is in my opinion nothing short of amazing. A quirky, twin peaks-esque world full of strange characters, weird happenings and charming dialogue, and a story that more often than not is wonderfully over the top.\n\nThis is not a game you should play for the gameplay or the visuals - its all about the experience of visiting the small town of Greenvale and its residents.\n\nSeeing this story through is nothing I regret\nDespite it being in perhaps the worst port yet\nTo Greenvale I think you should travel\nSo that this mystery, you can attempt to unravel\n\nSo says Mr. Stewart.","October 8, 2015","true","25.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","3","5","3","0"

I'm done trying to get this to work. For as ambitious of a game as Deadly Premonition is, this port completely ruins whatever might have been a good game. I spent almost 30 hours of my life dealing with crashes, glitches, and other glaring issues and even removing all of that from the picture the game still has its problems which makes it completely unforgivable.\n\nIf you have any interest in playing this game whatsoever I would recommend you try and find a way to play it on the original platform(s) (360/PS3) as the port is just awful. Even after applying the fan-recommended patches the game has a dice roll for every area you load as to whether it will crash the game. Loading times can vary from 15 seconds to 2 minutes depending on factors you cannot control. Without the graphics patch the entire experience is blurry and ungratifying.\n\nEven after patching the game and overlooking most of the porting issues. DP has fundamental problems with the aiming system which is very camera-dependent and glitchy at best. Vehicular controls are equally shoddy and the mapping system is more of a hinderance than it is a boon. The profiling sections serve more to cram ridiculously obvious information in your face than to reveal anything new and the chapter review quizzes are basically an insult to the viewer's intelligence ("HEY DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THING THAT HAPPENED 5 MINUTES AGO? HERE'S A QUIZ!!"). I really, _really_, tried to make this game work because it came off as highly recommended but the truth is it's just a mediocre silent hill clone with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ RE4 controls and a lamentable open-world system.\n\nI'm going to spend the rest of my "time" on this game watching a longplay just to see how the story ends. I recommend you do the same.","August 16, 2015","false","27.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Google DPfix - the patch made by a saintly individual who also rescued the Dark Souls port - as this is essential.  The controls will annoy you, the generally clunkiness will annoy you, and the combat will definitely annoy you.\n\nBut here's the thing:  I'm recommending it, and rather forcefully.  From a technical standpoint it's terrible, and don't get me wrong, it's shocking, but the actual content of the game acts as a huge counterweight.  You'll get over the annoyances and get sucked in to this little town, in which you can get up to what you're supposed to be up to as an FBI agent, or simply dawdle, have lunch at the diner, go fishing, then get hammered a bar in the evening.  You spend your time in this town however you choose to, and although the main plot is always there, waiting to progress and conclude, there's always time to just enjoy the town.  This is one of the few games in which you, as an agent of the law, can make the active choice to just have a day off - and that doesn't mean just pausing proceedings, it means potentially finding interesting side-stories as you take it easy.\n\nFor all that it lacks in the technical department, it does something that the Elder Scrolls games are vocal about doing but have yet to actually achieve:  a convincing town, with people acting as individuals with their own priorities and schedules.  I can't think of another game in which this has been achieved quite so well.","October 27, 2014","true","27.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Deadly Premonition tells the story of FBI Agent Frances York Morgan as he travels to the small city of Greenvale to solve a ritualistic killing which he thinks may lead to more. Deadly Premonition is a third person survival horror game with bits of comedy in it. You may think that sounds weird but it works very nicely. The comparisons to the TV show "Twin Peaks" are incredibly valid in setting, characterization & situations. I don't want to give away the story of Deadly Premoniotn as it's without a doubt the main draw. Agent Morgan goes into an "other world" when he's profiling and searching for clues. Here is also where you'll do some combat and a bit of minor puzzle solving. The story is so engrossing that you'll want to push ahead just to see the cutscenes which include great dialogue and voice acting. NOW the bad news. Deadly Premonition is a buggy console port.  The graphics are dated but serviceable. The biggest gripe is without a doubt the controls. To shoot guns is incredibly clunky as is the ability to use items. The driving is without a doubt some of the worst I've played in any game. Pole Position for the Atari 2600 is a breeze compared to this. And until you get the radio (if you ever do) you will drive A LOT. The two three tiered boss fights at the end also overstayed their welcome, the last being especially being an issue with the known aiming issue. This game is also very lengthy as it took me 30 hours to finish with only a few of the side missions completed. You will get your money's worth. Don't let the slow start fool you. The wonderful atmosphere, unusual music cues, the great story and amazing cast of characters more than make up for the many issues this game has.

I originally ignored it thinking it wasn't for me, then thinking it wasn't that great. Once the PC version was announced my interest in the game was sparked again, and I looked into it. Eventually got it as a gift on steam cause it was cheap and me and my cousin get each other games for our birthdays, and I am so glad I played it. Now, the thing about this game is the gameplay is not the best part. In fact it's a little weak, fun, but not too strong. It's obvious that they were indeed forced to include the RE4 style combat by the publisher, and I bet the game would've been better if more focus on the breath holding mechanic was your main way of dealing with enemies. Another thing some people might consider weak is the voice acting, and while it is "bad", a lot of people have such a charm to them that I actually like the voice acting. The games music is also wonderful, especially the classic whistle tune you hear throughout most of the game. The graphics while looking dated, don't look dated in a bad way to me. They give a cozy feeling.\n\nNow outside of things like music, graphics and gameplay, the PC version does have some notable issues. One is the lack of graphics and resolution options, which doesn't bother me but just cause I don't care doesn't mean it isn't an issue. The game also tends to crash, and for a while I had no way of continuing without using another save file ahead of me to avoid a crash, which fixed itself for me but not everyone. I'm not aware of any other issues, but if you find yourself discovering more issues before purchasing the game then look into getting the original release of the game on the Xbox 360, because while it has it's own issues the Director's Cut doesn't have, there are more game crashing, lag and other issues present in the Director's Cut versions of Deadly Premonition than there is in the original version.\n\nIn the end, besides that one crash I got which fixed itself I would highly recommend this game, on any platform, just that if you have any issues or don't want to take a chance get the 360 version of the game. If you need strictly good gameplay, which is what I usually need to enjoy a game, then you might want to pass on this game. I normally prefer the gameplay of my game be good, rather than my story or anything else (but music or story being better than gameplay so long as the gameplay is still really really solid works for me as well) but Deadly Premonition is just a case where even with gameplay that's only maybe a 5/10, the rest meshes so well together in a way that I just enjoy spending my time playing this game. I would probably say this is one of my top favorite games of the previous generation. Please do yourself a favor and give this game a try or play it.","October 15, 2014","true","17.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mage-7/recommended/247660/","Mage-7","Mage-7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mage-7/","261 products in account","Positive: game is somehow unique in some way (like Braid, Limbo, Alan Wake and etc.). I love those "unique" games which you can't see every day.. So I try to play them all.. This game is based on Twin Peaks (main plot almost the same, some characters are very similar in some details) so if you're a fan of TP you must play. However, before buying please read negative side. I bought it for 7 euro and still think price for this poorly optimized game is still too big. If you played Dark Souls (which is titled as one of the worst ports) and thought that DS is worst port try this game…. DS only problem was locked frame rates and resolution although no other problems I noticed...\nNegative: ou boy... where do I even begin from..? Well, I guess I’ll write about everything what I didn’t had positive opinion…\nSound: music and other sounds is nothing awesome. Problem is that it may stuck and loop again and again at some point (had a car brake sound loop). Problem is that IF you save (stupid that I did it) when this problem is occurring you're stuck with it even after PC reboot. Strangely enough it fixed itself after I progressed 2-3 chapters. Thank god... Unless you want to hear everywhere stopping car sound (even through cutscenes!).\nRagdolls/textures: during my gameplay I noticed few graphical issues (main character's tie was sticking from his belly to the back, sometimes his jacket mysteriously disappeared). It's nothing major although it annoys a little.\nGraphical look: this game looks like 2005 game.  Well at least it is at acceptable levels.\nEnemies: during the whole game you encounter only 4 types of enemies (sure they have different appearance or carry different weapons, but the fact is that it is SAME enemies only they carry or looks differently): shadow, climbing shadow, birds, dogs. Not to mention that 2 types of these enemies you can even not to notice (I barely noticed them myself and never killed or had to kill one of those 2).\nBoses: during the whole game you encounter X (I won’t spoil exact number but it’s only a few) bosses and they all are a joke once you know their weak point.\nCutscenes: although it occurred to very few people but the cutscenes may be shown to you upside down. I was one of those unlucky people. How do you like that? I browsed internet and some other games had this issue. It’s related to codec problems. Tried to install CCCP and K-Lite mega pack codecs but the problem persisted. (Good side is that there aren’t a lot of them + subtitles are displayed correctly so if you’re as am I more interest in a story it won’t bother you a lot).\nDungeons: once you’ll play your 4th or 5th dungeon you’ll realize that there is no benefit to kill enemies (except few times when they drop not ammo or medkits) because money is not an issue in this game. So you begin just run through them. These “dungeons” are boring and annoys a lot when you have to repeat them (if you want to collect all trading cards).\nLoading times: I store all my games on Samsung 840 PRO 500GB SSD drive (which is one of the fastest in SSD at the moment) and believe me when I say that you have to wait a LONG time to load this game different parts. I have to wait around 1 minute till it loads “Press Start button” (if I had simple HDD I probably would think that game is crashed), for every cutscene to load (if the game won’t crash) I’ll have to wait around 2 minutes before cutscene and around 1 minute after cutscene, if I enter somewhere (i. e. house) I’ll have to wait around 1 minute too (this is especially annoying because for example in L4D2 I have to wait around 10-20 seconds to load next map and graphics there are at least twice better, hell… I can even compare this games loading to  Windows 7 booting time… AGAIN 10-20 seconds…).\n\nOptimization (crashes): why I said that 7 euros is a lot for this you ask? Well everything above I mentioned is forgivable if not the OPTIMIZATION problem (yeah I wanted to type in the uppercase letters). This game crashes whenever it wants: it crashes during the loading screen, during the driving, when you try to open your inventory, on really rare occasion’s game crashes right when you launch it, hell it crashes before or even after the cutscenes (I really enjoyed this when I finish chapter and there are a few cutscenes… It crashed 5 times till I got to the words: “Do you want to save?” I saved the game and it crashed AGAIN. Good thing that I could continue from the save). So… In summary it crashes whenever it likes… Don’t forget that this game starts to lag after 30 minutes of gameplay. During constant crash you even can’t replay some chapters (I couldn’t replay chapter 7 even after 20th try…).  Not sure… Maybe crashes related to AMD card I have…\nFor those who gonna BUY THIS: use ALL available and possible fixes:\nIncrease game launch exe file max RAM memory access to more than 2GB (yes, the game has memory leaks due a bad coding i. e. after 30 minutes of playing it increases ram usage from 200MB to more than +2100MB and starts to lag a lot). Note: this “increase” method works only on 64-bit systems\nUse DPFix for desirable resolution (yes same story as Dark Souls… Devs couldn’t add support for high resolutions).\nSET DP.EXE and/or (I used same on both files) DPLAUNCHER.exe files to use Compatibility with Windows 98/ME and check mark “Run as an Admin”.\nShutdown your antivirus (at least for me it helped and crashes decreased even though whole Steam folder is added to antivirus exclusion list…).\nAnd yeah… Never do anything to stress your computer during this games’ gameplay or you risking with crash (for me even once occurred a crash while I tried to make a screenshot with steam integrated feature).\nFor those who doing all side quests: do them as soon as possible unless you want to experience more crashes (during chapter replay you cannot save) and to lose all your progress..\n\nSo if you still want to try your luck with this super SLOW and constantly CRASHING game be my guest. Just make sure that you apply all (or at least as much as possible) my suggestions… That way your game may become almost playable (you minimize crashing number as much as possible).\n\nAnd yeah although it annoyed me a lot I still liked game mainly due to it's story and gameplay :)","January 9, 2014","true","42.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/recommended/247660/","spincube","spincube","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/","310 products in account","Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.\n\nThis game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.\n\nYou know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?\n\nAnother thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.\n\nTechnical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain weirdness of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.\n\nIf you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.\n\nThe thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.","November 2, 2014","true","36.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is just weird in a good sense. I would describe it as a mixture of detective horror story, open world and police officer simulator.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the story. It is long (the main story took me more than 20 hours, and there are tons of side quests), full of interesting characters and unexpected twists. You as a detective York investigate the murder of a girl, and the further you go the better story gets. But not everyone will like this game because sometimes it gets weird - one moment you are terrified due to some horrible things happening and then a few seconds later characters make stupid jokes and laugh. So not everyone will like this mixture.\n\nI can't recommend it to everyone due to some other issue - stability. The port is not very good. Some people can't launch it at all, some others complain because game crashes every few minutes. I had a few problems, but luckily managed to complete it without any serious problems.\n\nDon't buy it for the full price. Wait for a discount and give it a shot.

This one right here.\n\nI've always been a survival horror fan, so it was pretty natural for me to pick this up on the 360 back then. I did not quite get what I was expecting. Deadly Premonition is Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill with many other influences thrown in and brewed into a cup of joe that, well, might be best left to interpretation. The game is not perfect. It's awkward at times, annoying at others, sometimes makes no sense and sometimes makes ALL the sense! (yeah) But in the end, I don't think I've forgotten a single thing about it. That is how it stuck with me.\n\nI admit, at times I sincerely hated this game and thought it was the worse piece of crap ever thrown together - a game that tried to be everything and yet couldn't find its place in a proper, comfortable gaming category. I ranted and raved about it to anyone who would listen - but this game was always on my mind. Did I stop playing? No. I HAD to keep going! And I did.\n\nI remember the day I finally finished it. I told myself "I will beat this game tonight! I will finish it and then I will never have to touch it again!!!" I believed it was doable. I thought I was near the end... And so I played. And played. And just when I thought it would be over... I was mentally exhausted but I couldn't stop! By the time I reached the end it was at least 3 in the morning, and I just sank down in my chair and looked at the screen to see the credits roll by. But even then I was still thinking about it.\n\nIt was a gaming experience I have never forgotten. And now I'm ready to do it again!\n\nThank you, Deadly Premonition, for scaring me and driving me crazy (and also thank you for letting me figure out who the killer was a little ahead of time because of my own clue hunting effort. That was rewarding). And thanks for keeping me awake and for completely exhausting me with your twisty plotline. For that, you earn a special place on my lifetime gaming list.","November 30, 2013","true","57.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This game is filled with a ton of issues similar to Dark Souls, it may not have GFWL but instead you must run it on Windows 98 if you don't want it crashing on you all the time. There is a Dark Souls patch as well from the same guy for this game. Now even with all of its issues this is the definitive version to play due to the poor framerates the PS3 version of Director's Cut receives.\n\nImagine that old David Lynch classic Twin Peaks was made in to a game, sure there's Alan Wake with all of its homages but what if it was a full blown video game. This is exactly what that game would be, it may be from a Japanese perspective but it's all there. The mysteries, the drama, the characters, the large open world in a small countryside town. What it lacks in graphics and gameplay it makes up for with charm. All the characters have their quirks and the world feels alive. You can spend plenty of time in the world without participating in the crime. This is a game made for fans of Twin Peaks. It's still possible to enjoy without watching the show but you might not be able to fully appreciate this beauty and it may be very difficult to get in to. I would recommend this to any fan who just want to relax in this fantastic simulator.","May 28, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Deadly Premonition is a Twin Peaks homage that similarly involves an eccentric FBI agent (Francis York Morgan) as he's called in to investigate a terrible murder in the small, rural community of Greenvale.\n\nThe game takes the player along for a ride with Special Agent York (please, call him York, it's what everyone calls him" and the friend only he can acknowledge; Zach, as together they question the locals, look for evidence, buy crackers for $44 and... shave?\n\nBalancing open-world driving and walking, side-quests, gunplay, humour and emotion is a tough task. The gunplay is poor (although improved over the Xbox version), the car (especially the initial one) handles poorly and the game has a habit of using inappropriately "wacky" music for serious situations... so believe me when I say that a game would have to really pull a cat out of the bag to overcome those, question is, does Deadly Premonition?\n\nYes, yes it does. Memorable and endearing characters with distinct personalities and interactions that keep you half rooted to your seat and half mind-fuzzled with a big stupid grin on your face, a creative and emotionally-driven story that's entirely unlike anything (bar Twin Peaks) that I've seen anywhere else.\n\nYork and Zach in particular deserve special mention for being particularly great, from their serious "discussions" about the case, to the smaller, random car conversations about DVD special features and "Jaws" amongst other things. On the flip-side, the Raincoat Killer is a fantastic antagonist, steeped in mystery both magical and mundane that'll make you -really- want to know who's hiding under that hood.\n\nDeadly Premonition has it's problems, but it compensates in so many other ways beyond that, that it's easily within my top 5 games of all time. There's nothing else like it and fans of detective stories (Twin Peaks fans in particular) are doing themselves a disservice not giving it a go!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, the game is roughly between 15-20 hours long depending how sidequest happy you are. Not a bad mileage for a cheap, low-budget game.","January 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, the core of the game's story, the characters, the setting, the story, the mystery, is just so god damn solid that I was willing to overlook the PC port issues. For some reason, you go back and play this game, it is its overall  ''charm'' of this gem that makes you forget about all the technical issues.  The janky animations, the voice clips, the terrible and unaccurate controls, the comically bad car handling, the chilling but also vivid music, and some other oddities seem to just fit so well with the game. Recommended 100% if you are into horror games. If you are a graphic core, do not judge this game for its poor graphics, otherwise you will miss one of the weirdest and unique games of gaming history.\n\nP.D Some tips to avoid techincal issues:\n1.- Always save your progress!\n2.- Execute the games as windows 98 compatibility mode and run it as administrator.\n3.- To avoid black screens when you quit the game manually, minimize the window game and close it with right click.\n4- When you start playing the game ok, then it starts dropping the framerates and keep 20fps, minimize the gaame and close the window. Enter the game and load your progress and game will run fine smooth again. Do this every 1h of gameplay. It seems the engine overload when playing for +1h so the game will lag, loading screens will take forever and get black screens.","March 19, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The side quests, silly as they may be, seem to fit in the world.\nSeldom does one come across a game that can make the gamer so immersed, it has the ability to frighten, make one laugh out loud, as well as puzzle and feel sad.\n\nCult classic: The mystery, the music, the ugliness, the beauty, the people, the humour, the dialouge...

A terrific game to play if you're interested in Twin Peaks or The X-Files.","January 27, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Deadly Premonition is a Twin Peaks homage that similarly involves an eccentric FBI agent (Francis York Morgan) as he's called in to investigate a terrible murder in the small, rural community of Greenvale.\n\nThe game takes the player along for a ride with Special Agent York (please, call him York, it's what everyone calls him" and the friend only he can acknowledge; Zach, as together they question the locals, look for evidence, buy crackers for $44 and... shave?\n\nBalancing open-world driving and walking, side-quests, gunplay, humour and emotion is a tough task. The gunplay is poor (although improved over the Xbox version), the car (especially the initial one) handles poorly and the game has a habit of using inappropriately "wacky" music for serious situations... so believe me when I say that a game would have to really pull a cat out of the bag to overcome those, question is, does Deadly Premonition?\n\nYes, yes it does. Memorable and endearing characters with distinct personalities and interactions that keep you half rooted to your seat and half mind-fuzzled with a big stupid grin on your face, a creative and emotionally-driven story that's entirely unlike anything (bar Twin Peaks) that I've seen anywhere else.\n\nYork and Zach in particular deserve special mention for being particularly great, from their serious "discussions" about the case, to the smaller, random car conversations about DVD special features and "Jaws" amongst other things. On the flip-side, the Raincoat Killer is a fantastic antagonist, steeped in mystery both magical and mundane that'll make you -really- want to know who's hiding under that hood.\n\nDeadly Premonition has it's problems, but it compensates in so many other ways beyond that, that it's easily within my top 5 games of all time. There's nothing else like it and fans of detective stories (Twin Peaks fans in particular) are doing themselves a disservice not giving it a go!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, the game is roughly between 15-20 hours long depending how sidequest happy you are. Not a bad mileage for a cheap, low-budget game.","January 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, the core of the game's story, the characters, the setting, the story, the mystery, is just so god damn solid that I was willing to overlook the PC port issues. For some reason, you go back and play this game, it is its overall  ''charm'' of this gem that makes you forget about all the technical issues.  The janky animations, the voice clips, the terrible and unaccurate controls, the comically bad car handling, the chilling but also vivid music, and some other oddities seem to just fit so well with the game. Recommended 100% if you are into horror games. If you are a graphic core, do not judge this game for its poor graphics, otherwise you will miss one of the weirdest and unique games of gaming history.\n\nP.D Some tips to avoid techincal issues:\n1.- Always save your progress!\n2.- Execute the games as windows 98 compatibility mode and run it as administrator.\n3.- To avoid black screens when you quit the game manually, minimize the window game and close it with right click.\n4- When you start playing the game ok, then it starts dropping the framerates and keep 20fps, minimize the gaame and close the window. Enter the game and load your progress and game will run fine smooth again. Do this every 1h of gameplay. It seems the engine overload when playing for +1h so the game will lag, loading screens will take forever and get black screens.","March 19, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/recommended/247660/","spincube","spincube","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spincube/","310 products in account","Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.\n\nThis game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.\n\nYou know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?\n\nAnother thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.\n\nTechnical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain weirdness of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.\n\nIf you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.\n\nThe thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.","November 2, 2014","true","36.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game originally came out on the Xbox 360 in 2010.  It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.\n\nMake no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.\n\nSome of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.\n\nThis is pretty important; if you don't do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the "quirky dialogue" as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.","December 25, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is "improved" version.\nOk. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this...\nAudio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw.\nYes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)!\nMy only motivation for beating this game was story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akatsuki_Dawn/recommended/247660/","Akatsuki_Dawn","Flawed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Akatsuki_Dawn/","387 products in account","How do I describe this game in one sentence? "It's so bad it's good."\n\nDeadly Premonition is a game I have only played for five hours, but am completely in love with. And by all rights, I shouldn't be. The graphics are PS2-era, the combat is mostly a Resident Evil 4-esque "stand still and aim with a relatively poor laser sight" system against enemies, the voice acting is often laughable, the music is repetitive (I'm pretty sure there are only about five or so tracks) and often plays at the most random and unfitting of moments... It's a recipe for an absolutely terrible game.\n\nIn fact, I quit during the first half an hour, regretting my buy. But something... Strange.. Urged me to go back to it. Perhaps it was my desire for a survival horror game that I've never played before, or just that I was bored out of my skull and decided to give it another chance, I don't know... But I'm so glad I did.\n\nThe first 20 or so minutes is a really bland, boring, linear shooting section with minamilistic horror at best, but once I got past that, the game, and indeed the world, opened up.\n\nThat was my first surprise: the game is open world. It's quite large, too, filled with interesting characters, side-quests and locations to visit. And facial animations, oh lord, those facial animations. The main character sometimes smiles a smile so horrifyingly terrible that I'm almost convinced it's actually a genius ploy by the developers to show how Detective York might actually have some sort of severe autism and is incapable of natural emotion. He sure seems like it, sometimes.\n\nDetective York is the strongest point of the game. An antisocial FBI lone-wolf detective/criminal profiler. York's character ranges from amusing, to awkward, to being an absolute ♥♥♥♥. He's completely foreign to socializing in the 'normal' way and doesn't care to hurt feelings if it furthers his case. He also has a (perhaps unhealthy) interest in the murders of young women, knows everything there is to know about terrible 80's movies and... Oh yeah, did I mention he also talks to himself? The mysterious Zach (who I'm certain is actually supposed to represent the player, but there might be a big twist that I don't yet know about) seems to be some kind of imaginary friend, or split personality, that York often converses with, though you never hear Zach converse back.\n\nYork is also an absolute genius, as proven at multiple points throughout the game. He solves riddles, rolls his eyes at stupidity and sees those miniscule details that solves cases that no-one else seems to see. He's also good at reading people, too. This leads on to the second strongest point: the plot. I won't spoil anything, and I haven't gotten too far yet, but so far I'm absolutely enthralled by this game's story. The characters are all memorable (if unintentionally awful and hilarious) and the crime, concerning that of the ritualistic slaying of the town beauty Anna, is brilliantly thought out and genuinely interesting to experience and solve - which is the main storyline of the game.\n\nGameplay-wise, Deadly Premonition has so far been split into two sections: the "open-world" section, during which one is free to travel (except for certain missions) around a clearly polygonal and badly textured landscape that is somehow full of character. York can interact with people, go to stores, complete side-missions, solve puzzles and look for clues pertaining to the case. He must also keep tabs on sleep and hunger, which both decrease over time and give debuffs to his stats.\n\nThe second section is the combat section, which is almost a dungeon crawl. Here, York encounters supernatural enemies and phenomenom, and has his run-ins with the games primary antagonist, The Raincoat Killer. As explained earlier, this section mostly involves shooting or battering down enemies (with melee weapons that break over time), solving puzzles and finding clues. A friend has told me it also grows to include chase-sequences and hiding-sequences in the future. York also has limited stealth capacity, in which he can hold his breath to become invisible to enemies. This has limited use, but is a good addition non-the-less. Shooting involves standing still and aiming the weapon, though guns have a rather difficult to see laser sight which makes aiming at distance hard. Enemies are zombie-like, but can have sudden bursts of unnatural (and creepy) speed and groan out things like "don't want to die" when you kill them. The two primary stats in combat are health and heart-rate/stamina. Health is self explanatory, while stamina is interesting in that it contributes to your tiredness, but also decides how long you can sprint and hold your breath. Your stamina recovers quickly when idle, so it's not a big problem.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about these supernatural sequences is York's reaction.. Or lack thereof. He doesn't actually seem to give a ♥♥♥♥ that all these completely insane and clearly supernatural-in-origin things are going on. He never reacts negatively, nor does he ever tell anyone or even so much as ask "did you see that?!". It's part of his charm, and makes sense in that it adds to the possibility York might actually be a fearless, no-♥♥♥♥-giving psychopath, or at least a cold-hearted ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game to EVERYONE. This is one of the few games that gets a perfect score from me... An absolute 10/10, despite the poor graphics and PS2-era gameplay.","May 12, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a terrible port from what I've been told and have experienced. However, though I think I'm only about halfway done with the game I have only experienced 1 crash so far... thought it was game breaking until I switched to Administrator mode for the game and the compatability for win 98.*\n\nSo far... this is one of those games that's so bad that it's good... And I mean that in a way in which no matter what platform you play it on, it will have some faults, but just the fun, interest in the plot, and characters and what not are gonna get you hooked on this game. If I play a bad game it's usually to torture myself for an audience, but this is a game that is instead very enjoyable even with it's faults.\n\nThe dialogue is some of the most ridiculous you'll ever hear and it is just god damned beautiful. It feels like a B-Movie on a low budget, but the director and the actors would have fun with it if it were an actual movie (which by the way the main character while driving WILL tell you some interesting movie trivia). The characters are for the most part likable and each have their own personality.... and... tend to overexaggerate their gestures while talking (seems to be very on purpose in all of it). The music is really damn good in my opinion. When the song, "Life is Beatiful," plays it will get stuck in your head, and it always seems to play at some of the most unappropriate spots.... just... making the situation that much wierder (perhaps it plays at such spots because it what the main character, York, feels at that moment.... simplicity in life).\n\nThe controls, on the other hand.. are what set me off a bit.... So many times I wish I could walk or run while I shoot a gun or swing a crowbar, but instead I am locked in place and can only aim. Seems to be a control sceme that even older Resident Evil games suffered through. The driving in the game is very weird to me as well. You can buy new cars in the game, each with it's set of speed and steering difficulties. However, I found myself always having trouble turning or turning too hard and spinning out... or hell even parts of the road that will have the car think it's Ryu or Ken from Street Fighter doing the Hurricane Kick!\n\nOne more gripe I HAVE to mention with the game is the map. It is one of the most difficult maps I've ever had to handle for one SIMPLE reason... It cannot zoom out far enough to properly know how to get from point A to point B, unless it is directly related to a plotpoint mission. If I want to do some side missions or go to the diner or gas station, I have to either start at my car and pan up the map until I HOPE to see a path that will take me to my desired location, OR I have to flip through set locations using the left or right bumpers on my controller and then from there try to search for the location of my car. It is very annoying, tedious, and frustrating. It would have been nice to either be able to zoom out even further to see more of the map, or even if there is a way to set your own waypoints like the game does for you when you have to proceed with the plot (seriously.... if there is a way to do that and I just can't find out, please message me and tell me how! Would help me greatly!!!).\n\nWith all that has been said, I still really enjoy this game and would recommend it! Just take caution, however, that it MAY or MAY NOT work on your pc, not matter what your specs are. Youtuber and Twitch Streamer Cryotic stated he can't get this game working on his rather powerful gaming set up, and yet I'm able to play this on a rather standard laptop myself, so... you have been warned... it may not work. I took the risk and was able to fix my one crashing issue thankfully by switching the compatability and turning on admin mode. Also do NOT GET THE DPFIX JUST YET!!!! It is still in alpha and needs to be throughally updated before it will do any sort of good... Tried it, and had to reinstall the game to make it work again...\n\nAnyhow, I talked on far too long. The bottom line is this is a good game! Give it a shot! If too afraid for the PC version, try it on xbl or psn!","March 24, 2015","true","23.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are those who see it as a masterpiece granted by god and those who think of it as a work of the devil. I belong to the first group. The game has a charm in spite of and because the horrible graphics. It also has quite a nice soundtrack. What also contributes to that charm is the fact you have to eat and sleep to stay functional. You can change or clothes and shave yourself. There are many side quests and activities that you can do beside the story. Depending on weather, date and time, different ones are possible. The rewards are various and sometimes really amusing, useful or just cool like new weapons It is difficult to explain but it somehow everything seems to fit together and create a wonderful atmosphere. Further, many of the characters are unique and stay in your mind. From the FBI investigator with the split personality to his enemy, the Raincoat Killer, a legend apparently come to life and many, many other eccentric ones, they are all likeable. Last but certainly not least the story, which is the greatest thing about this game. As Francis York Morgan, you have to investigate the murder of a woman in a town named Greenvale. This murder though is just the beginning of a series of events that is not like anything you´ve ever seen before. The story has so many unpredictable twists and barely anything is a cliché. You only get to know slowly what´s going on, but that makes the ending, which is really great in my opinion, so much better.\n\nAs already mentioned, the graphics are quite bad and also the keyboard control takes time to get used to. Especially the driving control can be really annoying, but the story is absolutely worth it. There are many people, reporting that they couldn´t even launch the game and I also had to start the game in a different way than using Steam, but that was really not that difficult and shouldn´t be the reason for not playing this masterpiece. If you´re a fan of a deep, slightly horror story that will shake you to your very foundations set in an open world with a lot of activities and if you don´t care too much about graphic, then this is just the game for you.\n","November 11, 2015","true","38.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't care about uprates on steam or whatever it's called. I don't even understand why people say +rep. I just don't want someone to buy this and then have the same issues I'm having as well as the rest of the players who own this. You can see all the issues just by visiting the community hub and seeing all of the people who have this and other issues. Also the issue I'm about to explain has never happened to me until a week or so ago and I've owned the game since October of 2014 I believe. Seriously view the community hub or read whats below this long boring explanation so you can see what you'll be getting yourself into if you decide to buy this game.\n\nP.S. I bought it on sale for $4.99 so I don't feel like an idiot for buying a game that's buggy as fk compared to paying $24.99 for it which it isn't worth IMO because of all the issues.\n\nI cannot get this game to run whatsoever anymore. Whenever I click play it immediately says "dp.exe has stopped working" and 1 second or less after that is switches from trying to find the solution to "close/cancel".\n\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified the integrity of the game cache, I have even watched several youtube videos watching people fix it by clicking on properties - local files - browse local files and then only to see that for some reason no matter how many times I reinstall the game I am missing 3 files inside the local files where you can find the .exe to launch the game aka the binaries folder basically. I ended up downloading dpfix 0.9.5 but that didn't help at all. After downloading the dpfix 0.9.5 I have all the files and tried to start the game. Crashed same as before. I followed the video showing me what to do with the files that I now have. Crashed again the same as before. I've been told that downgrading my nvidia drivers or graphics or whatever it is by 5 updates or so might help but I haven't tried that yet because I just don't feel like doing that atm. I've done several other things but they've slipped my mind atm. If I remember them I will come back and add them.\n\nLink to one of the youtube videos I watched - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtqvAtfYDqE\n\nWatch this video before you download dpfix 0.9.5 to see if you have the same files as the person in the youtube video.

Granted, there are some people who successfully installed and ran and even played it, BUT there are many many  others, myself included, who have tried and failed multiple times to play it.\n\nGenerally, I usually chuckle at people who have problems installing a game but this time the joke is on me.   I tried three different PCs, nothing funky in the hardware and OS of any of them (all Win 7 64bit).  Long story short, I did manage to run the game.   My gameplay (after actually entering the game) consisted of one interaction before the game crashed.   Repeated attempts came to the same conclusion:  it seemed that any interaction caused the game to crash.\n\nThere are a number of so-called fixes, none of which worked.  An amusing one requires you to run the PhysX driver over again, first to uninstall and then to reinstall.  This actually works, sorta.    It allowed me to get behind an instant crash and get the game running.

Sounds freaking AWESOME, don't it?  But let's take a closer look...\n\nYour character is an FBI agent, who has frequent conversations with some imaginary (?) person in his head.  This would be a fascinating enough idea...except that he does it RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE, and no one flinches an inch.  He drinks cup of coffee after cup of coffee just to read the tea leaves at the bottom...in fact, one of the main, recurring "side-quests" of the game seems to be the eternal quest for a cup of coffee.  And when he finds a cup of coffee, or a tin of pickles (branded "The Pickles" on the label, not bizarrely at all I'm sure you'll agree), we get a spooky little tune to, er, remind us that this is supposed to be a spooky-arsed game even if nothing particularly spooky has happened for the last half-hour of gameplay.  WEIRD, maybe...there is weirdness aplenty...but the spookiness is a little more on the sparing side.  At least as far in as I have played this game.  Maybe I'll try and play it again some other time, but for now I need a break 'cause, quite frankly, MY ♥♥♥♥ING HEAD HURTS.  Sincerely.\n\nHere's some of the other madness you'll encounter, should you be brave enough.  There's wooden crates, in various public places.  You can "push" them.  But instead of pushing them aside to reveal something, like in, say, the early Resident Evil games, you just push AGAINST them until they shatter under the sheer Herculian strength of your besuited character, sometimes revealing cash.  Cash you can use to buy live worms and a fishing rod from the strange old lady who runs the huge hotel where no one else is staying, so you can nip out to the back of the hotel and catch yourself some fish.  To eat, I presume (I didn't quite muster up the courage and/or patience to try this theory out).  There's a couple of bars in town which you can apparently visit, one of which is called...wait for it...The Galaxy Of Terror.  Which appears to be an oddball reference to the semi-obscure 80s horror movie of the same name, which I guess is meant to tie in with the recurring thematic of quirky low-budget 80s horror films which is fleshed out further in the conversations our protagonist has with himself/his split personality whilst joy-riding around in a police car which he has freely been given the keys to (along with the apparent permission to blare sirens, beep horns and run into other cars with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever).  I mean, c'mon...I love The Deadly Spawn from 1983 as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I need to hear the name of its director and fascinating little tidbits about it having a completely different crew to its sequel, while I'm supposed to be driving to a police station to find out some information about a murder victim.  Whose file has been lost by the nerdy, quite possibly homosexual deputy who then spends hours looking for it while you can pop downstairs for a quick nap in the cells (to replenish your "tiredness" meter, of course...there's a hunger one too, hence the aforementioned coffee and pickles and fish and, er, lollypops and crap like that as well).  Next thing I know, it's 5pm and the police station decides it's closing time - "come back tomorrow" - and while I'm driving back to the hotel after an amazingly productive day of stealing freshly-made cups of coffee from unoccupied hotel rooms  and completely failing to find out ANYTHING whatsoever about the ONLY murder case the sleepy little town has had in eons from none less than the police department, I decide to stop by and investigate a completely random letterbox outside someone's house and find some pistol ammo in it.  As you do.  Oh, and there's at least five or six cops in the police station at any one time, and if you try to talk to the majority of them your character decides that "This person probably has nothing to do with the investigation".  I guess they must need all those surplus cops to do traffic duty in a town with absolutely no bloody people in it, and couldn't possibly spare the manpower to contribute to the solving of a perplexing and incredibly rare murder case...\n\nWhat...you're STILL reading this review?  Okay, should I mention some of the technical problems then, like the fact that the mouse is INSANELY oversensitive to the point where your character spins almost 180 degrees with the faintest movement of one's hand - running around is a particularly enjoyable chore herein - even once you reduce the mouse sensitivity to its absolute minimum, which you can only do in the game's launcher, meaning you have to exit the game to perform such a privileged function?  Ah, look...seriously...I'm done.  I don't even want to think about this any more.  Like I said, I HAVE A HEADACHE.  I wanted this game to be good.  It looked so much like my cup of tea...er, coffee...er, t-tin of pickles...\n\nOh man, I'm gonna have nightmares tonight.  And not the type which I WANT games like this to give me.  I'll probably be wandering around an endlessly huge and empty hotel searching for warm beverages and canned food all night.  I swear to God, if I develop yet another bloody psychological quirk from this game, like never being able to look a tin of pickles in the face again without suffering a nervous breakdown, I am going to SUE THE DEVELOPERS.  I just wanna go to bed, and maybe cry myself to sleep.  I can't take it any more.  I'm sorry.  I just can't...I just can't...\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","January 1, 2014","false","3.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","1"

The life like animation engaged me on not only an emotional level but that of a spiritual one as well. The picturesque enviroment had me on the verge of tears in terms of sheer beauty; the amount of love the developers put into making every drop of water in the lakes and every leaf on the trees shows their commitment to the art that is VIDEO GAMES. The subtle yet numerous pop culture references to movies and films also shows how up to date and hip this studio is. The sound quality and level of fidelity to it is in of itself amazing, the character's voice actors really engage each other with passion for the roles they play.\n\nIn short this game is the Citizen Kane of Schindler's Lists' and is truly deserving of being called art. if it was any more perfect I'd need to check myself for testicular cancer.

I mean, it's based on Twin Peaks, and amazing TV show, that still to this day is relevant, and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are so many bugs, crashes, and errors that this game is hard to recommend. Hard, because I WANT to recommend it, but when a game is as faulty as this one, I simply cannot endorse it.\n\nThese Japanese developers cannot hide behind the quality of their games anymore, when offered on consoles. They need to put forth the effort to make them playable on PCs as well, something they seem reluctant to do. It's unfortunate, because I love a lot of the games Japan offers, but I cannot in good conscience stand behind something that is so obviously  flawed in the PC market.\n\nEven the much maligned Konami(boy is that a change given how much they were loved through the 80s and 90s) offers ports that are better performing than much of the Japanese games in the PC games market. It's really unfortunate, since I don't think PCs are beyond Japan's understanding. They seem to be people with a great understanding of electronics, yet play by the rules of consoles, and not the openended way of PCs. I hate to break it to Japan, but choice is a way of life, and rigidity enforced by consoles is simply a way of the past. The PS4 and XBone are proving that. They came out recently, and yet are far behind the PC market. People who want more power, and are willing to put in the work to access that, will always be far ahead of the console market. Many developers recognize that, and make games catering to the PC market. Even guys like Totalbiscuit will recognise that in the beginning of his reviews, highlighting what the options portion of the game allow a player to customize.\nThe old ways of the console have become antiquated. The personal computer, while being around since the 80s, if not farther back than that, offers more choice and customization, and the offerings of hardware allow multiple different price points of entry. That is the way of the future, rather than a one size fits all console offering.\n\nMost of the world has accepted this. Japan would do well to join the trend. Now I realize I am singling out this developer, who may have felt backed into a corner, with consoles the best chance of success. However, I realize that in today's times, 2015, consoles are NOT your best choice, regardless of the market. You adapt, or fall behind.","October 21, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","2"

There are many flaws in the game engine which vary from person to person, but the game was good enough for me to want to push past them. Once I got into the game a bit, terrible things like frame-rate drops stopped happening, and the main bugs were just the physics engine.\n\nAs a safety note, as with anything, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. I never had any problem, but many people complain of losing progress or having things disappear after having collected them, so keep backups.\n\nOnto the game elements...\n\n+ Awesome story. It is a bit weird and out there as you get further into the game, but it kept me intrigued the whole way. I love games like Silent Hill, but even if you don't like those, try the game. It's not as crazily demonic as those. A very interesting mystery to keep you guessing.\n\n+ The graphics were still pretty good, except for the glitches. I liked the style.\n\n+ The voice acting was pretty well-done, and I liked most of the characters overall. They had their own interesting pieces to them (oh man, that Cold Pot lady).\n\n- The gameplay, altogether, is actually a letdown, though wanting to see the town and the story held everything together for me. Most of the fighting "monsters" was rather pointless and unnecessary, and just got boring after a while. It makes sense for things like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and it's usually done in a way where it's not too boring or you can escape if necessary. Here, the fighting is just boring, one-by-one, often forcing you to empty rooms before you can move on.\n\nI still think that the game altogether was great, just getting past the glitches took a while. If you are looking for an off-the-wall, but really interesting, action/drama game, just look into this one.","December 26, 2014","true","46.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You are an FBI agent sent there to solve a murder mistery who happened in that city.\nThe game has a vey nice story, a murder mistery with some fantastic element, since you will mostly fight zombies like enemies born from the mind of the main character.\nI can assure you that you will surely play this just for the sake of knowing who the culprit is, but here is some flaw in the gameplay\n\nThe game is too easy.\n\nEnemies are always the same slow walking "zombies" who takes one or two hits to the head to kill. There is really no challenge at all and the only way to really game over is by either failing some quick-time event or by getting killed by getting hit on purpose. Same thing for the bosses, whose almost every attack can be avoided by quicktime events. Moreover, your weapons are all over powered, from the basic pistol whith infinite ammos to the magnum whose hits can really one shot enemies. why does this game even has melee weapons, don't ask me.\nAll of this makes the game really boring and doing the secondary missions, which are a lot, becomes something one does just for the achievements.\n\nAs if that is not enough the game has some technical flaws with the startup but, at least for me, where not that much of a problem since there are guides on steam who can help with these kind of problems and some random crashes.\n\nOn the positive side we have the story, I really enjoyed following it all always wanting to know more about it and every murder so particular. But what wins the oscar for me is the main character, who suffers from double personality, with a know-it-all behaviour, we really see him change during the game, and the voice act really fits him.\n\nIn conclusion I recommend this game only if you like good plots like I do. If you hope for something more FPS like, forget this. If this was a visual novel or a Telltale like game it would have probably been a better purchase. Definetly not to buy at full price and If I should give an objective rate, I would give a 6.5 / 10, although I still enjoyed playing this","May 11","true","27.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Then it started crashing, randomly - in the middle of a cutscene, in the middle of a level, in the map screen.\n\nI paid 2.49 for this and it isn't worth it.\n\nIt really is unplayable.\n\nTreat yourself and get the XBOX360 version - that I have played through, and yeah, the controls are clunky, but they're clunky no matter what version you play. The XBOX360 version works. I'm planning (when PS3's come down in price) to get the director's cut for the PS3.\n\nAnyway, in terms of the game, this is one of my favourite things ever.

The game is stuck on 720p quality, crashes randomly, save files get corrupted and characters and objects clip out. The open world environment enables you to drive freely in a somewhat vast environment, but the driving mechanism is so stiff and unrewarding you don't feel like going exploring just for the fun of it (Run out of gas in the middle of nowhere? Tough luck!).\nThough most negative feelings I have towards the game can be blamed on the bad PC-port, some are simply due to bad game design. The map system is hard to navigate, as you can't zoom further back on the full world map that you have in your pause menu. Some sidemissions give no clue as to what you're supposed to do. Shooting/melee action is hard to coordinate right and at times feels very repetetive, but the action sequences do manage to bring a lot of good tension to the otherwise puzzle-heavy gameplay.\n\nThough PC edition Deadly Premonition is a somewhat painful experience due to the recurring random crashes and bugs, it's also one the most captivating games I've ever played. Somehow, unexplainably, the game manages to turn many of it's cons into atmospheric pros.  Bad dubs and badly written over-the-top characters somehow add to the odd atmosphere. The characters feel fake and fairytale like, but in a good way. It seems the game's soundtrack has about three songs that play over and over again, sometimes at very inappropriate times. The monotonous soundtrack does however bring a certain Pavlov-element to the game. When you hear the "evil is lurking" music you learn to be on your guard - even if visible evil is not present.\n\nThe game owes a lot to the TV-series Twin Peaks; Eccentric FBI agent and the unexplained person he talks his mind to, murder of a young but troubled prom queen in a small, secretive town, ½ of which is owned by the owner of a lumbermill... The similarities don't end there. Though similar to the tv show, the game's story still stands well on it's on. It's weird and first sort of alienating, but as you progress in the game you find yourself restarting the game crash after crash, just so you could get on with the story. The terribly dubbed and stiffly animated characters that don't really make any sense pull you surprisingly deep in to Greenvale - and that's why I return to the game time after time.\n\nI would recommend Deadly Premonition to anyone with a  lot of patience and a taste for strange story telling and quirky humor.\n\n\n","October 25, 2014","true","39.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually.  Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues.  The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch.  This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently.  If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play.  I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene.  This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again.  Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying.  I think the story is very intriguing.  The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm.  I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand.  I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.","May 21, 2014","false","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a terrific, dramatic story, in a memorable, immersive, offbeat/surreal virtual town, PC porting issues aside.\n\nIf you do get the PC *port*, expect to put up with crashes every hour or so, long load times between zones and cutscenes (especially cutscenes), if you can even figure out the tricks to get it to run. Then, even when you're able to play, you still have to put up with broken vertical aiming that only shows up in the PC version.\n\nIf you still get the PC port, look at DPfix (and fiddle w/ resolution and windowing settings), and try setting compatibility to WinXP SP2, or better yet Win98 (but with Win98 you'll probably have to give up the built-in gamepad support and either use keyboard/mouse (mapped onto console/gamepad-first controls) or messing around w/ a third-party gamepad mapper).\n\nI was on the fence "yes" or "no", but I'll leave it at "no" both to stand out in the reviews, and to stick w/ my opinion that this particular PC version should be avoided unless you really don't have a 360 or PS3. I would hate to have you sour on this game's story and world simply b/c the PC port sucks major suck (seriously, even if you could get around the keyboard/mouse, load times (with only a blank screen, no indication DP hasn't frozen--tip: unless it CTDs, it'll probably load, just give it a few more MINUTES) can be unbearable).","August 4, 2014","false","55.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I knew it would be bad, but I believed that its charm and cast would win me over. It might have if it worked if the lag was not outrageously bad. This is in undeniable terms a heinously terrible game to attempt to play. It doesn't work. A cutscene will play fine yet the gameplay appears to be a crappy claymation crossed with a low budget 50's cartoon action segment. It is just poor all over on PC. Why did they even release this and why would they not fix it? It is not my PC's fault. Could be a cool game, but don't touch it on Steam.

XD\n\nThe graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.\n\nThe voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.\n\nThe controls are not that great.\n\nAnd still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.\n\nSo, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).\n\nA deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)","June 28, 2014","true","164.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine.\n\nHere's a list as to why it sucks:\nCrashes often\nPlot is barely explained\nPlot holes\nGraphics are terrible\nControls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme]\nSound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently)\nVoices are not that great (What's with the reverb?)\nHit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often)\nWeapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use)\nAI is weird\nSlow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...)\nCar controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways)\nThere's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))\n\nAnd there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are.\n\nTerrible game but it's 10/10 for me!\n\n","July 1, 2014","true","59.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game itself finally comes with controller support and patched a few bugs which really hindered the game. Interestingly enough this game was tested with windows 98 and if you have serious problems you may want to put it in compatibility for win 98.\n\nProbably the weirdest game I have played in a long time. It is a budget game and has its moments of being cheesy and surprisingly good. Mixed on the gameplay aiming is like resident evil 4, hilariously bad driving and annoying qtes. Nothing challenging about the game except maybe getting it work especially when it first came to PC. I enjoyed the game enough where I would probably play it again.","December 11, 2013","true","27.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's been a said a million times, but there seriously isn't anything else like it this gen, and it's more than worth plowing through, if for it's lead character (who is one of the most bizarre and awkward video game protagonists I've ever seen) and it's, despite all odds, more often than not intriguing murder mystery.","December 11, 2013","true","37.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Just a reminder this is a 2010 release and LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM 2003. The facial animation for each character is just so horribly done its a joke. The developer thought it would be fun to lock the resolution so its stuck in 720p, had to go and install a 3rd party fix just to get it to run properly in the correct resolution. Then when it does get going it crashes every 15 mins, or freezes on the pause menu requiring you to restart your progress from the last save point which are few and far in between out in the town. Lets talk a moment abou the HORRIBLE town design, I finished a story mission to be told that I have more then 12 hours til the next mission, so does the game give you some directions on where to go to sleep/pass time? NO, it gives you a marker to that mission and keeps telling you to come back, so in order to get to the mission I have to drive half way across town to the only sleeping bag not behind locked doors over half my cars gas. Oh did I forget to mention that? Cars have gas, so if you didnt do what I did after about an hour of searching for the sleeping bag and look it up online, you'll run out of gas and be screwed. The Enemies are a complete joke they are ALL "ghosts" that do nothing but bend over backwards like a haunted yoga instructer, never actually doing much besides walking slower than the earth turns towards you. They do get weapons but then all the do is just hold them up to thier faces and again never actually do anything. All in all dont waste your time, the game is terrible, the plot works mostly but the game is so horrible broken and terrible that you'll never want to get past the second case with out uninstalling it. 1/10","February 2, 2014","false","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Part murder mystery and part survival horror, there's rarely a dull moment and some unusual enemy design and stealth mechanics make the combat sections feel distinct from other 3rd person shooters. The game however, is not without its faults.\n\nI played this title with a keyboard and mouse and the controls feel muddy at best, the sensitivity settings at the lower end make no apparent difference and the controls feel unwieldy. I'm unsure whether it's caused by aim assist or some form of mouse acceleration, but the shooting sections often feel more like a game of wrangle the cursor rather than precision gunplay and whilst this does create some tense moments, it is at best frustrating and at worst infuriating. If this was a conscious design decision it is in my opinion a misplaced one and together with a downright abuse of quick time events a certain degree of patience is required.\n\nIf this is puts you off the title, that's a pity because the story is more than compelling enough to keep you playing and the town of Greenvale and it's residence are well realised. If you are willing to put up with its flaws deadly premonition has a lot to offer and is wholly deserving of the praise it's received. It's a title that lacks polish but certainly not character, and is well worth considering.\n","January 5, 2014","true","22.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If that matters to you, then wait a few months to play this because I'm sure someone will make better textures.  But this game isn't about the graphics, it never was.  I got this for 5 bucks from indiegala, but at $15 or less I'd call this a buy.","January 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is amazing.\n\nIf you happen to make it through to the end of the game you find a plot that is seriously messed up. No healthy mind could have thought of something this twisted. You need this game.\n\nAs a small side note, this is a straight port so there are no PC options. That means  you are locked at 1280x720 and for some insane reason there is no controller support at all. Luckily the genius behind the Dark Souls Graphic Fix, Durante, is on the job once again. Here's hoping he can get controller support in there too... Of course, with resolutions higher than 1280x720 you will probably need whole new textures for a few in-game items but I think we could see that from a modder in the near future.","October 29, 2013","true","0.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today.\n\nThe story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the “other world”. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.\n\nIt is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York.\n\nEncounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map.\n\nThe layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various “other world” levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right).\n\nThe little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.\n\nThough not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the “other world”.\n\nThese sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word “PROFILING” fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many  static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the “other world”, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred.\n\nProgression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as “Shadows”. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.\n\nTo further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.\n\nContinued...","January 8, 2014","true","23.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

There are plenty of flaws, even discounting the terrible porting job, but underneath it all is an awkwardly endearing and clearly ambitious hodgepodge of a game. The writing is occasionally quite clever and humorous, the characters grow on you and are surprisingly multidimensional. The story, while full of plot holes, is still interesting enough that it kept me going. And while it's usually easy to guess what happens next in the grand scheme of things, the details are usually completely unexpected. Especially when it comes to dialogue.\n\nIt's easy to see why everyone won't give this one a chance though. Production quality varies heavily. Many environments are incredibly detailed, characters are mostly well modeled, and voice acting is at least bearable and often genuinely decent. On the other hand character animations are often awful and level design is mostly uninspired and occasionally very annoying. This goes double for the corridors you end up traversing when the game switches to otherworld mode. There are occasional environmental puzzles that have no particular reason to be there. They're always easy but also almost always annoying.\n\nCombat is trivial, at least when played with a mouse, so the Silent Hilly otherworld bits where you shoot your way through endless mobs turn into routine that you have to turn your brain off for to get to the story bit on the other side. It's not actively terrible but you get the feeling the otherworld fighting stuff was meant for some other game entirely. But then, that goes for many things in the game. There are also useless combat-related QTEs which range from irritating to really bloody annoying, depending on whether you see them coming and whether you remember which buttons you need to press in which order to avoid being instakilled by one of the baddies that haunt your persistently through the game.\n\nThe freeroam stuff, while novel, also doesn't work too well as there isn't much of interest to actually do. The things you can do are also usually pointless from a gameplay perspective. Unless you really like increasing your Agent Honor by driving over medals in forest corridors, that is. Driving in general is something you will spend a lot of time doing, and you will not enjoy it.\n\nThankfully the devs realized driving around is boring (unless you play with a keyboard and mouse, then it's a constant life and death struggle to just stay on the road) and recorded tons of monologues where the main character reminisces about pop culture with his invisible friend. These give the driving segments a lighter tone and also help deepen the player character. Unfortunately the devs didn't consider how aggravating it is to listen to one single repetitively terrible cop show theme whenever your character doesn't happen to be talking about 80s B-movie rentals. A car radio would have been an amazing addition, even just so you could turn it off.\n\nThe music in general deserves a few comments. The number of tracks is way too low and many scenes have incredibly ill fitting tunes. Some of it is probably intentional humor, but it's impossible to tell. However some of the tracks are genuinely very good. Everything gets repetitive real quick though. You always know what sort of scene is about to start when you hear the music start to play. Well, except for that one experimental jazzy tune which is used completely randomly.\n\nBasically, if you can enjoy diamond-in-the-rough style games, and find amusement in weird things both intentional and unintentional, and enjoyed the general atmosphere of Twin Peaks, this may be a game for you.

It's a "so bad its good game" and a good game at the same time. To explain; the fighting mechanics, graphics, and driving sections are horribly bad but their so bad that their funny.

There are a lot of funnier stuff then that but I won't spoiler it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwaggon/recommended/247660/","redwaggon","RedWaggon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redwaggon/","107 products in account","I’m usually not a fan of the mystery genre, as there is a certain meaninglessness in turning a story into a guess-and-check puzzle. So believe me when I say that this is a whole lot more than a typical whodunit. It’s a psychological character study on top of a horrific murder mystery. Deadly Premonition is like playing through a TV show (particularly Twin Peaks).\n\nThis rollercoaster of a game blends psychological perspective and universal laws, the physical world and the supernatural, quirky humor and nauseating tragedy, all in one interactive experience. The framing of the piece creates plot holes, which upon contemplation leave an emptiness inside your ribcage. The personal interpretations and unanswerable questions are really the scariest part about this game.\n\nIt’s a shame this was given such a severely low budget, considering the remarkably high aspirations the development team had for the project. I suggest reading the English subtitles to avoid the characters’ poorly animated mouths. Save as often as possible to avoid losing progress from crashes. But don’t let the low production values fool you; if a bit of dialogue seems awkward and out of place, it’s supposed to be; if a character is acting strangely, don’t assume they have one-dimensional motivations. Even though it’s a bit shoddy, this game is carefully crafted.\n\nFrom a story standpoint, the characters are amazing. The main protagonist is Agent Francis York Morgan of the FBI. He is quite good at his job and has a polite, cheerful personality, albeit a strange lack of emotion. It gets interesting when he talks to his mysterious, other personality that goes by the name of Zach. The other main protagonist is Emily Wyatt, the Deputy Sheriff of the town. In her twenties, she seems to still possess a childlike innocence, while somehow managing to be an interesting character, free of any melodramatic, gag-worthy moments. Her personality does not fit her occupation, however, and she is not fit to be a cop. Things only get more interesting as the characters are put into play in the eerie town of Greenvale.\n\nYou just have to play it.","August 19, 2014","true","29.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A weird detective game set in a mysterious mountain town filled with quirky characters. Heck, even the female lead looked like Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr?).\n\nThere were countless reviews stating how terrible the game was, but no amount of bad reviews could've stopped me from buying this game. Man, oh, man were they right. The game's simply unplayable. And not simply because it's a bad port. It's a small game overextended to a massive open world with terrible writing and the worst soundtrack of all time. I played it for less than 2 hours and had heard the whistling theme song at least 10 times, so I tried playing it with the sound muted. Didn't help.\n\nI really tried to like this game, but it's not just so weird it's good. It's so weird it's bad and not in a Twin Peaks way.\n\nIf you're looking for a twin peaks-esque game, try Fahrenheit (also abysmally terrible writing, but atleast I managed to finish it).\n\nSadly, not recommended.

Once I got the game working, it would periodically crash. At its worst point, I had to download a save file from someone else that was past a crash point just to continue the game.\n\nHere are some of the fun things I did during the course of this game\n-download a fan made patch to "fix" things\n-Run the game in older windows compatability modes to get past crashes\n-switch the game to windowed mode to get past crashes\n-lower the resolution to get past crashes\n-download save files that are past crash points\n-dig through the game files and repair files in hopes it stops crashes\n-turn off steam overlay to stop crashes\n-ask on forums how to get past crashes at specific points\n\nI couldn't even finish the game.  I someone made it all the way to the epilogue and hit another crash wall. At this point I couldn't take it anymore and just watched the ending on Youtube.\n\nI tweeted the creator of the game, and he replied that he had nothing to do with the PC port and that its the PC development company's fault. I tweeted the development company and they told me there is nothing they can do because they don't have a development team for Deadly Premonition anymore.\n\nIt sucks because the actual game itself is great & unique.

Some assets (mainly UI) got retouched (looking worse but thats a matter of personal taste i guess) and slapped together with old stuff making for nice eye biting contrast. Some of the 3D Models for the inventory items got a shiny slime filter or something tossed onto them. The resolution is higher but the textures are the same resulting in highres blurryness. Amazing. The original wasnt a graphical marvel but at least consistent.\n\nAdditionally the game seems a litte too fast which actually managed to make me a little nauseous. Last game that did that was Starfox on SNES. Audio is still messed up. Nice shot.\n\nThe Thumbs up is for Deadly Premonition and that people who never ever plan on buying a Xbox360 ever ever (its cheap now and theres alot of other pretty good games...) have a chance of experiencing it - even in the warped form of this suboptimal port.","November 30, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.\n\nIt's easy to imagine that the early design discussions went something like this:\n\n\n"I have an idea for a game! And by idea, I mean let's copy something. How about we turn that weird 90s TV show by David Lynch into a game!"\n\n"You mean Twin Peaks?"\n\n"Yeah!"\n\n"Twin Peaks is about an FBI agent investigating a murder in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. It's a mystery, but mostly a character drama. What would the player fight in this game? There's not much action in the show."\n\n"Zombies."\n\n"Ok...are we going to explain to the player why there are zombies?"\n\n"No! I don't wanna! Let's just make it so the zombies are only visible to the main character. That way we don't have to explain why the rest of the world doesn't know there's a zombie apocalypse."\n\n"So every combat section of the game takes place inside the players head?"\n\n"Yeah. Head zombies."\n\n"Got it. So how does the player get around?"\n\n"It's open world."\n\n"Like GTA? You can drive?"\n\n"Yes, except you can only drive from a first-person view, you can only drive certain cars, and they'll each go an incredibly slow speed and flip over all the time for no logical reason. Oh! And the cars will include an incredibly small gas tank that you have to use in-game money to fill up at the one and only gas station in town."\n\n"And you can go anywhere?"\n\n"Sure! Except if you get out of the car in areas where we're too lazy to implement pathing or textures we'll fine you for being stranded and magically teleport you to a random location. And - I almost forgot - there are invisible walls everywhere."\n\n"Nice touch. Gotta have invisible walls. Will there be a fast travel system to avoid all the monotony?"\n\n"Definitely. But we'll lock it for most of the game until the player completes an obscure side quest."\n\n"Why obscure?"\n\n"Well the side quests will only be available depending on the weather conditions. We're implementing dynamic weather."\n\n"Oooooooooo."\n\n"Yeah, buzzwords. But since it's weather and the player obviously has no control over it, they probably won't encounter any sidequests on their own. They'll be basically impossible to find without looking up. Did I mention there's a time system too? And the side quests are also dependent on that? It complements the weather."\n\n"That's so real. Just so real. Can the player control the time at all?"\n\n"Well they can sleep, but only at pre-designated areas that we'll make sure are very inconveniently placed. And if the player doesn't want to sleep, we'll make them! If they stay up after midnight the zombies will come out and attack the town!"\n\n"I thought they were just in his head? And you know vampires are the monsters that come out at night, not zombies."\n\n"Don't question my inconsistencies! We'll also make the player tired if he doesn't get enough sleep. It'll slow him down and eventually start draining his health. The same for food. You have to eat. If you literally do nothing and keep the game running you'll die in under an hour. Just like real life!"\n\n"So the player has to manage food and sleep levels, with a limited inventory and only specific, far away places they can rest or buy food?"\n\n"Exactly!"\n\n"This game sounds truly awful. There's no way I'm going to play it."\n\n"Oh I'm not going to play it either. But we can still sell it: just call it art."\n\n\nOn a meta level, the PC version has all the problems Dark Souls did: terrible graphics, awful mouse support, and constant, ever-present crashing. You're going to need third-party hacks to even get it to run. In the process of getting my 100% playthrough the game crashed over 100 times (yes, I started counting). Developers: shame, shame on you.\n\nAt one point I had a save file that would crash exactly five seconds after I loaded it. I almost gave up at that point. Luckily I discovered that sprinting inside prevented the crash, and I happened to be only about four seconds from a door.\n\nHow I wish I could get the hours spent playing this back, but I wanted to give the game a chance and by the time I realized it was never going to explain anything or get any better I was so far in I figured I might as well finish it. That's a lesson in not trusting my own instincts early on.\n\nThe story and setting are so close to Twin Peaks that I think there might be a legitimate plagary case here. Additionally, it's like the creators of the game don't understand storytelling fundamentals, writing dialogue, or even how to make games fun. Your arsenal includes weapons with infinite ammo, and despite the bad controls that simple fact makes the combat trivial. It seems like such an odd choice to provide infinite ammo but then make the player have to manage food. It's tiresome and does not add to the believability or realism of this utterly unreal world. It's like this game was trying to combine every genre: third-person shooter, open world, adventure, survival horror. But in the end it did all of them poorly.\n\nThis isn't groundbreaking. It's not art. It's just bad.","May 13","false","42.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperrabbit/recommended/247660/","paperrabbit","Paper Rabbit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paperrabbit/","229 products in account","Thumbs down mainly because horrendous port.\n\nAs a port, this is possibly one of the worst port ever in the video game history. Anyone even remotely, vaguely aware of Deadly Premonition should already know by now just how bad the PC port is. Even setting aside the lack of HD graphics, the game runs. like. ♥♥♥♥. It actually suffers from memory leak issue. My personal best time before Crash To Desktop is slightly under 2 hours. On the norm, anything just a bit over 1 hour the game will commit ritual suicide on the dot. Anything related to opening the map screen seems to really exacerbate the leak issue for me, this leads to some very annoying side quests run. Replaying a chapter for side quests sometimes will bug your game out. This is serious game breaking potential bug too. You damn well better make a save backup before you do anything foolish.\n\nAs a game, Deadly Premonitions starts out absolutely brilliant. Then it took a wrong turn and ends up on a railroad heading to DBZ town.\n\n\nThe Gold:\nReally quirky casts\nWTF is wrong with this music?!\nThe amazing attention to details\nYork's amazing knowledge of old movies\n\n\nI can certainly see why this game became a cult classic. It has all the lovable and lovably hate-able characters. The flattest character in this game is the dog, but I bet even he has ulterior motives deep beneath that fur coat. (Actually confirmed by SWERY) The soundtracks have this dissonance to it that it'll play some cheery tunes at some very inopportune times. Too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen toward the end of the game where there are moments where I become very irritated. (More on end game later) A big notable mention is the attention to details of character interactions. Generally, character dialogues of when what where occurred won't be remembered.  So in other games there'd be occasions of you've already met this character, even done a few side quests for said person, but the game will still treat you as you've never met him/her unless plot dictates so.  Deadly Premonitions is the exact opposite of such syndrome.  In fact, it has a near compulsion of keeping track of who/what/when/where.  You can physically see NPCs moving from one location to another as they go about their daily business.  If the weather changes, their behavior patterns will change as well. That's some impressive bits of details for none big budget games.  You'll actually miss some impressive and hilarious nuggets of gold this way if you don't have a habit of exploring and wandering about.  I do so enjoy York's car ramblings about old movies as well.\n\n\nThe Unnecessary:\nYour piddly map screen that can't even fix its orientation\nClunky combat and driving controls\nEnd game railroading\nDBZ boss battles and worse dialogue\n\n\nTime for the really ♥♥♥♥ parts. The controls for this game can be abysmal. The combat is laughably bad. This is PlayStation Resident Evil 1 clunky. The quick turn animation doesn't quick turn my camera as well. I still need to slowly adjust it with my mouse or pad. Aiming is clunky, but at least the game is generously forgiving (until end game bosses.) Driving a car around town proves to be a challenge. This is where the attention to detail bit on the town will drive some people nuts. Greenvile is treated as an actual town, not a crappy rundown composed of just 2 blocks of random shops, houses, and 1 Inn. No. Actual people with their own homes, places where they gather, the works. On paper this sounds like a wonderful thing. HOWEVER, this becomes an issue when your map is forever stuck showing just one tiny bit of the town. The place is HUGE, hardly helpful when you need to get to the far side of the map. The map is NOT fixated to North/South/West/East/Whoville either, it is related to where you are positioned. Thought you got the map figured out? Oops, you moved so it changed orientation. This is Google Map without the actual GPS telling you where to go. There's just a big fat arrow pointing vaguely on the horizon on where your next plot point is. You can argue they are trying to encourage exploration, but being stuck in a game with memory leak problem...  Oh, your car also has this weird tendency to do some weird ragdoll physics; hit some invisible or tiny pixels in the road and spin off the road. Car controls itself is pretty damn clunky as well. If you are doing the sidequests that involve racing, this can get frustrating really quick especially in the downtown area.\n\nThis is a sad mention, but I actually have an issue with the plot execution. Not because it is ridiculous, but how it really spirals downwards near the end from poor execution. From the outset, the game encourages you to freely explore the town and do your own thing. You can jump on and off the investigation train at any time, no time limit is ever imposed on you. Shoot the breeze with the local crazies. Wow, there's a crazy killer on the loose. So what, I still have time to go fishing, sort boxes at your local store, eat a delicious sandwich made of sin at the diner. Hahaha. So what happens near the end? This is when the game takes itself too damn serious. You are being bound, gagged, and railroaded to the final boss bum rush mode. You want to stop and buy supplies? No dice. You want to redo some old dungeons for cards and infinite weapons? Too bad, so sad. My problem with this game is they've put the Point of No Return a few chapters too damn early. I'm in a game with big memory leak issue. I'm constantly worried about the game choking on itself in the middle of a dungeon, or the last bouts of bosses. Oh ye gods, the bosses. The freaking bosses also have the RPG syndrome of multiple forms, with a side order of crap dialogues. "Bwahahaha, you thought you killed me? BEHOLD! My second and mightier form!" You kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. ":cough hack: You... You thought you beat me?! Foolish mortal! Now I'll reveal you my true self!!!1111" ♥♥♥♥. Me. This is padding. You are actually padding the damn game.

It's the single most broken, poorly constructed amateurish piece of technological garbage I have ever witnessed in my entire life.\n\nIf you're fortunate enough to get past the confusing launcher(that has absolutely no technical options whatsoever, restricting you to a control configuration screen that thinks 1 and 2 are "RT" and "LT"), you get to enjoy the seemingly 9 in 10 chance of encountering a crash before you even see the main character on screen.\n\nShould you, against all odds, actually get to a fairly playable place in the game, you'll find that something as simple as drawing your weapon...

It's truly one of the worst PC ports in history, imagine a mix of Resident Evil 4 & Dark Souls PTD ports and make it a hundred times worse. It's terrible in every single aspect you could imagine and so broken that it's LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE:\n\nPerformance:\nExtremely terrible, couldn't be any worse. I can't even find a right word to describe how terrible it is! It barely runs at 10 FPS on a modern PC without mods. Well to be honest, it doesn't even run at all without mods. You'd hard a really hard time even trying to run the game without crashing, not to mention you will have to use Compatibility Mode and reinstall nVidia Physix just to get it to run. You probably have to use MODs just to be able to launch!\nAnd that's not all, Loading times are infuriating, especially the invisible loadings between each cutscene which could last up to 8 minutes! You'll just sit there staring at the black screen thinking the game's frozen but it's actually a terribly long loading! There are countless super-long invisible loading times!\nAnd that's not all!

Wait for it to stop raining so you may enter the store (may take several ingame days), buy clothes in said store, shave your face to earn money (yes, it's a thing), pay to clean clothes to earn money for being a stylish agent (also a thing) and of course stuffing your face with random eadibles, then wait to stuff your face again with another edible, repeat.\n\nAnd if you'd like to further wait for stuff then try picking up objects! You will have to see the item spin around for a few seconds before you may continue the game of course it wouldn't be fair if this didn't happen with every single item you picked up now wouldn't it?\n\nThe only thing the game really has going for it, is the story. Which seems interessting, but in my opinion a great story is not enough to make up for annoying gameplay with terrible controls, occasional huge drops of framerates and of course lots and lots of game crashes.\n\nDeadly Premonition feels like a game you really want to enjoy, however it fights you every step of the way. It does not want you to enjoy it. These are some of the reasons why I can not recommend this game, there are plenty of more things that could be said regarding this game, however I feel it's best to just leave it for now (we don't have all day now do we).\n\nThis is only by my experience, and yours may differ. You might become one of the lucky ones (from what I understand the majority) that does not have these constant crashes.","November 4, 2013","false","8.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Damuel/recommended/247660/","Damuel","Damuel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Damuel/","628 products in account","Great game, bad port. The game is quite unlike anything else. And it's got a bit of the "So bad it's good" type of game going on. There are some serious bugs, though with some quick fixes the game breaking ones can be fixed and just some hilarious ones (had someone fall through their driveway as they pulled into it) will remain.\n\nEverything Deadly Premonitions does is generally mediocre, but it doesn't feel like a knock off, it feels more like a self acknowledged B-Movie. And although it may not have had a large amount of fame, the game has gotten a cult fanbase and become a hit among its fans.\n\nThe gunplay is essentially Resident Evil 4 mixed with Silent Hill. The enemies aren't particularly tough, they don't generally evolve much, but they're creepy and they feel right at home with the silent hill like areas of the game. The driving portions control like a PS2 game, and not GTA quality either. The map also makes the driving a major pain as it can be frustrating to figure out where you wanted to get to without any waypoints or minimap GPS. And there's some simple detective work with generally easy side quests.\n\nThe game is open world during some portions, giving you anywhere from half an hour to several hours of real time to wander around, do minigames, simple sidequests, or gather collectables. There's a ton of optional content to keep you busy and it makes the game well worth the money as far as content goes. There's a few 'realistic' elements to the gameplay, such as a need to eat and sleep, these don't really ever detract from the main game though, and never feel like they're a problem. I constantly found myself with TOO much free time and slept in between missions.\n\nThe game really shines with how awkward it is. The dialogue at times doesn't even make sense, and is often thrown in front of hilariously inappropriate music. The animations during cutscenes are all fairly terrible and it adds to the charm. The game will jump from a serious sob story, to a completly out of place morbid joke in a heartbeat. And its fantastic. The community has uploaded several recordings of such scenes and it truly shows how surreal the developers are.\n\nThe game really requires a sense of humor and a bit of patience with some of its flaws, but if you can overlook them the game is a hidden gem. For an example of the humor see this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp5krDoflLI&hd=1\n\nThe game isn't for everyone, hell, IGN (US) gave the game 2/10 then the UK side gave it a 7.5. Give it a quick look and see if it grabs your interest. It's a great break from the usual stuff.","June 21, 2014","true","51.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/recommended/247660/","stragglerastic","Lagg&","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stragglerastic/","292 products in account","I'm sorry that I recommended this game about a year ago when it was on sale on the humble bundle store for about $1. I thought they had put more effort into the port than they did. But as it turns out it's just yet another bad port. Bad in a way that only japanese studios that regret their decision to take console exclusive deals can do.\n\nGot it running by breaking physx for other games on my system that link to it. Only to see that the resolution is hardcoded to 1280x720. I was aware of dpfix. But even though it evidently loads the symbols just fine (as indicated by not segfaulting) it just sits forever eating my cycles. Likely caused by a recent update.\n\nThere are people on the forums trying to defend these incompetent developers.  They shouldn't. They're only further ruining Steam. Having a quirky game that likes to have a bit of fun despite itself is one thing (and is why I came to want it in the first place) but having a buggy piece of ♥♥♥♥ maintained by incompetent developers is another, and believe me they are incompetent.\n\nThe fact that libs that override d3d9 symbols exist in the first place is evidence of that. As the complexity of the problem goes up so does the complexity of the override libs. But ones like these -though written by undoubtedly competent people- merely provide basic features that the game should have in the first place. Like adding a second step that adjusts resolution based on values given in a config file.\n\n\nEdit: I was able to fix the issue causing the game to just sit there eating cycles and have it running in my native resolution. I'm sure the game will be as fun as I figured it would be but my review above still applies. The short of it is: Don't bother if you're not comfortable having a game that isn't playable right after download from steam. It's going to take a bit to both get it to actually run without segfaulting and get it aesthetically reasonable (meaning native resolution of your monitor and properly saturated environments).\n\nHad I known this port was as bad as it was I wouldn't have encouraged developers who do crap like this by giving them money. I suggest you don't make the same mistake.","April 2, 2015","false","15.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

After downloading the game it would not launch at all. To fix that you have to run dplauncher as administrator. Then i calibrated my wireless 360 controller and launched the game after that and set my control config to joystick in the launcher. Buttons worked fine and the game is advertised with "Full Controller Support". RIght when i gained control of the character i could not move but the buttons worked. I downloaded and installed the dpfix and it didnt do anything. I really wanted to play this but i only paid $2.49 and i wouldnt recommend buying it at that price.

It runs at least, contrary to what others have reported. However, it does not recognise XBOX controller at all, there is no way to remap the keys, it has poorly dubbed voiceovers akin to a film originally produced in another language, the graphics are clearly directly ported from something like a ps2 with no way to increase resolution, and (one of my all time pet hates) there is no way to turn off subtitles. For some not being able to use a controller OR remap keys might not be a deal breaker but since I am left handed the whole awsd extended map is a complete btfk for me.

I was able to finish it by restarting my PC every time it crashed and it would crash probably once an hour or so.  There are a variety of crash bugs.  Sometimes the textures get all wonky on the map view and it crashes.  Sometimes it crashes when loading.  Sometimes it crashes when it tries to play a movie.  So the moral is only play if you are willing to restart your PC a lot and save your game as much as possible.  I would recommend checking out the DPFix unofficial patch to make the port a bit smoother, but unfortunately it won't solve the crashing bugs.","October 29, 2015","false","26.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

After having dealt with constant crashes, stuttering, framerate issues, restarting my computer, etc, I'm finally done. This game wasn't worth the dollar I paid for it. And it seems EVERYONE is having the same problems. How they can call this game released as a "director's cut" where they fix things, but its actually more unplayable than the original. Also, its been out over 2 years and nothing has been done to fix it by the devs. There are workarounds but I shouldn't have to start installing and deleting files on my brand new high end comp to run this turd. And what all for? The animations are stiff and terrible, graphics suck, the pace is super slow, the characters are weird and unrealistic, the story is mildly interesting but 2/3 of it doesn't make sense. The combat, controls, and UI are terrible. Limited controller support. Map sucks. Long boring forced driving sections with terrible controls. Positives are waiting the 20 hours for the story to finally finish, which who cares.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/247660/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","I thought that Resident Evil Revelations was a horribly generic version of Resident Evil but this game takes the cake. Made in 2009, then re-released in this HD version in late 2013, it looks, sounds, and feels like a game from no later than 2005. The graphics and character movement are basically updated versions of controls and graphics from Resident Evil 2/3. The graphics look a thousand times better in the screen shots on the store page than in the actual game. I bought the game because it looked good in the screen shots but boy was I wrong. Thankfully I only paid $2.50. But I do not judge the overall quality of a game based on graphics, although it certainly does suck when the graphics suck. The character and enemy movement, shooting, melee attacking, effects, everything feels much, much older than 2009. However I am not really complaining about it just pointing it out, because obviously a game that was released in 2009 for only $20 at the time does not exactly scream high quality. Either way, it should be technologically advanced to that year, not take a step four years backwards.\n\nThe shooting and melee attacking feels very stiff and generic. Enemies being hit by your bullets/weapons is just laughably generic. The sound is forgettable and the music is ear bleedingly bad. The music that plays while talking to people in town during cut scenes sounds like music straight from an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Much of the cut scenes are unnecessarily padded with total nonsense like “man this biscuit is good. Where can I get these in town?” “well actually I um... I baked them myself”. Or pretty much the entire conversation with the old lady at the long dinner table early on.\n\nI would love to give the game a further chance but I am without doubt that it will just get more silly as time rolls on. I do not expect it to get even the slightest bit better, especially since I have already seen how horribly generic combat and character movement are and those things simply cannot improve. It is also not a pure survival horror game. It is about 50% adventure, 50% real game. I separate “real game” from “adventure” because adventure games do not have real gameplay. In an adventure game you just walk around and find clues and objects to use later and talk to people and watch a lot of cut scenes. This game has a ton of that. It is not too much of a gripe though considering that when you do get to actually experience combat, it sucks as well. The real deal breaker was one of the worst problems I have ever seen in a game: when I got into the police car to drive, a terrible, ear piercing screeching sound was playing looped nonstop. I checked the forum and it is a sound glitch that can be fixed by setting your speakers from 5.1 to stereo. I do not care what game it is, I am not going to go into the control panel to redo my sound setup each time I switch to a certain game. And besides, my speakers are configured to 5.1 but I have a audio control panel app for my sound card that lets me switch to stereo, headphones, or whatever, and I had it set to headphones since I was wearing headphones while playing the game so who knows, who cares. If it is something that I had to actually set to stereo in the control panel sound setup options for speakers, there is like I said no way in hell I would ever do that for any game, and would never have to for any other game for that matter. Only this one, no thanks. So that horrible sound problem sealed the nail in the coffin for this game.\n\nI realize it has a cult following, and it is not a horrible game (besides the seriously unbearable sound screech problem when driving), but I do not see the point in bothering with something so barely decent when many much better options exist for your time to be much more well spent. Resident Evil 4, 5, 6, and Revelations are all far superior games and are all available on steam. So with those games and a few other survival horror games out there also if you look, there is no point whatsoever in wasting your time with something as heavily mediocre as this.\n\nPainfully generic, 5/10","October 25, 2014","false","2.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I've never seen Twin Peaks but many say if you've seen that series you'll get notice a lot of elements from it in this game.\n\nOriginally I played this on the PS3 and picked up the PC version for £2 or so.\n\n.....It's a terrible port, probably the worst ever next to Saints Row 2. However as with Dark Souls, there is a resolution fix and fortunately for me at least there have been no further problems. In fact I'd say the PC version with the fix is better than the PS3 version due to the framerate (again for me) being 60fps as oppossed to the PS3's horrific sub 30fps in most cases.\n\nIf you don't mind the technical issues, it's worth at least one playthrough just for the plot. The game itself is extremely easy anyway so you'll never really be stuck.","December 9, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not at its core, but where it counts. Deadly Premonition is essentially Twin Peaks: the Video Game. So much so to the point where in its setting, characters, and major plot points are ripped almost directly from Twin Peaks. You are FBI special agent Francis York Morgan, tasked with finding the culprit behind the murder of a young woman in the small town of Greenvale that has some odd relation to a string of murders happening all across the country.\n\nTo preface this, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition: Directors Cut is one of the sloppiest, messy, and badly done PC ports for a game that is just not good. It has ransom crashes and even though people talk about CTD's (Crash To Desktop), the majority of crashes didn't even allow me to do that. The controls are clunky and the horror bits aren't as scary as they could be. Yet everything is done in such a way that it is just so absolutely amazing in every way. At its core, Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games to play and is definitely one of my top ten games of all time. The weirdly written character dialogue backed up by one of the maybe 15 audio tracks that the game has to offer (but it's probably going to be Life Is Beautiful, who am I kidding) creates this setting that you just can't put down because you're so invested in the world it paints and the characters that accompany you on your investigation. Also it's just f****** weird in a great way.\n\nTL;DR Even while the game is flawed in so many ways, all of its flaws contribute to an experience that every horror lover/movie lover/lover of David Lynch/person on this planet should partake in. The game is an absolutely amazing work of art that is only $2.50 during sales and totally worth the cash and the crashes.","December 25, 2014","true","50.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You either love it or you hate it. The pc version has a kind of cost at entry, where you have to root out various bugs and hindrances in order to play unaccosted. once you get set up and stabalize it however it's pretty good. This is probably the single greatest example of making good on incredibly low budget. Deadly premonition was originally a ps2 game which was bumped up in scale before being released for the xbox and ps3, this means that it has a lot of the quirk and "jank" that you get from old school ps2 games with a larger scale and length.\n\nOver all Deadly Premonition is an exercise in video game weirdness, the merit of the game comes less from the plot or gameplay and more from "Wow look how weird this guy's character model is when he's smilling" or "pffft that zombies running sideways." Kind of a more eloquent goat simulator.\n\nThis games charm is impossible to describe, so for reference go and watch the "two best friends play" of deadly premonition where they will constantly and in detail describe why the game is REALLY GOOD while also looking terrible.\n\n"The Pickles"","December 3, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat isn't really enjoyable, sometimes you needed to fight monsters before you could progress, sometimes they infinitely respawn. The levels could become mazelike and hard to navigate through. At some point you need to do a tailgating mission that takes way too long (5-10 minutes). The bossfights aren't enjoyable because of the combat. The map layout of the town is made by a madman. You will sometimes need to drive to the other end of the town and instead of having a straight line from point A to B, you have a gigantic swerving line (not exaggerated). At some point there is a new mob introduced that's very bulletspongy but you can easily take out with melee. The downside? Your melee grade degrade so fast it's not even funny. There is a sequence where you need to fight four of those monsters in a row and I pretty much ran out of usable weapons at that time.

Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.\n\nIf I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.\n\nDespite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.\n\nThat is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable.\n\nSo, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.","October 31, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure, much like Twin Peaks, the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about Deadly Premonition is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics.\n\nStill, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should.\nThe gameplay works sort of like L.A. Noire. The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The "game" operates much more like an interactive film or television show ("Previously in the investigation" or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)\n\nI suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.","November 8, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game.\nThis is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.\n\nRead non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut.

I really, really want to. The plot, dialogue, setting, characters et cetera are all fantastic. However, even after applying various fixes such as dpfix, and compatibility mode, I still experienced numerous errors. These include stuttering framerate, unable to get out of windowed mode, unable to alter resolution, and an inability to aim up or down rendering some puzzles literally incompletable. (I know compatibility mode is supposed to fix this but didn't for me.) Couple that with my save file getting corrupted somehow (twice) I can't reccomend the PC version. If you want this game, the console version works fine.\n\nI love this game, but the number of bugs is completely unreasonable. If it gets officially patched and this is fixed, I would reccomend it.

But somehow, it ADDS to the charm of the game, it's lovable BECAUSE of it's flaws. What makes it so very amazing is the writing. Seriously, this game has some of the BEST character development and scripting I've ever freakin seen in a video game, or anything for that matter. I've never ever before WANTED to kill the villian so bad, and felt so invested in all the characters. Really, the game is lovable and wonderful in just about every way. EXCEPT FOR THIS PORT. I played it back on the Xbox on release and loved it, and I have to say this port makes me want to cry. If you can get it to work properly, especially with DPFix by the guy who made DSFix, you'll have a blast.

Even on consoles. It's a disaster on so many levels.\nDespite that, you still need to experience this perfect train wreck. It sucks in so many ways that it literally creates its own gravitational pull that sucks you in. You won't understand why it fascinates you so. It just will. You won't understand why such an objectively bad game is so amusing. But it is. It's like the sirens of Greek mythology- you're not supposed to listen to their song.

Don't approach this game with the mentality that "This is a survival horror game" because it's not.
