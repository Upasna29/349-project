Defend Your Life is  a  typical TD game with the usual  tower purchases, for example  upgradeable cannons and   tesla towers,  as well as other towers that  slow units down or toss grenades, plus there are special towers such as  those that give you extra oxygen.  Oxygen is the currency in game  which  allows you to purchase  more towers and  upgrades, plus  at the end of each  level you are awarded  tablets and  diamonds, both of which can be spent  either on  upgrading your tower  defenses or on special  upgrades that can only be used once to  top up  other  defenses that  usually take time to recover such as the electric shock , bomb or adrenaline.\n\nThe theme of this  TD game is  biological, with a human body  being attacked by viruses.  Each level gradually takes you further into the body.   You can set the speed up to four times the normal speed  and/or  select from three different difficulties.  Even at full price  I think Defend Your Life is  a bargain.   I reckon most  TD fans    will enjoy this game and it's also an  excellent  introduction   for those new to the genre. The easy mode is relatively easy to beat.  I played   through several levels  with no losses. The harder levels  give less currency to buy the various upgrades and   the speed of  the viruses  are increased, plus you get less oxygen currency to start with.\n\n\n\nWith 22 different enenies,  all with different strengths and weaknesses, for example the flu virus  divides into two weaker flu viruses  when it  is  killed  and the Nicotinic unit disappears when  first hit and is immune from attack while invisible, at least from the tower defenses. You can still damage  these with bombs and electric shocks.\n\nThere's a tips and tricks section as well as an encyclopedia that  gives you  information  about each building, for example  the Tesla tower  does more damage  for each shot  than any other  tower, but takes a longer  time to recharge.  There are some nice little touches like the defensive towers that  when activated  create little  beings that    don't do actual damage, but block the path of incoming  viruses.  When damaged they  recover  fairly quickly. If destroyed   new ones will replace them before the next wave.  You can  start  the next wave early by clicking on the warning symbol that pops up near the place where the viruses  first appear. The quicker you do this, the more oxygen is added to your total, giving you more currency to  buy or upgrade towers.\n\nThe 20 achievements  for this game are  relatively easy to attain, so long as you can survive the waves of viruses.  You can see a video of game play HERE. I highly recommend this game","April 10, 2015","true","12.1"," 76 of 91 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","76","91","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VinceRowe/recommended/357780/","VinceRowe","Vince","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VinceRowe/","350 products in account","========================================\n\nVince Rowe ReviewsSaving the Industry one Game at a Time!\n\n[YouTube Link]   [Curation Link]\n\n========================================\n\n\nA neat little Tower Defence let down by a few technical issues.\nVerdict - 6.7/10\n\nGameplay - 7/10:\nSo firstly, when it comes to Tower-Defence (TDs) games you've got 3 types, there are the TDs that give you free will over where you can place Towers so you can create your own path (And sometimes HP bars for the Towers), there's the TDs where you have a pre-built path but you can choose where you place your towers next to the path, and then the TDs like Defend Your Life; where you have a pre-built path and pre-built locations to place the Towers, now all of them are good in their own way - preferably I like either complete freewill (Like DesktopTD) or just a pre-built path (Like BloonsTD) but the latter does cause you think more tactically at times as well. As I said, Defend Your Life is the 3rd one - pre-built path and pre-built Tower locations - you get 4 choices of towers and each of those 4 are separated into 2 more options, equalling 8 unique towers to build, fortunately each type of Tower comes with it's own special use making them all very different to eachother - and then of course you get the A-Typical upgrades you can do to make them stronger. You get attacked by different types of enemies which come in waves, each with their own purpose, like your fast but low HP enemies, the tanks and the invisible ones - all very basic. You can get Heroes, which although very awkward to control (Because of the 'Mobile Friendly' aspect of the game) are pretty cool to use, they level up as they get kills which allows you to upgrade them slightly each level up and allows you to fix any holes you may have in your defence. Then there's the 'out-of-game' upgrades you can do which just give little basic buffs here and there, like a little bit more money from creeps - you obtain coins to buy these by completing the levels in Easy/Medium/Hard.\n\n\nLevel Design - 6/10:\nAll the levels are based in the human body with 17 levels to run through. As I said, the game has a pre-built path and pre-built Tower locations, so you're almost forced to complete the level how it wants you to complete it, every single level I have managed to fill up every single Tower location... I felt that it made the game feel a bit 'limited' at times. In addition, on the earlier levels, and up until about half-way the game limits you to what upgrades you can buy for your towers - I have no idea why but once again, this makes the game feel limited - this is remains the case even if you progress through the game and get better upgrades...\n\n\nGraphics - 7/10:\nAs I said, it's set in the human body so you can expect that the graphics to look like a cartoon human body - and they do. There's really nothing more to be said there, they look alright... Nothing special but feel free to decide for yourself from the screenshots and the gameplay video I have on it. As you upgrade a Tower it also changes aesthetically as well, it's a nice touch and all the upgrades make the Towers look like they have in fact, been upgraded. Unfortunately - and this is a big unfortunately... - the game has some hideous black borders at either side of the screen, something is clearly wrong with the resolution and it's not going wide screen... It's somewhat frustrating and hard to look past when you first start playing the game but as time goes on you get used to it. Other than that I feel almost inclined to mention that this game feels (and probably is) a mobile port, or at least developed with mobile in mind - think what you like on that, I personally feel a bit let down by it.\n\n\n\nOverall - 6.7/10:\nThis game is pretty fun, unfortunately it's let down by a few technical issues such as the black borders and the fact that it was clearly made for mobile. Overall, if you like Tower-Defence games like this then chances are that you'll like this one too.\n\n\nGameplay and Commentary:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuo64fHICkk\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","May 21, 2015","true","5.3"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","52","66","4","11"

If you are a gamer that only goes for AAA games, this is not for you (though I guess that goes without saying).\n\nSo, in general, here are the pro's:\n+ quick / easy  / fun to play (mildly adictive)\n+ nice gradual difficulty progression\n+ very fluid\n+ excelent for a first tower defense or for younger audiances\n+ you can beat the hell out of Cancer\n+ Easy to get the full set of achievements\n+ Good value for money.\n\nThe cons:\n- Doesnt seem to fit the screen. I keep on getting the impression that I dont see what is going on the edges of the map\n- Game tends to become very slow during the final waves of the last level.\n- While playin in window mode, you will have to minimize windows bar\n- Sometimes the UI blocks you from seeing enemies or selecting them\n- ...cant recall of anything else that could be bad about it.\n\nI started playing Defend your life while I was spending Christmas holidays with the family, as a gap filler in the slower hours, and I couldnt be more pleased.\n\nIt is a very simple and very basic tower defense game, based on defending your body against all sorts of virus and problems - which will be your enemies.\n\nIn the begining, the game seems to have a childish look to it, and more adult people will probably relate it to the 80's cartoons "Once upon a time... life". The first couple of levels seem to be extremely easy and you feel that the game will get boring very soon. However, the difficulty level escalates in an interesting progression, and most levels seem to introduce something new. It gives you some time to learn in depth about all the enemies and defenses that you have available without "setting out the wolves" on you from a moment to another.\n\nAlso, you cannot just jump to the hardest difficulties, as you will have to play "easy" to unblock "medium" and them "medium" to unblock "hard". This has some sense to it, has you will need to get money to evolve your bodies defenses, in order to make it into the harder difficulties. Otherwise, it would just be impossible.\n\nYou will also have the opportunity to play with heros that will help you defend your body. These characters are upgradable in power, speed and health, and they will be fundamental for you to beat the game in the later stages.\n\nFor the achievement hunters, it is also a great game to have. You can actually tick most of the achievements on your regular game play. No need to go into laborious tasks that in the end are boring and sound like a lot of work.\n\nAll in all, it is a quick / easy to play game, that brings you a great value for money. I would recommend it!!!\n\n(Another negative - in window mode, it is so easy to forget to close the game and leave the room. I think I got 52h of gameplay in a week and that got me into trouble with my partner, has she thought that I spent the whole week playing  games!!!)","January 9","true","57.7"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","0"

I got this game for 1 EUR and it is a really nice TD.\nI'm not crazy with the health concept that provides the 'story' for this game, but from a gameplay perspective it is really good. There is nothing new, but it is solid TD with loads of towers, many different type enemies, and a nice set of levels. You replay each level for new challenges - don't let the titles Easy, Middle, Hard fool you - each is a new 'campaign'. You have a hero, and can buy different types. Their skill increases as you play.\nIn general, this game is a casual Kingdom Rush lite.\n\nIt has really good tutorials and there are videos for each level if you fail, which makes this game an execellent 'TD starter' casual game for people who wants to try TD.\nAnd it is a casual TD - there are no advanced concepts, developments, or a multitude of levels - but it is casual fun and incredible good value for the money.","April 13, 2015","true","21.6"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","2"

The whole game takes place in the human body, as you work your way around the body, you encounter plenty of different enemies with some really interesting abilities.\n\nOne of the major issues I found here is there is certainly some technical issues still going on, load times are pretty bad, even when the game is installed on an SSD, I was often at a load screen for 15 seconds or so. Another issue I encountered was in the later games when your screen is full of defence towers, was the horrendously bad fps drops, they were so bad at times, that it caused me to lose the level.  I would also of liked to have seen an options menu included to be able to change a couple of options such as windows mode, resolution etc. without having to exit the game altogether.\n\nI did like how the game sort of prompts you to go back and get replay previous missions for extra points (tablets in this game), as it is pretty much impossible to progress at some points without going back to farm extra tablets to upgrade your abilities and towers.\n\nHopefully the technical issues can be ironed out, and if they can, then Defend Your Life is an excellent tower defence title, I will still recommend it now, because after all, I played it for almost four hours and still had a really good experience.","April 19, 2015","true","3.5"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","27","43","2","0"

As I played the game, I mostly found myself reminded of other games that did the same thing much better and thinking how much I'd rather be playing them instead.\n\nThe premise of the game with the human body and viruses is also massively disappointing. The enemies are mostly named after diseases, but the names are entirely arbitrary and unrelated to what area of the body you're in. You'll be fighting angina in the larynx, for instance. The levels themselves are also named for various parts of the body, but aren't really related to them. I would have expected the lungs level to have a lot of branches or the intestines level to be long and windy, but they aren't. They're just yet more generic tower defense levels. The towers themselves mostly don't even go that far. A couple are named thematically, but most aren't. Missile silo, swamp tower, tesla tower. I must have missed that day in biology class.\n\nOverall, this is a thoroughly uninspiring and generic title with little to recommend it.","May 16","false","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The $4.00 is really just to bypass micro transactions in the game which are.... not really all that necessary.  I finished the game on all difficulties in a single playthrough with relative ease.  People who don't play tower defense games may struggle a bit, but in terms of difficulty, it's not so bad.  But when I went to the mobile version I noticed that it was actually mildly more difficult because of awkward touch controls.\n\nThe game does import some of the awkward touch mechanics from mobile.  Unfortunately playing it on an actual touch screen like mine just doesn't really work all that well.  Instead you use a mouse and deal with input lag.\n\nThe most unusual choice was to release it on PC with all of the crucial buttons being at the bottom right of the screen.  Steam users know this as the default location for announcements for achievements and friends to appear.  It's always fun when you're playing and all of your abilities are covered up by achievement spam.\n\nHonestly it's probably not even worth $4.00.  There are better tower defenses on Steam, Speedrunners 2 was also a mobile port but it's far better.  Get that one instead.\n\nEdit: They developers for the game added some "PC friendly features."  They added 1080P... sort of.  Instead of having native 1080P they just added black on the sides of the screens... looks like a square still.  Thankfully it's now playable on PC which is still an improvement.  It still suffers from a lot of the mobile issues.  You are forced to use the micro transactions store to progress.  The micro transactions don't cost money, but it is a currency that will eventually run out.","April 14, 2015","false","9.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","10","20","2","1"

The game also uses "running at 2X speed" as one of the ways to make it harder - turning the game into a test of how fast you can click all over the place. This is even more excruciating when it doesn't let you click on your hero for whatever reason.\n\nBottom line: If you enjoy point and clicking everything, this might be for you. Otherwise, either wait until its on sale, or let this one go.","April 19, 2015","false","15.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198176783878/recommended/357780/","76561198176783878","Oceanic~Lullaby","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198176783878/","71 products in account","I would recommend this game at the discounted price of $1, and maybe at the normal $5. Although I wouldn't consider myself a veteran of TD games, I have played a few, and nothing about this game really stands out to me. It's cute, charming, good for a few hours of fun; but it wasn't anything that I couldn't walk away from, and now that I've stopped playing it, I don't really have any wish to continue.\n\nI bought it primarily because I thought a TD game based off of the human immune system would be really cool. I was expecting a game where I could control all sorts of white blood cells to kill foreign viruses and bacteria. However, the game really doesn't follow this theme very well. For starters, your arsenal towers consist of the tesla (which is literally a metallic tower with an orb that fires electrical pulses), the cannon (again, literally a cannon resembling a tank or a machine gun), and the bomber (which fires literal cannon balls). Now, the cannon balls do visible damage to your body on the map, but this doesn't affect the game whatsoever. It's just an aesthetic effect. I think that's a real shame; it wouldn't have been very difficult to incorporate some kind of health meter for the body. When our immune systems fend off invading microbes, we do damage to our own cells as well, and that can lead to a lot of problems. So it wouldn't be inaccurate at all to impose on players the need to balance killing the infecting virus and bacteria without doing too much damage to the body. The currency in the game is oxygen, which is generated by a windmill. And there is a vitamin factory (which provides a boost to your melee towers), but it looks like some tower you'd see in a space station or some alien colony. You can even employ a hero such as the Hulk or a Lumberjack to run around inside your blood vessels.\n\nThe worst part of it is that the enemies are all legitimate viruses and bacteria, and the path they're traveling through is the blood vessels. So the overall effect is that you're inside your body, there are viruses and bacteria circulating through your system, and you're blowing them up with machine guns. And let's not forget the Lumberjack--inside your blood vessel--sawing his way through everything. There is such an odd disynchrony between the towers and the enemies, and it makes no sense. It just doesn't work at all. If you're thinking of buying this game because you, too, are allured by the whole human physiology aspect, prepare to be disappointed.\n\nI believe that there are 17 levels in total, in different areas of the human body (lungs, stomach, kidneys, intestines, etc). I've already played through 7 or 8, and I'm still not fully done the tutorial, i.e. there are still features and upgrades I have yet to unlock. This should also speak for the length of the game (my playtime of 2.2 hours is accurate). The background art is well drawn, and does reflect the different parts of the body well; but the different maps are all very similar and I stopped paying attention to them at about the third or fourth level. The soundtrack is unremarkable, and I can remember nothing I want to say about it. The selection of towers is pitiful (I've already described every unit you can build in the game except one). And one thing that really annoyed me is that the level limitations don't change regardless of your difficulty setting. So, level one, easy: you obviously don't have all your towers or upgrades. That's fine. But once you advance in the game and go back to play level one on medium or hard, you still have only the same towers and upgrades as you did in the easy setting. Nothing you unlocked later on in the game is available to you. This greatly annoyed me, and makes it very difficult to win the more advanced levels. Again, I will say that I'm no TD veteran, so perhaps this would pose no challenge to you; but I do believe that players should have access to everything they've unlocked through their progress. For me, at least, it destroys replayability.\n\nThis game also has Steam pop ups for achievement progression. Not only that, but there are progression notifications for several achievements at once. So once you kill 100 viruses, expect a pop up that tells you you are 100/1000 to earning the first achievement, 100/2000 to earning the second, and 100/4000 to earning the third. The notifications convienently block access to some very important buttons, and if you get more than three at once, the entire game screen blacks out until the pop ups disappear. I don't feel like disabling my achievement notifications for one game. Devs, please fix this.\n\nI can't speak for how well the game runs. I have a brand new 2015 laptop, so if I can't run a game like this, I don't expect that anyone would be able to. And, then again, considering how basic this game is, there really shouldn't be performance issues.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, I do recommend it if you can get it on sale. It's certainly not a polished game, but it's still a functional TD at heart once you get past all the inconsistencies and how generic it is. If you're looking for a break from other games, give this a try.","April 12, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Quite possibly the single best purchase of my entire life. Hours can fly by when playing this. Each level has Easy/Medium/Hard difficulty. The first few levels are deceptively easy on the first 2 difficulty settings. But after the first boss..... easy ain't so easy anymore O_O\n\nDo I like this game? No. I LOVE this game. So many different enemy and tower units. Beautiful graphics. Options are limited at the start but the deeper you go into the game, the greater the amount of things you unlock (upgrades and such).\n\nA smart and charming tower defence game.\n\n10/10","April 14, 2015","true","7.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolname1/recommended/357780/","coolname1","coolname","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolname1/","22 products in account","I suppose the tower defence benchmarks are Defense Grid 1 and 2. The developers of Defend Your Life clearly put no thought into the title, however it's great fun to play and they clearly have put plenty of thought into the gameplay. Don't let the cartoon style graphics deceive you - just when you think you've got it all worked out, it throws you a few curveballs. I haven't finished the game yet, but 5 hours in and I'm still unlocking new power-ups, so it doesn't get stale too quickly.\n\nThe game is based inside the human body and there's weird baddies like "Pro Angina" and "Rabies" (that bark like dogs). Each level is in a different area of the body and fortunately, you wouldn't be able to guess where you were.\n\nIt's all a little bit strange to be honest, and when I got to the bit where I had to click on the semi-autopsied man's crotch, I was quite relieved when it took me to the "Urinary Bladder" level. Weirdness aside, this game is a lot of fun and worth every penny.\n\nI paid Â£0.79 for this today, but if I'd paid full price, I would still be happy.

It's definitely worth a buck. The only down side is I wish it was easier to keep your hero involved like w,a,s,d or arrrow keys for his movement and mouse strictly for tower building. Instead you have to click the hero then the location you want him to move and repeat for every movement. But overall it's fun I just keep the hero in the back for leaks and play the rest like a traditional TD.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDn1z5YUDEU&feature=youtu.be","April 10, 2015","true","8.8"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","5","20","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/recommended/357780/","jpsf91","jpsf91","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/","478 products in account","This is a tower defense game, and in that regard, the game is good, but doesn't have any particular aspect that separates it from it's competitors. The concept seems fun: you are the commander of a human body immunity system, and you have to defend it in various levels, each in a different organ or muscle. The threats represent real life diseases such as angina, flu, cold, nichotin, cholestor, stonekid and even cancer. But when you play it, you'll quickly forget about all that, and it's just another tower defense game. But it's a good one. There's 18 levels each with 3 difficulties, but in practice they mostly play differently, so you have about 50 levels that feel different, even with the same layout. Each enemy type has different characteristics, and will require a different strategy. And there's plenty of tower types to build and upgrade, and they all play differently. There's also a hero that you can command, and other small upgrades to buy. Even if it's nothing new, there's plenty of content here to check. On another note, this game will no longer be patched, despite some bugs still present. But the game is completely playable, and i haven't had any real issues with it that prevented me from enjoying it. If you're worried, none of achievements are broken.","August 15, 2015","true","42.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Such as, framerate slowdowns to the point of being unplayable, and in-game buttons that disappear leaving you unable to effectively strategise for the really hard levels.\n\nThat said, when things are running smoothly and when said buttons are not called for (i.e., for the easy levels), and assuming one doesn't mind that the display aspect ratio is a bit quirky, it can actually be an amusing and enjoyable game.

While the first few levels come easy, the difficulty raises over time.\n\nYou start out with a number of towers and upgrades which are nicely explained in detail. As the game progresses, more towers and upgrades become available.\n\nBesides, you have the possibility of buying a "hero" (which also levels over time) for assistance via ingame "tablets". The latter are rewarded on successfully mastering a level. Each level has got 3 difficulty levels and the "waves" are specific on each level.\n\nAnother nice feature is the ingame "lexikon" containing descriptions of all infection types. Additionally, you got nice tutorials in case help is needed on the publisher's homepage.\n\nI really enjoyed playing this game and would definatley recommend it. The only downside I see is that I couldn't manage to get the game running in fullscreen/correct resolution, which resulted in black bars on the left and right of the screen. But in the end, this don't matter all too much and doesn't hinder the fun and joy of playing this gem.","May 25","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
