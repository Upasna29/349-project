I bought it several years ago and was blown away with how good it is. I'd like to cover a few key points that really make this game stand out from the rest.\n\n-Original cast wrote the plot and voiced their characters! (Bill Murray sounds a little annoyed at returning.) The game is genuinely funny, intelligent, and spooky.\n-Easily one of the most cinematic games ever created. The story intelligently bridges the first and second movies, as well as expands the Ghostbusters mythos and universe in intelligent directions.\n-Revisit popular locations from the movies, without feeling like it's a gimmick! You have a reason for being there and doing what you're doing.\n-There is almost no UI! Almost every function (health, overheating, "ammo", etc) is shown visibly on the character, via the Proton Pack, which actually manages to be easy-to-read and organic at the same time.\n-Tobin's Spirit Guide is available for all the ghouls, ghosts, phantasms, class 5 full-formed repeaters, and spirit objects in the game, replete with their own back stories, lore, and rules. It allows enemies to be diverse and interesting, and fulfilling for lore hounds like myself.\n-The game is fast-paced and fun, and switches the rules up often enough as to never feel stale.\n\nThe only cons I can think of for this game are that it's a bit linear, the upgrade system can be a bit of an annoyance from time to time, and the "teammate revive" mechanic can be a bit annoying, since the boys like to go down often on the tougher enemies. But none of these things deterred the experience for me and, at $10, this game is a STEAL! You HAVE to buy it. It's so worth it.","October 3, 2014","true","34.5"," 277 of 294 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","277","294","0","2"

It's a great little game with the original actors from the movie lending their voices. The game never strays from the source material. You play a new ghostbuster, only known as the "Rookie." All the wonderful characters from both movies combine to make something unexpected and quite fun. Buy this game go bust some ghosts.\n\nPros:\n1. Bill Murray\n2. Never had any bugs or glitches in my playthrough\n3. I've always wanted to be a ghostbuster\n4. (see number one)\n\nCons:\n1. An older game with dated graphics (very minor issue for me)\n2.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/9870/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Lately there's been a lot of disappointment expressed over this new Ghostbusters reboot movie, and a lot of people once again wishing for a true Ghostbusters 3. The great tragedy is how many of them will never know that it already existed 6 years ago in the form of this game, and was even called "essentially the third movie" by Dan Akroyd. The main 4 cast members all return to voice their characters (Rick Moranis is absent, tragically), and even a decent amount of side characters come back to reprise their roles.\n\nThe premise of the game is pretty simple. Instead of playing as one of the Ghostbusters themselves, you play as a new recruit, who is about as self-insertion fodder as you can get. Aside from being totally mute, he isn't even given a name, with the main cast just referring to him by various different names like 'cadet' and 'new guy' because they "don't like getting too attached to the recruits". This means that there's no time wasted introducing a new character, and instead you just get to feel like you're on a ghostbusting tour with the fan favorites. One of my favorite aspects is how well the proton stream and new wearpons are brought into the game; you get other attachments that serve as other weapons throughout the game, but the proton beam is used to capture ghosts, done by damaging the ghosts enough to weaken them and then grappling them and slamming them into walls and other objects until they're dazed enough to be captured in a ghost trap. The proton beam leaves scorched spots wherever it contacts with a surface and almost everything in the game's areas are destructible, so every encounter with ghosts inevitably results in a once pristine location being reduced to a scorched disaster, making you feel just like the comical menace to bar mitzvahs, libraries, and hotels that the Ghostbusters are.\n\nUnfortunately, the PC port of the game isn't that great. It was poorly optimized at launch, and while modern day computers should handle it fine, if your computer is a bit dated you might want to wait for an upgrade (though even on my modern PC I still dropped from an average of 120 FPS to around 8 to 11 during the final boss fight). Though no matter what your specs are, there's no dodging the mouse acceleration, which still haunts the game so badly that even the Ghostbusters wouldn't pick up if you called them to deal with it. Ghostbusters has probably the worst mouse controls I've seen in a game (barring games that just don't have them, like Dark Souls), and while it is playable enough that I've completed the game twice, it's not what I'd call acceptable, and if you're comfortable playing with a gamepad I would recommend using that instead.\n\nBut ultimately, while the port isn't that great, and the game does decline in quality gameplay-wise for the last hour or so, I'd still recommend the game to anyone who's a fan of Ghostbusters. It's only $10, and while the story might feel a bit too much of the same, it's still as close to a Ghostbusters 3 as I feel we're ever going to get.","August 26, 2015","true","20.4"," 109 of 114 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","109","114","7","8"

This game includes themes that wanted to be explored in further movies but those sadly never got made but this game got made and you can find them here like going to hell that alter universe kind of place.  This game has proton packs, the traps, all that Ghostbusting goodness we have come to know and love from the movies.   There are upgrades and the nostalgia runs wild through this, one of the best parts is in the GBHQ you can go upstairs and look at a computer screen that has the ending from the NES Ghostbusters game.  This game is ten tons of awesomesauce.  Even if the movies didnt exist and only this game, it would sit as a standalone slice of fried gold.  In the movie they wreck this beautiful dining room in a fancy schmancy hotel, in this game you get to go to that hotel and smash up that room leaving not even the flowers still standing.  The ghosts are clever and creative with the marshmallow man making the rounds.  Get ready to hit the twelth floor and take down some cockroaches because YOU ARE A GHOSTBUSTER!!!\n\nThis is one of the greatest PC games out there, not only is it a GOOD game tied to a movie, but it also works without tons of bugs and glitches.  All that hard work the awesome programmer people put in with their coffees going all night living off stale pizza ended with every studio involved in this game going out of business.  Their legacy will not be forgotten...\n(Bearly tears T_T)\n\nTo view some fun content that ISNT in the game but is in the game files check these out:\nThanksgiving Parade Cut Scene 1:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw0EK1A4il8\n(This level the "Thanksgiving Parade" is NOT in the game,  including being able to go in Ray's Occult Bookstore, the assets are around though.

It stars the voice acting of all four original Ghostbusters, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson. Not just them, but other members of the cast, Annie Potts, William Atherton as William Peck, Brian Doyle-Murray as the Mayor and newcomer Alyssa Milano as Dr. Ilyssa Selwyn. You play the new fifth Rookie Ghostbuster, voiced by Ben Stiller. No I'm just kidding. He has no dialog, even though there are screams every so often. This is why you play the game, to immerse yourself in everything from the movies. To be in the firehouse between missions. To play what people call the third movie written by Aykroyd and Ramis. To be a real Ghostbuster shoulder to shoulder with them. I should mention there's no multiplayer component like the console versions.\n\nYou will rarely bust ghosts alone. Most of the time you're there with one, two, three or four of the Ghostbusters. They are competent partners and can really do anything you can do. Switch weapons, blast ghosts, wrangle them and trap them. In 10 hours of play, I never saw them get stuck on anything and in later parts, there is a lot to get stuck on. These partners can play the game without you, but that doesn't mean they leave you behind or lead the way. They stuck with you and let you lead the way. The Ghostbusters move as fast as you do, so you'll never have to wait for them.\n\nAnother thing they do well is revive. Your health slowly regenerates, but when you go down for the count, they'll pick you back up and you'll do the same for them! Sometimes that's a deal breaker for people. You can even be their medic if that's how you want to play. Let them do the work and they will, unless they're specifically hinting at what to do.\n\nSo when it comes to ghosts, there are two types, lesser ones you have to blast into vapor. The others, more difficult ghosts that you need to weaken them enough to wrangle them. Then with them wrangled, thrown around, so if they're scrambling to go right, you need to whip them to the left. When its time, you need to throw out a trap if there's not already one out. With a ghost weak enough, you and the other Ghostbusters need to pull them down into the trap and keep them from moving out of the radius of the vacuum where they are free again. It is all certainly a process that will make you feel like a real Ghostbuster, because it feels like work.\n\nThat's the game, so much of it feels like real work. You won't just run from area to area, you'll whip out your PKE meter and see in a first person night vision view. With the PKE meter out, you'll be guided to supernatural activity. There are things you'll need to find, such as clues, but also artifacts and collectables. I went through almost the entire game in PKE mode and I don't feel like there was anything special to find. Its not a fast mode, you'll need to follow the hot and cold signal, sometimes moving around rooms to find where the activity is coming from. The first person night vision is certainly a nice touch, its just not very quick.\n\nThe PKE is also your PDA. You'll use it to see what your objective is, upgrade weapons and view additional information on what you just scanned into the database. Everything can be upgraded once. From damage intensity to beam heat. You pay for it with money that you get for busting ghosts. Not just busting ghosts, but destruction. Its woven into the story that New York City pays for the repairs, so somehow you get the money for blowing up cars and shooting through walls.\n\nWhen it comes to weapons, you start with the typical red proton stream and the Ghostbusters give you three others periodically to test out. A blue cryo beam, green slime slinger and a rapid fire sort of yellow pulse. The slime thrower can clear up black slime environmental hazards that will hurt you. It can also seal portals that lesser ghosts spawn. All four weapons share the same energy and if the beam gets too hot, you need to vent it (reload) or you're stuck having a cooldown for a longer period of time than a reload. If you cross proton beams too long, you'll get a warning, followed up by an explosive, damaging discharge. All four weapons make for a colorful light show all throughout the game.\n\nThe proton beam has a default fire button that, and a wrangler button lets you grab things including ghosts if they're weak enough. Then you can use a third button whip them around with a different button. Three buttons, one beam. On top of that there's an alt fire. The proton beam has a sort of grenade giant projectile, the cryo beam has a straight beam when normally its a shotgun blast of a beam for faster moving targets, the rapid fire beam just fires a second shot. Think of that as a right and left sort of firing. Just firing one rapid fire shot is slow, so you alt fire to double the speed.\n\nFinally, there is the slime tether for the slime slinger. This is the only weapon that really feels fun. Alt fire it once to connect point A, then alt fire it again to connect point B. Watch as the two points quickly come together! This allows you to pull platforms together, move objects and generally derp around for the laughs.\n\nThere are a variety of enemies that you'll need different techniques to tackle. Rip shields away from some ghosts. Wrangle gargoyles and bash them into the ground. Slime tether flying cherubs to the ground and watch them smash. Cover black slime demons in green slime. Ghosts that possess people and the Ghostbusters, needing you to douse them in green slime to restore them. Some of the uncommon fights felt like they took way too long, especially the possessors. Can't shoot them, because they're in a Ghostbuster. Then still have to struggle to wrangle, throw them around and put them in a trap. The bosses were big with multiple parts. One you'd need to green slime it, because its covered in black slime, then tear its mask off, so the others can blast it.\n\nThe game had a few game breakers for me. Getting stuck in a luggage rack around my feet, preventing me from walking through a flooded hotel's tight spots. Not doing exactly what the Ghostbuster's told me to left them waiting for a ghost to put into the 'super slammer' ghost trap, when I put them in my own trap. The guys are very helpful with hints and clues.\n\nAs for the locations, the game will take you back through the first two movies. You'll visit the Sedgewick Hotel to recapture slimer, take on the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in Times Square, visit the New York City Public Library and even the sewers that were once filled with slime. The game also takes you to new places I guess... like a ghost world with floating platforms that you need to slime tether together and timed running to avoid being beaten to death by books. Oh the game also takes you through a spooky graveyard. That's new right? Every location is spooky, but not scary or horrifying. There's no blood, just slime. The music is from the movie, but feels different like its a different performance and not the music straight from the movie like Ray Parker's theme song.\n\nWith everything said, the game felt like work. It was great to revisit mostly the first movie and have great voice acting from characters we know and love, but there are games that are more fun. Blasting ghosts to vapor was one thing, wrangling them is another. While the game is full of comedy written by two of the best and voice acted by three of the best, I didn't laugh out loud once. I understand that the jokes every 30 seconds were funny, I just didn't laugh. If this was the script for a third movie, I can't imagine it being a good movie. As for it being a good game... All this needed was to have the voice actors from the movie and a game that starts with Ray Parker's Ghostbusters theme and ends with Ray Parker's Ghostbuster's theme.","December 29, 2014","true","10.5"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","41","43","2","0"

It got taken off about a year and a bit ago and has been A.W.O.L ever since. Well If you were ever keen to grab it, now would probably be a good time since there was apparently a problem getting keys issued for the game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344363919\nTo my surprise the game actually captures the spirit of the franchise perfectly (having been penned by Dan Ackroyd himself, one of the original creators of the Ghostbusters). Having all the actors reprise their digital selves is a blast and to hear the banter going back and forth between the characters reminded me of old friends, instantly transporting me back to the early eighties were as a kid with childlike sensibilities I lived in wonder of these fine ghost fighting folk so much so that I even wanted to be a Ghostbuster myself until I realized that movies were not real and that no real Ghostbusters of this variety actually existed.\n\nThe game picks up two years after the events that closed Ghostbusters 2 and involves an architect that goes by the name of Ivor Shando who is trying to bring another Great Destructor into the world. As stories of this nature go, its not the strongest and wouldn't have made that remarkable of a film if it were filmed as Ghostbusters 3 but for a game its more than fine.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344364592\nThe graphics are quite lovely and vibrant throughout and many of the levels are an absolute blast to explore, although not tech pushing they do a serviceable job and manage to create an immerseful world that is immediately recognizable if you watched the movies. Controls were a bit awkward with the keyboard but once my xbox wireless controller was hooked in I had no problems whatsoever. The game can get quite challenging and frustrating in sections, especially towards the end were I was having hassles with the cherubs in the cemetery.\n\nIf I have one serious complaint it's that the rest of the Ghostbusting team (you get to play a nameless rookie and not one of the original characters) are a bit naff when it comes to actually fighting ghosts. They repeatedly get themselves into situations were they are downed and you have to rush over to revive them or else if you go down and there is no one to revive you the game ends and you have to restart from your save. It would have been nice if they had implemented a co-op feature which I understand after reading reviews was included in the console version. It's really a shame this did not make it into the PC version as I could think of nothing more awesome than co-oping a Ghostbuster's game. Anyway, classic case of PC gamers getting the short shrift yet again.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=344365772\nAll in all it was a great way to revisit the classic with even Slimer, Stay Pufft and the Librarian Ghost getting in on some of the digital action. As mentioned it's a pity we can't all hook up every once in a while to save New York from the terrors of the night but as a massive Ghostbusters fan (it's my favorite film from the eighties) it does more than just pay lip service to the fans. It actually turns out to be a worthy and rather well made action adventure game from a popular license. At it's current price of $9.99 its a steal considering the length and quality of the actual game.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","January 4, 2014","true","20.7"," 59 of 72 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","59","72","0","2"

It even carries on from GhostBusters 2, but with very slight inconsistencies. Does't affect the game though.\n\nThe story is good, written by Dan Aykroyd and the late Harold Ramis. I enjoyed it, all the trappings of GhostBusters are in it, including some great Venkman One-Liners.\n\nGameplay, I've enjoyed. At times the controls can be abit finicky, especially the Gears-Of-War-inspired run button that sometimes irritates me. The AI of the ghostbusters can be erratic to the point where it will cause you to die and restart to the last checkpoint. Towards the end of the game, specifically the Stone Angels by the Cemetary Gate, the difficulty is ramped up for no reason, it becomes the hardest section to beat and is needed to carry on. Very very weird.\n\nGraphically, it is passable but dated by 2016 standards. Even though the game came out in 2009, it shows its age abit.\nOn my Nvidia 970, I have noticed that the framerate changes from 60 to 30, depending on what is happening onscreen. Sometimes a battle sequence is at 60fps and a walk through of a level is 30 and vice versa. This could be how the game was ported to PC though.\n\nAudio, no issues here. Neither hate or love it, job gets done.\n\nIs the game worth (as of 02-05-2016)US$10?\nFor huge fans of the franchise, yes. All your wims of GhostBustordium are met and slightly exceeded.\nFor everyone else, hold out for a discount.

You have to shoot the ghosts long enough until their "health" is down, then you need to catch them with your ghost trap, while trying to keep them in the beam so that they won't escape.\nCapturing ghosts was the most fun part for me actually, as it was implemented pretty good. The controls of the proton gun while catching a ghost with it, felt pretty good, especially when struggeling to get them into the traps.\nThe only issue i had was with the camera, it was a bit clumsy to control (with mouse and keyboard) but after a while i got used to it.\n\nAll in all it's a nice and fun game, which does a good job in creating a nice ghostbusters atmosphere.\nDespite some (minor, imho) technical flaws, like the controls and the somewhat outdated graphics, i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the movies.","March 2, 2014","true","8.2"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PunasaurusRex/recommended/9870/","PunasaurusRex","PunasaurusRex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PunasaurusRex/","5687 products in account","Story:\nWell done. I think if this was an actual movie instead of a video game it would fit right in to the Ghostbusters series. I would totally have gone to see this in theatres. Story was thought out. Involved many aspects and subtle references and jokes to the previous Ghostbusters Movies. Plot involves saving New York from mass dimensional collision all caused by the Damsel in Distress unbeknowest to her.\n\nTo quote - Ghostbusters creator Dan Aykroyd has said, "This is essentially the third movie." and I whole-heartedly agree.\n\nCharacters:\nIf you know the original movies. Egon, Ray, Venkeman, and Winston. All remain with their personalities intact. No big changes. Venkeman still after the girls with his sarcasm befitting his character. This was used throughout. Egon with his super nerd explanation of anything. And simple truth Ray the big boss of the team. The best part is that each of the actors who portrayed the Ghostbusters in the films, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson, lent their voices and likenesses to the in-game characters which made the character more consistent and true to their movie counterparts.\n\nYou - basically as if there was a new recruit to the team - you learn the ropes as the newbie. You never speak which is fine - (i dont want to hear my character I rather hear Bill Murray as Venkeman).\n\nGameplay:\nThe third person shooter set-up of the game is very valid. The idea your pack can do different things to fight a range of different ghosts from the other side also was fine. My only issue, my only true complaint is that if you check any of my videos of the full game as I played is the following: The mouse did not trap on the window. So I had a lot of trouble aiming, my mouse would go off screen or my mouse would accidently hit the X to close or pick up and drag the window while I was attempting to fight a ghost. It was very difficult to play straight without have to go tab to the menu and back to get back to the game and remove the movement lock from the mouse going off screen. If you can get past the mouse issue, the only issue at times is when multiple streams are on screen or the characters, the gameplay would slow down/lag. (referring to rendering of the other ghostbusters with your character.)\n\nAI:\nIn addition, the AI at times were dreadful. You are a team member of the ghostbusters fighting ghosts and bosses yet you do all the work. I would have thought at times when there were 10+ ghosts on the screen I wouldn't be the only one attempting to capture them.\n\nOverall:\nI would recommend to play this game. The one pitfall is the mouse. But the rest of it. I loved. Then again could be biased to the fact I watched the Ghostbusters as a child. And since it was Halloween, Ghostbusters were being shown on the TV.\n","January 3, 2014","true","11.3"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","1"

Now I'll admit I haven't seen Ghostbusters in few years, but it seemed very faithful to the spirit of the movie. Your character, a new guy joining Ghostbusters, doesn't speak at all, which is no problem. Bill Murray, on the other hand, speaks a lot and in such a ... uninterested... voice that is very funny.\n\nGraphics are good (But then again, anything from 2009 that looked even 'okay' back then looks good to me now), I really liked how the proton pack is detailed, considering it covers your entire back and you'll be staring at it the whole game. Releasing the steam to cool down (basically reloading) was weirdly satisfying, so when there were no ghosts to bust, I sometimes shot up the scenery just to be able to cool down.\n\nEnvironment is quite destructable, which is a need when you are busting ghosts in museums and luxury hotels.\n\nControls (w/ mouse) were a little awkward, but I got used to them after making some adjustments. (maxed up vertical sensitivity, lowered horizontal)\n\nIn the end all is fine and the hero got the girl. (no, not the PC, Bill Murray)\n\n\nRating: Solid 3 golden sloths","April 9, 2015","true","5.9"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","30","35","3","0"

The Ghostbusters are now funded by the city of New York and they are well respected in the community. In fact, they have started recruiting new Ghostbusters, which is where you come in. You play as Rookie, a trainee whose real name the other Ghostbusters refuse to learn because they do not want to get too attached. You do not get much time to learn the ropes before a pulse of energy flows through the city, igniting paranormal activity like a wildfire.\nCatching ghosts is lots of fun. Most of the ghosts in the game are beaten by just damaging them until they run out of health, but there are still a lot that require ghost traps. The process of wearing down these larger ghosts and dragging them into traps is incredibly satisfying. There's a decent variety of weapons aside from the basic proton stream, including a slime thrower and the really fun slime tether. You also come equipped with a PKE meter, which lets you get information about your environment and ghosts, much like the Scan Visor in Metroid Prime. All this equipment can be upgrade with money earned by catching, defeating, and scanning ghosts, as well as by finding collectibles throughout the game.\nThe characters look like the actor's they are based on. The effects for the proton pack are spot-on. The ghosts look great,with some interesting designs. The level designs are varied, ranging from areas straight from the movies to completely new, almost Lovecraftian environments. Everything looks good and creepy, and there is a lot of attention paid to detail.\nEverything about the sound in this game is nearly perfect. Clearly, the voice acting is fantastic because it is the actual actors who are doing the voice actors.\nThe music sounds just like the movie, everything sounds right.\nGhostbusters: The Video Game offers an excellent opportunity to relive one of the greatest franchises of the 80s. It stays true to the movies it was based on while providing a nice twist to a standard video game genre. Whether you are a fan of the Ghostbusters or not, you will probably have fun with the few hours you will spend on this game.\n\nSound 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","March 15, 2014","true","8.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","0"

It turned out to be really hilarious! It feels like more of a movie sequel than a game, which is fine by me!  The game itself is well done with good graphics and good puzzles all peppered with lots of witty comments from the other Ghostbusters. The voice acting is hilarious at times and they try to make you feel at home with encouragement like, "Way to go Rookie!"   Getting that from Bill Murray... *swoon*  Of course, there's a cheesy love story and a powerful ghost on the loose. The story is pretty much the first movie with small differences, which is fine by me! =)\n\nI did have trouble getting the ghosts into the traps.  I don't know if its a bug, but sometimes if you drag a ghost near a trap nothing happens, or if there's a wall nearby the ghost gets stuck on the wall and there's nothing you can do, but release and try again.  It was frustrating at first, but then I just spammed traps left and right to give myself a better chance of catching the ghosts.  I also got the trap speed upgrade early on which helped a lot.  I also didn't like all the new beams and weapon options.  Other than the slime gun and slime tether, the others just felt tacked on and silly.\n\nThis is a fun game!

I wouldn't have been able to say that before 2009 when Ghostbusters: The Video Game was released though. How good is this game? Well in the first month and a half the game sold over one million copies and I was one of them who contributed to that number. Did this game sell that many copies because it was a Ghostbusters game or because fans would have bought anything Ghostbusters at that time?\n\nThe game begins two years after the Ghostbusters two movie and they are training a new recruit who is just called "Rookie" and that character is who you will be playing. The year is 1991 and its Thanksgiving Day and for some reason a shock wave of some sort hits the city and you find yourself hunting down ghosts with the ghost buster team and so begins the game.\n\nThe first thing you will notice is just how meticulous the developers were in every detail. They made the headquarters just they way it was in the movies, right down to the decor, items and office equipment. If that wasn't enough you will hear that the voices for all the characters in the game are the exact ones from the movies! That's right Ghostbuster fans, they were able to get all the original actors to do the voices for there characters in game. Even the most iconic figure in the game, the Ecto 1, is kept to its original form down to every detail including the license plate.\n\nThe single player game is just phenomenal, I am not going to get into the story plots of the game, but you do fight the Stay Puffed marshmallow man early on in the game and it build up form there.\n\nThere is no Multiplayer side of the game anymore and when it was originaly included the multiplay was the Sanctum of Slime thats a seporate game now.\n\nThe Xbox 360, PS3 and PC versions of this game are by far the best ones out there, however the Wii version was rendered more like a Saturday morning cartoon and it wasn't one I myself would ever touch. I am sure kids out there liked it allot but as for me growing up with the Ghostbusters and having the two movies on DVD I never wanted to see a skimped down version of the game.\n\nOriginaly when the game was on Steam it didn't have any support for the Xbox360 controller, but after an update, not sure when it was because I left it for so long (didn't like playing this with Keyboard and Mouse) it now suuports the controller.\n\nIf your considering this game for the Xbox 360 or PS3 you won't be disappointed. This used is now back on Steam after a long hiatus and being sold for $9.99. Its the best Ghostbusters game ever and is worth a play.\n\nPro's\nOriginal actors took up there roll and vocied their characters\nHarold Ramis was still alive when he vocied his character *we will miss him\nEverything Ghostbuster realted was placed in the game with care\nSounds, music, and characters bantering all in place as it should be\nYou will be left wanting more\nCon's\nNo Multiplayer game portion anymore\nNo Coop\nI give this game:\nːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː\n\nhttp://youtu.be/4J12XEQLQyE","September 16, 2014","true","3.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","0"

This game doesn't feature much of the replayability of most modern games, and feels asthough the budget ran out after the campaign, but all the love and attention was put into making the story memorable and enjoyable, which is what you should be here for.

The game casts you as a new recruit to the paranormal security company, who gets to train "on the job" alongside the characters from the movie, voice-acted by their respective actors (except for one, whose name escapes me for the moment). You also get to use all the gadgets, bust ghosts using the methods used in the movies, fight enemies from the movies - everything is very authentic, with a keen attention to detail guaranteed to please fans of the series. That said, the controls are slightly finnicky with keyboard and mouse (it was originally an Xbox 360 game after all, and really should be played with a controller for best effect), and some of the levels do meander a little, but not enough to annoy most players. Manhatten looks great, though, when you get the chance to take to the streets in the ECTO-1 during an early set-piece.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/level3corn/recommended/9870/","level3corn","Level 3 Corn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/level3corn/","194 products in account","Story - Pretty nice for a Ghostbusters game, and was written by the original team behind the first two movies. This was intended to be Ghostbusters 3 and I'm glad to see them still shine. I wish there was a film adaptation, but with the guy who played Egon dead (may he rest in peace), it just isn't the same. I love the fact the game continues not long after the end of Ghostbusters 2. I don't want to spoil the plot but rest assured, it feels like Ghostbusters.\n\nGameplay - Bustin' ghosts never felt so right. There's several varieties of 2spooky4u ghosts that come in for melee attacks, ranged attacks, fire, slime, and so on. Chef ghosts haunt the kitchen, a fisherman and his boat haunt a seafood eattery, etc. In the Wii version there was also purple slime that could slow you down and make you less accurate and mobile. As a small side note you could also play as a female in the Wii version. You get upgrades along the way that are slowly introduced to the character that doesn't feel overwhelming. Ghosts are captured and dropped into the Ghost Containment Trap and you are given money. Money can be used to buy upgrades for your weapons and equipment.\n\nYou also have the PKE Meter which is used to track down hidden things, treasures, scan ghosts, and so on. All the things you find and collect are in display at the firehouse for you to see or interact with. My favorite is a pair of ghost bellbottom pants that play disco and walk around the firehouse. Even Vigo and the giant painting from Ghostbusters 2 is just propped up in the firehouse, and you can talk to them.\n\nGhosts and possessed things that are scanned are stored in a database for you to read up on and see their weaknesses.\n\nYou can destroy many things in the enviroment and that's cool. Nothing like blowing up millions of dollars worth of things that cannot be replaced in a museum.\n\nCombat - Point the crosshair at the ghost, shoot beams at ghost, lay trap for ghost, catch ghost, and just know that bustin' makes you feel good. All ghosts have a weakness and exploiting the weakness makes them easier to trap. A lot of weaker/smaller ghosts, zombies, and things that are possessed don't need to be captured and are easy fodder to pick off. You can take damage in combat and taking enough damage knocks you out. A Ghostbuster can come revive and you can continue on your way. The Ghostbusters and their AI are for the most part, very stupid. Many times they will stand in the same place and take multiple hits and collapse in a funny heap, forcing you to revive them if you spare a moment. In most cases you'll want to keep them alive so anything that's a threat will target them instead of you.\n\nGraphics, Models, Voice-acting- The graphics are fairly nice and consistent with the dark and spooky feeling of Ghostbusters. Some parts of the game are a little too dark and I found myself having to swap to the PKE meter just to see properly. I hear that there is a shadow rendering error, or some kind of display error that can cause the game to crash. I've yet to see that in my game. There's also some real world advertisements in-game. The only ones I could find were Doritos, back when they had the old logo.\n\nModels look awesome and are ready to recognize. Everyone from Peter, to Egon, to the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man look very good and accurate to their movie representation. Even the Proton Pack on your back looks VERY detailed and realistic.\n\nVoice-acting is pretty good as well and I feel the Ghostbusters did a good job. My only real complaint is Bill Murray, in almost every bit of linework that he did, just sucked at it. He sounded very in character, but it wasn't difficult to imagine Bill inside the recording studio, bored while reading all the lines he had. Even his one-liners were a headache to listen to. Egon and the rest of the crew however did a very excellent job and I'm glad they got all the original actors to do their parts. I did find it strange that Louis (Rick Moranis) did not make an appearance, nor was mentioned outside of one line in-game. To be fair the helmet that he wore in the first movie after getting possessed is inside the firehouse.\n\nConversations don't feel awkward, forced, or weird. Lots of scientific mumbo-jumbo is tossed your way between Egon and Ray, which I found to be goofy.\n\nEnviroments - A number of enviroments from a castle, the famous motel from the first movie, graveyard, the library from the first movie, and various other places look true to their origin. Or as true as they could be imagined. It felt very nostalgic to explore the library for some reason.\n\nThe firehouse is also in-game and acts as a sort of hub. Exploring the fire house reveals many of the things shown in the movies, as well as things you collected in missions. Janine, the secretary, is still there for the Ghostbusters and still takes calls and sets up appointments. In the upstairs area is the lab and where they sleep. They've got a Q*Bert arcade machine and next to it is "Employee Of the Month" showing pictures of Bill Murray in various scenes of the movie, and I think one scene from Caddyshack. Of course the Ecto-1 is there, but dubbed the Ecto-1B on the license plate.  The siren plays briefly in-game from time to time too. Slimer is there too.\n\nUI / HUD - There is no life bar, no ammo count, and very little else. All things follow a route similar to Dead Space where all your information is shown on your back. I've never noticed a lifebar at any point in time. Swapping weapons reflects on your proton pack and the animations are cool. The lack of a HUD outside of a few things like swapping your beam, or the PKE meter, makes things very nice in my opinion. Sometimes a game just doesn't need all sorts of bars, text, and other information to tell you and I like that.\n\nDifficulty - Outside of a few head scratching puzzles, the game wasn't very difficult on the Experienced (Normal) setting outside of a few moments in later levels. Playing on Professional yielded a much better experience since I felt it kept me on my toes. Simple things like fodder can be a genuine threat. I also played the game while using an Xbox One controller with Aim Assist turned off to make it a much more fun experience. It felt satisfying to beat the game for a third time.\n\nReplayablity - With a number of things to collect, ghosts to scan, and things to look out for, you'll get a decent few hours out of the game. The game does have some limited replayability and finding all the collectables that show up in your fire house I feel is worth going 100% for. There's also concept art that show up on the main menu after beating a level and as someone who's a sucker for concept art and things that didn't make it into the game, I like the nice gesture.\n\nOverall - Very fun game if you're a Ghostbusters fan. While it does have some limited replay value, it's still a great game to play.\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 13, 2015","true","9.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I picked it up on sale for £2 to give it a go because I adore the films. Upon getting a few hours in I have found myself to be extremely surprised by just how good the game is.\n\nGraphically it looks lovely (for a 2009 game, at least), and runs smoothly without any issues. The sound, music and voice acting is spot on (all main cast members do the voice overs). It "feels" exactly like you are in a Ghostbusters film. The characters chat and joke with eachother and the humour from the films is here in abundance. The sound of zapping ghosts with your proton pack is pure joy.\n\nYou take on the role of a "rookie" Ghostbuster, recruited to help the team. A lot of locations from the original film show up in the game, which are great fun to visit. The combat is refreshingly fun and different.\n\nAlthough the multiplayer is sadly missing from the PC version (I was very bummed out by this), I can safely say this game is good - great if you are a fan of the films. For the money I paid, it is WELL worth it. If you fancy a bit of Ghostbusters nostalgia - this is the game to play.\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","October 29, 2014","true","13.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arkhamskaro/recommended/9870/","Arkhamskaro","Arkhamskaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arkhamskaro/","134 products in account","I just finished playing Ghostbusters: The Video game for the PC and wow what a ride. When I bought the game on Steam during their halloween sale I was happy to finally be able to play this game. I remember playing the demo on the PS3 when the game was about to come out and I thought to myself that this is a really good game. Sadly I wasn’t able to afford the game when it came out a couple of years ago.\n\nI just have to say that I wasn’t expecting this game to have Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, and Harold Ramis do the voices for their characters in the game. Hell I wasn’t even expecting Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd to be the writers of the game either. So once I read the title credits and saw those names, I knew it was going to be good.\n\nThe gameplay was actually great. Being able to use a Proton pack was exhilarating. I was able to control the stream wherever I wanted to, and I was able to destroy furniture and walls with the proton stream which was so cool. My favorite part was being able to use the ghost trap and capturing ghosts. The whole process of capturing was so spot on, that I actually felt like I was a ghostbuster. Using the Ecto-Goggles and PKE Meter to scan and identify ghosts was cool as well, but it just seemed like I had to use them to much. Besides using the Proton pack, ghost trap, PKE Meter, and Ecto-Goggles, there was also three other weapons that I was able to use. One of them being the Slime Blower from Ghostbusters II. The Slime Blower is used to discharge black slime and clear paths, as well as to take down ghosts that are weakened by green slime. Also there was a second function to the Slime Blower called Slime Tethers, which is used to either pull walls down or solving some puzzles. The next weapon that I was able to use was called a Dark Matter Generator. It worked like a weird shotgun and it was a little untrustworthy but good at short range. The second function of the dark matter generator was a stasis stream which when aimed and shot at a ghost for a certain period of time would crystallized the ghost and freeze them in place for a short while, while the other ghostbusters would damage the the frozen ghost. The third and final weapon would be the Composite Particle system. The two functions of this weapon is a Meson Collider and overload pulse. The Meson Collider worked like a sniper rifle, except with no scope. It fires a high powered particle stream like bullet and once it hits it's target, the Overload pulse comes in. The Overload Pulse, works when a ghost is tagged by the Meson Collider. When the Overload pulse is fired, it shoots out rapid fire particles and goes straight to where the tagged ghost is. If no target is made, it will continue to shoot rapid fire particles and can be directed to any ghost.\n\nSo adding on a couple of weapons, one already known, and two which are brand new, it was cool to mess around with these in the game. What made me happy about these weapons was that every time I got a new weapon, Egon (Harold Ramis character), would explain what the weapons would do and the scientific reasoning behind them. To me hearing the explanations of the weapons made it fit into the Ghostbuster universe perfectly.\n\nThe ghosts are of course the main enemies of the game. There was a wide variety of ghosts from chefs to librarians to Slimer, and of course The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man. Each with their own weakness and abilities, which made the game more challenging. Some would need to get hit by a certain weapon to make it easier to catch, some would need to be destroyed by a Proton stream. All in all, it made the game fun.\n\nThe levels were good as well. Nothing looked like it wasn’t finished. The architecture on some of the levels were phenomenal, and the way everything looked, looked right out of an actual Ghostbuster movie. It made the game much more enjoyable.\n\nIn the end, the whole game acted like a brand new Ghostbuster movie. It felt like this is what Ghostbusters III would have been. I had a blast playing this game and I wish there was another one being made, but sadly Harold Ramis died this year and yet we still have Dan Aykroyd as the secondary writer, it wouldn't be the same without Ramis. I’ve played many movie to game adaptations and yes there are many that are terrible, but Ghostbusters: The Video Game was a very well made, well polished game that I wouldn’t mind playing over again.","November 11, 2014","true","9.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

You play as a silent but otherwise visually emotive recruit who helps the Ghostbusters out through their missions as well as helping them test new proton pack equipment. There's a solid story flow which feels very true to the nature of the franchise, and it maintains continuity instead of making up random Hollywood revisionist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This is largely due to Akroyd and Raimis having written the script. On a nice note, Winston gets a lot of lines now instead of being relegated more to the background.

I guess you're supposed to feel heavy because of all the gear you're carrying, but it can make the game a little less fun to play. They give you a side-step/dodge move that is too sluggish to be of much use. The act of busting the ghosts themselves is also a little too simplistic for my tastes, but the game offsets this by providing you with a steady supply of new gadgets. None of them really seem that useful, but by the time you realize this, they're ready to give you the next one to play with, so at least that's not too bad.\n\nI'm still recommending it, but only tentatively. As a Ghostbusters fan, I had the most fun just exploring the (surprisingly expansive!) iconic firehouse, looking at the countless easter eggs stashed around every corner. They have the painting of Vigo the Carpathian in one corner, and his banter is great fun. That kind of stuff might be worth the price of admission by itself, but if this game didn't have the Ghostbusters license to lean on, there wouldn't be much here worth seeing.","February 16, 2014","true","9.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

As the newest recruit of the Ghostbuster team, you follow Egon, Ray, Peter and Winston as they discover the source of the disasters that have struck New York City in their past adventures.\n\nPros: This is the third movie everyone have always wanted, the scripts by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd is spot on, and all the main voice actors return including William Atherton as Walter Peck. The game looks and sounds great. The attention to details is staggering, including the incredible amount of lore and fan service in the Firehouse. You actually feel like you’re one of the Ghostbusters as they interact with you and each other.\n\nCons: The game is short, and you can easily complete it AND get all the secret collectibles in 10 hours. The music, limited to the score available in the two movies, can get repetitive. When swarmed by ghosts, you may find yourself spending the better part of the encounter helping your buddies back on their feet, which can get frustrating.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!\n\nIf you’re any bit of a Ghostbusters fan, GET THIS GAME! Sure, its length will leave you wanting more, because it is so good! This game was made with love and attention to detail, very few movie game will ever be as spot-on as Ghostbuster: The Videogame.

If you're not... well, watch the movies first and get back here, if you became one of.\n\n\nStory\nStory is written by Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis (Ray & Egon), so expect 100% authenticity and relation with both Ghostbusters movies. Many think, including myself, this game as Ghostbusters 3 movie.\n\n10/10\n\n\nSound\nGhostbusters' voices performed by original actors themselves: Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis. Classic dialogues, jokes etc.\nSame theme song by Ray Parker Jr.\nSame sounds of proton packs, traps, Ecto-1.\n\nWhat can be better?.. NOTHING!\n10/10\n\n\nGraphics\nGame is almost 5 years old now, so it is hard to judge. When you are first time launching the game, picture looks ♥♥♥♥♥♥. But when you get used to it, you start to find artwork really beautiful.\nEspecially I like character design. You see Peter Venkman on the screen and you believe he is Bill Murray. Don't know, maybe it is more due to voice acting and classic dialogues, but even if game graphics doesn't make it feel better, then at least it doesn't make it worse.\nGraphical effects are primitive, but look nice. Same as in movie.\n\nGood artwork but lowres. Is this due to age or bad engine's optimization that lead to detail cuts?\n8/10. Bring HD textures and I'll give 10.\n\n\nGameplay\nWhy I put gameplay to the end? Because this game should be treated more as a movie rather than as a game. There are a lot of cut-scenes in the game. I would say even more: there are some cut-gameplay put inside a movie. Don't get me wrong - this is a good thing. First because those cut-scenes are interesting to watch, especially if you're Ghostbusters fan like I am. Seconds, the gameplay, which is put between those cut-scenes, is interesting too. It's not like in other game, where you need to spend 5 minutes of watching one cut-scene, then ten times press 'E', then watch another one, which you can't skip. Btw, you can skip cut-scenes in Ghostbusters, if you want to. But I didn't. Cuz they are cool ;)\n\nEnough about movies. Let's talk about gaming. This isn't an arcade action game. It is ghost hunting simulator. A dream of my childhood: you got a proton pack on your back, PK-meter and a ghost trap - go hunt your ghost, cadet! Wow, cool!... wait, how am I supposed to do it? It seemed like guys in the movie trapped ghost with ease. Why it is so hard for me? Because they are pros, but you are a noob! Shame of me, but I must admit that "modern gamefare" left impact on me too. "Shoot everything that moves. Press 'E' multiple times, if **** happens" - this doesn't work here.\n\nFirst, you have to find the ghost, using PK-meter. This is the easy part.\nSecond, you can scan the ghost, i.e. shoot the ghost with PK-meter. This can be ommited, but scanning gives you valuable information about the ghost, revealing its weaknesses and way to deal with it. Weak ghosts can be just killed, harder ones require trapping, but some requires extra steps like catching them and smashing to the ground.\nThird, the usual part - damage the ghost.\nAnd final and most tricky part - get the ghost into the trap. This is a pain in the *** for beginners. And the most fun part for experienced players. This part make this game unique. First time I though this is a simple as Ghostbusters were doing it in the movie: shoot the ghost with proton beam, put a trap, press a button... but ghost says "Screw You!" and flies away! It doesn't want to be trapped. So you have to catch it, smash it to the objects on the map (it feels kinda punching ghost to the face) and only then try to pull it towards to the trap while it is still dazed. After you have mastered this, it makes you feel like a real Ghostbuster!\n\nBut there are sad things too:\n1. 3rd person view. I agree that the Proton Pack looks cool and has all HUD elements player needs, but I'd really prefer to sacrifice it for a 1st person view. Or at least a button that changes views.\n2. No Ecto-1 driving mission. You can't drive Ecto-1, you can't even get inside and see its interior. Maybe I'm asking too much, but I was really expecting it.\n\n9/10","January 29, 2014","true","22.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Gameplay is for the most part good. Sprinting is very stiff for your character. Voices are good. The actors don't put as much into their vocal performances as they did their live action performances. Story seems pretty good.\n\nNow for the negative. The game is full of glitches and bugs. I'll only list two I encountered.  At one point Winston and I were to go into a building. Winston was supposed to kick the door open. He apparently just phased through the door. I had watch a video walkthrough to find out where he went. When I did find out where he went the door was closed and he was already through it. I had to reload checkpoint twice before the door finally opened for me to come through. When it did open and I got in there with him he got stuck on part of the environment twice forcing me to reload my save again and walk him through it slowly so he wouldn't get stuck.\n\nNow for the most damning glitch. Apparently a well known glitch. After 3.8 hours into with quite a lot of ghost captured and upgrades gained the game decided to wipe my save. I loaded up the game and it's telling me to restart from the beginning on the easiest difficulty. That won't be happening. The game has defeated me. I was liking this game. Lots of nice fanservice.

It exceeds in writing as Dan Akroyd and Harold Ramis actually wrote it, which is notable given the amount of dialog given explaining the science and technology. And Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson also reprise their roles alongside Ramis and Akroyd. This is the good Ghostbusters game you should be playing. Also, Akroyd considers it canon to the film franchise as this was initially meant to be the third film.\n\nIt's 1991, the plot in the game involves the Ghostbusters crew taking on a rookie/intern and start by showing him the ropes. Things go bad when the city experiences a shockwave sent from the history museum where an exhibit on Gozer is supposed to be opening up soon. Most of the exhibit's pieces were donated by the Shandor estate. If you recall anything from the first film, Shandor was an insane physician. Well, he's the primary villain in this game. You'll encounter ghosts seen from the films, new ghosts, and bizarre areas. I don't really wanna spoil anything. Oh, and Max von Sydow reprises his voice as Vigo. You can find the painting of him in the firehouse and interact with him as much as you'd like.\n\nThe graphics are decent. I mean, I'm playing it six years post release so it kind of goes to show how far technology has come that I'm just calling it decent. Then again, the first Crysis still looks amazing today and that was 2007. But that's also an unfair comparison as Terminal Reality isn't well known for being a graphics powerhouse and Ghostbusters was probably their last great game before they shut down in 2013. Anyway, the special effects with the power equipment and sound designs were great.\n\nPretty great game overall though.\n\n8.3/10","August 4, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has the original movies cast voice acting it and was written by Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd which basically means this is as close to a new ghostbusters movie that we'll get.  It's funny and the action is great you really are fighting ghosts trying to keep them from flying out of your beams grab and  trying to manuver them and hold them over the trap so that they are captured.  This mostly feels like I'm constantly large bass fishing and it makes for a fun and intense fight where you have control then suddenly the ghost tries to make a break for it and you just barely hang on.  Very fun ghost fights and very satisfying when you trap those big ghosts.  Did I mention that theres a full on Street battle facing down Stay Puff marshmallow Man?  Well there is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/recommended/9870/","CharlieLima79","CharlieLima79","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieLima79/","121 products in account","At the time of this review, the cast of 'Ghostbusters' reboot was recently announced. Given there is no chance of a 'Ghostbusters 3' starring the original cast (rest in peace, Mr. Ramis), playing this game felt like finding closure through interactive nostalgia.\n\nThe main selling point of 'Ghostbusters: The Video Game' is that it brought Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson back together as the Ghostbusters, with Annie Potts and William Atherton joining them as Janine Melnitz and Walter Peck respectively. Also, Aykroyd and Ramis co-wrote the game's story, making this as complete a 'Ghostbusters' experience as you can get right now. There were also plenty of cameos and references to other otherworldly creatures throughout the game. With you playing as a new (nameless and speechless) recruit of the Ghostbusters, the game would make you feel that you are part of their wonderful world.\n\nFor a game that came out back in 2009, 'Ghostbusters: The Video Game' still looks pretty great about 5 years later. The set pieces were beautifully designed and rendered, and the proton pack energy streams still look fanastic. Despite borrowing the basic game mechanics from 'Gears of War', the game felt very unique mainly due to the proton pack weapons. In fact, zapping, capturing and trapping ghosts using these weapons added an extra level of challenge and fun to what could have been otherwise a generic third-person shooter.\n\nYou can tell that the creators of 'Ghostbusters: The Video Game' had put a lot of thought and care into designing the game. They also made it quite challenging in some parts. There are 3 difficulty levels: Casual, Experienced, and Professional. I've found myself losing often in two or three of the boss fights playing at the Experienced level. While my mission failures were at times due to the Ghostbusters A.I., making my experience frustrating, I did feel compelled to keep going. Things did get easier once I purchased upgrades for my weapons.\n\nThe game, while great, is by no means without flaws. The biggest one is actually having Bill Murray coming back to play Peter Venkman. In the movies, he was energetic, sarcastic and at times obnoxious. In the game, Bill Murray's performance was very inconsistent -- sounding lethargic and disinterested in one spot, and very true-to-character in another. It was quite disappointing to say that Bill Murray's Peter Venkman added little to the key moments of the game. Thankfully, other original cast members gave it their all.\n\nSome reviews back in the 2009 gave the PC version of 'Ghostbusters: The Video Game' a mediocre score in part due to the lack of multiplayer mode. While a multiplayer mode would have been welcomed, I sincerely do not think the game should have been penalized so greatly because of its absence. 5 years later, 'Ghostbusters: The Video Game' still holds up well. I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy third-person shooters, but I think it is fans of the original films who will enjoy it most.","January 31, 2015","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You run around and reel in ghosts and shoot at generic spookies which would be kinda boring if you didn't do it in the whole 'Bustin getup with your sweet lil' proton pack and the other Gostbusters in tow. One of the best things about this game is that the voice acting is done, for the most part, by the original actors (Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, etc.)\nAll I'm saying is: if you like Ghostbusters, consider buying this game. If you don't like Ghostbusters, then why are you here, broh.\nOk let's look at the important stuff:\n\nPlot:\n\nOk so there's ghosts and things but the important part is that it's written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis\n\nGameplay:\n-An essential thing to note is that you, throughout the course of the game, unlock four different proton stream things, each serving a different purpose and each having a special attack or ability.\n-The enemies tend to either be destructible objects brought to life or just straight up ghosts. The ghosts tend to be the most difficult as they need to be captured.\n-You have access to a half life physics gun stream that is used to wrangle ghosts, solve puzzles, and move debris.\n\nGraphics:\n\n-Is good, looks good\n-the proton pack is filled with detail which is ♥♥♥♥ing great\n\nok now that that's out of the way let's talk about the pros and cons\n\nPros:\n-It's Ghostbusters\n-But not the new Ghostbusters\n-As in it's the original one with Bill Murray and that one guy whos last name is spelled weird\n-somewhat above average gameplay\n-excellent graphics that still hold up (for the most part)\n\nCons:\n-several of the boss fights feel underwhelming\n-occasional lag discharge\n\nMy final verdict is that this game is great, even though it's a movie game.\nI'll give it a neat ol' 8/10","June 1","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/9870/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","I loved playing this game, it was really great.  But a few things to keep in mind.\n\nThis is Ghostbusters, not a new idea or franchise.  The thrill of this game is getting to strap a proton pack on your back and hang out with Peter, Ray, Egon, and Winston.  If you aren't a fan of Ghostbusters, there's no point in playing this.\n\nThis is a single-player third-person adventure/shooter with AI teammates who assist you.\n\nThe good is that the story is written by Harold Ramis (RIP) and Dan Aykroyd, and feels very much like the movies did, especially the first movie.  Some people have called this the third movie.  It is more or less a direct follow-up to the original story, revisiting Gozer and Ivo Shandor, and why they were almost able to cause an apocalypse.  I felt a bit of excitement seeing they included the old, grainy Colombia logo just like in the movies, and the game menu resembles the DVD menu.  The bad part of this is while many characters returned, two were conspicuously absent.  Dana Barrett and Louis Tully are not in the game, but Louis is mentioned in passing at the end of the game.\n\nThe main tool of the game is the proton pack and trap.  And this they got completely right, using them looks and feels like the movies.  Like in Ghostbusters 2, the packs can also be equipped with slime, but unlike the pinkish mood slime, it is the traditional ectoplasm green.  Additional tools can be added to the proton pack as the game progresses.  The only letdowns are that you cannot drive Ecto-1, and that the PKE meter quickly gets annoying.\n\nThe gameplay itself is satisfying, but not great.  You aren't playing Half-Life 2, or anything in the ballpark of great games.  It is a mostly linear game, with somewhat repetitive enemies, and it overuses some tools (after awhile I start to wish I never heard of a slime tether!).  Some concepts, such as property damage claims, are not explained and typically irrelevant.  The game uses a checkpoint system and auto-healing, which some gamers have strong feelings about.  It isn't particularly challenging, either.  The game is also fairly short, only taking a few hours to play.\n\nThe enjoyment mostly comes from the storyline, acting, and a bit of wish fulfillment, because what kid in the 80's didn't want to strap on a proton pack and hunt down ghosts?  If you enjoyed the original movie, and you want to play an interactive story, this is an enjoyable game.  If you want a challenge, and you haven't seen the movies, look elsewhere.  Or go watch the movies, because they are f***ing awesome.","January 3, 2015","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It matches the likes of those really graphical games on the Xbox, even today. Sure, it lags a little on the PC and the PC only, but that's only during those extremly graphical moments in the game.\n\nFor game mechanics, the creators used the game engine to it's full potential, and then some. This allowed the game for some surprising scripted events, and when I say "surprising", I mean it in more ways than one. There are some very good jumpscares involving things from shelves falling over to a gruesome-looking ghost popping up in your face out of nowhere. I'll admit, this game made me jump at some points in the game, and even nervous. The equipment you gain access to is also very well done.\n\nSpeaking of which, this simulates being a Ghostbuster very well. The game-exclusive equipment fit the Ghostbusters universe perfectly. A few memorable ghosts make a return in this game, like Slimer, for example.\n\nFor voice acting, I am very surprised the creators were able to get the original actors to voice themselves. The voice acting never sounds out of place throughout the game.\n\nAnd finally, the story. There are easter eggs in-game that are references to both movies, so it feels like the game is a third movie. Including one part in-game when Egon mentions the "Ellis Island incident", a tip of the hat to when the Ghostbusters literally walked the Statue of Liberty to a museum that was guarded by a barrier of slime in the second movie.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10. There are flaws in-game, such as repetitive objectives, but a very good game overall. If you are a Ghostbusters fan, I highly recommend this game. And even if you aren't a fan, you should at least give the game a try.","November 24, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not happening because Bill Murray doesn't want anything to do with it, it's happening anyway, now Bill Murray has something to do with it after all, the scripts haven't been good enough for Reitman and Akroyd, etc. Harold Ramis' passing hasn't helped matters, but even that has been subject to a back-and-forth, with the original Ghostbusters supposedly planned as cameos in whatever form Ghostbusters 3 takes so they can pass the torch.\n\nGiven how long fans have waited, it's nice to see a game specifically set after Ghostbusters 2. The plot revisits several elements from the movies, but for the most part it takes their minor details to expand on instead of rehashing the major ones; we get to see more on the very first ghost the Ghostbusters hilariously failed to bust in the library before they even had their gear, and more on the history of the hotel Slimer was caught in. This is an effective way to provide something that the fans will care about, while still having an excuse to let the characters talk about background information so someone who hasn't seen the movies won't be confused about why these things are important. It thus avoids how the second movie is widely regarded to have failed, where it redid the original's story arc with different pronouns (Vigo being an obvious stand-in for Gozer, the Ghostbusters having to start from scratch, etc.) While Gozer, as a major plot point of one of the movies, is a rehash by virtue of the movie covering pretty much all there was to cover, it turns out to be a lead-in to expanding on yet another minor element as a resolution. Given that this is a classic franchise and most of the audience is likely to be made of fans anyway, being newcomer-friendly may be pointless, but it's still nice to see writing of a high enough quality that it actually puts in the effort to maintain continuity while still avoiding lockout. Special mention goes to Walter Peck; the original movie is one of the very few things that have ever made the unfriendly, opposing bureaucrat character interesting and amusing instead of so ridiculous that it’s painful to watch (moviegoers who have endured Transformers 2 know exactly how bad this character archetype is when the writers both throw it in because it’s expected to be there and let the subplot run on for way too long.) The game follows through, giving the character a reason for being in the plot beyond just being an opposing force the good guys must awkwardly circumvent. Even the silent protagonist has some effort put into it; the Rookie is given enough in the way of facial expressions and body language for him to have actual character instead of just being the usual, lazy, blank slate.\n\nThe game was obviously a labor of love. All the small details help to recreate the flavor that made the movies so memorable, from the absurd occult artifacts to Egon's blase reaction in the face of pulse-pounding terror to Janine being perfectly in-character. Long-time fans who know the supplementary material (particularly children of the '80s who grew up with "The Real Ghostbusters") will find plenty of nods to various parts of the franchise. Poor art direction could have easily ruined this, but everything is crafted to look like you would expect something from Ghostbusters to look.\n\nThe graphics are generally very good, even five years after the game's release. The game manages the rare trick of making it easy to believe you're looking at something that exists in the real world, helped by a small amount of stylization that helps to avoid an uncanny valley effect. The character models, especially, stand out. The occasional muddy texture is the only thing that smudges the game's looks andit’s also a bit jarring that the Doritos product placement is immune to the destruction physics.\n\nI will not knock the game for the product placement itself, however, because it’s unobtrusive. Doritos is a fairly ubiquitous brand and seeing the occasional vending machine or truck does not break suspension of disbelief. I’m of the opinion that product placement is fine so long as the placement is realistic instead of shoved into places it shouldn’t be; in theory it should give the developer more money to make the game better (assuming the publisher hasn’t pocketed it,) and I’d rather see a signpost for an actual product on a street in New York than a signpost for Derpritos Snacky Things. The latter just distracts me by making me think about how it’s a copyright-friendly fake. If there was a huge Doritos logo emblazoned on the proton packs, I would be far less forgiving.\n\nThe sound won’t win any awards for technical achievement, but it serves its purpose. While the actors are obviously older than their characters, they do a fine job reprising the roles. The proton packs sound like proton packs, at least when using the actual proton stream. The sound effects for the other firing modes fit with the flavor but aren’t particularly memorable.\n\nSpeaking of the alternate firing modes, the decision to have them at all was definitely for the best. As iconic as the proton packs are, having a single weapon for an entire game gets tiring fast. The alternate fire modes are all lore-friendly, both in looks and in explanation. The explanation in this case usually being scientific hilarity that reminds one of the famous “each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back” line. Not every enemy is a ghost that requires trapping, so the trapping mechanic does not get tiresome. The worst that could be said about the gameplay is that the friendly AI is poor; the other Ghostbusters deal reduced damage and you’ll probably make it through the entire game without seeing any of them actually finish pulling a ghost into a trap on their own. However, the friendly AI is perfect in the two areas it really counts: they will always keep fighting the enemy (often destroying the entities that don’t require trapping) and if you go down, the other Ghostbusters will, without fail, rush to your aid. They may not make it before they’re all taken down as well and it’s Game Over if they are, but it’s not for lack of trying. They won’t inexplicably wait and their pathfinding to you is fine. Since keeping them all on their feet increases the chance that one of them will last long enough during the run towards reviving you, there’s an actual incentive to keeping them up and it doesn’t feel like work. Their effectiveness is especially apparent against the bosses.\n\nThe actual controls make sense and are perfectly responsive. Unfortunately, the PC version has horrible mouse acceleration and there is no in-game option to turn it off. There are workarounds but it shouldn’t require digging through forums to find them. Worse, the mouse acceleration is so poorly implemented that even if you generally don’t mind it, you’ll probably mind it here. This is an extremely glaring oversight. The game does work fine with a 360 controller, so if you have one and you don’t want to fiddle with configuration fixes (or if you prefer using a controller in a game like this,) it’s still perfectly playable with zero effort, but again, this is not a proper solution. A proper solution would be a checkbox labeled “mouse acceleration” in the options screen.\n\nIn the end, this game is not only fun, it’s fun the same way the movies and shows are. The writing holds up throughout, and not just in dialog, with even the flavor text being worthwhile. Most importantly, it’s extremely loyal to the source material.\n\nThey should've just called it Ghostbusters 3.","March 18, 2014","true","27.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Ghostbusters: The Videogame is one of the rare exceptions. It lives up to the expectations of the fans of the old movies and animated TV-series. Better yet, it's more than just a functional tack-on and reliving of the movies. It offers its own new characters, environments and stories into the mix. Okay, so it's functionally a third person shooter with the Ghostbusters theme firmly attached on top, but is that really a bad thing? I can honestly not think of a better way to make a game about the ghostbusters and their escapades. It's as quirky and funny as the movies, and has as many encounters with a variety of ghosts as are featured throughout the animated series.\n\nIf you have any affection at all for the Ghostbusters license, even if it's just a tiny little bit, then go and buy this game now that it's finally back on Steam.","October 28, 2014","true","3.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I loved the humour of this supernatural comedy movie at the time, and like every kid back then I really got into the books, music and even the animated series.  However to this day there has not been that many games that successfully capture the feel of the movie, sure there been several attempts of a Ghostbusters video game, however all the ones I played from the early 1980s 8bit version to the recent games based on Real Ghostbusters always lacked something.  To me this game is definetly been created with love to the fans and it is what Ghostbusting should be about.  Its far from perfect though, and some of the level designs are annoying as are some of the graphic textures seem unfinnished in areas.  Saying that though, what this game gets right it does well.  The voice acting is fine and well delivered by the original movie cast, as are some of the music cues are taken directly from the movie.  In short if you loved the Ghostbusters movie, or followed the animated show then this is a must buy for you.

Just look around the firehouse for some of the extra details they threw in.\nIt has everything in it you love about the Ghostbuster world.\nWhat more can you ask for?

The constant chatter of your team either giving you hints, bickering, or just general smart ♥♥♥ comments are all voiced by the original cast, its just perfect. You have some damn fine grafx for the PC to boot. I had the xbox 360 version prior to this, and man o man the textures alone on the PC make this a must buy if your a fan. It looks amazing for a game that came out a few years ago.\nMy only gripe is that there is no multiplayer like the consoles had...WHY? makes no sense not to add it.\nIf your a fan of the movies, a member of T.A.P.S.,like capturing ghost and not being stuck in a mansion with a little green jumpsuit.

The character you play as is a standard mute hero with almost no discernable personality. He constantly gets shoved off to the side or the background during cutscenes. It's almost funny, and would be if you weren't the one playing him. I just felt bad for him after a while.\n\nSince your character you play as gets shafted like this, it starts making one wonder why they didn't just do away with a trainee character, and let you play as your choice of one of the four original Ghostbusters.\n\nThe story was downright fantastic, it followed the events of the second and first movies phenominally. Some of the story-driving bosses may have been a tad too 'demonic' for something out of Ghostbusters, but they still would somehow maintain a Ghostbusters-esque personality. Most other ghosts were creative enough that I'd have expected to see them in the Ghostbusters universe. Most of the swarming type ghosts were not very inspired, and in another instance a blue, and a white ghost that were introduced looked like something that got ripped off from Luigi's Mansion. Despite the swarmers and the other afformentioned ghosts, there were more than enough creative ghosts to overshadow the mediocre or downright stupid ones. Usually the more creative of the ghosts were even just using the swarmers as an attack.\n\nThe gameplay reminded me a little bit of Bioshock mixed with some other FPS like Killzone, except you play in the third-person. Unlike the story, the gameplay was NOT very inspired, but it was not terrible. The gameplay was generic at its worst, elements were taken from other more popular games.

The script is great. My wrath comes down primarily on Atari.\n\nThis game has a disgusting memory leak. I've been playing first and third person shooters for years, and have a lot of control with them, on a pretty good gaming PC with specialized hardware that could not exist at the time that Ghostbusters was made. All the same, I cannot play it above Casual/Cinematic, because of the awful slowdowns. A memory leak is a serious problem, and it was holistically ignored by Atari QA, even to this day.\n\nArt is amazing, script is wonderful, and outside of a glitch with cutscenes the sound is synchronized. The programming leads to slowdowns that quickly make the game unplayable. I believe I have gotten around most of them by exiting to the menu; then reloading your game and continuing. However, save points are automatic and without notification, and doing this causes you to jump back to the last checkpoint. They are sporadic at best.\n\nIf you can get it for three bucks, it might be worth it. I would not pay anything more for the game.","November 3, 2014","false","8.1"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","22","45","3","1"

Forget it.\n\nThis game has the worst reverse mouse acceleration I've ever used in a game, and was the sole reason I originally bought an XBox pad for my PC.\n\nThis game's campaign is playable with a pad, but if you don't like using one, pass this one up.\n\nMoving the mouse slowly causes no movement to register in-game at all.\n\nWhat the slimy green ****, Atari?\n\nI have scoured forums for hours looking for a fix for the controls so I can use the mouse and keyboard properly, but there is literally nothing. The acceleration is coded in to the engine itself, and the algorithm that translates your mouse movements to in-game action are NOT bypassable, no matter what you try.\n\nI've only had a few bugs, and only one of them was game-breaking, forcing a restart of the entire chapter, but it only seems to be happening to a few of us.\n\nThis game runs perfectly on my Windows 10 system besides the issue with the controls, although if you wish to run it in a window, you're going to need DXWind or WinExp to force it in to one, although the game becomes very unstable, so keep that in mind if you plan to stream it.\n\nIf you can find this game for sale online somewhere cheap, get it. If you love the Ghostbusters, and don't mind using a gamepad to play a 3rd person game, you're going to have a blast. I wouldn't be able to comfortably say that this game is even worth £6.99 in the state it's in.","April 27","false","14.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Walking in front of the Ecto-1's headlamps does not illuminate your character or cast your shadow)\n\nSound: Awesome, from the voice actors to the sound effects.\n\nGame length: Somewhat short, finished it in about 6 hours including hunting for collectibles and cleaning all the black slime.\n\nReplay value: Very little, there are a few collectibles to gather and a weapon upgrade progression.\n\nPerformance: Decent, good stable framerates and no CTD bugs, only downside would be the horrible loeading times.\n\nAll in all it was enjoyable game, hearing all the familiar sounds and voices had me running down memory lane, Iwas even moving my head about while the theme music played from time to time.\n\nPick it up if you are a Ghostbusters fan and wish to star in your own Ghostbusters movie, otherwise give this game a pass.","July 15, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Plenty of Ghostbuster throwbacks, but these extend almost to the point of annoyance.\n\nThe story is pretty neat and, as it turns out, was more along the lines of an original draft for the first Ghostbusters movie.  This script was scrapped for being too alien for audiences to connect with, and instead the movies were based very strongly in New York with far less fantastical elements.\n\nI mean, hey, I felt like a ghostbuster in this game and that's pretty solid.

It is also completely missing the multiplayer mode that the original console versions had. Apart from these cons the game is every bit as good as I remembered. The original cast are all there with the exception of Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver as their characters do not appear in the game. The game was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis so it has some real funny dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay itself is excellent. Ghostbusting is challenging but rewarding and the trapping mechanic is fun. There's an upgrade system for the proton pack that has a real impact on gameplay. You also have Tobin's Spirit Guide for reading about all the different spooks for tips about their weaknesses etc. The graphics hold up surprisingly well. The game looks really good at 1080p. There are some rough textures here and there but nothing major. The sound is also excellent. The sound effects from the proton pack are great as well as the ambient sounds. Music is awesome.\n\n\n\nAll in all it's a great game with a few flaws. Highly recommended for fans of Ghostbusters.","October 31, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a unique combat system, taking full advantage of the source material it stayed true to in order to create an interesting dynamic in combat, while not being overly difficcult or extremely easy. And to top it all off, it comes with many memorable characters from the movies, and really tells an interesting story.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStory:\nThe story, as stated by many, feels like the third movie that every one wanted but never got. It takes you to many inconic locations, and faces you against iconic foes all over again.\n\nYou play as a new rookie Ghostbuster, who just so happens to be the new test subject for all the new equipement that could possibly blow you to New Jersey...\n------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay:\nThe shooting mechanics consist of many steams and modes. You have red, blue, green, and yellow steams, as well as the regular shooting mode and the rangling mode to capture.\n\nRed is the standard, and what you start off with. It does decent damage and has good accuracy over any distance, so it feels balanced.\n\nBlue does a lot more damage, but is really only short range. So I recommend it for crowd control and other close range combat circumstances.\n\nGreen is the slime blower, and is required for getting rid of black slime on environment as well as on monsters.\n\nYellow works as a low damage homing shot. So it's useful for finding enemies you've lost in large areas, as well as being practically required for a certain late game boss fight.\n\nThe regular shooting stream mode allows you to do damage to a ghost's PKE (health).\n\nThe capture stream is required for capturing ghosts by throwing them into the traps you place down.\n------------------------------------------------------\nGraphics:\nThe game looks good, even today. However the CGI cutscenes paired with the much less acurate models and animation of the regular engine clash a bit.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall a very good game that I highly recommend!","June 23, 2014","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do you experience dread in your basement or attic? Have you or your family ever seen a spook, specter, or ghost? If the answer is yes, then don't wait another minute. Navigate to the store page and purchase the professionals: Ghostbusters.\n\nAlright, maybe I like Ghostbusters a little too much. But god dammit, how couldn't I? Ghostbusters is one of the greatest movies of the 80's, and it's sequel, Ghostbusters II (1989) is a solid sequel (despite what everybody thinks). And if you're like me and have always wanted a Ghostbusters III, Ghostbusters: The Video Game is as close as you're gonna get. It has everything that made Ghostbusters great. Nearly every cast member came back to voice their characters in the game, including Dan Akroyd, Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, the late Harold Ramis, Annie Potts, Brian Doyle-Murray, and even William Atherton, who played Walter Peck in the original film! The game is written by Akroyd and Ramis, who wrote the original films, and who also later went on record to say that Ghostbusters: The Video Game, serves as the "essentially" third entry in the franchise. But before I get lost in praising this game, let's get down to the nitty-gritty.\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game is a 2009 action-adventure game developed by Terminal Reality, the team behind the BloodRayne series, The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct, and Kinect Star Wars (one of the greatest Microsoft Kinect titles to date, no doubt). The game follows the player's character as a new recruit in the Ghostbusters and features various elements of typical third-person shooters. However, instead of using a traditional gun, players are equipped with a "Proton Pack", a laser beam-like weapon, and a ghost trap to fight and capture ghosts.The game's plot is set two years after Ghostbusters II, around Thanksgiving in 1991, with the Ghostbusters team training the player's character while investigating paranormal activities in New York City.\n\nOver the course of the game, the player will utilize a variety of ghostbusting tools (such as the PKE Meter and Goggles) in order to track down specters and capture them. As the game progresses, you are awarded with a variety of different proton streams in order to capture ghosts more efficiently, such as the slime thrower or messon collider. Furthermore, revenue earned from busts can be used to upgrade these tools in various ways. In place of a traditional heads-up display, the player's health and weapon status are represented as meters on the rear of the Proton Pack. Health regenerates over time if the player does not take further damage. However, by taking more damage, they can be knocked down; if there are other Ghostbusters still standing, they will attempt to reach the player and revive him/her. Similarly, the player can help revive fallen team members. The lack of a heads-up display presents a more immersive experience for the player in the Ghostbusters universe. A large variety of levels also serves to present the player with a more complete world, as the player will have to travel to various locations including Times Square, the Sedgewick Hotel, the New York Public Library, and of course, the Firehouse, in order to bust ghosts and complete the campaign. Unfortunately, the PC version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game does not have the multiplayer aspect that was offered on the console versions of the game, but as of this writing, the servers for online play on all platforms has been shut down, so you won't be missing anything by purchasing the title on Steam.\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game serves as a love letter to fans of the franchise. If you're like me, and you love Ghostbusters, then you'll find yourself nothing short of absolutely pleased with this game.\n\nA 10 out of 10 (would bust again).","May 5, 2014","true","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls are slippery and sometimes frustrating, and the game rehashes some of the movie scenes. But if you loved the movies, then you'll enjoy the game for what it is. The third movie that never quite made it to the big screen.\nSome of the most enjoyable part of the game is exploring the firehouse headquarters with all the little interactive items.\nThe action really feels like you're wrestling these ghosts with your equpiment, and if you watched the movies you can feel some of the exertion the ghostbusters show on their faces in the movies.\nAnd.

I haven't played many Ghostbusters games in my lifetime (actually the only other one I've played was the first Ghostbusters game on SEGA Master) but I'm a huge fan of the movies and this game delivers VERY WELL. Everything a fan could want is in this game. You get to bust ghosts, work with the original Ghostbusters team, and get a little nostalgia here and there as homage is paid to the two films. While it's a fantastic game though, I feel it could have been much bigger and much grander. Maybe they'll make another Ghostbusters game in the future and if they did I would like the chance to drive the Ecto 1, perhaps in a Grand Theft Auto/L.A.

I just bought it on sale here on Steam so I could play it in high resolution with mouse and keyboard controls and while the port has some rough edges to it I still love the game. There are some frame rate issues in one or two places, the game seems to forget some of the upgrades you purchase between gaming sessions and the mouse acceleration is beyond horrible. It is also completely missing the multiplayer mode that the original console versions had. Apart from these cons the game is every bit as good as I remembered. The original cast are all there with the exception of Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver as their characters do not appear in the game. The game was written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis so it has some real funny dialogue.\n\nThe gameplay itself is excellent. Ghostbusting is challenging but rewarding and the trapping mechanic is fun. There's an upgrade system for the proton pack that has a real impact on gameplay. You also have Tobin's Spirit Guide for reading about all the different spooks for tips about their weaknesses etc. The graphics hold up surprisingly well. The game looks really good at 1080p. There are some rough textures here and there but nothing major. The sound is also excellent. The sound effects from the proton pack are great as well as the ambient sounds. Music is awesome.\n\n\n\nAll in all it's a great game with a few flaws.

And to top it all off, it comes with many memorable characters from the movies, and really tells an interesting story.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStory:\nThe story, as stated by many, feels like the third movie that every one wanted but never got. It takes you to many inconic locations, and faces you against iconic foes all over again.\n\nYou play as a new rookie Ghostbuster, who just so happens to be the new test subject for all the new equipement that could possibly blow you to New Jersey...\n------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay:\nThe shooting mechanics consist of many steams and modes. You have red, blue, green, and yellow steams, as well as the regular shooting mode and the rangling mode to capture.\n\nRed is the standard, and what you start off with. It does decent damage and has good accuracy over any distance, so it feels balanced.\n\nBlue does a lot more damage, but is really only short range. So I recommend it for crowd control and other close range combat circumstances.\n\nGreen is the slime blower, and is required for getting rid of black slime on environment as well as on monsters.\n\nYellow works as a low damage homing shot. So it's useful for finding enemies you've lost in large areas, as well as being practically required for a certain late game boss fight.\n\nThe regular shooting stream mode allows you to do damage to a ghost's PKE (health).\n\nThe capture stream is required for capturing ghosts by throwing them into the traps you place down.\n------------------------------------------------------\nGraphics:\nThe game looks good, even today. However the CGI cutscenes paired with the much less acurate models and animation of the regular engine clash a bit.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall a very good game that I highly recommend!","June 23, 2014","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't Get me wrong this isn't some perfect game, its just so suprising that this was a positive moive to videogame translation which has had terrible results in the past. Part of what makes this such a success where other moive based game tie ins have failed is the cast is all there. Dan Akroid, Bill Murry, Harold Ramis, and Erine Hudson voiced their respective roles. Not only did the cast pull ogether to voice the characters Dan Akroid, and Harold Ramis wrote the story themselves. I knew I was in for a classic ghostbusters expirience, truly the thrid installment of the series.\n\nAs for the gameplay its a third person shooter, with some intresting twists. For example wrangling, after weaking the ghost you put it in a capture beam and throw it around the room until you can trap it. There are upgrades purchaseable through your PKE and new weapons like the slimer or stasis stream. The story is pretty straight forward, its Ghostbusters, its a fun light-hearted expirience that is told through multipule cut-scences and banter amongst the voiced characters.\n\nAll in all it is so unbelieveably good compared to its NES counterpart, and it has aged fairly well (given todays standards). I reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of Ghostbusters or is looking for a more unique take on thrid person shooters.","June 15, 2015","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The atmosphere in some levels is genuinly creepy and in other it's just really cool (Such as that  other dimension ).\nThe game even has the original actors voicing their in-game counterparts, which is cool. It also brings back one of the best villians in all of movies (No, not godzilla) The stay puft marshmellow man.\n\nThe game itself is really fun to play. Throughout the story you gain new upgrades to your proton pack which help you to solve many a puzzle. The story itself however isn't extremely easy to follow but is loosely based on the original story for the first ghostbusters. This game is the closest we will ever get to a proper third installment in the franchise.","August 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I put the game away and picked it up yesterday (2 months later) and wow i was surprised how fun it is. After beating the minions i started to get the hang of it and made it all the way to the last part in one night.\n\nthe voice acting is top knotch, the plot is actually really well written, and trapping ghosts is a lot of fun.\nive seen people complaining in review how its too hard to trap multiple ghost, but that is what makes it fun, it ramps up the challenge. fighting enemies and un possesing your friends, while at the same time trying to trap multiple ghost was really fun.\n\ni think little details go a long way as well, like when you switch to slime, a vile of slime appears out of your pack, same with electricity.\n\nthe one frustrating thing is keeping your team mates alive, since they dont move out of the line of fire, and will stand there getting hit til they are daed.\n\nbut all in all a great game, if you are a fan of ghostbusters get it now, if  you liked ghostbusters as a kid, but dont really care (like me) then its still a great game, try to get it on sale","March 24, 2015","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Catching the first ghost was awesome experience, but after that, the game feeds you ghosts in groups, and it is surprisingly frustrating. Weakening and catching a ghost needs time and concentration, and you don't have either when other ghosts or possessed companions are attacking you.\n\n-Companion AI is below average. They are either blocking your way to shoot monsters / ghosts, or they have been knocked down and you need to go help them up, which eats away further more of the time that you would rather need to weaken ghosts.\n\n-Unnecessary upgrades to proton pack. Rather than giving tactical options to gameplay, proton pack upgrades just makes ghost fighting even more annoying when you need to switch back and forth between them on some occasions.\n\n-Gameplay leans heavily on the mediocre ghost fighting. PK meter has been added, but rather than giving any depth or atmosphere to the game, PK meter is mostly just a tool to trigger obvious plot points. I.e. something on the door prevents us from going though. Scan the door, problem gets solved, continue to the next ghost fight.\n\n\n\nTL;DR -Ghostbusters is a mediocre game with flaws that only a fan of the original franchise can forgive.\n","December 22, 2014","false","10.1"," 32 of 67 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","32","67","0","0"

After Years and years of languishing in development hell in Hollywood due to a mixture of budget issues and cast unavailability it seemed that the film would never be made and we would never get one more outing with the guys who came, saw and kicked ♥♥♥.\n\nThis game is quite literally the 3rd ghostbusters script only with certain physical script directions moved off the original cast and onto you: The Rookie.\n\nIs this a good story? Oh my good god yes. This is an almost perfect recapturing of the original vibe of the ghostbusters films and with good reason Written by the late great Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd it simply oozes that late 80’s early 90’s feel that the first two ghostbusters films so readily projected. This. And only this. Is the reason you should pick this game up. Get it in the sale, set the difficulty to easy and just enjoy the cut scenes (All of which are voiced by the original cast I might add) if you’ve ever wanted a 3rd ghostbusters film. This game is right up your street. Better yet, go to youtube where im almost certain that someone has supercut all the important gameplay moments and cut scenes together into one coherent film.\n\nWhy suggest going to look it up online? Or worse still to just play the game through on easy to get the great great film that plays in between? Because the game elements of this video game are border sadistic. It was at some point in the third act when I fell into the basement of a castle and had to spend the best part of an hour wandering around aimlessly till I  found Ernie Hudson that I realised; I just played a section of gameplay that would be written out of a film. And that’s the 2nd biggest problem with this as a game. You only really play cool ghostbustery moments about 30% of the time, the rest of the time your wandering about down corridors…in a film you’d cut away to help keep pacing up but in this game its almost like it actively encourages these boring, long and utterly nerve destroying moments…\n\nAdd to this that at random points in the game it likes to utterly bombard you with ghosts for no real reason other than to insta-kill you and that the AI is really not very well programmed to deal with these situations (A key issue because the AI in this game are essential to you not getting a game over) and you have a real problem game ultimately…controls feel lax almost like your directing someone else with the controller on how to play…and overall I just found the game elements here were off putting to a story I really wanted to follow…\n\nGraphically it stands up about as well as a game from 2009 can stand up these days though there is a noticeable dip in quality between cinematic cut scenes and in game cut scenes.\n\nShould you watch this game? If you’re a fan of the ghostbusters it’s almost your duty to. A wonderfully crafted and well written and acted piece that almost certainly leaves a good taste in the mouth.\n\nShould you play this game? Not unless your immune to utter pain inside…Don’t get this at full price…sale price pick it up…if nothing else for a small price you’ll get a really quite wonderful film and a near perfect “Original Trilogy” from the original creators themselves.","November 3, 2015","false","5.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I would like to say thank you to harold rammis for providing me and many others with so much humor. without harold i wouldn't have the same sense of humor i have today, and i wouldn't be the same in general. I love all the work he wrote, directed and acted in like caddyshack, groundhogs day, stripes, and so many other great works of comedy.

The game is a linear 10 hour romp through the Ghostbusters' universe that has you facing down new and old foes alike. It is total fan service and the quality is here. With Ramis gone this is as close as you will get to a 3rd outing featuring the original cast. I enjoyed playing alongside the famous four as a rookie rather than taking control of one of the known Busters, it allows you to sit back and enjoy their antics and it really makes you feel like part of the gang and that is exactly what all of us fans dream about! Each Buster gets equal screen time and you get some one on one time with each of them at different points throughout the game. This game was a total joy.\n\nGamer score = 7/10\nGhostbusters fan score = 9/10\n\nPROS\n\n+ Ghostbusters galore. The music, sound effects, likeness of the characters, voices, writers (Aykroid and Ramis), story, it's all here folks and it's all genuine. Really, as a Ghostbusters fan, this is all you should need to know.\n+ Graphics and locations. I can't believe they pulled off making us face down entities from the first movie without having it come off as cheap and gimmicky but it works here. The graphics are great but could use some tweaking to create a creepy atmosphere (it's too bright and washed out right out of the box).\n+ You can replay any mission at any time to pick up any hidden items you may have missed,\n+ Unlockable concept art for all the stages.\n+ They take the franchise into new and interesting places. I'm a sucker for the tech and the proton packs in this game are way cooler than the originals. The PKE meter is implimented well and is fun to use as it gives you insight into the target scanned including its weaknesses. Wrangling and trapping ghosts is a blast. Cool new tools like "slime tethers" that let you attach a contracting string of slime to two points in order to move stuff.\n+ The game is cinematic and FUN. You really feel like you are hunting ghosts and it can get quite creepy at times though I feel like they missed a lot of opportunities to make it scary due to the lightheartedness of it all.\n\nCONS\n\n- The game is linear, straight as an arrow. There are a ton of doors you can't open and many you have to wait for your AI partner to open. No mission selection, no side missions, nada. Playing this game has me dreaming of a huge open world New York, a big Skyrim or GTA in the Ghostbusters universe.\n- Mouse control is a little sloppy but you get used to it. Controls in general are a bit chunky and your path is impeded by any and all obstancles. You won't see your character hoping over benches or stepping over rubble. I blame the proton packs.\n- Save feature is clunky. You must rely on autosaves and if you clock out after beating a stage (you end up back at the base after each mission) you will have started the next mission when you log in the next time. This means you will miss out on a little cutscene or two if you exit the game before viewing them after completing a mission.\n- The upgrade and progression system seems tacked on and arbitrary, You get money for capturing or defeating ghosts and you use that money to upgrade the strength and resource costs of your 4 different beams, traps, and PKE meter. You will have zero problems maxing everything out before the final mission and there is little if any visual indication that anything is stronger or better. You can't expect much in a pure shooter like this but the upgrade menu is nothing more than something you should remember to click on to make the game easier.\n- Little variety in the stages. The settings are versatile and you will fight through the streets of downtown New York, up a skyscraper, through the public library, a museum, the sewers, a forgotten castle, alternate universes, a cemetary and more but you are doing the exact same thing throughout the entire game. You will never drive the Ecto-1, solve (involved) puzzles, do research, interview clients or witnesses, talk (at all), or really have any freedom at all. This is a pure, by the books, 3rd person shooter.","November 1, 2014","true","11.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

GB:TVG is ok, I guess, but there's not enough here to justify how long it is.\n\nThere are a handful of nice setpieces and the ghost designs are as imaginative as ever, it's just a shame that the story is such a cynically bland piece of fan service, the friendly AI is comparable to a litter of inbred puppies and the gameplay lacks any genuine excitement or variety, beyond switching between a few different settings on your proton pack. I'd consider myself to be a pretty big Ghostbusters fan, and even I struggled to stay motivated enough to beat the game.\n\nIf you've ever really, really badly wanted to Gary Stu yourself into the Ghostbusters universe, then this one's for you. Be sure to wait until it's on sale, though.","September 7, 2015","false","8.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's got a good story, voice acting, and graphics.  From what I was able to play, it seems fun.\n\nThe problem is that it is plagued by a serious case of consolitis.  It was obviously made for a controller pad.  Mouse controls are so horrible, there are places you can't even turn around.  You keep getting stuck staring at the wall, ceiling, or floor, while you frustratingly try to control your character. Moving the mouse over and over again in different directions while tapping the WASD keys eventually get the mouse moving correctly again, but by that you have lost the ghost.  I've heard (but have not tried it myself) that it works fine with a 360 Controller.\n\nBottomline is that this may have been a fun adventure game with action elements but was ruined by a sloppy port to PC.  :P","October 4, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

However it is quite a buggy game. I can't really give it a thumbs up because of the "Access Violation" message I get every second time I try to launch the game. Someone posted on the forums that this happens when USB devices are plugged in and this is true, but I hate having to disconnect all my USB devices just to get this game to work. As for the game, it is great for fans of the movie, it has Slimer, Stay Puff and the feel of all the movie locations down pat, with a kind of Half Life kind feel and some interesting gameplay ideas. Though the dialogue somehow manages to be even cheesier than the original. And the gamplay quickly degenerates into tedium with repetitive shooter elements and walking around for ages with the PKE meter. Juggling things gets really annoying, especially when you get attacked while you're using the meter or in the middle of trapping a ghost and some completely pointless annoying paranormal thing starts biting at your heels. I don't think its well optimised either. I've got decent hardware that runs the latest games but there are times when the framerate seems to really chug.","April 6","false","1.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Had to stop after another hour.\n\nMaybe if you rush through it on easy to see the story because you are a ghostbusters fan, it could be ok.\nFor me, the Ghostbusters franchise is only mildly interesting. I liked the movies but I don´t have any urge for more of the same, which this is, at least at the beginning.\n\nWhat frustrated me to the point of stopping was the main mechanic:\nKeeping your crosshair on ghosts flying around until they are weak enough to drag them to the trap and constantly reviving fellow busters is the main mechanic. It's not very interesting, but what made me walk away was how lenghty these are. The other part, walking around with the sensor, is even less intersting.

Venkman in the movie is an a-hole but a likeable a-hole. The game version he's just an unpleasant, yucky creep. I didn't think it was possible for Bill Murray to play a character so unlikable. To top it off, Murray phones it in. It's like he was forced to record it in between something he enjoyed doing more, like cutting out coupons.\n\nIt's not a terrible game. It's certainly better than any other Ghostbusters game that came before it. It can get frustrating and repetative. I wanted to like it. I don't.\n\nPros: It's an okay Ghostbusters game.

Mouse acceleration is horrible, as it was meant to be played with a controller.  There are some fixes out there that sort of normalize it but it's still pretty noticeable.  The only real working "fix" is to get a 360 controller and play as the game was intended.  They literally did not program code for mouse in the game, it's emulating a 360 controller, same as those crappy mouse / keyboard conversion kits for shooters on console that only halfway work.\n\n2. No Multiplayer.  What the hell, seriously?  Sure, it has a goofy arcade feel, but the teamwork MP is actually pretty fun in this game.\n\n3. No Achievements.  How lazy can you get?\n\nI also owned this on PS3 and the graphics were a lot worse than on 360, because the game was made straight up for 360 originally.  The coders couldn't get the PS3 port to utilize all the textures and particle effects correctly without slowing down the machine so they just dumbed it down to get it to work.  There were a lot of gamer sites pointing out how awful it looks on PS3 when the game launched, extremely disappointed.  360 game is for 360.\n\nSad thing is I DO recommend this game, just not on PC or PS3.  It's best played on 360 /vomit.  Don't waste your money on this broken port because it's basically an afterthought, same as someone putting their middle finger in your a-hole while you're giving them head and acting like you're lucky to get that much attention.  SInce when have mediocre consoles become the priority in coding a game?\n\nThe publisher should be ashamed.","November 3, 2014","false","1.1"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","0"

The controls are sluggish and non intuitive and the bosses' difficulty seem oddly out of order. For example, Azetlor the Collector, the second real boss of the game, is the hardest boss. Speaking of boss levels, the boss design is thoroughly unimaginitive. Expose 1 weakness, hit weakness while evading.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imdur/recommended/9870/","Imdur","Imdur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imdur/","1030 products in account","Ghostbusters: The Videogame - I remember reading the reviews and they said how it was good, but not great. I kinda get that. But, overall, I really enjoyed it. It's a nice little story written by original writers, Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, and it could've easily been the follow-up film.\n\nFirst up, let's get the downers out of the way... The pc port is a lil' bit iffy. I had issues with the framerate dropping from 60fps to 26fps, a lot. This, on an AMD 290! Not just that, either. A few times, I loaded up my savegame, but the game would sit on "loading..." constantly. This happened randomly, but sometimes I'd have to verify the files in order to straighten things out. Doing this allowed things to work again.\n\nNow, the good. The game is fun to play! The first time you get your proton pack and start shooting up the scenery, it's a great feeling. Bagging your first ghost looks like it's right out of the films. I never tired of capturing ghosts in a trap! They got it so right :)\nThe music is pretty much the original films' soundtrack, tacked onto the game scenes/cutscenes. It's a mixed bag as it doesn't always match the action. Shame. But, because it's the original music, it does bring a level of quality that, at times, does mix in well.\n\nAnd the best part, we get the original cast back for a semi-sequel (sort of). And in light of Harold Ramis' death just last year, it's all the more poignant. I just want to touch upon the difficulty level for a moment. Again, I remember hearing folk say that it's a hard game, even on normal - to the point of it being annoying to play. Well, I disagree. I played on normal and the challenge was pretty good. Still, it wasn't too challenging and I managed to finish it in around 7 and a half hours. Maybe the best tip to keep the game going is, always help pick up your fallen comrades!\n\nOverall, it's a nice return to the Ghostbusters franchise. Even if it was a videogame :P Thumbs up!","January 19, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Picking up in 1991 after the events of Ghostbusters 2, the plot centers once again on the cult of Gozer and their shennanigans. Without spoiling too much, you'll learn a lot more about Ivo Shandor, the architect who built the original temple from the first movie, and ties the plots of the first 2 movies together while telling it's own tale.\nIt's well-executed, with the original cast & writers at the lead. And it has the same sense of comedy & charm as the movies have.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a 3rd-person shooter, with the main gimmick of having to trap a lot of ghosts instead of just blowing them up. (There are a number that need to be dispersed, aka. blown up as well for good measure). This means using the capture beams and dragging them into traps. It makes the game unique, and makes if feel like Ghostbusters. It also adds another level of franticness to the combat.\nAlong the way you'll find different weapon upgrades to use, you'll hunt for artifacts to collect, and you'll earn money to improve the gear you have. Throw in a few bosses that are fun to watch, if not particularly inspired in their mechanics, and you've got a solid game to go with a solid script.\nThere's no cover mechanics or the like, but I didn't really miss that.\n\nIt's not perfect, and the game can get frustrating if you're facing large hordes of opponents, but it's enjoyable enough. On the whole, Ghostbusters fans should NOT be giving this a miss. And neither should people who like third-person shooters with a twist.","November 2, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player takes the role of a new rookie in the Ghostbusters team. He or she (well, the guy in the game is a he) will fight ghosts alongside with Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spengler (the late Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson).\n\nThe controls aren't the worst, but they are far from fluent. It feels bulky in the action scenes. Especially running, dashing and evading during the combat is really really stiffy stuff. Luckily, catching and fighting ghosts with the updated version of the Proton Pack isn't as hard.\n\nGraphics and sound effects are nice. The Ghostbuster's gadgets look and sound as they should.\n\nThe story is written by Aykroyd and Ramis. The script's funny, interesting and original. It really does feel like a Ghostbusters story! The performance of the original film cast as voice actors is heart-warmingly great. It's a shame that Sigourney Weaver and Rick Moranis don't reprise their roles, though. The music is from the original 1984 movie and adds a nice touch.\n\nGhostbusters: The Video Game is a fun and decent game and it's a better Ghostbuster story than the third movie will ever be. It has its flaws, but it looks, sounds and most importantly feels like the Ghostbusters and that's enough for me!","October 31, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thought it would be great fun, especially when it was on sale. A typical adaptation from a movie franchise to a video game that fails to capture the feel and atmosphere of the original Ghostbusters movies. This game is rather boring and uninspired. The only good thing about the game is the main theme song! Here you play as an unnamed rookie (as every poor movie-to-videogame adaptation) in the Ghostbuster team, where you follow the title characters in the game to catch ghosts, with boring dialogues, jokes that aren't funny at all. As others had said the controls sucks and not intuitive at all, especially with keyboard+mice control, the Xbox360 controller doesn't make the game more playable and/or enjoyable. Graphically, I think it still looks okay, but the characters move quite cumbersome in the game, it doesn't matter what control you are using for the game.\n\nThe game could have been better with tactical game mechanics, perhaps similar to the Rainbow Six franchise with team based gameplay while keeping the Ghostbusters movie's fun and jokes; each team member has its unique ability to compromise other team members's weaknesses and strengths etc. The game in its current form is just too boring and the gameplay is really nothing special at all, not saying it's easy to beat the game (especially with that awful mouse accelaration that can't be disabled in the game menu). Furthermore the PC version lacks multiplayer mode!\n\nSo use your money wisely and buy an other game instead. This Ghostbusters videogame just lacks in gameplay/-gamemechanics, control, writing/story. If you want a good ghosthunting game, and if you have a Nintendo 3DS, go buy Luigi's Mansion 2 instead. Or go for the first Luigi's Mansion game for the really old Nintendo Gamecube console (a second hand Gamecube is really cheap now) for dirt cheap. As for a recommendation for the PC platform, try out Ghost Master which is also available on Steam here, though it plays differently than this Ghostbuster video game, but it's way more fun to play: just for less than 1 euro during Christmas sale!","December 27, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game isn't the best port to the PC and lacks the Multiplayer feature that the console versions have; but if you love the movies and want to feel like your watching them all over again, buy this game. The characters are hilarious as ever, the storyline is fun and it's a great game all the way through, giving you that nostalgic feeling of not crossing the streeeeeams! The singleplayer is short and relatively easy but don't let that put you off, this game might be something weird, but in the end, you just wanna call the ghostbusters ;)\n\n... okay I'll try not to make jokes like that again.","November 19, 2010","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is nothing to behold and the dialogue is awful. For the most part they just recycle stuff they've already used in the previous movies and use them as a constant reference. Which is okay. It isn't as annoying as it sounds. But there's not much going for this game beyond the gameplay itself. Even the original Ghostbusters cast is lacking a bit and even though it was written by Herold Ramis it still falls short in plot and comedic value. It's funny how incredibly bored Bill Murray sounds in all his dialogue. He sounds so bored and it makes me bored. But the game itself was entertaining. Catching ghosts and junk turned out to be pretty fun for the most part. Even the controls felt on the PC version. If you find this game on steam for $10 or less then I highly recommend you pick it up even if you're not the biggest Ghostbusters fan out there.\n\nFinal Verdict 3.6 out of 5","February 21, 2011","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeybslash3/recommended/9870/","joeybslash3","JoeyBslash3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeybslash3/","304 products in account","First, I must say that I am a fan of Ghostbusters. The video game is a must for any fan who would enjoy throwing on a proton pack and catching some ghosts while haphazardly destroying the environment around them. This game has some great gameplay mechanics to catch ghosts, a good variety of enemies, and a decent addition to the storyline from the Ghostbusters movies.\n\nNow, with that being said, the game has many flaws as well. Unfortunately for PC gamers, there is no co-op multiplayer where you get to play the campaign with your friends, unlike the console counterparts. I have no idea why this wasn't included with the PC, big mistake in my opinion. The reason for this is that the A.I. for your ghostbusting companions is very frustrating on the harder difficulties in the game. This leads to my second problem, the checkpoint system. When you fail at certain parts of the campaign because of repeated A.I. mishaps, then you have to keep going through the motions sometimes of exposition or puzzle solving over and over again just to get back to where you were. To me, those are the two main problems with the game.\n\nNow for the good stuff. Considering the time it was released and the development and production problems that came before the game was finished, this game looks great graphically.  Fairly well polished with a lot of detail in my opinion. The star of the show being the Ghostbuster character models (which resemble their real life actors fairly well), and the famous proton pack. The detail on the proton pack is astonishing. It was a great idea to implement a HUD on the proton pack itself instead of cluttering the screen with it. Since there is no HUD cluttering the screen, this leaves room for more enjoyment in observing the destruction caused by the proton stream and other projectile particles fired from the proton pack. The destruction mechanics in the game are very fun to play with. It's just eye opening how much damage to the surrounding environment happens after a battle with a few ghosts. Sometimes, I get disappointed when I find something in the game I can't destroy. There are some levels' destructability that rival games like John Woo's Stranglehold or Red Faction Guerrilla. Also, the gameplay involved in actually catching a ghost is fun too, especially the wrangle and slam mechanics. These devices help make you feel like you've accomplished something after catching a ghost especially on the hard difficulty settings. Plus, with a decent variety of enemies, you have different ways of dispatching your foes. There is a system of advancement in the game, making your proton pack more efficient and powerful throughout the campaign. It is more of an afterthought though. The PKE segments are a cool change of pace, but unfortunately the game holds your hand too much and doesn't allow for much exploration and puzzle solving to where you actually have to figure it out. There are some good moments though where I did a get a jump scare or two.\n\nOne more plus is that the actual actors in the Ghostbusters films did the voice acting for their respective characters, at least all the main ones anyway. Plus Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd wrote the story and script for the game so it's legit.\n\nGhostbusters:  The Videogame is a must play for fans and for anyone interested in a fun third person shooter that differs a bit from most of the TPS's out there. This game could have been soooo much more in the long run if the developers had more time to work on the gameplay mechanics and how to integrate them into a more open world exploration approach. If this game wasn't so linear and didn't hold your hand so much on the puzzle solving and directing where the player must go, and then maybe adding some driving of Ecto-1 so a little bit of an open world approach can play out, then it would be a AAA game in my book. But, this is what we get and I'm glad that the Ghostbusters can be alive and well in a decent video game.\n\n3 1/2 stars out of 5","June 13, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As the game gets more challening later on with more ghosts with harder mechanics your teamates go down more and more and it becomes a pain. I am a massive ghostbusters fan so I tried to grind through all this, but I could only take it so far before I couldn't put up with it. Even without the shoddy AI the game still isn't fantastic. While the rest of the gameplay is fine, it's very linear, gets too repetitive later on, taking on the same ghosts over and over and the story isn't completely gripping, as it re-treads the first movie and is predicatable.\n","March 31, 2015","false","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could write a lengthy review about all the authenticity, originality, humorous dialogue and plain-old fun that this program offers.

You are literally walking inside the famous (or infamous) firehouse, sliding down the pole and getting into the Ecto-1 to do battle with ghosts that challenge your Proton-pack, along with all the other cool gadgets that do not become excessive, but are introduced gradually and enhance your enjoyment of the game.  I would say about 50% of my enjoyment of this game stems from my appreciation for the film as a child - if you're a fan of the movies, you will appreciate this game.  They've done justice.  I feel like I'm 5 years old again and living my dream as an actual teammember!  It's really cool.  One thing they could have done was increase the intervals between savepoints (I'm playing on hard - I am, afterall, a real Ghostbuster); but you'll get better at the game and get over this before too long.

Considering the time it was released and the development and production problems that came before the game was finished, this game looks great graphically.  Fairly well polished with a lot of detail in my opinion. The star of the show being the Ghostbuster character models (which resemble their real life actors fairly well), and the famous proton pack. The detail on the proton pack is astonishing. It was a great idea to implement a HUD on the proton pack itself instead of cluttering the screen with it. Since there is no HUD cluttering the screen, this leaves room for more enjoyment in observing the destruction caused by the proton stream and other projectile particles fired from the proton pack. The destruction mechanics in the game are very fun to play with. It's just eye opening how much damage to the surrounding environment happens after a battle with a few ghosts. Sometimes, I get disappointed when I find something in the game I can't destroy. There are some levels' destructability that rival games like John Woo's Stranglehold or Red Faction Guerrilla. Also, the gameplay involved in actually catching a ghost is fun too, especially the wrangle and slam mechanics. These devices help make you feel like you've accomplished something after catching a ghost especially on the hard difficulty settings. Plus, with a decent variety of enemies, you have different ways of dispatching your foes. There is a system of advancement in the game, making your proton pack more efficient and powerful throughout the campaign. It is more of an afterthought though. The PKE segments are a cool change of pace, but unfortunately the game holds your hand too much and doesn't allow for much exploration and puzzle solving to where you actually have to figure it out. There are some good moments though where I did a get a jump scare or two.\n\nOne more plus is that the actual actors in the Ghostbusters films did the voice acting for their respective characters, at least all the main ones anyway. Plus Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd wrote the story and script for the game so it's legit.\n\nGhostbusters:  The Videogame is a must play for fans and for anyone interested in a fun third person shooter that differs a bit from most of the TPS's out there. This game could have been soooo much more in the long run if the developers had more time to work on the gameplay mechanics and how to integrate them into a more open world exploration approach. If this game wasn't so linear and didn't hold your hand so much on the puzzle solving and directing where the player must go, and then maybe adding some driving of Ecto-1 so a little bit of an open world approach can play out, then it would be a AAA game in my book. But, this is what we get and I'm glad that the Ghostbusters can be alive and well in a decent video game.\n\n3 1/2 stars out of 5","June 13, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Selwyn :)\n\nCons\n\n*  Not very creepy but it tries to on several occasions - has its moments it caught me off-guard.\n*  Missing achievements and trading cards.\n* Few bugs (Ghosts or teammates getting stuck / collisions/ logic and not progressing storyline) forcing you to reload from last save.\n* Some of the animations are really well done and others you can just tell there was 0 effort.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite it's drawbacks, it was still definitely worth the cost. None of the cons were significant enough to make me want to not see it through to the end. Very fun and gets challenging on harder difficulties. Great that you can change difficulty without starting the entire game over.\nIf you liked the (original) movie, it is highly recommended you give it a go for fun - you won't be dissapointed.

It feels bulky in the action scenes. Especially running, dashing and evading during the combat is really really stiffy stuff.

I mention this so if someone else winds up in my spot it'll save them a lotta time and system digging.\n\nI'm currently 8 hours into this one, and the game is fantastic. I enjoyed the first film but wouldn't consider myself a diehard fan, but even as a newbie to the franchise the gameplay lets this title stand on its own. The third person three-step process to ghostbusting is a ton of fun and can get very frantic and exciting. The controls are... a bit stiff but I find with this sort of game it works, like tank controls did for older survival horror where managing to work in the framework of the game is part of the challenge and fun. The 'weapons' are all very satisfying, and I spent way more time and had way more fun just pinning chairs to the rooves of buildings with the slime tether than I should be willing to admit.\n\nThe soundtrack matches the film with some great atmospheric pieces put in, and most pleasantly: The game is actually quite unsettling at a few points. I was worried with the brand image they'd hold back on the spooky side but the game actually got a few jumps out of me and the ghost design ranges from goofy to actually hellish.\n\nI would check on your specs before purchasing, the game runs pretty good on my system but there is an abundance of particle effects that I've found my fps greatly drop during, particularly in the ghost world level, Also in the kitchen level where there was a lot of fire and smoke going on.\n\nBack to audio, the original voice cast is almost entirely here, and they sound fantastic. You play as a generic silent protaganist which is a bit disappointing since I saw a golden opportunity to get a recognized voice today play a new addition to the team that could add more banter, but messing with the original formula is iffy business so I can understand playing it safe.\n\nUltimately you have a 10 hour game with a good amount of collectables, great third person shooter gameplay, an often tense atmosphere, and a good amount of weapons. You also get ten hours with Bill Murray, and if that doesn't buy you alone it's probably not the game for you. The story is pretty good as well but a bit tough to follow. It may be because I have never seen Ghostbusters 2. Either way, solid game, having a ton of fun with it aside from some mild issues. If I had to ascribe a number it'd be a very recommended 8.","November 1, 2014","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, the performance is atrocious. It feels like you need to have a certain graphics config, or have your computer built a certain way.\n\nThe game itself is very nice. Graphics are lacking, mostly in character models, but proton beams and ghosts are animated perfectly. As for the story, I obviously haven't beaten it within this release, but from playing it on consoles, I can confirm that it's suffecient. Maybe not a masterpiece of storytelling, but pretty good nonetheless.\n\nControls actually aren't a problem, they're very straight forward and easy to remember, but the game runs awfully. Like, distractingly so. To the point where it's hard to play for more than 30 minutes at a time without the right PC build or configuration. This is the major drawback of the PC release. If possible, play this game on a PS3 or Xbox 360. The expierence is quite a bit better there (If nothing else, I recommend a controller).\n\nOverall, the game itself is great, but due to performance, it feels coated in ♥♥♥♥. Like I said, try and play the console release if possible, but if you can't and you're a big fan of the franchise, then go for this. It's certainly not impossible to enjoy on PC, and if you can tweak your settings and find a way to make it run properly, then it's even better.\n\nGame itself gets an 8/10, after performance, drops to a 6-7/10.","March 1, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you get past the first couple of hours and you get a good handle on the controls it is smooth for the most part.\nThe only thing I really didn't like was that there are areas where you don't know what to do, it is not very intuitive what to do next, and you have to try a few things before one of your companions suggest something and then you have to figure out how to solve the puzzle with the vague clue that they give you.\nI played with a 360 control, and getting used to it took me a while before I got comfortable with the weapons and how to combine and use the buttons correctly.\nOverall I really liked the game, took me around 20 hours to play through it, spread out over a few weekends.\nThe game is definitely worth the prize, if not the game just for the story and voice acting.","March 1, 2015","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of that probably has to with the fact that I'm a huge fan of the movies, and the game does a very nice job of paying homage to those classic films while creating an original story that essentially works as the third in the series.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, the game is solid but nothing spectacular. Mostly your standard third-person shooter fare, although the "zap 'em, cap 'em, trap 'em" mechanics of fighting ghosts makes combat feel pretty fresh and enjoyable. There are a wide variety of interesting weapon upgrades (I liked how the game makes use of the PKE meter) and some intense and challenging enemy encounters as well.\n\nThe area where the game really excels, though, is in its production values. From beginning to end it truly feels like you're in the Ghostbusters universe. Between the excellent use of music and sound effects, the terrific voice acting and the quality environmental design, the game succeeds in staying true to the source material. The writing is mostly solid, especially when it comes to the in-game banter between the original four.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does have a couple nasty technical issues. The mouse smoothing feels awful and I found using a controller to be a necessary decision. I also experienced significant performance drops during the game's final boss battle that would make the fight nearly unplayable. The lack of co-op play is a noticable and unfortunate omission as well.\n\nOverall though, if you're a fan of the original movies, I can't recommend Ghostbusters enough. It's one of the better movie tie-in games I've ever played and stands strong as a follow-up to the films.","January 4, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel that the devs were truly able to capture the feeling of being a ghostbuster and being part of the team in that universe. I've owned the game for at least four years and I've played through it about 6 times and love it every time.\n\nThe game has fantastic atmosphere. Every place has good aesthetics including some places that are genuinely creepy. You get to revisit some classic movie locations, done well I might add. The writing and voice acting is a pleasure (though some say Murray's voice acting was half hearted, judge for yourself) and the familiar GB humor is present throughout the game. Not to mention the iconic music! Not just the obvious themesong, but the same music that was composed by Elmer Bernstein that sets the mood in every scene in the movie.\n\nDan Aykroyd himself has said that the game is basically the third movie, so if you are aching for a continuation of the story line with the same familiar faces and voices then I suggest you give the game a playthrough.\n\nFor me, as a ghosthead, the replayability of this game is as high as rewatchability of the movies (at least the first one) which I've watched many, many times.\n\nAs you can see I love this game, but it is not without its flaws. At least one area of the game dropped my FPS to single digits on my old computer, but I haven't had the issue with my current computer with max settings on. The mouse aiming is wonky; It feels unoptimized and possibly mouse acceleration is stuck on, but the controller feels good. Certain parts of the game are only hard because they're frustrating and, related to that, sometimes you get stuck with the job of constantly picking up your team because you depend on them to pick you up if you get knocked down.\n\nThe game can give you around 8 hours of gameplay but that's if you move at the game's pace while picking up collectibles. It's possible to beat the game in half of that time.\n\nThe most sacriligious thing is that the multiplayer half the the game was excluded for the PC version. If you are intent on playing with your friends then you need to buy the console version.\n\nAlso, a side note, BUY THE GAME WHILE YOU CAN! I don't know what the deal is, but this game seems to have a history of popping up on Steam and then disappearing for years.\n\nI also recommend not purchasing the ghost trap upgrades. My favorite part of the game is wrangling and capturing ghosts with the crew and I don't want anything that detracts from that. If you do decide not to get the upgrades but you are worried that the game may be too hard without them, I've beaten the game three times on professional difficulty and I've never purchased the trap upgrades once.\n\nI don't think Ghostbuster fans are ever going to get another game, or even a movie, that is as good as this game. Take that how ever you want to.","January 30, 2014","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Alright, Ghostbusters: The Game! But before I say anything more, I must admit that ‘Ghostbusters: The Movie’ is probably my favorite movie of all time. The first one, not the second one…let’s not get crazy here. I must have seen that movie over 100 times by now, and I’ll gladly sit down to watch it sometime in the near future, possibly even after I finish this review. Back off man, I’m a scientist. So needless to say, I’m a really big fan. Anyway, this isn't the first Ghostbusters game to have been made, and if you've played the ones for Nintendo, you’ll know that they aren't very good. They’re pretty terrible actually. So when I first picked this one up, I had pretty low expectations, especially since Atari released it.\n\nNow I have no idea who wrote the story for this game but it’s extremely well done, and playing through it is like watching an entirely new version of the original Ghostbusters movie. It’s all there, just re-arranged and updated to be shown through the eyes of you, a new hire for the Ghostbusters being put through the ringer his first day on the job. It’s wonderful. The cast signed on to do the voices (brand new dialogue with lots of references to classic lines from the movie), the unforgettable music is present throughout, and there are tons of recognizable landmarks and characters such as the library, old firehouse, Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, Slimer, Walter Peck, etc.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it’s pretty much what you’d expect from a polished, third person AAA title. The controls are fluid and work well, catching ghosts is fun and sometimes difficult, and the camera is perfect. Characters can heal one another after they've fallen, so you don’t die too often, and regular cut-scenes and change in environments are plentiful so you won’t get bored very easily. You really can’t go wrong with the gameplay here if you even remotely like games in the third person perspective. So all-in-all if you’re a big fan of the Ghostbusters movies, then I’d easily recommend playing through this game for the story alone; it's well worth it.","January 2, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thought it would be great fun, especially when it was on sale. A typical adaptation from a movie franchise to a video game that fails to capture the feel and atmosphere of the original Ghostbusters movies. This game is rather boring and uninspired. The only good thing about the game is the main theme song! Here you play as an unnamed rookie (as every poor movie-to-videogame adaptation) in the Ghostbuster team, where you follow the title characters in the game to catch ghosts, with boring dialogues, jokes that aren't funny at all. As others had said the controls sucks and not intuitive at all, especially with keyboard+mice control, the Xbox360 controller doesn't make the game more playable and/or enjoyable. Graphically, I think it still looks okay, but the characters move quite cumbersome in the game, it doesn't matter what control you are using for the game.\n\nThe game could have been better with tactical game mechanics, perhaps similar to the Rainbow Six franchise with team based gameplay while keeping the Ghostbusters movie's fun and jokes; each team member has its unique ability to compromise other team members's weaknesses and strengths etc. The game in its current form is just too boring and the gameplay is really nothing special at all, not saying it's easy to beat the game (especially with that awful mouse accelaration that can't be disabled in the game menu). Furthermore the PC version lacks multiplayer mode!\n\nSo use your money wisely and buy an other game instead. This Ghostbusters videogame just lacks in gameplay/-gamemechanics, control, writing/story. If you want a good ghosthunting game, and if you have a Nintendo 3DS, go buy Luigi's Mansion 2 instead. Or go for the first Luigi's Mansion game for the really old Nintendo Gamecube console (a second hand Gamecube is really cheap now) for dirt cheap. As for a recommendation for the PC platform, try out Ghost Master which is also available on Steam here, though it plays differently than this Ghostbuster video game, but it's way more fun to play: just for less than 1 euro during Christmas sale!","December 27, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lack of co-op is trash but the rest of the game is pretty solid. However, about halfway through the game, you stop feeling like a ghost buster, the gameplay reiterates so much I feel like I'm playing Metroid Prime, like I've been backtracking for hours - even though I've been progressing in the game. Once you get to the end of the story you probably won't care anymore and will inevitably load up the first hotel level to destroy furniture with the ghost laser gun. The pack upgrades are cool but ultimately only serve a gameplay mechanic. There's very little choice, the game handholds, and overall it feels like it's from a bygone era (which it is). Bill Murray's presence is very off, he seems disinterested or like he's just script reading. Regardless, it all seems to work in a cute way. You'll probably only play this once.\n\nWorth aprox. $2.","June 14, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's basically the third movie, and is written Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis (RIP Egon!), as well as the original Busters and other characters returning to do the voice acting (Bill Murray is as overconfident and sarcastic as ever as Venkman). It is actually scarier than the movies ever were...I think a lot of it has to do with equipping the PK meter which means you pretty much have on night vision goggles and have to track down ghosts in this mode; knowing full well you can't attack in this mode. Especially if you are playing in the dark at 1:30am lol. Plus, the ghost are a tad more gruesome looking than the movies.

I kinda get that. But, overall, I really enjoyed it. It's a nice little story written by original writers, Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, and it could've easily been the follow-up film.\n\nFirst up, let's get the downers out of the way... The pc port is a lil' bit iffy. I had issues with the framerate dropping from 60fps to 26fps, a lot. This, on an AMD 290! Not just that, either. A few times, I loaded up my savegame, but the game would sit on "loading..." constantly. This happened randomly, but sometimes I'd have to verify the files in order to straighten things out. Doing this allowed things to work again.\n\nNow, the good. The game is fun to play! The first time you get your proton pack and start shooting up the scenery, it's a great feeling. Bagging your first ghost looks like it's right out of the films. I never tired of capturing ghosts in a trap! They got it so right :)\nThe music is pretty much the original films' soundtrack, tacked onto the game scenes/cutscenes. It's a mixed bag as it doesn't always match the action. Shame. But, because it's the original music, it does bring a level of quality that, at times, does mix in well.\n\nAnd the best part, we get the original cast back for a semi-sequel (sort of). And in light of Harold Ramis' death just last year, it's all the more poignant. I just want to touch upon the difficulty level for a moment. Again, I remember hearing folk say that it's a hard game, even on normal - to the point of it being annoying to play. Well, I disagree. I played on normal and the challenge was pretty good. Still, it wasn't too challenging and I managed to finish it in around 7 and a half hours. Maybe the best tip to keep the game going is, always help pick up your fallen comrades!\n\nOverall, it's a nice return to the Ghostbusters franchise. Even if it was a videogame :P Thumbs up!","January 19, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/9870/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","7/10\n\nThis game is most certainly the perfect definition of "mixed bag". Let me say it's fun to go back to everyone's favorite movie. It's cool how the actors wrote the script for this, and they all lent their likeness and voices to it, and I mean basically EVERYONE. Most of the character models look good, except for dan akroyd who has way too weird looking of a tall head with a giant forehad and his face/head look mishaped. You play this guy who has no name and doesn't even say a word the whole movie, which is pretty hilariously stupid in many parts, where he just makes a face in reply. It sticks out like a sore thumb and is definitely lazy writing on their part. It was fun sliding down the pole in the facility. You go to all the old places like the library, the hotel, fight marshmellow guy and everything. There is a lot of good fan service. The story is also interesting. There is a forced and dumb romance that is thrown in but feels akward. The game is also decent length. Sometimes the facial animations/expressions/talking gestures, all look super wooden and really bad. Sometimes the cutscenes look guy, sometimes they look bad. The environments are quit destructible which is a nice touch.\n\nThen theres the biggest problem,the gameplay. First off, you use your pack the entire time. Its cool and fun at first but starts to get really old. You get a few different attacks with it, but honestly it doesn't really make sense, since your first one does the most damage and is the most effective. You get things like an energy shotgun and a superfluous homing weapon but since they do less damage, theres no reason to ever use them, unless its forced. I used the main gun the entire game for about 90% of it, which gets super old after 8 hours. All of the upgrades are boring things like "better damage, rate of fire, or heat generation, for your current weapons", nothing interesting or fun or different. Putting enemies into traps is fun at first, but the controls on how to do it and trigger it are finnicky. The aiming and sensitivity are wonky and you have to adjust settings. Many times with the small hit range of your gun and how much everything teleports, how fast it moves, and how much life it has, you'll be frustrated with aiming. The checkpoints can be annoying as the game never really tells you when there is one or when its saving. Many times in certain parts where there isn't a cutscene, but there's dialogue before something is triggered, if you die to have to wait and listen through it all over again, which happens in the two most poorly done and annoying parts of the game. This could have been handeled better.\n\nFinally, the worst part, your team. I cannot remember the last time I had such incompitent teamates or AI. They constantly stand in 1 spot eating damage and get downed. You have to help them up, for which you have to stand stationary, slowly squat down, and then stand back up, leaving you open to dying. But if your team dies you have to restart. In common boss fights I would have to revive anywhere from 10-15 times, and on wave parts/mini bosses, it would be around 5-10. you feel like a babysitter because if something is damaging them they will sit there and take it. One boss had a melee tornado, so he would spin at you, and they would stand stationary, let him come up to them and kill them. The AI is unacceptable. Then if you die they will sometimes just around your body until they get killed. Many times they will have a downed teamate next to them and they won't revive them. You will be so frustrated b/c you will have to run around reviving them and if you die once then they will die without helping you. Also b/c there is no glowing sign or anything, it can be hard to tell where they are. Many parts involve waves of guys coming, or bosses, that have like instant homing hits that get you no matter what you do. It doesn't help you have a slow weird hop forward or to the side, but no jump/roll to dodge. Also for some reason guys can either 1 shot or 2 shot kill you. If you get hurt the recharge takes about 30 seconds to work, which is super unhelpful. Many parts you have to try dozens of times because of the cheap auto hits, the worthless teamates, terrible AI, and huge amount of damage they do.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is somewhat bland and repetitive, and the AI may be the worst squad AI I've ever seen in a game, the story and characters and being a ghostbuster is what this is all about. If thats what you're looking for this has it. Otherwise be wary.\n","September 10, 2015","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WITH the whole cast reprising their roles? It's the closest we are gonna get to a Ghostbusters 3, and it's incredibly good! It has minimal HUD usage, since all the important info is displayed on your proton pack, thus adding to the movie feel of the game.","February 19, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were several elements of the story (including the ending) that I felt crossed the line between referencing the films and ripping them off.\n\nThe performances from the cast were for the most part excellent as you would expect, but ultimately I found the answering machine messages and the Viggo painting were the funniest parts of the game.\n\nWeapons were fun, especially the slime gun although the upgrade system was totally pointless. "Hidden" items you are basically guided to as there is a message telling you to use the PKE when you are near them. I had bought all the unlocks by 4/5 levels from the end and ended the game with almost as much money again left unspent.\n\nNo rewards or anything else for completion, the artwork was mildly interesting but I didn't feel much joy from unlocking a cut-scene I had already watched.\n\nOverall a fun game but I have to say if not for the theme I probably would not have stuck with it until the end. I don't think the producers really looked too deeply into the gaming side of this title, but if we are considering the overall quality of most movie licence games I would definitely put Ghostbusters near the top.","September 30, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/9870/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","7/10\n\nThis game is most certainly the perfect definition of "mixed bag". Let me say it's fun to go back to everyone's favorite movie. It's cool how the actors wrote the script for this, and they all lent their likeness and voices to it, and I mean basically EVERYONE. Most of the character models look good, except for dan akroyd who has way too weird looking of a tall head with a giant forehad and his face/head look mishaped. You play this guy who has no name and doesn't even say a word the whole movie, which is pretty hilariously stupid in many parts, where he just makes a face in reply. It sticks out like a sore thumb and is definitely lazy writing on their part. It was fun sliding down the pole in the facility. You go to all the old places like the library, the hotel, fight marshmellow guy and everything. There is a lot of good fan service. The story is also interesting. There is a forced and dumb romance that is thrown in but feels akward. The game is also decent length. Sometimes the facial animations/expressions/talking gestures, all look super wooden and really bad. Sometimes the cutscenes look guy, sometimes they look bad. The environments are quit destructible which is a nice touch.\n\nThen theres the biggest problem,the gameplay. First off, you use your pack the entire time. Its cool and fun at first but starts to get really old. You get a few different attacks with it, but honestly it doesn't really make sense, since your first one does the most damage and is the most effective. You get things like an energy shotgun and a superfluous homing weapon but since they do less damage, theres no reason to ever use them, unless its forced. I used the main gun the entire game for about 90% of it, which gets super old after 8 hours. All of the upgrades are boring things like "better damage, rate of fire, or heat generation, for your current weapons", nothing interesting or fun or different. Putting enemies into traps is fun at first, but the controls on how to do it and trigger it are finnicky. The aiming and sensitivity are wonky and you have to adjust settings. Many times with the small hit range of your gun and how much everything teleports, how fast it moves, and how much life it has, you'll be frustrated with aiming. The checkpoints can be annoying as the game never really tells you when there is one or when its saving. Many times in certain parts where there isn't a cutscene, but there's dialogue before something is triggered, if you die to have to wait and listen through it all over again, which happens in the two most poorly done and annoying parts of the game. This could have been handeled better.\n\nFinally, the worst part, your team. I cannot remember the last time I had such incompitent teamates or AI. They constantly stand in 1 spot eating damage and get downed. You have to help them up, for which you have to stand stationary, slowly squat down, and then stand back up, leaving you open to dying. But if your team dies you have to restart. In common boss fights I would have to revive anywhere from 10-15 times, and on wave parts/mini bosses, it would be around 5-10. you feel like a babysitter because if something is damaging them they will sit there and take it. One boss had a melee tornado, so he would spin at you, and they would stand stationary, let him come up to them and kill them. The AI is unacceptable. Then if you die they will sometimes just around your body until they get killed. Many times they will have a downed teamate next to them and they won't revive them. You will be so frustrated b/c you will have to run around reviving them and if you die once then they will die without helping you. Also b/c there is no glowing sign or anything, it can be hard to tell where they are. Many parts involve waves of guys coming, or bosses, that have like instant homing hits that get you no matter what you do. It doesn't help you have a slow weird hop forward or to the side, but no jump/roll to dodge. Also for some reason guys can either 1 shot or 2 shot kill you. If you get hurt the recharge takes about 30 seconds to work, which is super unhelpful. Many parts you have to try dozens of times because of the cheap auto hits, the worthless teamates, terrible AI, and huge amount of damage they do.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is somewhat bland and repetitive, and the AI may be the worst squad AI I've ever seen in a game, the story and characters and being a ghostbuster is what this is all about. If thats what you're looking for this has it. Otherwise be wary.\n","September 10, 2015","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel that the devs were truly able to capture the feeling of being a ghostbuster and being part of the team in that universe. I've owned the game for at least four years and I've played through it about 6 times and love it every time.\n\nThe game has fantastic atmosphere. Every place has good aesthetics including some places that are genuinely creepy. You get to revisit some classic movie locations, done well I might add. The writing and voice acting is a pleasure (though some say Murray's voice acting was half hearted, judge for yourself) and the familiar GB humor is present throughout the game. Not to mention the iconic music! Not just the obvious themesong, but the same music that was composed by Elmer Bernstein that sets the mood in every scene in the movie.\n\nDan Aykroyd himself has said that the game is basically the third movie, so if you are aching for a continuation of the story line with the same familiar faces and voices then I suggest you give the game a playthrough.\n\nFor me, as a ghosthead, the replayability of this game is as high as rewatchability of the movies (at least the first one) which I've watched many, many times.\n\nAs you can see I love this game, but it is not without its flaws. At least one area of the game dropped my FPS to single digits on my old computer, but I haven't had the issue with my current computer with max settings on. The mouse aiming is wonky; It feels unoptimized and possibly mouse acceleration is stuck on, but the controller feels good. Certain parts of the game are only hard because they're frustrating and, related to that, sometimes you get stuck with the job of constantly picking up your team because you depend on them to pick you up if you get knocked down.\n\nThe game can give you around 8 hours of gameplay but that's if you move at the game's pace while picking up collectibles. It's possible to beat the game in half of that time.\n\nThe most sacriligious thing is that the multiplayer half the the game was excluded for the PC version. If you are intent on playing with your friends then you need to buy the console version.\n\nAlso, a side note, BUY THE GAME WHILE YOU CAN! I don't know what the deal is, but this game seems to have a history of popping up on Steam and then disappearing for years.\n\nI also recommend not purchasing the ghost trap upgrades. My favorite part of the game is wrangling and capturing ghosts with the crew and I don't want anything that detracts from that. If you do decide not to get the upgrades but you are worried that the game may be too hard without them, I've beaten the game three times on professional difficulty and I've never purchased the trap upgrades once.\n\nI don't think Ghostbuster fans are ever going to get another game, or even a movie, that is as good as this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/9870/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","1984. The year the Apple Macintosh hit the States, the year the White Sox took over eight hours to defeat the Brewers in a single baseball game, and the year Springsteen released his "Born In The USA" album. I was about the same age as my niece at this time- but I was still trying to take things over with cats; even if it was mostly using my favorite Garfield plushes to stake my claim on the couch for cartoons. But it was also kind of remarkable for one more thing- the launch of a movie franchise that's turned into one of the more popular ones in known memory- in fact, it just got a new film, announced for release sometime later this year.\n\nWhen there's something strange in your neighborhood, well... who ya gonna call? That ought to be an easy answer for anybody who was alive to have seen the movies... or the two animated series... or the other videos games: The Ghostbusters. Granted, it's been too long since I've seen one of the movies- but at least I have a couple of video games in my collection. For this review, I'm looking at Ghostbusters: The Video Game.\n\nThe premise of the story sets it at the year 1991- two years after the second movie, and business has apparently never been better- so good, in fact, that the original four Ghostbusters have decided to hire an intern- you. Apparently you're not the first, either (if some of the lines about accidents can be believed...), so to them well... you're just "the rookie"- in case something ends up happening to you, they don't want to get too close. Not that anything will... you know. Hopefully. But hey, you get to guinea-pig the new tech that Egon comes up with- so that's a plus! But they just don't know how stable the tech is... that's a minus. So you get to run around with a nuclear accelerator on your back with enough experimental tech that could blow you and everyone else clear to New Jersey. if something went wrong with it. Joy.\n\nAt its heart, the game is a third-person view shooter- you advance through the levels, busting ghosts and slamming them into traps in order to generate money to further research the tech needed to power up your offensive capabilities. Hey, they have to whip this stuff up from scratch, that costs money! You can also find artifacts for some much-needed cash, but your main source of cash is going to be ghost-hunting. The controls are all right- I used the keyboard, but I don't know if it supports the controller or not. I didn't have much difficulty with KBAM, though. The controls are easy to learn, though.\n\nThis game's been called "the third movie" by Dan Aykroyd himself, and features the voice talents of many of the original movie cast- Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson have all lent their voices and likenesses to the game for an extra authentic feel, and William Atherton (Peck), Annie Potts (Janine), Max von Sydow (Vigo the Carpathian) and Brian Doyle-Murray (the mayor) add their voice talents as well. Ramis and Aykroyd also assisted with the game's script, so it really does feel like you ought to be watching this in the theater.\n\nThe first level is essentially a love-letter to the fans- and as you progress through the game you find out that yes, there really was an over-arching plot to the first two movies, with a pretty strong conclusion to the trilogy. Honestly, I had a great time playing this.\n\nHowever, it's not perfect. You can't customize the player-character at all- what you see is what you get. No matter what you want to play as, you're stuck playing a twenty-something guy with a short haircut. You can't even change the gender of the rookie- in fact, I think the only current option to play as a female Ghostbuster can be found in "Sanctum of Slime" (Bridget) or in one of the "Extreme Ghostbusters" games (Kylie). Some of the animation is rather dated, and the lipsyncing of lines can be a bit off sometimes. Sometimes it can be hard to navigate the levels- the first level (The Sedgewick Hotel) is easily the worst offender. Would it have killed them to give us an on-screen map of some kind? Or waypoints? There's just too many functions jammed into the PKE meter... oftentimes the only way to figure out where to go is through trial and error or looking for someone standing around waiting for you.\n\nCurrently, Steam desires ten Gabenbucks for this game- I think it's a bit on the high side, but still worth it. If it catches a sale, and it's at least fifty percent off? Grab it. If you enjoyed the movies, and miss Harold Ramis, buy it. It really is a great game.\n\nTL;DR - Gift-a-pulting makes me feel good, but busting will make you feel good- and is a crapload of fun. 7/10.","April 2","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The lack of co-op is trash but the rest of the game is pretty solid. However, about halfway through the game, you stop feeling like a ghost buster, the gameplay reiterates so much I feel like I'm playing Metroid Prime, like I've been backtracking for hours - even though I've been progressing in the game. Once you get to the end of the story you probably won't care anymore and will inevitably load up the first hotel level to destroy furniture with the ghost laser gun. The pack upgrades are cool but ultimately only serve a gameplay mechanic. There's very little choice, the game handholds, and overall it feels like it's from a bygone era (which it is). Bill Murray's presence is very off, he seems disinterested or like he's just script reading. Regardless, it all seems to work in a cute way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeybslash3/recommended/9870/","joeybslash3","JoeyBslash3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joeybslash3/","304 products in account","First, I must say that I am a fan of Ghostbusters. The video game is a must for any fan who would enjoy throwing on a proton pack and catching some ghosts while haphazardly destroying the environment around them. This game has some great gameplay mechanics to catch ghosts, a good variety of enemies, and a decent addition to the storyline from the Ghostbusters movies.\n\nNow, with that being said, the game has many flaws as well. Unfortunately for PC gamers, there is no co-op multiplayer where you get to play the campaign with your friends, unlike the console counterparts. I have no idea why this wasn't included with the PC, big mistake in my opinion. The reason for this is that the A.I. for your ghostbusting companions is very frustrating on the harder difficulties in the game. This leads to my second problem, the checkpoint system. When you fail at certain parts of the campaign because of repeated A.I. mishaps, then you have to keep going through the motions sometimes of exposition or puzzle solving over and over again just to get back to where you were. To me, those are the two main problems with the game.\n\nNow for the good stuff. Considering the time it was released and the development and production problems that came before the game was finished, this game looks great graphically.  Fairly well polished with a lot of detail in my opinion. The star of the show being the Ghostbuster character models (which resemble their real life actors fairly well), and the famous proton pack. The detail on the proton pack is astonishing. It was a great idea to implement a HUD on the proton pack itself instead of cluttering the screen with it. Since there is no HUD cluttering the screen, this leaves room for more enjoyment in observing the destruction caused by the proton stream and other projectile particles fired from the proton pack. The destruction mechanics in the game are very fun to play with. It's just eye opening how much damage to the surrounding environment happens after a battle with a few ghosts. Sometimes, I get disappointed when I find something in the game I can't destroy. There are some levels' destructability that rival games like John Woo's Stranglehold or Red Faction Guerrilla. Also, the gameplay involved in actually catching a ghost is fun too, especially the wrangle and slam mechanics. These devices help make you feel like you've accomplished something after catching a ghost especially on the hard difficulty settings. Plus, with a decent variety of enemies, you have different ways of dispatching your foes. There is a system of advancement in the game, making your proton pack more efficient and powerful throughout the campaign. It is more of an afterthought though. The PKE segments are a cool change of pace, but unfortunately the game holds your hand too much and doesn't allow for much exploration and puzzle solving to where you actually have to figure it out. There are some good moments though where I did a get a jump scare or two.\n\nOne more plus is that the actual actors in the Ghostbusters films did the voice acting for their respective characters, at least all the main ones anyway. Plus Harold Ramis and Dan Akroyd wrote the story and script for the game so it's legit.\n\nGhostbusters:  The Videogame is a must play for fans and for anyone interested in a fun third person shooter that differs a bit from most of the TPS's out there. This game could have been soooo much more in the long run if the developers had more time to work on the gameplay mechanics and how to integrate them into a more open world exploration approach. If this game wasn't so linear and didn't hold your hand so much on the puzzle solving and directing where the player must go, and then maybe adding some driving of Ecto-1 so a little bit of an open world approach can play out, then it would be a AAA game in my book. But, this is what we get and I'm glad that the Ghostbusters can be alive and well in a decent video game.\n\n3 1/2 stars out of 5","June 13, 2014","true","26.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's kind of amusing that they actually removed this from Steam for a bit, so I actually had this for a while despite the game not even being purchaseable.\n\nEssentially, this is pretty much the 3rd movie, but in video game format, with you playing as a new recruit, whom they're testing to see if they can't expand the Ghostbusters name into a franchise in other cities. As a result, you get the standard equipment from the proton pack, including a few new weapons, like the meson collider, or the slime stream.\n\nThe game kind of feels haphazardly put together, but it works well enough to function. I would strongly recommend cranking the mouse sensitivity up as high as it will go for the best experience. Just, fyi.\n\nIf there's one thing I like about this version compared to it's console counterparts (barring the Wii version, that one's actually kind of special), it's that the loading screens are relatively short. Why does this matter? Because, unfortunately, you'll be "dying" quite often in some cases, and it really doesn't take much to do so. You'll likely spend about half the time in the game reviving your teammates (which it's console counterparts actually have an achievement for this!).\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of the movies, you'll likely enjoy this. It's actually quite short, averaging between 5-7 hours, but it's surprisingly well done.","September 10, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I like to think of this game as Ghostbusters 3. While playing this I had an abosolute blast! There has been no game to date that captures the charm and brillience of Ghostbusters as well as this.\nPros:\nAll voices actors (besides Rick Moranis) return and give the same level of charm that they did in the movies.\nThe gameplay is fun and engaging, wrangling ghosts and trapping them is a great experience and would be a reason alone to buy this game.\nThe graphics are extremely well done (especially by 2009 standards) and bring the world to life.\nThe story has great humour, plot twists and structure.\nThe level design is excellent (I could spend hours exploring every single detail in the levels).\nThe game has good replay value and even afterwards you'll still have cursed objects to collect and ghosts to scan.\nCons:\nYou are bound to only 1 place at a time, the story narrates where you go and when you go there (it would be great if at some point someone would make a RPG Ghostbusters game where you travel around the city answering calls).\nIf you turn off the game while at the firehouse, it cancels out the next cutscene when you reload it.\nYou sometimes have to stand in an exact spot for a command to activate and move the gameplay along (for example, when in the library, the ghost didn't appear until I stood in an exact spot).\nIn conclusion, this is an amazing game, if you're a fan of Ghostbusters, this game is a must, it also ran very smoothly on my PC (which doesn't do too well with games). 8.0/10 Amazing!","March 4","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is written and voiced by the original cast of the original ghostbusters and is deemed by Mr. Ankroyd "The third ghostbuster movie" (Source:  "The 'Real' Ghostbusters." Game Informer, 81. Akroyd:"I've seen work on the video game, I've watched it progress, my rap now to people is 'This is essentially the third movie.'"). This game manages to bridge the gap between 1 & 2 to show how the movies plots were connected the entire time. The gameplay is fun with the ghost trapping mechanics and the unique proton streams that come from upgrades which add a interesting take on ghost busting. The game at times can perform horribly due to poor optimization but is still worth while with every other great thing. Anyways the graphics are a tad outdated but it does not hamper the fact that this is a great game for ghostbusters fans that have an itch for the final hurrah of the original ghostbusters.\n\n8/10 Highly reccomend when on sale.","March 9","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's obvious that they tried their best to make the best Ghostbusters game possible, and they did it. It's like you are actually in a movie. Although it's scripted, the gameplay doesn't get old. I've played through the game several times since it was released and I can still enjoy it. The only thing missing is multiplayer which was on xbox 360.

But I like to think of this game as Ghostbusters 3. While playing this I had an abosolute blast! There has been no game to date that captures the charm and brillience of Ghostbusters as well as this.\nPros:\nAll voices actors (besides Rick Moranis) return and give the same level of charm that they did in the movies.\nThe gameplay is fun and engaging, wrangling ghosts and trapping them is a great experience and would be a reason alone to buy this game.\nThe graphics are extremely well done (especially by 2009 standards) and bring the world to life.\nThe story has great humour, plot twists and structure.\nThe level design is excellent (I could spend hours exploring every single detail in the levels).\nThe game has good replay value and even afterwards you'll still have cursed objects to collect and ghosts to scan.\nCons:\nYou are bound to only 1 place at a time, the story narrates where you go and when you go there (it would be great if at some point someone would make a RPG Ghostbusters game where you travel around the city answering calls).\nIf you turn off the game while at the firehouse, it cancels out the next cutscene when you reload it.\nYou sometimes have to stand in an exact spot for a command to activate and move the gameplay along (for example, when in the library, the ghost didn't appear until I stood in an exact spot).\nIn conclusion, this is an amazing game, if you're a fan of Ghostbusters, this game is a must, it also ran very smoothly on my PC (which doesn't do too well with games). 8.0/10 Amazing!","March 4","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/9870/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","1984. The year the Apple Macintosh hit the States, the year the White Sox took over eight hours to defeat the Brewers in a single baseball game, and the year Springsteen released his "Born In The USA" album. I was about the same age as my niece at this time- but I was still trying to take things over with cats; even if it was mostly using my favorite Garfield plushes to stake my claim on the couch for cartoons. But it was also kind of remarkable for one more thing- the launch of a movie franchise that's turned into one of the more popular ones in known memory- in fact, it just got a new film, announced for release sometime later this year.\n\nWhen there's something strange in your neighborhood, well... who ya gonna call? That ought to be an easy answer for anybody who was alive to have seen the movies... or the two animated series... or the other videos games: The Ghostbusters. Granted, it's been too long since I've seen one of the movies- but at least I have a couple of video games in my collection. For this review, I'm looking at Ghostbusters: The Video Game.\n\nThe premise of the story sets it at the year 1991- two years after the second movie, and business has apparently never been better- so good, in fact, that the original four Ghostbusters have decided to hire an intern- you. Apparently you're not the first, either (if some of the lines about accidents can be believed...), so to them well... you're just "the rookie"- in case something ends up happening to you, they don't want to get too close. Not that anything will... you know. Hopefully. But hey, you get to guinea-pig the new tech that Egon comes up with- so that's a plus! But they just don't know how stable the tech is... that's a minus. So you get to run around with a nuclear accelerator on your back with enough experimental tech that could blow you and everyone else clear to New Jersey. if something went wrong with it. Joy.\n\nAt its heart, the game is a third-person view shooter- you advance through the levels, busting ghosts and slamming them into traps in order to generate money to further research the tech needed to power up your offensive capabilities. Hey, they have to whip this stuff up from scratch, that costs money! You can also find artifacts for some much-needed cash, but your main source of cash is going to be ghost-hunting. The controls are all right- I used the keyboard, but I don't know if it supports the controller or not. I didn't have much difficulty with KBAM, though. The controls are easy to learn, though.\n\nThis game's been called "the third movie" by Dan Aykroyd himself, and features the voice talents of many of the original movie cast- Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson have all lent their voices and likenesses to the game for an extra authentic feel, and William Atherton (Peck), Annie Potts (Janine), Max von Sydow (Vigo the Carpathian) and Brian Doyle-Murray (the mayor) add their voice talents as well. Ramis and Aykroyd also assisted with the game's script, so it really does feel like you ought to be watching this in the theater.\n\nThe first level is essentially a love-letter to the fans- and as you progress through the game you find out that yes, there really was an over-arching plot to the first two movies, with a pretty strong conclusion to the trilogy. Honestly, I had a great time playing this.\n\nHowever, it's not perfect. You can't customize the player-character at all- what you see is what you get. No matter what you want to play as, you're stuck playing a twenty-something guy with a short haircut. You can't even change the gender of the rookie- in fact, I think the only current option to play as a female Ghostbuster can be found in "Sanctum of Slime" (Bridget) or in one of the "Extreme Ghostbusters" games (Kylie). Some of the animation is rather dated, and the lipsyncing of lines can be a bit off sometimes. Sometimes it can be hard to navigate the levels- the first level (The Sedgewick Hotel) is easily the worst offender. Would it have killed them to give us an on-screen map of some kind? Or waypoints? There's just too many functions jammed into the PKE meter... oftentimes the only way to figure out where to go is through trial and error or looking for someone standing around waiting for you.\n\nCurrently, Steam desires ten Gabenbucks for this game- I think it's a bit on the high side, but still worth it. If it catches a sale, and it's at least fifty percent off? Grab it. If you enjoyed the movies, and miss Harold Ramis, buy it. It really is a great game.\n\nTL;DR - Gift-a-pulting makes me feel good, but busting will make you feel good- and is a crapload of fun. 7/10.","April 2","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a great adventure that acts as a third movie.  It has the original cast doing the voice work and script credited to Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis!  It's awesome seeing these characters interact as you join them as the silent rookie.\n\nGameplay is good as far as using the classic gear and catching ghosts like the movie.  However it isn't the best.  Enemies can swarm and corner you.  You'll have to constantly revive your teammates because you'll need them to revive you! You collect money to upgrade equipment, but you'll have it all about halfway through the game.  I think a little tweaks like customization of your character appearance, more interaction with the firehouse, more stuff to purchase with the money you earn would have been nice.\n\nBe warned, it isn't a very long game.  You can unlock the concept artwork which will make you just a little sad of what was cut out.  I was happy with what I got, but can't help wondering how much more it could have been.\n\nAll in all, worthwhile for your Ghostbuster fix.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsfatinternet/recommended/9870/","tsfatinternet","Ψ TheSuffering™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tsfatinternet/","128 products in account","At first i feared a little from this game. Loaded it up, and by seeing the menu, hearing the goofy music, i thought, what did i bought, oh my god, not gonna happen... And exited. A few days ago was bored, i have a lot of games installed on my laptop, but didn't have the urge to start/continue any of them. There was the icon on the desktop for a few months now; i bought it a little while back on a steam sale - and i clicked on it. Since then i was playing for 3 days, every day a few hours, and just finished it minutes ago. And i don't think i regret buying it, but certanly would have regret it on full price. Maybe i could compare it to much like Max Payne 2, only with ghosts, and more graphics of my liking. Played on full HD 1920x1080, with everything on maximum on a Dell 3521 laptop with a Samsung S22D300 display, so i can't say it's not optimized, but it has it's technical issues in game, although not any of them turned out to be game breaking, so no big deal. You play as the "new guy", the rookie, with no name, and not a word to say througout the whole game, and for what reason is a mistery, but you're the experimental guy, you get all the new hardver - that hasn't been tested - on your back to test, try out, and use. You can upgrade your equipment by collecting money in game by completing quests, collecting artifacts, and information about ghosts using the PKE meter, which you gonna use a lot in game, not only for the said tasks above. I must admit, i been playing for 15 years now, but didn't get the opportunity to really laugh in a game, there where a lot funny games in my life/lot of funny moments, but somehow none of them had that something in it, that got me to laugh out loud, but this game has it; if you would ask me to explain what, i would say it's because i'm in the early 30s, and remember the Ghostbusters movies, experienced it myself, maybe thats why i can empathize with the humor, the spirit (get it? spirit, ghosts? no...? oh...) of the game. Otherwise i have no idea why i found it funny, because it's just trying to be, and except a few moments, it's not. Although after 6 hours of playing you get enough money with PKE-ing the last wall out of the game to upgrade everything you have to it's maximum, the chase of, and the effort to capturing the ghost becomes a flustrating mess of streams, and "what the hell is goning on"-s on the field, with no idea of where to look, and shoot, and it's not helping that all of the npc-s are screaming and complaining of pain and egony if i accidently hit one of them, and on top of that "getting down" with the need to run to him, and revive-ing him in a middle of a boss fight. Getting down means, that there is no actual death in-game, the game doesn't end until all of the npc-s, and you are not lying on the ground. That's one problem. The other one is, that this game is screaming for more. More of everything. More money, more ways to spend it, more upgrades, more artifacts, more ghosts, more ways to interact with things, more besides only being the 3rd movie. This is going to sound a little strange for a negative point of a game, but i can think of at least 50 achievements to put in this game, it's a shame that Terminal Reality has been closed. My third problem is with this game, that it's just the 3rd movie (At leats thats what they said about it). Nothing more, and it's mostly because of the worn-out story. I'm not gonna spoil the story, but it's "just" about the whole Gozer thing. It feels as the developers didn't want to put in too much effort in the story telling, just make a Ghostbusters - The Video Game, and thats what this is. A videogame of the ghostbusters, and it could have been much better. I think there's only gonna be a second, maybe a third time, that i'm going to play it through, than leave it, delete it from my laptop, and go on, and if somebody asks, that have i played the Ghostbusters game, i'm gonna say yes, it was good for one, or maybe two, and thats it. I'm recommending, that you do the same thing, if you were a fan of the original ghostbusters movies, buy it, play it, because it's worth the 10 hours of gameplay thats it's offering at it's optimum, but not nearly at it's full price. I think i can give it 87/100, just because i bought it on sale, on full price it's maybe a 84/100, no more. It's a shame, Terminal Reality has been closed. This could've been better with a few developer-tweaks here, and there. Much better.","January 15","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't believe the junk posts in the forums.\n\nI don't recommend you spend a lot of money on this game. Its an average port.

I would suggest playing it on casual and just enjoying the story and some moderately challenging fights. Beating them on hard mode won't lend you much in the way of a sense of accomplishment (especially without achievements). If you look at buying this like renting a movie, only you get to keep it, you'll be just fine.","February 13","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The story is definaly another good point in this games avor buitifuly meshing comedy with horror like the films from the 80's it was based on. The game lasted me around 13 hours on the equivlent of normal mode with one part being an expeption, and it definatly is a good amout lasting considering its 10 dollar price point. The music being mostly from the film's score by Elmer Bernstein, also assists in helping feel like the movies as well though.

The cutscenes and banter between the ghostbusters feels very much like one of the movies, and in fact this game is largely considered canon in the Ghostbusters universe.\n\nThe designers also did a pretty good job of capturing the actors' faces digitally, even if it's starting to look a little dated.\n\nThe game itself is fairly simple and linear, but the action is challenging enough to make it feel like you've earned the next cutscene of the movie/game you're watching/playing.","March 28","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/recommended/9870/","JaysonFour","JaysonFour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaysonFour/","299 products in account","1984. The year the Apple Macintosh hit the States, the year the White Sox took over eight hours to defeat the Brewers in a single baseball game, and the year Springsteen released his "Born In The USA" album. I was about the same age as my niece at this time- but I was still trying to take things over with cats; even if it was mostly using my favorite Garfield plushes to stake my claim on the couch for cartoons. But it was also kind of remarkable for one more thing- the launch of a movie franchise that's turned into one of the more popular ones in known memory- in fact, it just got a new film, announced for release sometime later this year.\n\nWhen there's something strange in your neighborhood, well... who ya gonna call? That ought to be an easy answer for anybody who was alive to have seen the movies... or the two animated series... or the other videos games: The Ghostbusters. Granted, it's been too long since I've seen one of the movies- but at least I have a couple of video games in my collection. For this review, I'm looking at Ghostbusters: The Video Game.\n\nThe premise of the story sets it at the year 1991- two years after the second movie, and business has apparently never been better- so good, in fact, that the original four Ghostbusters have decided to hire an intern- you. Apparently you're not the first, either (if some of the lines about accidents can be believed...), so to them well... you're just "the rookie"- in case something ends up happening to you, they don't want to get too close. Not that anything will... you know. Hopefully. But hey, you get to guinea-pig the new tech that Egon comes up with- so that's a plus! But they just don't know how stable the tech is... that's a minus. So you get to run around with a nuclear accelerator on your back with enough experimental tech that could blow you and everyone else clear to New Jersey. if something went wrong with it. Joy.\n\nAt its heart, the game is a third-person view shooter- you advance through the levels, busting ghosts and slamming them into traps in order to generate money to further research the tech needed to power up your offensive capabilities. Hey, they have to whip this stuff up from scratch, that costs money! You can also find artifacts for some much-needed cash, but your main source of cash is going to be ghost-hunting. The controls are all right- I used the keyboard, but I don't know if it supports the controller or not. I didn't have much difficulty with KBAM, though. The controls are easy to learn, though.\n\nThis game's been called "the third movie" by Dan Aykroyd himself, and features the voice talents of many of the original movie cast- Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson have all lent their voices and likenesses to the game for an extra authentic feel, and William Atherton (Peck), Annie Potts (Janine), Max von Sydow (Vigo the Carpathian) and Brian Doyle-Murray (the mayor) add their voice talents as well. Ramis and Aykroyd also assisted with the game's script, so it really does feel like you ought to be watching this in the theater.\n\nThe first level is essentially a love-letter to the fans- and as you progress through the game you find out that yes, there really was an over-arching plot to the first two movies, with a pretty strong conclusion to the trilogy. Honestly, I had a great time playing this.\n\nHowever, it's not perfect. You can't customize the player-character at all- what you see is what you get. No matter what you want to play as, you're stuck playing a twenty-something guy with a short haircut. You can't even change the gender of the rookie- in fact, I think the only current option to play as a female Ghostbuster can be found in "Sanctum of Slime" (Bridget) or in one of the "Extreme Ghostbusters" games (Kylie). Some of the animation is rather dated, and the lipsyncing of lines can be a bit off sometimes. Sometimes it can be hard to navigate the levels- the first level (The Sedgewick Hotel) is easily the worst offender. Would it have killed them to give us an on-screen map of some kind? Or waypoints? There's just too many functions jammed into the PKE meter... oftentimes the only way to figure out where to go is through trial and error or looking for someone standing around waiting for you.\n\nCurrently, Steam desires ten Gabenbucks for this game- I think it's a bit on the high side, but still worth it. If it catches a sale, and it's at least fifty percent off? Grab it. If you enjoyed the movies, and miss Harold Ramis, buy it. It really is a great game.\n\nTL;DR - Gift-a-pulting makes me feel good, but busting will make you feel good- and is a crapload of fun. 7/10.","April 2","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a cool vibe here where you feel like you're hanging out with the original cast. The mechanics aren't super complicated, but they create a simulation where you're wrangling ghosts, actually forcing them into your trap. The destruction you cause is awesome -- puts you into the hotel scene throughout the whole game. Plus, they do a great job letting you experience the original ghosts without forgetting the original movie or outright copying it. The models look slightly stiff and dated during cutscenes, but that's easy to forgive with the voice cast and the cool creepiness of ghost hunting, where you're heading down a dark hall and furniture starts to rise. Also, the PC version really, REALLY needs multiplayer -- you can tell it would be a perfect fit. Still, it's easily worth the 10 bucks.","May 23","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
