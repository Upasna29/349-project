At first glance it looks like one of many ordinary space shoot'em up games, but as soon as you unlock the so called hangar option a new dimension opens up.\nWithin the hangar players are able to construct their own personal space fighter to do battle on one of the many maps. With each level progression the player unlocks new parts which become available at the hangar screen.\n\nMuch, if not most, of Gimbal's power is due to this feature and sometimes you're spending more time construting and tweaking your ship than actually playing a map.\n\nThe maps which are at your disposal are okay and look nice. Each map comes in 2 versions: normal and mini.\n\nAnother good thing about Gimbal is the option to host your own server, add bots to it (This allows for Co-Op and solo play) and to adjust almost any setting to your liking.\n\nControls are another league of their own. I haven't seen that many games that allow for just "You got a key, button or axis to use? press, jiggle it." That's a very nice feauture, because with the many weapons and construction options at your disposal, controlling that killer ship can become a science of its own.\n\nBut, it's not all sunschine with Gimbal, it actually has one huge flaw. And that's the level cap. First of all there're just a hadful of levels/ranks you can gain: about 4. And as a result you're pretty soon done gaining ranks and earning parts. Which is another downer for Gimbal. Although the hangar is just the thing to use, you soon realise that it's not perfect. There're not enough parts. With a game as Gimbal you want 1000 and more parts, 200+ weapon choices and so one and so one. You don't just want to build fighters. You want to construct a Star Destroyer... Not gonna happen, not allowed.\nTrue, it's a lot of work to creat a game with such options, I won't deny that, but a game like Gimbal needs at least some modding support so players can add their own parts and designs. Without that option its life span is rather short.\n\nOn the other hand, with the low price tag you can't go wrong with Gimbal.\nAll things work just perfect, no bugs, just not enough construction parts in the end.","November 20, 2013","true","21.8"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","43","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AzeTheGreat/recommended/252070/","AzeTheGreat","AzeTheGreat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AzeTheGreat/","181 products in account","This game is an incredible combination of fast paced combat and detailed ship design.\n\nCombat:\nCombat is fun and, at times, thrilling.  Some imbalances exist, especially on the "newb" servers-but there isn't anything that       skill and design can't overcome.  The design of your ships will have a major impact on how you fight.  Build a hulking tank?  You won't be moving much, and will probably need a turret to hit anything.  Build a lightning fast missle boat?  You'll be darting in and out of combat, tactically choosing when to strike, and when to retreat for repairs.  Controls are 100% customisable and never hinder gameplay.\n\nDesign:\nShip design is deep, although slightly restrictive.  You start by choosing an airframe, essentially determining your base stats (a "class" if you will).  Due to some imbalances, the larger airframes are rarely used, but eventually this should be fixed.  On this base you can attach weapons, thrusters, structures, machines, and more.  Realistic(ish) physics mean the interactions between parts and the locations of your thrusters will play very important roles.  Other components are simpler, but still require careful contemplation on how to balance the monetary and spatial constraints, while maximizing combat output.\n\nProgression:\nAs you play you progress through four ranks, increasing your budget with kills and wins, and unlocking new technology each rank up.  Reaching max level is not difficult, and can easily be achieved in a single day-perfect for those with less time to sink, but who still want to compete.  On the other hand, it is possible to reset your rank, gaining "cool points" and rejoining the newbs.  While this provides no tangible advantages, releveling can be quite fun.  You can design ships for every price range, and master flight of the weakest platforms.  Additionally, its sometimes more fun to fight with weak ships than powerhouses, as skill becomes even more important.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe game is currently focused on multiplayer, and suffers because of it.  The lack of players means only 2-3 servers are ever really full and fun.  Fortunately you can add bots to liven the game up when few people are on.  Other than a poor player base multiplayer is a smooth experience.  Hosting is easy, and provides a plethora of options affecting gameplay.  Joining is even easier, especially when connecting to the official servers.\n\nTL;DR:\nHelp us out by buying the game and increasing community size!  If you're still on the fence there's a demo available on the game's website, where you'll also find the forums.","November 25, 2013","true","20.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

The ships are fully customizable. There are many maps and gamemodes to try.\n\nYou start off with $1500T and you earn more by destroying ships. When you reach a certain amount of money you rank up and unlock new parts to build with. Once you hit $6000T you can reset back down (you can only do this once) and after you get past $6000T again you unlock "MasterMind mode". This is where you can have as much money as you can get, there is no cap.\n\nFor now it isn't a very active game, so once you reach mastermind it can get boring, because the bots cap at $6000T and you 1 shot all of them. If anybody is on the servers though (which there is usually at least 2 people on for now) it is a lot more fun.\n\nThe developer listens to everybody, and tries to add in anything that is suggested. There is a very good forum where you can talk about anything in the game. There is a very good community, most people are nice.\n\nThat is pretty much it, I highly recommend the game to anybody.","March 8, 2015","true","502.4"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleSkyHoliday/recommended/252070/","PurpleSkyHoliday","PurpleSkyHoliday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleSkyHoliday/","119 products in account","I honestly Believe this game gets a bad wrap from a fair amount of its players, so there's a few things you'll need to know before you buy.\n\nDon't mistake this game for SPAZ. A lot of the enjoyment from this game will come from building ships. If that's not your thing, This isn't your thing\n\nThe playerbase is quite small, and the game is rather bad at a public competetive setting, anywho. Ensure you have friends who are also interested in the game. For some, there's fun to be had on your own, but I Highly Recommend the 4-pack for friends who are interested. (It's Four for the Price of two, Thats freakin awesome!)\n\nSome people seem to think the game caps out when your ship budget reaches 6000. THIS IS NOT TRUE. On the main menu, once you reach 6000 Trillion, an atom-like Icon will appear, which will allow you to (For lack of a better word) Prestige, and then enter mastermind once you've earned your 6000 back. (Allowing you to continue progessing past 6000 trillion)\n\nThe control scheme is not terrible, you're terrible. I'm not being sarcastic here. The effectiveness of the controls is completely affected by how well-made your ship is and what ship software you use.\n\nDon't forget to rebind everything to WASD! controls are not able to be edited from the main menu, because everything is bound to different parts of the ship, you can edit your controls from the hangar.\nInterested? here's some stuff the game has to offer\nRidiculously Customizable Ships, Ridiculously. Although Ships are required to have a base, They can be expanded upon extremely. Every Functional Part can be bound to a different key if you wish, or the same keys to effect. There are NO restrictions, barring your budget, on what your ship can be composed of.\n\nAn impressive 2D Physics Engine, Including Robocraft-Esque individual Part Damage, Bullets with force that will not only cause recoil, pushing back the firing ship, but also push back the one getting shot. (Machine Gun Boosters!), and all matter of other physics goodies like light ships spinning the hell out when they collide with debris or other ships. (I've built way too many ships that are purely designed on smashing into people, too many)\n\nMore than 4 Different weapon types (I'm looking at you, robocraft) That ensures that Rock-Paper-Scissors matchups never occur. There are a whole manner of weapons, which, in my hours of playing, I've unlocked about 15-20 so far.\n\nA well made trade-off system that intergrates naturally into the games engine, light vehicles are naturally light, heavy vehicles are naturally heavy, and require more thrust to move at speed, heavier thrusters aren't as agile, and thus heavy and light vehicles are formed.\n\nAn array of ship 'software' That allows you to make ships as simple or difficult to master as you like, giving a nice toss up between more guns/armour/boosters/machinery and needing a bit more finesse to control and use your ship effectively, or an easier ride. This includes stuff like stabilizers, which will automatically retro-thrust the rockets on your ship designed for rotating and steering to stop you from spinning once you stop turning, Targeters, which bind to turrets and cause them to follow your mouse, Salvo Modules, which allow you to control whether guns fire all at once or consecutively, and more.\n\nRidiculous antics with friends from ship designs that range from flat out stupid, to almost too effective, to downright maniacal (But probably with a massive weakness)\n\nIf I had to describe this game, I'd note it as a 2D, Top-down space shooter, like SPAZ, but focusing heavily on ship creation and customization, similar to robocraft, but more complex and requiring a bit more consideration, like Kerbal Space Program (Don't Worry, You're already in space, and it's 2D, it's not as hard). And the artstyle is similar to that of FTL. Sprite-Based ships and parts, detailed non-pixelated backgrounds.\n\nHowever, adversely to robocraft, it's system is significantly more in-depth because Gimbal Lacks the Limitations of Robocraft's blocky unity engine. For example, as noted, ship bases can be expanded upon with structural extensions and armour, but also can utilize an array of machinery parts such as the tether gun (Which allows you to attach to another ship, trapping them, or alternatively, tow your teammates to safety), Extenders, which allow parts of the ship to extend and retract at will. Turrets, Which allow parts of the ship to Rotate at will (Mostly for ships that require guns to turn without the rest of the ship, eg, a ship with armour on just one side), Attractors and repulsors, for such antics as firing into your own attractor orbit, causing a circle of bullet doom, and then ramming into another ship, causing them to collide with bullet-based space debris. There are even bolts that allow for segments of the ship to be detonated, for staged ships, such as tanks that, once they've sustained too much damage, can escape with their lives by detonating all of their heavy parts\n\n\nOverall, I've had a ton of fun with this game so far, But it IS really reliant on it's multiplayer elements.\n\nMain Menu GUI: 5/10\n\nIn-Game GUI: 7.5/10\n\nAI ship designs and programming: 7.5/10\n\nMusic: I'm not gonna give this one a score, just take my word for the fact it is really quite average.\n\nCreative Freedom: 9/10\n\nShip Customization: 9.9/10, the 2D nature means it's a bit difficult to attach parts how you want sometimes, but thats a nitpick.\n\nTutorial: 0/10. Just read the top rated steam guide, it may give you a bit of insight into how you setup a ship.\n\nGameplay and shooting:\n7/10 without friends\n9.5/10 with friends\n10/10 With rice\nThanks for your suggestion\n\nOverrall: 9/10, pretty great.","September 27, 2015","true","17.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","4"

It has a number of modes, including death match, team deathmatch, and racing. It has unlocks and progression. It has an appealing art-style and sense of scale to it. Unfortunately, the one thing it does not have is a player base. At this current time, there are nine servers running, with a combined total of twelve players. The best match I could make was a 3v2 team deathmatch, rounded out by bots. A real shame. With a strong player count, I would recommend this.

Steam says ive only played less than an hour but thats not true at all. I played quite a bit on Desura before it hit Steam, and i can easily say its one of my top ten of the whole year with ease. The combat is extremely fun and competitive, The controls are tight and react like you would expect them to off the bat, but once you get into building your ships that can all change. The tiniest tweaks can make or break you and i feel like thats one of the things that makes this game most exciting, being able to make your own creation and test it against others in combat.\nThe music is great, the sound is great, the art style is pleasing to the eye and the effects used mesh with it all greatly. The day i seen this was Greenlit i was extremely excited and waited quite a while. Well it came, and im loving it.\n\nthere really is only ONE thing this game lacks to me. That is a single player Campaign. I would love to see a storyline behind this game, with RPG elements. Something similar to Ring Runner: Flights of the Sages, which is another game like this one mechanics wise that is extremely good.\n\nBetween this game, and Ring Runner: Flight of the sages i think developers can just put this genre up on the shelf, because its going to hard to top them.","December 12, 2013","true","3.2"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

The 2D visuals are very appealing, but offer a welcome retro look reminiscent of space shooters from an earlier gaming era  The similarities end there, however, Gimbal has realistic physics, a large arsenal of guns, thrusters and upgrades, and really allows you to make it whatever game you want to be with different player modes like capture the flag, racing or traditional team vs team combat.\n\nThe most iconic portion of Gimbal is the ship builder.  Depending on your player rank you can build varying strengths of ships.  It's a humbling experience meticulously placing parts onto your deathball just to launch in a game and find that someone else in the community has already thought of something better/stronger.\n\nSome features that I think made this game stand out: tethering to enemy/friendly ships; player controlled +/- gravity fields; ship modules that can control thrusters, aiming and more; stealing enemy ship blueprints after a kill and the well designed ship explosions.  This is a great game for any age that encourages and rewards your creativity.

You have a lot of freedom to create various designs this way, both simple and complex, and thus create your own personalized Fighter - it may be good for long-range bombardment but thus be frail or slow-moving, it may be good for dogfighting, it may be good all-around...

Yes, of course, you can totally screw up too and make a barely functional ship, but doing that and then learning from it is obviously part of the fun!\n\nThe gameplay itself is somewhat simple: You control your own ship and, along with your teammates, battle opposing ships in various game modes. When it comes to the gameplay itself, you move your ship either by keyboard, controller, mouse. Movement and combat are quite difficult at first, especially if you didn't make the best of ships - but thankfully, it is still easy to learn and improve, and you will eventually become an experienced pilot - which is ever so satisfying.\n\nSome important things to note: You can zoom out *a lot*, you can use your radar to detect enemies and allies (teamkills *will* happen), ammo is limited (or you risk making your ship too slow if you overload it with ammo) and a lot of the fighting can be relatively long range, since taking damage is easy - and it cause modules of your ship to fly off, thus, making it harder for you to control it and continue fighting. Obviously, this means that you will be smart to play it safe.\n\nTo summarize gameplay itself, I'd say that, for starters, you should play regular Deathmatch, with loads of bots (due to map size) and that you should use the 3 preset ships available to you at Rank 1. Given that constructing a proper and fully-functional ship can be tricky, this is the best way to learn.\n\nIt is also very important to mention that the game has a progression system, meaning that you will have to grind for a while until you fully unlock all customizable parts *and* increase your Ship Budget (similar to Call of Duty!).\n\nGame modes, from what I recall, are mainly focused around your team and you fighting the opposing one in a simple Team Deathmatch - the kicker, though, is the fact that both teams have large Motherships/Capital ship. Depending on game mode, these are either your target or they are mainly an obstacle to deter you from diving in deep. There are a few more modes, all based around eliminating enemies, their Capital ship or Capturing the perennial flag. There even seems to be a "Race" mode of some description.\n\nWhen hosting a game (online or offline versus the AI) there are a lot of options to tinker around with - the basic being, of course, score limits, respawn timers, as well as more game-specific stuff, like limiting the upper-level of Ship Value or - more interestingly - editing the weapons that the Mothership/Capital has. It is also important to note that the maximum number of players is very high - 64.\n\nThe game has simple but detailed and well-drawn sprites for the ships, as well as very nicely made particles and other assorted effects for ship movement and combat - it is satisfying to watch your ship "drop in" (I assume from hyperspace) and watch it glide into the battlefield, with nice little visual details emphasizing the speed at which it enters - and then later, once you actually start flying it, admiring everything from the thruster and weapon effects to the pretty (but simplistic, it's space after all) backgrounds.\n\nI am not much of a music guy (don't pay much attention to it), but I don't remember anything particularly bad or good about the game's music. The rest of the audio is fine - I'd single out the satisfying sound effects that you can hear from some of the heavier weapons as well as from the destruction of (enemy, heh) ships.\n\nThe game options are fine and you can, of course, customize things like resolution, graphics, audio (note: No Audio Sliders, only a separate On/Off for both Sound and Music).\n\nThe game, unfortunately, has two (related) issues:\n\n1. It lacks players for Multyplayer\n\n2. It lacks a true and long Singleplayer mode to make up for it.\n\nAs it happens with small indie games that don't get exposure (If only someone *cough* TotalBiscuit *cough* had covered it), the playerbase is small or non-existent. The potential to organize a playtime via the Steam forums or something is there, but, still, you can't just jump into the server browser and play a game.\n\nThus, you are left to play versus the AI, which aren't of noteworthy quality. All of this means that, of course, the game doesn't have a lot of time to offer you...\n\nFor the end I'd say that this is a fun little game which is "ruined" by the lack of people to play it with. The aesthetic, graphics and audio are good, the gameplay is challenging and satisfying, the customization is present and very important, like any good Multyplayer game there are a lot of options to make your own personalized game server... But basically all of this is for naught given that you won't have anyone to play it with. As of right now, there are 3 people online!\n\nStill, you can potentially have some fun with it if you just screw around with the bots. It's still really charming and satisfying to glide into the battlefield with your own customized Space Fighter, awkwardly fly around your teammates and try to shoot your enemies - and, as your mighty cannons utterly annihilate a teammate of yours by accident and as the silly AI bots shoot you and destroy your steering modules and/or thrusters, you can then revel in the silence and loneliness as your ship slowly drifts away from the battlefield into the nothingness (since the AI failed to finish you off), thus forcing you to suicide and redeploy. The pretty aesthetic and relaxing, minimal sounds only at to this weird calm feel.\n\nCool game, pick up if you want to screw around with it a bit or if you happen to have 10+ friends ready and willing to revitalize it.","October 17, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I really did.\n\nSo, the basics of the game are as advertised.  Build a ship using a variety of parts (the higher the level, the more you unlock) and fight.\n\nThings break down pretty fast though.  First, there is a cheat to get yourself to maximum level virtually instantly. (Check the Community Hub for details.)  In fact, you apparently need this cheat because any other players out there are also max level, and if you want your ship to be competitive you need the best parts.\n\nSingle player mode (set up your own server and fill it with bots) exists...but really the game is supposed to shine in multiplayer.  The problem is there's no such critter.  There are only a handful of public servers/maps, and the most players I've ever seen on at one time are two.\n\nIn the end, there's no value here.  There are plenty of games out there where you can upgrade your soldier/fighter/spaceship, with a cheaper point of entry, and more players.  Nice idea, but if three months after release (as I write this) the community doesn't exist, it's not going to.","February 18, 2014","false","1.9"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","20","38","0","0"

It's a 2D Top-Down Space Shooter set in the upper atmosphere; as such, you need to deal with manuverability via thrusters, but aerodynamics are still a factor.\nThe game itself is enjoyable, but the real fun comes into the ship building aspect; there are many different ship types, weapons, gear, software and armour to choose from. Want rotating turrets? You can have that. Want to attach yourself to enemy ships so that you can destroy them close up? It's possible.\nThe only real downside is the leveling system; it takes a while to level up (which is the only way to get new parts.) There is also a budget system, which limits how much you can put on it (ship space can also be an issue.)) You increase your budget by killing people in explosive fashion.\nThey could fix this in my opinion by making it easier to level up or simply removing the leveling system and retaining only the budget system, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, the game is very much worth more than the asking price.

The image portion of the file shows a picture of a ship, but the actual data of the ship design used by the game is stored in a custom PNG chunk in the same file.

Multiplayer (the core of the game) is *almost* dead, sometimes there will be 0 players, sometimes there will be 2 or 3, and if you're REALLY lucky there will be 6 people on 1 server.\n\nThe new "Mastermind" patch which removed the money cap for building ships has hurt the game imo. There used to be a strategy behind building ships with the limited funds, but now whoever has the most ingame money wins because they can mount the most guns/armor. Also the servers/game engine cant even support these rediculous unlimited fund ships, the game lags to unplayable levels or sometimes crashes when someone uses an unlimited fund gunship. There NEEDED to be a money cap increase... maybe 2x-3x, but not unlimited. Its also split the few players left... if you are new to the game you have 0 chance against these "Mastermind" players, and the Mastermind players dont play on the money capped servers, so now the player base is even more diluted than it was.\n\n15 dollars is also steep for this game, if you are a good player you will unlock everything in the game in a day or LESS.\n\nHowever, when players are on even ground and you are lucky enough to be on a server with battling players on it, this game is scary fun.","September 9, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also when you destroy someone's ship you get the chance of getting their schematics for the ship which will allow you to use or tweak their design yourself.Another great feature is you can save your designs and import/export them to share with friends or the community they save as simple xml files.To build the ships and get parts you have to earn money which you get from simply playing the game.The physics in the game feel very good, the amount of thrust,pitch,etc matter.There are various weapon systems in the games ranging from rocket,missiles,torpedo's,bombs,lasers,and many sci-fi types.Various shield types and force fields are in the game to.\n\nLike any standard mp only game there are your standard game play modes that you can enjoy, DM,TDM,Cap the flag types.I wouldn't pay $15 for a mp only niche title such as this myself especially since the community can be dead at times and there is lag often depending on the server but the game is worth getting to have mp fun in.It might not be like the old Star wars shooters we all know and love but its a gem in the mp spaceship fighter market for sure, and the devs are active on the game which is a plus.","November 20, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Controls are tight and feel good, WASD and arrow keys can be used to control your ship. You basically construct a vessel and equip it with weapons to attack other players and AI in online combat. Many types of ships can be seen such as laser sniping ships, speedy interceptors, tanky frigates, and many more. However there are very few players online which can make for a lackluster session and max level can be reached very quickly,within 4-6 hours. I would recommend that the developers add larger ship types and maps so you can battle in massive capital ships rather than fights.","June 11, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And, if you're not into ship building, the stock ships work, and you can have fun with them, and if you see a ship you like, you have only to blow it up to get it into your hangar. I suspect this would make for a great LAN game, and the one problem is that there aren't enough people playing. You can sometimes find a server with people on, but never have I seen one full. I reccommend this game in hopes of remedying that, and because I've been having a blast regardless.","January 2, 2014","true","87.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since the game is mostly inclined on multiplayer gameplay the game gets a bit boring just playing with bots but there are a couple servers with players on them. If the game had more players then it would become the perfect ship building game. I still rate it a 10/10 because just how you can make custom ships is really amazing. I hope that the game gets more players soon.","April 27, 2015","true","61.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Needs single-player content.  Nobody plays it multiplayer anymore.\n\nHas occasional performance problems - I experienced this with small ships (not the monster unlimited-budget ships available recently).  Probably related to point-defense targeting on my ship vs. bomb/missile spam as far as I could tell.  Didn't have the patience to diagnose further.\n\nIf you have a dedicated group of friends to play this with, get it.  If you don't, get Reassembly instead - it's similar to this game (design-your-own top-down 2D spaceship-combat-game), but designed for single-player from the ground up.\n\n\nSide note:  The game lets you share ship designs in .PNG images.  The image portion of the file shows a picture of a ship, but the actual data of the ship design used by the game is stored in a custom PNG chunk in the same file.  This is an *utterly brilliant* idea, and the creator gets major props from a fellow game developer for coming up with this.","March 7, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turn the ship(or turrets!) via WASD, Arrow Keys(or any keybinding really...), or install a Control chip that allows the thrusters to auto adjust to face the ship(or turrets!) at your mouse position. You can even set up layers of different chips to have semi-automated targeting and firing systems for your turrets. This is just the tip of the iceburg in terms of ship customizability.\nAnd after achieving the "Mastermind" rank, you can begin building a budget level so you can literally build any size or geared up ship you want.\n\nDefinite recommend.","January 1","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game modes are meant to be played cooperatively, but there's noone to cooperate with. Most older players just build and showcase their "awesome" ships... and that's all. I've had fun playing FFA against friends and learning how to build effective ships, but that's just not good enough for a commercial game.\n\nI'll say "yes" for now, but if it stays like that, I'll switch to "no" later.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe ship building system does give lots of design freedom, but if you want your ship to be effective in combat, you HAVE to use certain parts in a certain ways. Parts need to be rebalanced for this to become less of a toy and more of a game. There's this "autoaim" module that is too good for its price - ships with fixed weapons or manually mouse targeted weapons are strictly worse. It seems the "aiming" is done server-side too, which amplifies the importance of "autoaim".\n\nSwitching to "no", hoping for a miraculous update that will bring the game back to life.","January 4","false","35.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
