The multiplayer review can be seen on the video and it also covers visual and functional part of the game, it can be found at the bottom of this review :-)\n\nNow, I haven‚Äôt played the first Trapped Dead, so I can‚Äôt really compare, altough I have looked at the reviews both on Steam and by external sites and authors. It did not received very good scores, mainly due to being buggy beyond an acceptable point, and generaly awful gameplay. I was curious if anything of the above has gotten better with the sequel.\n\nNow I will say this right from the start, it might be better than the first, but it still seriously lacks. The first one was apparently very buggy, and this trend mildly continues, the bugs were random, but there were many. In singleplayer I had some weird issues with my inventory (items that I had before, dissappearing on death and returning to checkpoint), and in multiplayer we experienced horrible missplacement issues, crashing, invisible zombies and as you could have seen in the video, I get stuck in a warehouse unable to progress at one point. This forced us to play this for the second time and switch hosts.\n\nThe game did receive a big update after we played it for the multiplayer review and I went in to see if stuff got fixed or what was that update about ‚Äî I have no clue, since the item problems still happen for me, and I had one game crash happen.\n\nVisually it‚Äôs ‚Äúalright‚Äù. There are definitely prettier games, but to what it is (isometric ‚Äú3D‚Äù rpg game) I have to say that it‚Äôs absolutely enough and the game doesn‚Äôt do bad with this,.\n\nThe UI on the other hand is something absolutely horrible and I hate it. It‚Äôs clunky, the game doesn‚Äôt pause when you go into inventory/etc. And the whole thing is just really hard to figure out and use, since there‚Äôs buttons that totally don‚Äôt look like buttons (skill points) and the game is using ‚Äúapply‚Äù in several parts of the UI which makes me totally forget to push it every time, since I‚Äôd not expect a feature like that.\n\nSpeaking of skill points and such, this game is supposed to have RPG features, and I can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôd be enjoying them. Character progression felt boring, nothing new or innovative, due to the UI complications it‚Äôs really hard to give attention to it anyway and the overall game just felt more like an action adventure zombie slasher whith annoying rpg features.\n\nStory by it self is like a B-rated movie and you shouldn‚Äôt expect a plot worth your brain cells,. Literally, if you‚Äôre going to play this game, just expect nothing, turn your brain off, and go hack&slash some zombies. On the other hand if you do enjoy B-Rated movies, it might appeal to you a lot.\n\nThe good part of the story is the voice acting, which is funny and adds a little humour to the game, altough sometimes I feel like the characters are talking for way too long, thankfully you can skip it. Soundtrack on the other hand is absolutely generic, can‚Äôt recall any track to be stuck in my head and I believe it‚Äôs 85% just ambience noise.\n\nI was starting to be annoyed roughly two hours into the game, level design felt like it‚Äôs intentionally slowing me down, bugs, no great story, just killing zombies all the time, with weapons that go down with durability faster than you blink and a skill system so weird that you‚Äôll end up using bare fists just to not have to go into the inventory all the time. I saw about 3-4 boss fights and.. the store page claims ‚ÄúDiverse enemies and boss..‚Äù. That is so not true, the 4 bosses I encountered looked almost the same and acted roughly the same. That is just killing the game as well, and only adding to the annoying repetitiveness, not even talking about the repeating quests and game mechanics (‚Äúplace explosive here‚Äù).\n\nI did had some laughs when playing it with my buddy Brandon Dayton, and I think the main selling point of this game is definitely the co-op multiplayer (so the developer better fix the issues lol) and playing this in singleplayer is just plain not worth it.\n\nFor me this game has almost no replayability, and I will probably not be coming back to it, only if things get better (fixing the god damn UI & bugs would be enough for me to clench my teeth). It would make a good game for an iPad, as I recall having some similar games installed on it, so I could play it in the subway.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a fan of the first one (despite all the bad about it) you‚Äôll probably get this regardless of my review, and that‚Äôs ok, after all its just my point of view, but I feel like it doesn‚Äôt introduce much new to the series (based on my research), apart from not being tactical but a hack&slash. And with this price tag, I just have to say to everyone else.. don‚Äôt buy it. Just don‚Äôt. Wait for a sale, or a bundle to include it if you want it, because you‚Äôll regret spending 20 bucks.\n\n*According to an official, this game has nothing to do with the first Trapped Dead, only the name...*\n\nPros\n(+) Cool voice acting\n(+) Zombies (seriously, this is enough for most people)\n(+) Co-op campaign for up to 4 players\n(+) Multi-platform (OS equality ftw), also XBOX ONE and PS4\n\nCons\n(-) BUGS, sometimes game-breaking bugs, this really shouldn‚Äôt be happening..\n(-) B-Movie story with typical zombie clich√©s\n(-) Multiplayer issues, missplacement, latency, etc.\n(-) Generic RPG features, that more annoy than excite\n(-) Level design is gonna make you go zig-zag all the time, ehh\n(-) Whole game feels very REPETITIVE\n(-) HORRIBLE UI DESIGN\n(-) PRICE\n\nMULTIPLAYER REVIEW\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iFZTwBDR4SE\n\nThank you for reading/watching this review, hope you liked it and it helped you decide.

If you like diablo, torchlight, van helsing, etc... you should like this game, as the actual gameplay is similar to those games. The story revolves around zombies! Tons of loot, can equip different armors and weapons which changes your appearance, level progression is more old school, (you not only have a skill tree but also level up stats), multiple characters to play as, multiple difficulties, and, although nothing mind blowing, a cool story.\n\nI applaud the devs for including gamepad support in an iso arpg, which used to be rare for these games to have on pc, so thank you for helping make a m/k arpg a thing of the past.\n\nI also really dig the voice acting, it is very good for a budget title. The graphics are what I expected from a game I paid less than $20 for.\n\nIf you like iso arpgs you cannot go wrong with Trapped Dead: Lockdown. I highly recommend people that like the genre to buy this game...NOW! Its a steal at its current price.

A DIABLO, VAN HELSING style hack and slash action rpg in a modern setting with grim ambience of BLOOD and the first POSTAL where death is everywhere.\n\nYou can choose between several characters who each are really well voice acted. You will be able to level up attributes and skills personalizing your character by putting level up points in these areas. Characters are varied with some being able to use guns while others like the Priest relying on melee and spiritual powers to destroy flesh feasting fiends unleashed upon the world.\n\nMusic sets the tone perfectly with its dark all enveloping quality as if the world had been transformed into a unending morgue of sorrow and sanity destroying horror.\n\nGraphics are gorey and surreal in their unescapable nightmare visuals. Environments look very nice with a comfortable amount of interaction. Your characters are displayed well though you cant zoom in and out. There is a great rag doll inventory system where you can equip weapons and armor which will change the physical appearance of your character ingame.\n\nGameplay has just the right amount of balanced movement and weapons fire where actions take the proper amount of time to do without being too fast or too slow unlike the first game in the series where the combat and movement felt very frustrating and clumsy. Your character can heal up by consuming food and things like holy water. There are also edible items which will give you temporary boost benefits to your skills.\n\nTRAPPED DEAD: LOCKDOWN buy it!

The dialogue, scenery, and characters are all cartoonish without being cartoony.  The combat is fun, franetic, and delightfully gory, yet  requires some tactical considerations, not simple button mashing. I can't tell you if you'll like it, but I can tell you that the very first time I played it, i played it for 3 hours straight.\n\nSome reviewers have said they don't like the art, but i think the simple style of the art lends a brutish and savage aesthetic and works here.  It's not bad art. It's merely a simplified style and, I believe, it adds to the game's tone and vision.\n\nToday Trapped Dead lock-down patched the broken controller issue.  They have thus responded to complaints, owned their mistake, and repaired it.  For that reason I have changed my recommendation to the thumbs up I would originally have awarded the game.\n\nI remain concerned about the unresponsiveness of the developer, a concern that originally garnered a thumbs down review from me.  True they have just today patched the problem with the controller, but the parties involved remain mute here at Steam.  They haven't even announced the game has been patched or what the patch repaired.  If I hadn't actually seen the game being updated when I signed in today, I would have gone one believing the game was broken.  As it stands it's anybody's guess whether other issues complained about in the forums have been fixed at all.\n\nIn my original review I wrote that "The silence displayed by the development group and the publisher hint at best a disregard for the player's experience."   It's since occured to me that they may simply be inept or inexpert at communitcating with their customers and would-be customers.  Whatever the reason, silence is a poor practice in a community as vocal as Steam's.\n\nIf you have problems, after complaining on the forums, then let me recommend you do as I did and contact their support team directly.  Like me you may get an e-mail saying that the developers have been informed.  Hopefully, unlike me, you'll get a confirmation once the fix is in place too.","May 14, 2015","true","12.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","2"

The gameplay was monotonous, the UI clunky, the enemy AI seemed to have trouble pathfinding toward the player, and bugs/crashes were rampant. While the RPG-style leveling, skills, and gear kept hardcore fans of the genre engaged, many people weren‚Äôt satisfied with the amount of entertainment offered. There are plenty of games that performed the same functions a lot better. When a second installment was announced, the collective reaction was mostly one of surprise. How could this game possibly merit a second release? Was a lesson taken from poor reception of the original? They did give the sequel to a different developer, so all hope is not lost. Let‚Äôs find out as we take a deeper look at Trapped Dead: Lockdown.\n\nThe graphics and music do work rather well, and are a notable improvement over the last game. I enjoy that the various equipment you find shows up on characters, and that the various character classes are only able to equip certain types of equipment. The skill trees are different between the classes and so the replayability is actually pretty decent. Unfortunately, most characters will follow the same quest line, which mostly consists of the usual go-here or fetch-this. It isn‚Äôt really conducive to any sort of lasting engagement and even with your screen spattered with gore, you may find yourself pretty disengaged. The combat is extremely straight-forward and doesn‚Äôt really offer anything different than the previous installment. Hopping online and bashing zombies with your buddy is a good time, but could be made a lot more enjoyable if combat and questing was made more engaging.\n\nThe levels stay varied, which is appreciated. Going from a prison to a swamp to the sewers does make you want to continue and see what‚Äôs next. This want is complicated by the clunky UI, which you will need to navigate to find explosives needed to get past certain obstacles. Pressing escape and clicking in equipment/skills simply isn‚Äôt sufficient. Implementing a hotkey would go a long way in making this game feel more playable. Bugs and crashes aren‚Äôt as prominent as they were in the last game, but they are still there. My recording session was ground to a halt when my friend and I discovered that a certain set of explosives needed to progress deeper into the sewer wasn‚Äôt anywhere to be found in our bags. There were latency issues during multiplayer, which is one of the main selling points of this game. If things aren‚Äôt cleaned up considerably, I predict this game falling into obscurity like the previous one.\n\nDid Trapped Dead deserve a sequel? Maybe. But to me this feels more like something that should have been free DLC. The core mechanics of the game are average at best and have not changed significantly since the last installment. The skills are difficult to assign and makes the skill tree feel a bit arbitrary. The story is engaging, but only because it makes you feel like you are living out a zombie B-movie. Enemy AI seems to be slightly improved, along with less bugs and crashes, but it still isn‚Äôt up to par for a game being released in 2015. If you enjoy action-adventure games and/or beat-em-ups you should give this game a shot, but overall I found the experience to be average at best and frustrating at worst. Trapped Dead Lockdown certainly doesn‚Äôt live up to the hopes of fans of the original, and people being newly introduced to the series will probably find it far too generic. A nice attempt, but better luck next time.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 3/10\nFun Factor- 7/10\nDifficulty- 5/10\nReplayability- 4/10\nInnovation- 3/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 6/10\nMusic- 5/10\nSound FX- 7/10\nStory/Lore- 6/10\nLevel Design- 5/10\n\nFinal Score: 51/100 for graphics, voice-acting, and fun factor.\nSummary: Zombie RPG beat-em-up, complete with currency, loot, and skill system.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-trapped-dead-lockdown/\nFull review video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEOo5B-diqs","March 20, 2015","false","2.7"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","20","38","0","2"

For that price it is okay. I have to mention though that I've been playing games with similar graphics 20 years ago on my Amiga 500. There's like 6 classes, the description says that  alone 3 of them were good at both, melee and using guns. So I don't know why there's so many classes. At the vendor however you can purchase guns that are just crossed out. So your character can't use them. What it does not show, which class you have to play to use eg. the Katana. The menu for the equipment and the statpoints is ugly. I tried to connect to multiplayer games several times with no success. It is not possible to join a multiplayergame or host one so somebody could join you.\nAlthough it is stated in the game description. Seems to be some bug. For the price of 20 Euro I can not recommend this game. That is totally overpriced. There's many free 2 play games that do a lot of stuff better. Or old games that are available for free nowadays.

The graphics as well don‚Äôt really stand out and often times were muddy and not close to modern standards. Characters often enough talk for way to long forcing you to have to skip over each box of dialog while the games soundtrack continues to drone on throughout the game never being memorable for even a second.\n\nWhat should save the game though is its game play but we already know that it doesn‚Äôt. Trapped Dead Lockdown tries to play like your typical hack and slash RPG similar to the Torchlight and Diablos of the world. Instead we get something that tries to do that and instead turns into delayed reactions and being swarmed by guys. When you attempt to attack there is a delay on that and it later in the game turns into a luck based battle on if your attacks will hit. Throw in multiple enemies and you better hope your guy hits them all or that you have health packs.\n\nLevel designs are another nightmare. Thankfully the mini-map provided is absolutely no help what so ever. Buildings turn into just room after room and everything one tends to look the same, prisons are just long hallways that make little sense. Going outside is just dark textures for long stretches. You‚Äôll often see texture glitches and spaces black out into nothing. I saw NPC‚Äôs as well stand still and glitch out making quests they had unobtainable.\n\nEven something as simple as the loot and leveling up system I found lackluster. The majority of the loot I found was always close to the same or similar items I had and were always junk. Once I leveled up I never really saw a vast improvement or felt like my character was being the unstoppable killing machines the way that better games of this genre do.\n\nOverall I found very little entertainment coming from this game. It could have been a lot better but instead felt like it was underdone in every category and in a genre where there are several games that leagues above this I just can‚Äôt recommend this one above others.\n\n\n\nScore :\n\n1/10\n\nhttp://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/03/29/trapped-dead-lockdown-review/","May 31, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Thoughts of the original game colored my impression of this for quite a while, however about 8 levels in I realised I was really enjoying myself and found it hard to put down. Sure it's got some flaws: the movie compression is ugly, the voice acting is terrible (and I hardly ever think that even when everyone else goes), the storyline is incomplete and meandering and references events and details which were never previously discussed, NPCs are completely unrealistic, but you don't come to this game for the story. The action is fun and that's what counts. Gameplay wise, I don't think I'd play this multiple times to unlock all the achievements with multiple classes, and there's probably too much inventory juggling, but apart from that it's a good blast. Don't expect some wonderful polished experience like Shadowgrounds, this is not that good, but it's not garbage like the first Trapped Dead either. Pick this up on sale and it's a good buy.","December 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'll not cut my opinions short because of you lazy asses.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nIt's been pretty hard for me to decide how to grade Trapped Dead: Lockdown. By today's gaming standards, game would certainly be thumbs down title. But then again, screw the standards and let's see if I had some fun. Judging by that thumps pointing up, I guess I did.\n\nMaybe, just maybe you'll remember Trapped Dead, isometric tactical Commandos-went-George Romero game that was really interesting, but had a plaguing problems concerning bugs and bad camera positioning. I really wanted to play that game, but every single time when I've launched it, I went berserk over camera and getting stuck in the rooms whil trying to sneak my way around numerous zombies.\n\nTrapped Down: Lockdown isn't really a sequel per se, but another chapter in Trapped Dead universe. Here we have action hack-n-slash RPG that doesn't really ask of you to be subtle nor gentle... minutes after you're in game, it goes Evil Dead / Braindead on you.\n\nYou can choose between several classes which don't really differ way too much, but they let you play with their specific weapons and items and define your gameplay style that way. My favourite - butcher. Think Barbarian.\n\nStory is horrendous (in a perfect way), missions are linear and if you're an achievement hunter you're gonna have some nice time searching all over the game areas for that one zombie you need to kill to unlock that shiny medal...\n\nI do recommend this game, but it's a must for me to be specific about to whom I recommend it to. This is a game for everyone ready to dwelve into late 90's/early 00's hack'n'slash madness, not too sensitive or demanding concerning the richness of gameplay/storytelling.\n\nIf Trapped Down: Lockdown was released back in that period, it would be hidden and obscure classic (read: something that generation of gamers that are now nearing their 30s played in their high school days and loved it immensely, although they don't know why) - it has every single element of it. Atmosphere is great. Hacking is overwhelming. You get to upgrade your character, pick those sweet fruits of skill tree and create one unstoppable killing machine.\n\nCharacters you're about to meet are legendary bad (think car salesman Republican that minutes after finding out his daughter died sends you out to get him some appliances so he can make more money. Or a crazy floating witch. Or mad scientists. Or... oh my, there's bunch of them and you'll love to laugh your way through this game).\n\nLocations look fairly similar to those from the first Trapped Dead game and if you've played it, you'll feel like gone back home. Bosses are weak points of the game since they're nothing more than upgraded versions of regular zombies, but they shine smokey-blue and you can't deny the satisfaction of murdering them in cold blood.\n\nTrapped Dead: Lockdown also offers multiplayer co-op game, but I highly doubt you'll need to play this one with your friends - you'll have five classes to work out with in case you really decide to play again after you beat the game with one of your characters. Linear nature of game missions (go down the street, kill everything that moves, talk to NPC, do his bidding, kill everyone, continue after NPC said mission is complete...) doesn't really help with game replayability.\n\nLet's be honest, Trapped Dead: Lockdown looks cheap and feels cheap (those unbelievable 'bloody' fonts are hurting my eyes and are bad design decision). It is also retro enough to remind you of playing silly games like Blood or Flesh Feast (please, can anyone remember Flesh Feast or am I the only one brought up on this horrendous craziness). It's basically one of those weekend games - you get 'em on No-Clue-What-To-Play Saturday and you're done with 'em on Evening-Before-School-or-Work Sunday. But those hours playing, if you're not too demanding can be pretty fun.","March 21, 2015","true","6.1"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","14","30","2","0"
