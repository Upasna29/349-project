(At the Beginning in the Middleeast, so dont expect anything unique here)\nAs in many other Strategy Games you can either select all or only certain units, you can also produce new Units in your Base and send them across the Maps and into Battle.\n\nThe Battlesystem is a little boring. When you "attack" someone, all you see are Units standing in each other, while the health stats are slowy changing.  I doubt that anyone would be able to enjoy this for a longer time.\n\nThe Animations, Graphics, Sounds and Gameplay as mentioned are very basic, and the Game feels like it was  originally created for Mobile devices.\nThe Mouse Movement  is a little sluggish.\n\nAs positive aspect is to say that there is a detailed and helpful tutorial.\n\nOverall it feels very low budget.\n\nI would say when you like Mobile Ports you can pick this up for ~$1 on sale, otherwise you wont miss anything if you just skip this Game completly.","February 8, 2015","false","6.1"," 474 of 586 people (81%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","81","474","586","31","45"

So I gave it a second chance, and a third, maybe even a fourth. I plowed through the tutorials and got to the more in depth scenarios. I am now kind of hooked on this game, even though it's not really what I expected.\n\nThis game is simple in some ways, yet deceivingly so. All of the units have the same strength, but have varying costs, speed of movement and utility. There aren't that many unit types, although the game doesn't feel like it's missing anything critical. Air, land and sea are all represented. There's no fog of war, no base building, and the economy doesn't need to be managed. It's definitely not a typical RTS in that sense.\n\nI think I hated it at first becuase I was expecting another RTS. A typical RTS. I couldn't get past the fact that one tank unit and fighter jet unit are worth exactly the same once in combat. I couldn't get by the the interface and control scheme being unique. And I certainly couldn't get by the fact that there are no special abilities, rank ups, or customization options. I'm glad I plowed through and looked past my expectations.\n\nThis game rewards thinking ahead, the dance of tactics. It doesn't require you to click a thousand times a minute. Any ruses or strategems you create are entirely based on what you do and decide, not what some simulated fog of war or magic ability button says happens.\n\nIf you take two units and feint east, what happens? What if your opposing player doesn't even notice? Or what if he does and guesses what you're really up to? Even the AI feints and doubles back in this game.\n\nThis type of situation and depth is part and parcel to this game, all while giving the player the option to play the game their way. The game doesn't force you to use Air units. It doesn't force you to use Tanks. By all means kick out a hundred infantry in a massive stack and just plow straight ahead. A smart player will trounce you if you do, but that's the beauty of a game that rewards tactics over click fests, and has unit strength parity at all times.\n\nReally all I can say is give this game a shot. Considering the price point it really delivers. Just try to get past the tutorials. The game gets alot better.\n\nTL;DR\n\nHas strategic depth without tomfoolery or magic abilities, simple controls and units while remaining versatile, no clickfest! A real gem for the price.\n\n\n","January 13, 2015","true","10.6"," 220 of 263 people (84%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","84","220","263","15","2"

Unfortunately there appear to be a limited number of scenarios but it's not bad overall. However I do have some difficulty recommending at even this price point simply because in many ways it is extremely simple.\n\nNow that I've had  alittle more time to fiddle with it:\n\nPros:\n- A nice simple version of Risk (as I'm sure you noted, also a con). Units have the same strength but do move at different speeds. Easy to understand and really reduces things to how well you can strategically/tactically manage things.\n- The AI isn't that bad.\n- Each scenario is fairly unique (in terms of what you need to accomplish and under what constraints).\n- Game does an excellent job of explaining what everthing does and how you need to do it piece by piece (each of the early scenarios introduce something new and how to use it).\n\nCons:\n- A nice simple version of Risk (as I'm sure you noted, also a pro). As all units have the same strength there isn't a ton of variety in what you see scenario to scenario.\n- There are a few minor bugs I've noticed (it seems to love to minimize when I click things).\n- The UI is a bit clunky and a little bit of work could have streamlined it considerably (you have to click on individual barracks/airbases/etc to generate units). Essentially you have to go to each place to build something new (although there isn't a ton of new unit generation - at least early on) which involves going to each city, finding the barracks/airbase/etc around the city, then clicking on what unit you want to build rather than from a nice menu.\n- It's all scenarios, I assume they run out at some point but no global conquest type thing that I've seen.\n\nI'll update it a bit more as I can accross other items of note.","January 12, 2015","false","1.8"," 210 of 262 people (80%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","80","210","262","8","2"

Personally, I cannot speak to the validity of these claims, but I've seen this statement more than once. If true, this would call into question many of the positive reviews for this title, as it artificially inflates its appeal. I would only advise potential buyers to do their homework before handing over their money.\n+ Advancement of time is visually represented by the orbit of Earth, and showcases a competent day/night cycle; time can also be advanced by 12 or 24 hours at the player's whim\n+ Selecting from within stacks is practically implemented, in which individual units are cycled through the stack; this makes it easy to see what is selected and what will remain\n+ Interesting and minimalist design; overall, the presentation feels unique and aesthetically pleasing\n+ Soundtrack offers a selection of quirky and enjoyable tracks; lends the game a more casual feel\n+ Cloud cover is visible, and can often be quite disorienting; lends a small, precious facet of realism that the game otherwise lacks entirely\n+ Tutorial is comprehensive and helpful; more than adequate at walking the player through the nuances of gameplay\n\n- Defense bonuses feel inadequate, and are relegated only to cities, of which there are precious few\n- Unit variety is absolutely horrid; there is essentially one or two unit types for each arm of military (one type of infantry, one type of tank, three types of ship, two types of plane, for every faction)\n- Multiplayer appears underpopulated\n- All factions are absolutely identical; no distinctive units, advantages, or distinguishing traits, whatsoever\n- No terrain - or artificial - features to exploit; all terrain is essentially flat and featureless, having no bearing on movement or combat\n- Only deciding factor in battles is number stacks, regardless of force composition; if you have more units in your stack, you will win provided they cannot reinforce in time\n- No option of tactical withdrawl; once forces are committed to a battle, they automatically fight to the death, and the player is helpless after the fact\n- All units boast the same representitive strength; one infantry unit measures up, identically, to a tank or plane unit\n- Things like maneuvering, reconnaissance, logistics, etc. are all completely nonexistant\n- No resources to speak of\n- Battle mechanics are overly simplistic; on the whole, the strategy and combat is not very stimulating\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please follow my curator page.

Any claims this game makes to realism is generous, and the reviews were carefully chosen.  It's mixed Metacritic rating is closer to the mark.\n\nIn 'War..', you control one side battling one or more enemy sides.  At your command is infantry, armored, fighters, bombers, carriers, battle fleets, transports and nukes.  And that's it.  With the exception of the nukes, everything has the same number of hit points, and other then a few minor tricks (aircraft in a battle don't take damage until all friendly land or sea units are destroyed, or transports and carriers don't do damage in naval battles), each one fights the same.   Take Risk, toss in a little Rock Paper Scissors, and you have this game.\n\nYou can buy new units to help your conquest, but the interface for this is a bit unfriendly, and building up the money to reach that point can take awhile.\n\n'War' boasts some 20 odd scenarios, 3 of which make up a crash-course tutorial.   The tutorial doesn't necessarily end there however, and will constantly interrupt your battles with well meaning advice.  Incidentally, completing one part of this tutorial and advancing by a full day in game uses the same key (space bar), so if you press space too many times trying to shut the tutorial up your enemy is going to take advantage.   You CAN turn the tutorial off, but since it's trying to help you and you're obstensibly a new player, is that wise?\n\nThe scenarios range from realistic (US counterinvasion of Kuwait, China vs. Taiwan) to unlikely (Britain vs. Zimbabwe over South Africa, China vs. Russia and Japan).  There's a World War scenario I didn't try, as well as Global Domination.  From YouTube videos it looks like the last is more of a sandbox game with multiple AI factions.\n\nThe description boasts of the game using a spherical globe.  It does, and this is actually a pretty nice touch, but it's just not enough to save this game.  It's a little too simplistic (though a decent AI), parts of the interface (like building units) is God awful, and memorizing its peculiar combat rules (what will attack what) isn't worth it.\n\nStill, the game isn't unfixable.  Fix the interface somewhat, maybe either add some more units or make the combat a little more engaging, and make a number of more realistic scenarios (or even giving players the chance to mod in their own scenarios) and you could have a fun little game here.  Not one a wargamer can take seriously, but a way to pass a few hours.\n\nRight this second however, you can spend your gaming dollars more effectively elsewhere.","January 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 128 of 187 people (68%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","68","128","187","16","3"

On one hand, it's a cross between RISK (without the cards), DEFCON, and an RTS...all three of which appeal to me.  On the other, the controls take some getting used to.  For one, there's no way to create a selection box...instead, you click and hold the left mouse button and drag over the units you want to select.  There's also no way to build units without first finding and clicking the appropriate structure on the map...C&C and other RTSs have since graduated from that way of thinking with separate production menus tabbed by unit class appropriately.  There's also no skirmish that I can find, just premade scenarios with no indication as to their difficulty.  All of these things have the potential to frustrate new players as they did me.  Combat is simplistic (you watch them fight with no direct control over anything once the opposing forces overlap) and the units types just aren't varied enough to make a difference.\n\nOverall, I neither like or dislike this game...it's just "OKAY".  Despite all of the above issues, I do find it to be intriguing and strategic when I find a scenario setup that appeals to me.  With that said, I wouldn't pay $10 for it, knowing what I know now.  Give me difficulty settings, implement a skirmish mode with custom setup options, and make the interface/controls more user-friendly, and I'll be happy to revisit the game and possibly give it a positive recommend.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7o50xhFkZg","January 16, 2015","false","1.3"," 54 of 78 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","54","78","4","0"

Numbers were everything: toss 2 infantry units against a single tank battalion and the tanks will just stand there, locked in combat and eventually die from simply being outnumbered.\n\nAfter some time I realized that was the entire point. The particularities of combat made for deep and very engaging strategic play and every unit as specific strategic usage. While some part of me feels like it's oversimplifying a bit too much, I think that's more of a personal fault than one of the game itself.\n\nOh and the controls may feel a bit awkward at first but you'll get used to it.\n\nAnother thing of note: in both my PCs the game started on a tiny little window with a good chunk of it cropped.

Henry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/munkelschmunkel/","81 products in account","The Gameplay:So, with  War, the Game one gets the basic RTS package, with the twist of your map being the entire earth and you having the topdown view on a sphere instead of the obligatory 2d map. Unlike many other games of this genre, War, the Game does not offer a main story-line, but instead various scenario missions - some also in multiplayer - which will reward you with a certain amount of stars when you fulfill specific extra conditions (these may vary from the time you required to the amount of money you spent etc.)\nAlso unlike many other RTS games, this game offers no possibility of base-building, and does not give all players the same starting conditions:\nIn the game you take control over one of the Earth's many nations, controlling their cities and armies. Cities have a certain income (I couldn't really figure out a pattern - for example Sydney with 4.6 million inhabitants generates 8 billion $/year, whilst Munich with 1.4 million inhabitants generates 16 billion $/year), so when you start with a great or a rich nation, you automatically have a headstart since your income over time and your starting army differs from other's. In multiplayer missions this leads to great imbalance (America for example has 14 starting cities (with a total income of  137.8 billion $/year)- all of them providing buildings that allow the creation of units - whilst Australia is stuck with 2  (with a total income of 16 billion $/year) ).\nThere are five building types, which are all preset, which takes away a great amount of flexibility and individual strategy since one usually has to resign to one of the very few tactics that always seem to work out fine.\nIn multiplayer getting to a lategame stage could get very interesting for sure, but the problem is that the game is very slow paced, resulting in the multiplayer games dragging on for hours - and without the option to save it's very hard to pull off a full game.\nNow in singleplayer you can for one speed up the time and also save, but this mode really suffers from it's nonexistant versatility -> most of the missions have one and only one way to be beaten, whilst in the large scheme world wars the AI always goes back to their one strategy, making the game very monotonous.\nThe gameplay itself also is very basic, there are seven unit types:\nInfantry, armor, jets, bombers, battleships, transporters and carriers. Now whilst all of these have their little twists about them, they all share the same firepower, resulting in the battles strategically devolving into 'Who can send more troops?'.\nNow since the fighting is based around this strategy, the game's early stage is basically building units into a massive stack and waiting for money to be able to build more units to throw onto that massive stack.\n\nPro:\nSpherical map\nHilarious unit stacks (that reach the moon)\nAmazing soundtrack\nContra:\nMonotonous (It's basically always "CONQUER X!")\nInflexible\nUnbalanced\nHilarious unit stacks (that reach the moon)\nVery slow paced\nNo saving in multiplayer\n\nSummary:\nOverall I give the game a 3.5/10 - for it offers no more than any other RTS game, has poor amount of\ncontent and thus gets stale very fast in addition to it suffering from too slow gameplay.\n","January 20","false","10.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","1"

If you are looking for traditional base building, resource gathering, and specialized counter units, you should look elsewhere. This game is very simple and easy to learn the basics, but difficult ot master. Only 2 ground unit types, 2 air, and 2 sea. Each is 100% equal in strength to the other, so a $3.5B Bomber will be on equal footing with a $1B infantry unit. Once a battle starts there's not really much you can do to affect the outcome other than throw more units in. The key to this game is maneuvering. If an enemy is more poweful than you, the only way to win is to find where he's exposed and use faster, more expensive units, to go around their stronger forces to capture cities and hurt their economy, or attack isolated units before their main force catches up to whittle him down. I promise every single scenario is beatable if you find the right strategy.\n\nPROS\nVery unique\nVery simple yet still challenging\nPretty good value, especially if on sale\nMultiplayer\n\nCONS\nHonestly won't be very fun until you get to the large scale scenarios, which can take a while\nNo campaign\nMultiplayer never has anyone on it\n\nVery underrated game.

The engine is just not strong enough to support the variety of options it gives you. i had just launched the largest invasion every made against China, and i crashed. theres no autosave mind you, and i dont really want to open up options, saves, new save, a whole buncho BS because a game cant handle what it was meant to. I really wanted to give this a 10/10,  but i cannot reccomend this untill they up the limit a bit more. 7/10","January 17, 2015","false","4.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

I don't write reviews very often, but this game is an exception. War, The Game is a very simple yet extremely fun game to play. Controls are able to be learned within 15-20 minutes of game time. It's full of all kinds of scenarios such as operations in the Middle East, an all out war in Europe (You may also pick an ally.) , and a fight for the United States. Of course, this is just scratching the surface to all of the scenarios. The game also features a very unique 3D model of the earth as you fight, so your troops, navy, and aircraft can travel as they would in the real world. Overall, the game is just amazing. I greatly recommend this title. Enjoy, everybody.\n\nNOTE: There have also been accusations in the past saying the owner was giving out free keys to write a positive review. I would like to say that this is false. I wrote this review because I honestly love every bit of it. I have nearly 100 hours, and I can expect hundreds more in the future. I would also like to add that the owner was giving out free keys at the completion of the game. (Which is NOT easy.)  Not if somebody wrote a positive review. Anyway!

The globe design makes for an innovative and realistic experience but then again in other aspects it falls very short, such as the lack of terrain effects on movement (an obvious thing that would immediatly make the game more interesting and engaging), no artillery or long range missiles (bar for the very underwhelming nuclear bomb which isnt very nuclear). There's no reason why this game couldn't be fleshed out much more than it is. While I enjoy many of the levels, some of them seem more based on racing against the AI than actual strategy, particularly when it comes to endless stacking of units.\n\nWith the Falkands mission, I was able to glitch win by simply having my fighters engage and withdraw from battle over and over until the enemy got worn down. It's a noble project no doubt but it might have been better to focus on quality over quanitity and perhaps scale things down to a more compact but more interesting theatre of war, a perfect example would have been the Ukraine crisis, with more fleshed out units, options, strategy and a better overall experience. See Vietnam 65 as a great example of a game playing to its strengths.\n\nPros:\n\nInnovative idea, particularly having to naviate units around the curviture of theglobe makes it interesting\n\nHas 'potential'\n\n\nCons:\n\nUnfocused at times\n\nSometimes strategy takes a back seat over unit stacking or achieving what are ultimately linear objectives\n\nThe game somehow feels unbalanced at times, normally with the AI at a distinct advantage\n\nLack of what could have been nice additional details, effects of terrain, national border violations (more geopolitics)\n\nThe ally system on some levels is really basic and can take away from immersion.\n\n\n\n","July 15, 2015","false","14.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There is no strategy beyond that, there is no way to utilize terrain, unit composition or clever maneuvering to gain an advantage, making the game quite dull. This could change if they could introduce elements such as morale, training, military doctrine or technology to make things interesting, but I don't know if they have any plans to to that. Even Defcon, with incredibly simple units that perform exactly the same for every player, made combat far more engaging because unit position and strategy still mattered.\n\nI don't even really dislike this game, to be honest, it just feels incomplete and unsatisfying.","August 13, 2015","false","1.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","1"

The effort put into the game is there, but it just feels like it is missing some elements that make a good strategy game. for example, you can win a battle just by creating a massive horde of units and just go from base to base killing everything in your path.\n\n\nFor personal reasons i give this game a 6/10\nFun but not much of a challenge","April 9, 2015","false","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Restarted as Mexico and was immediately destroyed by the US without provocation. 11/10 realistic war simulator.\n\nI got this game in a bundle and was interested to try a grand strategy title that looked very reminiscent of Risk, one of my childhood rage-inducing board games. I was satisfied with my gameplay experience, although I routinely got my ♥♥♥ handed to me.\n\nIf you like Risk-style grand strategy and simplistic mechanics, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are nice - the amount of detail is very simple but in no way boring or unpleasant. The game takes place on a map of the Earth's globe that you can rotate at will, and visual effects that mimic a radar occur periodically as you play. For example, there will be static feedback at times, and at others the world map will colourize. The music and sounds are good, however, I eventually muted the music in favor of my own. A female-voiced artificial intelligence helps you as you play, and will sometimes remark on different things, including a particular game track being her favorite, which I thought was a charming touch. The story is fairly basic - you play as a General-for-hire and will have to aid different nations in their conquests for world domination.\n\nControls are not too difficult to learn, however, it may take a bit to get accustomed to using the right mouse-click to select and left mouse-click to deselect/cancel unit movement and building production. There is a series of tutorial missions that will help you understand the mechanics of the game, however, the in-game tutorial dialogues pause action and can take a bit too long. Fortunately, you have the option of turning these off and on - I prefer having them off because sometimes you may speed through the dialogue (spacebar) back into gameplay, and spacebar is also used to speed up action by one day; bad design choice in my opinion. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with real-time strategy and grand strategy games.\n\nGameplay consists of you building forces (slowly), generating income (passively), and taking over territories to expand the first two goals. There are a small number of unit types - infantry, armor (tanks), two aircraft, three navy, and a nuclear missile. Each unit moves at a certain speed, and you can stack different units together to move as a single entity (they will move as slow as the slowest unit in the stack). Every unit is exactly the same across nations, so an armor unit at 100% will fight another undamaged armor unit until they both die around the same time. You cannot heal units, however, you can merge units to refill their health (ex: merge three infanty at 30-40% health each to get a 100% and a 20% unit). Only infantry can capture structures. They are also the land unit capable of entering transport ships (a design choice I find weird because it grounds your tanks and forces you to slow your island invasions).\n\nAircraft are extremely quick and can help turn the tide of battle, however, you must keep them supplied with either an aircraft carrier or airpad - they will only fly within a certain supply radius.\n\nDuring combat, units will fight to the death, and pulling them away from each other can be rather challenging (discouraging retreat). Infantry gain a 2x bonus to their combat effectiveness when they are defending cities. Cities are indicated by a flag of the controlling nation and usually have other military structures present (barracks, aviation center, etc). You cannot build new structures, another design choice that I find interesting (I would've liked the ability to construct new buildings). Each city provides constant income, which is important because each unit costs billions of dollars.\n\nThere are different game modes, including a wide-branching story mode and online matches. There are some sandbox modes that allow you to select a nation and/or starting city. These are very challenging if you do not maximize your time and resources because the AI will slowly steamroll you into oblivion.\n\nOverall, the game plays very well for a real-time grand strategy game, and anyone interested in the genre should give it a try. Personally, however, I would wait until the game goes on sale or is bundled again.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\n","May 10, 2015","true","3.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","12","22","7","4"

It doesn't give the user dozens of different options and force them to tackle complex systems. No, War is more elegant in it's execution and gives the player a limited scope, requiring them to use strategy to outthink their opponent rather than sneaking an attack by in a thousand layers of choices. Combat is abstract and requires the player to decide where to manuever and where to sacrifice.\n\nOne feature I like about War is that no unit is better than another. Each adds exactly the same combat strength to a battle, but each unit has a unique ability. Tanks are fast, whereas Infantry can hunker down in defence. Fighters are some of the most powerful units, but there are a few principle zones they are limited to due to air field access. Bombers have further range, but cannot be based on carriers.\n\nAll of this makes for a game that has the elegance of a game like chess or go.

I like not having to upgrade every unit but to use what I have effectively. I've been a fan of Lords of The Realm and Shogun Total War. Since units are even it's about numbers, defending(you get a bonus) the AI will take undefended areas and how you use the economy you create by taking over cities. Having my big invasion force nuked was a surprise and fending off invasions was fun. If I get a good foothold in an area the funnest parts have been before I start to really dominate because just one infantry unit joining a fight late could tip the entire battle and you could save a lot of resources to keep on the offensive.","July 2, 2015","true","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

U know how to play instantly because the tutorial shows you the process of understanding the rules. The graphics is  presented in the nice way, really original and user-friendly. The game's simple but not easy to win. You have to think about making the right decisions at the right time and gain an advantage to the opposite sides. I haven't played on multiplayer mode but it wasn't easy to win some scenarios with AI :) For me the only drawback of the game is the style of menu. It's comfortable but could be better :) I'm sure that the devs will workout that element in the near future :)","July 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are a few modifiers here and there, like the ability of only infantry to capture bases and the instant range of aircraft. The slight history infusion with almost every battle and the encouragement almost to always play both sides is a great plus as well. And for those that like to fight real people instead of robots, there are a slew of multiplayer battles available.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nReally digging the artstyle, calling back to the retro 80's but still keeping it smooth. There's a lot of green and a lot of glowing things. I think everyone likes green glowing things. Still, I wish there was a little more to choose from, maybe some filter pack updates in the future would be awesome -- or even DLC.\n\nSound: 8/10\nThe narration in this game uses a pregenerated voice but the amount of dialogue is amazingly helpful. The music and sound effects fit the environment perfectly but are also something else they might be able to extend via updates or DLC.\nAnd if you're one to dislike the AI voice there is an option in the menus to disable it. :]\n\nOverall: 8/10\nI give this game a 8/10 because I like RTS games and this is a perfect simple expansive RTS that stays true to the roots. Has great AI and multiplayer options. I bet it could be easily ported to mobile platforms as well so keep an eye for that!\n","February 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 13 of 28 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","13","28","2","0"

Example-In a campaign where it is UN and allies in Asia against China I don't overly mind that most countries will just sit where they are, because alot of cities don't have recruiting facilities, but then you have India who may help immensely, Japan on the other hand just sit there building armies and won't go to help you even if your fighting the Chinese in one of there own cities.\n\n\nSo, can be fun, can be a drag.

Unlike many games that try to dumb themselves down to become accessible, War, The Game is designed from the ground up to be easy to learn, but harder to master.\nThe control scheme is very inventive and while counter intuitive to what strategy gamers may expect, once you get your head around the system it works reasonably well. Many of the control options feel very touch screen orientated, for example selection is not driven by a box drag, but rather a click and hold, dragging the mouse over the units you want to command. Panning of the map is done automatically as your cursor approaches the edges, and the effect is amplified if you zoom further out. While I’m not sure the nonstandard controls really add to the game, once you get used to them they work nicely and in my opinion don’t detract from the experience.\nGame flow is built around a set of scenarios. Build units at cities, move them, if they encounter enemy units then a fight breaks out. As is common in GSGs, you don’t have direct control over the fight, but you can help by piling in extra units. In a very interesting twist units all have the same combat strength, but differ in terms of mobility and special abilities. For example one armoured battalion versus one infantry battalion will end in near stalemate. However armour can move much more quickly and so can be used to pin other units in place while the bulk of your forces arrive to tip the balance. This means positioning and control of multiple units is important. Infantry on the other hand double their strength when dug in at outposts or cities, and are also the only unit that can capture them. Sadly without transports they are also very slow.\nAnother interesting departure is that the game is in real time, and there's no pause option. Instead space bar accelerates time briefly so that your slow moving units can be shifted quickly. I’m not sure on this decision, as I like time to carefully consider my options. That said the rest of the game’s design very much feels like it’s almost rushing you. The goal seems to be rather than playing a game that lasts hours and hours, you pick up a scenario, play it, and if you want to keep playing you just play another. As such while I don’t like the absence of time controls, I will admit that the decision does seem to further a very intentional design choice, rather than being omitted by mistake. And for the most part that design choice can be summed as minimalist, and quickly paced.\nAnd that's pretty much War, The Game's watchword- minimalism. Despite being very much a GSG, it's the bare bones of what one is. This makes the game quite hard to call for GSG fans. On the one hand they may enjoy the very basic yet functional and satisfying gameplay for a while, or it can be enjoyed as a deconstruction of the genre. On the other hand there just isn't the mechanical complexity to keep someone who's logged 200 hours in HoI engaged. That said it's £6.99, so you'll probably get your money's worth. The mission based structure is also an interesting touch. While many GSGs do offer various scenarios, War, The Game takes this one step further and some of the missions are more like puzzles than anything else. They put me in mind of those trick decks from the Magic The Gathering videogame campaign modes.\nFor people who don't like strategy games, there isn’t much pull here. But I think the group that really benefits from this game though are people who want to get into GSGs. War, The Game is very basic and while the control scheme is very different, the core concepts and ideas are the same. It's about meta game planning and positioning of assets, with the occasional bit of micro management when the war needs it.\nThere's a total domination mode that was added in after release, but for the most part the game consists of a sequence of unrelated scenarios. Again, this seems to inform a very careful choice for how the player is supposed to approach the game. Plus, the fact the developers added in something the fans really wanted is also a good sign.\nThe game's presentation is also worthy of note. Obviously it's not a AAA polished 4K treat with advanced rendering and lighting effects- but it has a charm of its own. The fact the game takes place on an actual globe is a nice touch, as is the fact you can navigate around without needing to actually press any buttons.\nThere are also three different map projection modes- there's monochromatic for people who enjoy gaming on what looks like an IR display screen (admittedly it does look cool, just not great for actual gameplay), there's colour which is what you see in most of the screenshots, and finally there's unstable. Think the technology in the Alien movies and you won't be far off. Basically it switches back and forth between monochromatic and colour, as well as adding in occasional scan lines.\nAll in all War, The Gameis a solid little title, well-conceived, well designed and well built. It's not going to be for everybody but I'd say anyone with an interest in the GS genre should at least check out the store page.\n","January 29, 2015","true","1.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Other players likened it to Risk and while that certainly gives you a rough idea of what it’s about, it isn’t a perfect analogy. Unlike Risk, for example, “War, the Game” features a more developed economic aspect that you will have to pay attention to.\nGenerally speaking, the player with the larger income will win, assuming that their armies are about the same size and the terrain is negligible. However, that doesn’t mean that tactics and strategies play no role. To win it certainly is necessary to pay attention to enemy troop movements and the composition of their troops.\n\nRelatively few things bothered me while playing “War, the Game” but one of the things that did were nukes. Equal in cost to about six infantry or five armor batallions, you’d expect more of a nuke than to only wipe out infantry, leaving naval and armored units completely undamaged.\nVery bewildering is also that you cannot seem to move armored batallions across oceans with your transport ships. In other words, if you or your enemy sit on an island (e.g. Great Britain), you’ll have a hard time trying to conquer them. Even air support helps only minimally in those situations because of the games Rock-Paper-Scissors principle which makes it kinda necessary to have some of all unit types.\nWere these things amended, “War, the Game” would be even more enjoyable but it’s already a solid RTS game as is.","February 5, 2015","true","4.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Will go over each side of the game one by one.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is fun without a doubt. I have enjoyed every minute of the game. I have seriously taken a lot of time in some missions just to decide on the country I would play in. It has different layers of strategy that you seamlessly get used to. The missions are well designed; though it is sad that they are actual wars in recent history. I could not try the co-op missions due to not being able to find a partner for a long time. AI is good and actually follows your movements and changes attacks which forces you to react accordingly.\n\nGraphics:\nThere is not much in the sense of "graphics" in this game. It is more like a spherical Risk (boardgame) map. Units are representations and there is no animation. The day-night cycle and weather effects are good but it is just a flash thing. It actually bothers me that units have no animation but the sky is much more detailed.\n\nSound:\nOh God the voice of your computer assistant is really annoying! I had to shut her up in the third tutorial mission and just try to learn things on my own. Someone just reading the lines (just, anyone) would have been less annoying than this automated reading machine. The unit sounds are basic but gets the job done. Clicking sounds may annoy some people who give a lot of commands quickly but I doubt it will come to that in this game. The music is bad. Seriously in one mission a lady was just screaming an I waited for so long for a change in the tune or note or melody but no. That was shut down as well.\n\nOne important topic that I think needs special mention. You only use your mouse for all of the commands and it sometimes gets complicated and you might have to try 3-4 times before you can do what you want. I could not properly master it in 75 minutes, and I think adding some keyboard shortcuts can be easier (though I don't know for which command. Attack? Load/Unload?)\n\nOverall this game is a really great idea just bogged down with technical difficulties. It is deep and requires a good deal of thinking. It would have been much better if the sound was not as annoying and you did nothave to wrestle with your mouse at a few points in the game. I would recommend the game with your own music in the background and a bit of patience to get used to the controls.","January 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The problem is the build. It is very very poorly developed. The ai voice is annoying, and get's alot wrong. When hovering over Germany it says "Germany, France, Germany" Then moving the mouse slightly it will then say "France" even though your still hovering over Germany.\n\nI don't know whos idea it was to make the mouse faster than it normally is on desktop and then make it so if your mouse hits the left or right side of the screen it switches page.\n\nThe splash intro screen with the "company" logo, the music was terrible. Who though bassy music on a game like this was good i do not know.\n\nI am a game devloper and whoever made this game should be ashamed to be quite honest. I payed £2.38 for this game with a 66% off coupon. Still not even close to what i would pay for a game so badly made. This game is worth £0.15 yes the first level (which took 3 seconds) was fun simply because your learning how to play.

It's like a cross of Risk, Defcon and Command HQ (if anyone remembers that: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_HQ , seems to be available on Steam!). It's a simple World Conquest RTS with a limited number of units that all have the same strength, but different movement capabilities. In later scenarios you also get nuclear missiles that are extremely expensive but can wipe out whole stacks of enemy units.\nLike Unity of Command it's easy to learn (although the controls can take some time to get used to since they're non-standard and were originally intended for controllers) but hard to master. It has a range of different scenarios of varying scope, that get more and more difficult. Some of them have randomized starting positions, so they play differently each time.\nThe AI is a pretty strong opponent, especially in the later scenarios. It can sometimes be a little passive though, especially when it doesn't have much ressources (some of the minor powers on bigger scenarios like the Pacific War scenario).\nThe Multiplayer scenarios that get unlocked during the course of the campaign are an addition to the Steam version, I can't comment on them yet.\nIf you like games like Command HQ, Defcon or Empire Deluxe, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.","January 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Every unit has a value of (1). Infantry, tanks, airplanes, ships, (except transports which have a value of 0)\n\nIf you throw a tank vs. infantry, both will wipe each other out. If you throw an airplane against airplane, chances are it's a mixed bag since you can freely retreat (the opponent can too).\n\nSome important game mechanics is that infantry don't fight air, but air doesn't fight air in mixed battles. The role air serves in this game is artillery.\n\nThat said, tactically, I have been challenged time and time again. Especially the last map where you're going against a beast on either side of the world. I have to say that this was a very fun game for what it was.\n\nIt's definitely worth getting if you want a Risk-like along with a bunch of other mechanics.

While the military units appear to be graphically challenged, control of the map (Earth) is very interestingly done and provides visual cues as to the placement of units. The controls are intuitive and the tutorial covers the rules of the game very well, also giving the user the option to speed up the game. The options menu provides the user with stats, guides, and more. I found the voice of the female instructor can, at times, get annoying but luckily the developers remedied this inconvenience with an option to "hush" her. Additionally, the game provides achievements and trading cards for those who are interested.","February 4, 2015","true","5.2"," 8 of 19 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","8","19","0","0"

PRAISE THE SUN!\n\nTL;DR:None. Seriously, if i could sum up this RTS game in as few phrase as possible i would say enjoyable, simple yet frustrating. You do have to read the whole thing and see if its the sort of game for you.\n\n1.Introduction:What the ♥♥♥♥ is War, the game\nA game of war, The game of war, Wargame. I have been pondering why exactly that the dev chose that name War, the game as oppose to something more palatable, perhaps it ryhmes with A Game of Throne then? We shall never know.\n\nEssentially War, the game [♥♥♥♥. we shall refer it to WAME from now on.] is a simplistic RTS where player takes control of proabably a rookie commanding officer doing VR round in the newly made simulation program since the story is barebone but WAME doesnt really need story to flesh it out much since its gameplay carries it strongly by itself. Onward!\n\n2:Graphics\nWAME uses simplistic wireframe style graphic that pays homage to the VR vision of the olden days. Its functional and does not gets in the way of the battle except during the few times where plenty of units overlap with each other. Simple yet functional.\n\n3:Gameplay\nMenu\nUpon starting the game you will be immedietly thrust into the VR control centre with a a floating AI head explaining some stuff to you before you are required to finish the tutorial before more scenario is unlocked. A pet peeve of mine with the menu is that we are not presented with the option menu upon starting the game but you have to press ESC before being able to access it at the bottom screen. Also flicking the mouse while the setting menu changes betwenn options probably to simulate finger swiping in a VR overlay but honestly its annoying when that accidentally happens. From the bottom screen you can also access the guide and several other options. I recommend reading the guide to get a clear handle on the capability and weaknesses of your units before you start the game.\n\nActual gameplay\nHere's the part that divided me the most and which causes me to unable to provide a summary to this game. You see when starting the match there are several generic objectives that you might get such as hold out against the enemy assault, capture the enemy base and total annhilation style objective. Some missions allow you to build units and ship them to faraway location where the objective is located while some gives you specific number of units and expect you to deal with it.\n\nLeft click to select and the right mouse button to do anything with contextual action determine by a quick tap and a long press although it is a bit stupid to assign the attack button to long press since by the time the command is inputted the enemy has already started moving which means delays in response.\n\nThe game begins when 2 units meet on the field with a power gauge on the bottom right showing who has more of an advantage over the other although unit count, reinforcement and other stuff also factors in. It is incredibly simplistic with each game session not lasting for more than 10-15 minutes at maximum. You have the options to build units but thats pretty much the only management option you will get with this game.\n\nThe game is FUN [Subjective to individual, i use my own scale for now.] but several non-intuative controls frustrate me to no end. You cant simply draw a select box to select many units at once but instead you have to hold down the left mouse button and select them one at a time. This gives the already quick ai more time to prepare for an assault as i toss about trying to organize my forces. Also the only way to speed up time is by pressing the spacebar but that only speeds it up by 1 in game day so you might resort to tapping which i highly discourage since the game registers every single tap. So you got the units close enough to the enemy and want to begin planning an assault? Too bad since the games still plays out the last 5 spacebar tap so your units helplessly blunder straight into a fight. Judicious use of the skip time problem solve this one problem but another one pops up, the ai is a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ since they can just order their troops straightaway while youre still busy with the clickings and such. How i wish for a pause function.\n\nThe game is also simplistic, the only tactic you need to know for basic bootcamp is stalling, redirection, sudden attack and air support strikes to thrawt the ai since ground and sea units once lock into a deadly struggle with their foes will not retreat at all so expending a tank unit to delay the enemy while the infantry unit waddle up for reinforcements is actually a good ideas at times. Why infantry instead of tanks? Because they have all the weaponry to counter everyone just not particularly strong against any.\n\nI'll give more thoughts in the conclusion.\n\n3.Sound\nBattle sounds and simulation noise thingy are good enough although the constant stuttering of the ai voice that is blamed on bugs of the simulation got on my nerve shortly after and it doesnt help that the ai speak in the most gravel voice i have ever heard. That is a compliment masked in sarcasm btw dev.\n\nConclusion and final thought:\nI dunno, i like the game because it focuses more on the traditional unit placement to stall and counter the enemy but the overly simplistic gameplay is definitely not for me. That and that annoying ai. But at the end of the day the game is solid enough to stand on its own 2 legs from the rest of the game on steam and it does play smoothly enough for me to warrant a positive review.\n\nWhile i did only play it for an hour the game pretty much opens up fully within that timeframe which is enough for me to say that its a good game marred by a few minor annoyance.\n\nAlso i lied.\n\nTL;DR:\nA simplistic RTS game with heavy emphasize on quick reaction and fast mouse clicking with a focus on strategy more. Fans of RTS game should probably get it after viewing the gameplay on youtube but those who want base building to go along with it should look elsewhere.\n\nCQC Peace out.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The only problem I have is sometimes the ai just sits there building a huge stack of troops and then does nothing the rest of the game which really sucks if theyre your ally amd dont help in the wars.

I'm a fan of fun, easy to get into grand strategy games, like Superpower 1 and 2, I have Geo-Political Simulator 2 which sucks due to every tiny fraction revolting every waking minute, and Supreme Ruler games suck because they are a great grand-strategy RTS, with lots of detail, but worst economy and military system ever: every country is magically in super-debt, and you have to super-micro-manage because AI managing your army fails every time, worse than the AI that manages CPU controlled countries (Mexico's puny army easily conquers the USA for example), and even then, the units don't respond to your orders 75% of the time. Worthless software.\n\nNow, we have WAR: THE GAME. I love the fluid feel, the graphics, the simplicity. I agree, the "globe" thing is a gimmick but it's an very nice gimmick. Better than the overly clunky maps in the Supreme Ruler series and even worst Hearts of Iron/Europa Universalis series which are a million times over-rated (seriously, they blow).\n\nWAR: THE GAME, is not a "grand strategy" game like these. It reminds me more of an very old PC game called "COMMAND HQ". Any fellow old school gamer will know what I mean. Or, if you like games simple like DEFCON, this is kind of similar in the simplicity. But you have to be very smart. I though that first it was easy to deceive the AI but then got my butt kicked, so it's simple, but that hides it does require some thought. There is a space-war type game out there, can't rememeber the name, but operates with the same principle: simple, but you have to think it out.\n\nI very much appreciate games like this and developers that try to go as far as they went here.\nThe graphics are very fluid, runs great, feels smooth, and very comfortable. Nothing to over-convolute the screen and has a somewhat relaxed feel. I would be interested to see what games the developer makes going forward. No crashes, no hiccups, there is a comfortable level of quality and I like to give credit where I think it is do.\n\nThe only negatives is I had a hard time figure out what was going on when I used the middle mouse button.\nIt sped up the game, and press again and it sped up more, and each time sped up, couldn't get back to slow (bug?) and the graphics changed from color, to black and white, to fuzzy TV flurry/distortion affect without any explanation (satellite mode? Huh? What?). There should be some clear pop-up text that is visible to show you are toggling between different modes. I can easily see a person new to the game clicking that by accident and going, "OMG! WTF DID I JUST DO! MY GUYS ARE DYING NOW?! OMG! WTF?! W T F!!!!?!?!111!!!" :)\n\nThe only other big negative is there is no "skirmish/open-ended conquer the world mode" I don't know if that is just a limitation to the game programming or what. I agree with what someone else said it feels mayble originally designed for an iPad or something where you do "scenarios/levels" and they get progressively more difficult or complex", fortunately, and appreciatively, they branch out so there are options and that is nice.\n\n****This game would totally rock with an open-world, try to conquer it all mode.****\nI cannot stress this enough.\n\nUPDATE: A recent patch has added this!!!! I recommend this game even.\nThere are custom Scenarios on Steam Workshop that let you do the same, and Scenario Editor is included now!!!\n\nI have to majorily disagree with what I consider unfair criticism of how you select multiple units.\nMany complain you cannot simply click/drag a box over them. Instead, you hold down a button and run the cursor over the ones you want. I actually liked this!!!! Some units were in places a drag-down box COULD NOT GRAB!!!! So instead, I can mouse over this one, that one, and way up here to THAT OTHER ONE. And it was fast, fluid, no glitches. So what gives? I can surmise some are simply use to the old style of click/drag-box from RTS games, and that is fine, I understand new things can be a bit difficult to get used to but the system this game uses --- the overly fanatical criticism just wasn't warranted. Not all new systems are good, such as in games like Supreme Commander or Sins of a Solar Empire with the super-zoom where your mouse is. I could never get used to that junk. So live and let live.\n\nLastly: NOT A PAID REVIEWER. LOL. I think some people get so upset people like this game, and they had much higher expectations, they can't fathom it. This is an indie strategy rts war game. Not Hearts of Iron or one of those other lame games using a lame game engine. It's fairly simpler. Superpower 2 is 10x more complex than War: The Game. I bought this game and feel good about supporting a indie developer. Some of the most popular, most fun, and interesting games come from indie developers (Salvation Prophecy, Eschalon series, Avernum series, Binding of Isaac, etc.).\n\nSo no, this is not some epic grand strategy masterpiece, this is a beer and pretzels game.\nBut not a Budweiser and generic Wal-Mart pretzels game, but rather a Stella Artois (or Baltika!) and Trader Joe's Pretzels game. :D","February 25, 2015","true","51.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakotachambers/recommended/322900/","dakotachambers","Cutter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dakotachambers/","400 products in account","War, The Game has a lot of potential but has some quirky UI issues and questionable balance decisions that hold it back.\nSet in an alternate modern-day timeline, you command forces on fronts around the world fighting with real countries. There are a couple of basic military units in the game, including infantry, armor, airplanes (bombers, fighters) and various ships for naval combat. Combat itself is very simple, and essentially comes down to which side has more units in a fight and who can reinforce their troops fastest. Because all types of units have the exact same fighting power, this is pretty simple to understand. More units, regardless of type = stronger fighting force.\n\nThis is the first issue I had with the game...other than travel speed (and movement limitations by the aircraft), the units all being the same strength seems a little strange. It keeps it simple and minimalistic, which I can appreciate, but it also seems to lack a little depth. I would be interested in being able to upgrade a group of units, or see some difference in strengths. Armor moves much faster than infantry, for example, but has the same strength. Other than a slight difference in cost, there is no reason for me to want to build infantry units over armor.\n\nThe only other glaring issue I had is that the UI/UX can be a bit...weird. For example, it's impossible to move the mouse around the screen and select units without also moving the viewing screen itself. This is frusterating when trying to precisiely select and command units. The game also drops the tried-and-true "selection box" for selection multiple units, and instead asks you to hold down the LMB and move the mouse specifically over each unit. Often I found this to be a waste of time when tying to rapidly select multiple units, and in an RTS, every microsecond can count. Finally, there are some other oddities. The menu is a little strange, and there are quirky commands. Press F1 3 times to restart a level? Why wouldn't a "restart level" button just be included in the Esc menu? How should I be expected to remember that when no other game in memory does that? I respect the developer for trying new things, but I suspect the game would be a more enjoyable experience for newcomers if it shared more UI/UX traits with tried-and-true RTS mechanics.\n\nI realize the previous two paragraphs sound harsh, but those are pretty much my only criticisms with an otherwise excellent and inventive RTS game. It tries many new things and features a unique style that is a breadth of fresh air in a very stale genre. I can't speak much to the strength of the AI yet as I haven't put enough hours into the game to really study how it behaves, but look for an update soon. I have enjoyed my time with the game so far and look forward to many more hours of play. Iron out the few kinks there are and you may have a real winner on yours hands.\n\nThe short list\n\nPros: Unique approach to a stale genre\nNeat digital art style\nExcellent soundtrack\nQuick matches, easy to undestand how the game works.\n\nCons: Unit balance - all units have same strength\nQuirky User-Interface","January 15, 2015","true","1.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It's an RTS about war on a global scale. Strategy games are probably my weak point when it comes to gaming, I put this down to increasing complexity and a decrease in my abilily to focus. Fortuantely, WtG offers short missions that you can replay over until you beat them, (or not in some cases). The simplificaiton of units to 1:1 hardness ratio gives you a good idea of whether you're going to get kicked hard, or, preferably the other way round.\n\nSo far, so straight forward, except it isn't like any other RTS I've played, you rotate the globe using the mouse, zoom in and out with the wheel, It's a smooth flow from say CoH, or (cough) dune 2. The consistancy in motion and the ability to skip forward a day/week make for a fast action strategy game. The whole interface makes targeting units a joy. That is once you've got your head round the basics control-wise, because there really are only a handful of controls, and that is all that is needed.\n\nFinally, what really made this game stand out, was the atmosphere created by the glitched up view of the planet, coupled with the glitchy tutorial AI and the almost glitch-hop soundtrack, which went down very well with my ears.\n\nWhat I didn't like about the game (and this is probably my own ineptitude) was the lack of direction after the initial 3 battles. It felt like there should have been an order in which to do them, but I failed to see it, and pretty much failed every mission afterwards, until the AI started to hand out advice seemingly randomly.\n\nAfter giving the single player missions a good go, I decided not to get my back side fedex'd to me on a platter in the multilplayer.\n\nDo I recommend? I reckon this game is good fun, not too frustrating, and lovely to look at. So I'll be going back to it.","February 5, 2015","true","6.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/322900/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","War, the Game is a deceivingly simple game at first, but as you progress you will be surprised by the circumstances and how the mechanics interact with one another and will have to carefully plan your actions in order to meet the mission objectives. Each nation that you controls has units, which can range from infantry and tanks to nuclear missiles and aircraft carriers, and production facilities that can be used to create them. You can choose what and when to build, based on the money the cities you control are generating, and on moving your forces across the map in order to engage the enemy, defeat him and then capture his urban centers. The actual battles do not require any sort of input and they are only based on the power of the units that are taking part, with both infantry and tanks contributing one level each when at full strength and with air units offering the same strength but with some special rules attached.\n\nThe systems in the game mean that small initial advantages in unit power lead to a win in the long term and most of the strategy needed to win in War, the Game is linked to knowing when and how to commit forces in order to win, even by the smallest of margins, while crippling the enemy army. The initial scenarios seem simple, but the game quickly ramps up the difficulty level and it takes a lot of tries and restarts in order to complete the later mission objectives. The best way I have found to create a solid path towards victory is to find the nearest enemy divisions and focus as many of my forces on them in a coordinated attack. The trick is to keep your own units together as much as possible, while making sure that the enemy is scattered and unable to mount a powerful counteroffensive.\n\nWhat makes the entire experience more difficult than it should be is the fact that the entire game moves a little too fast and sometimes the AI, with its unlimited attention, simply makes moves that you cannot respond to in time. The game does a good job of teaching you, via a virtual assistant, how to play the game and it’s always easy for you to understand what you need to do in order to succeed.\n\nWar, the Game is a lesson on how to do more with less as the development team uses what is clearly limited resources to create a graphics engine that delivers a fluid game, interesting details and an art style that enhances the gameplay experience. Units and terrain are all abstracted and the look of the title borrows a lot from the military video feeds that show battlefields and combatants, although on a much larger scale. The user interface is easy to read and offers all the info that you need and the choice to allow you to zoom in and out at any moment manages to convey the scale of each operation, while the representation of Earth offers a sense of time. War, the Game shows that indie developers do not need to try to compete with big companies in the graphics department and only have to come up with an interesting design choice in order to capture your attention with a simple, clean, efficient look. The sound design is less impressive, but it does mesh well with the rest of the experience.\n\nThe developers at Gabber Games have created an interesting game overall, with some very cool ideas, but the game might be too niche and abstracted to appeal to gamers who are used to a view of war that’s more about spectacle than about decisions and consequences. War, the Game is a title that all strategy lovers should try out at least once in order to see how smaller teams can innovate by taking the classic concepts of the genre and turning them into something new.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 26 of 57 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","26","57","0","2"
