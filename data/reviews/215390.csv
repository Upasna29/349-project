Its's arcade style, but you can fly it with a joystick or gamepad. The game makers put a lot of effort in the missions.  Some of them seem to actually have a historical source. In this game you get to dogfight in multiple World War 2 fighters. You can even choose to get into an Axis fighter to fight the Japanese. Also nice are the multiple views like 3rd person, from the hood of a plane or  cockpit view. So you can always choose what you like. This game has a full campagne coop. Yes people you can play this game with 3 online team mates. So I had many hours of double fun with this game.\n\nCons: The game always starts with me in windowed mode. Also I have to adjust the settings for my screen in game all the times when I start this game. These are just minor bugs and more a nuisance then a real burdon. Also the volume in the game is quite loud making it difficult to hear my mates on teamspeak. So before I start this game I have to adjust the volume settings in Teamspeak. Also a minor bug.\n\nAll and all a very good game with nice graphics. It brought me back into the fierce combat  of World War 2 Pacific theatre. Definitely a good bang(s) for a bug.","December 2, 2012","true","13.3"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Make yourself a service and check out forums prior to buying, as it may save you some money. Also good idea would be to at least wait for a discount, if you have to test your luck.","March 28, 2014","false","0.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"
