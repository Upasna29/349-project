This game is a video game version of real life escape room (which is a real life quest game). I had a few issue with it based on the first 5 levels:\n* Bad feedback, sometimes there are sounds and sometimes there are not.\n* Sometimes combining clues make no sense (like in real quest rooms rather for the sake to have interaction) like in level 2 you can't put a book aside unless you lit a candle. What? Why? In the same level even if you put the correct code it won't move unless the combine the 2 pieces of paper together. It makes no sense in a video game or real life. Also you can pick up only one of the pieces and you need to move it to the other. Why?!?!?!\n* It is very inconsistent. The same rehashed models for desks and drawers are used everywhere in levels 1 - 3. The locks on the drawers are only decorations. Except for the one time when one lock isn't.\n* The fire pick could only be picked while in movement. That's so wrong.\n* The same schticks are on every level: something under a pillow, something with candles, key behind picture, key opens a box, box has code for another lock that even if you know it unless you did all the steps it won't open and then there's another key to the door.\n* Sometimes clicking on something with an object will make interaction and sometimes it won't. Why so many inconsistency?\n* It moves so slow..! And sometimes doesn't respond immediately.\n* Some places are hard to get, you need to press from a certain place only to get there (I'm looking at you missing stairs at level 5).\n* Immersion is kinda ruined that a skilled thief can't break on his own a broken wooden floor or jump like 1.2 feet up where stairs are missing (with no danger of hurting himself).\n* The story and tutorial and bearable at best. At least this game have these.\n\nKey was given by publisher for beta testing. I will play a little more to see if it gets better but clearly this game is made by someone that loves escape rooms but have no idea about the basics of good game design. Too bad.\nAlso, I'm not an escape room expert but from my experience this doesn't beat the real thing (but it is a good try though).\nAlso couldn't beat level 5. I've clicked on everything with the little box (I have no idea what it is) and the planks. No idea if it's a bug or I've missed something. The game could have a hint system for situations like this.\nBut not everything is grim, this game has two good virtues:\n1. It's cheaper than going to a real escape room.\n2. It allows disabled people to have a glimpse of the experience (based on the rooms I've been to, a person in a wheelchair could not participate).","March 26","false","0.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

You have to solve all of the puzzles in one room in order to access the next.  In each room is a variety of furniture and decorations, though the contents of each room doesn't change much.\n\nLike all point and click adventures, you have to manipulate your mouse precisely and accurately so that you click on the correct object.  Unlike most point and click adventures, this game does not tell you when you move the mouse over something significant.  This was the first sign to me that this was going to be a bad game -- you literally have to click all over the room to grab something that makes no sense to grab -- like in the first room, the stick leaning against the shelves.  Why?\n\nUltimately, the lack of the pointer highlighting an object (or however else the game would let you know you're looking at something significant) leads to a prolonged experience.  And that's important with this game because it is EXTREMELY short.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, your "movement" between areas in each room is EXTREMELY slow.  This was another bad sign when I started playing -- slow movement making up for a lack of content.\n\nOther criticisms -- there doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason why you would perform some actions or why you would want to explore one part of the room but be completely unable to explore another.  The objects that you pick up are a little obscure in their identity as well -- in one room I picked up am object that looked to me to be like a piece of undeveloped or developed film.  This made no sense because the game obviously takes place in kind of medieval times.  Unlike most point and click adventures, this game doesn't tell you what the object is when you pick it up, doesn't tell you what it is when you rest the pointer over it, and you can't right click on an item to have a closer look.  It was only with a combination of random clicks that I realized the piece of film wasn't that -- it was a box of nails.  That's a pretty big problem when you can't figure out what something is unless you have a purely random experience.\n\nMany areas of each room make no sense that you would want to explore -- in the tutorial room, the second piece of what you are looking for is behind one of the lanterns on the wall.  Of course it is!  What rational person wouldn't look behind a lantern mounted on a wall?!\n\nIn the end, this game was reduced to random, frustrating clicks.  There isn't a storyline that I can find, other than somehow you've gotten yourself trapped in a castle whose builder apparently had no sense of proportion, direction, function, or decor.  Fung Shui has no meaning in this game.  It's like a digitized version of the famous Winchester House, where the owner built stairways that didn't go anywhere and doors that opened to brick walls.  I realized this finally when I had to set the dials on a lock that opened a window -- and then the window opened to another room.  Made sense.\n\nTruly, I'm writing this review so that, when you look back on your life when you are in your elder years -- you don't dread wasting two hours of it on one of the sh*ttiest games on Steam.","March 26","false","1.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

The music ingame isnt bad either.\nHas an Eerie feel to it, this is something the intro I cant stress enough really needed.\nI sort of dilike that each room is its own level, I think I would of rather had an interconnecting game escaping eachroom that connected, but to each his own.\nOh boy the 2nd level makes me remember why I dislike these games, I got the Candle and lit the other candle, and found part of the code, but It seems I have clicked everywhere and can't find the rest of the code...Ok So I found a stick? The Items should have a name under them that displays what they are.\nUsed the stick? on the painting to find a key, that didnt make alot of sense to me.\nI tried to enter code and it didnt work, then realized I had to put the paper next to the other paper to "make the code" instead of doing it in my head and having the right answer it wouldnt let me unlock it on my own, this is not cool.\nLevel 3 was easier and much more well designed, This is the kind of level that makes these games enjoyable.\nOverall game is enjoyable id just think about some of the logics and label the items for better understanding.","April 12","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
