"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nidoriner/recommended/249330/","nidoriner","お兄さん","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nidoriner/","247 products in account","Let me tell you about Popan.\n\nPopan was the first baby ever born in my apartments. She was a Cheepy so I didn't have high expectations. Popan was probably 3 days old when her parents died in an unfortunate ambush on my complex. I had a ton of other tenants, so I didn't see the harm in waiting for her to grow up. Somehow, she never became in debt. This ♥♥♥♥ing baby was paying the rent. She grew up to be a total badass. She would single-handedly wipe out entire waves of enemies without breaking a sweat.\n\nPopan is obviously popular and well-known throughout the land, she easily finds herself a guy to shack up with. He's weak and dim-witted; a farmer named Peecone that watches tv 90% of the time that he's home. It doesn't slow Popan down though, she easily slays the first main quest adventurer all by herself while all the other tenants are at work. She returns immediately and has victory "pillow-talking" and immediately has the child they have been trying so hard to have. A girl named Chaan, that is impossibly strong as well. Popan and Chaan were ♥♥♥♥ing ruthless, the perfect mother-daughter duo. Then Peecone stops paying rent, or so I assume, as I thought the world of those two divas but not so highly of farmer Peecone. I keep lowering the rent hoping they'll stay, I evict Peecone hoping it will fix the problem. It helps! They are back in the green in no time and happily tending their garden and watching tv together. Then it all goes down hill again. Popan robs the cradle with her next man, the neighbor boy, Pyo, not much older than her daughter moves in. Things get tense. Chaan was the one that wanted the damn Love Balloon and yet her mother was the one to snatch up a mate. Chaan is unemployed but barely comes home. Popan and Pyo are having pillowtalk near constantly. Twice I found Chaan begrudgingly lifting weights while the two love birds pillowtalk all night, draining the life out of her having to deal with it.\n\nThen tragedy struck. Being the only one home at the time of the ambush, Pyo the live-in boyfriend was struck down. Despite her envy, Chaan became increasingly more withdrawn, very rarely going out for fun or even job interviews. Popan also began getting increasingly more gloomy and soon they were once again behind on rent, once again because of a guy. In fear of losing my glorious lady warriors, I lowered the rent as much as I could stand but their grief had drained not only their livelihood, but also apparently their bank accounts because the two ♥♥♥♥♥es ran out on me in the middle of the night.\n\n11/10 would collect rent from orphan babies again","September 20, 2015","true","32.1"," 224 of 243 people (92%) found this review helpful 192 people found this review funny","92","224","243","192","5"

All the reviews about those cruel and ridiculous events are all true.\n\nA tower defense game where you are a landlord, taking care of monsters... or so I thought.\n\nYou have an absolute power over the occupants. My first playthrough I read every details of the game. The jobs my occupants have. Their satisfactory meter. I always check how they feel and what they want, trying my best to fulfill all of their wishes. There is an option to evict them, but I don't intend to use it at all. Later on, my cheepy is the first one to find his lover. And the first one to have a child/chick. I am so happy for them. I max out their satisfaction. And try my best not to increase the rent too high.\n\nTo my ignorance, this is not how you play the game. This is not sims! It's a tower defense game! You need money to upgrade your 'fort'. But my progress is really slow because I care too much about them. Those cheepies are extremely poor as they have low-income works. As time goes on, I accidentally kill the cheepy's lover. I fast-foward the time but I was too careless. For that, a cheepy lost his wife... and the child/chick lost his mother. Killed by those filthy humans that try to attack the building. I feel so bad about this. The early feeling of happiness has gone in the blink of an eye. Sorrow creeps into my heart.\n\nTo make things worse, the father-cheepy and the daugter-cheepy didn't say anything. But at least, I wanted them to complain, to at least blame me for I have done. They did none of that... as though they understand what was at stake.\n\nPerhaps, they think that I am already kind enough to give them shelters against those dangerous humans. It could have been worse. The enemies only get much stronger with each quest.\n\nI was quite shocked by the incident so I paused the game for a while.\n\nSomething must be done in order to fight against those vicious humans.\n\nAfter much deliberation, I, the kindly landlord, evicted those remaining cheepies... They both pack things and leave obediently. They are both crying, yet firm and understanding. They know I need to make rooms for the stronger monsters.\n\nFather and daughter.... now homeless... without wife or mother... Both of them... Hobos lol\n\nThe situation alleviates for a while. Stronger monsters now occupy the tragic-filled room of those cheepies. Completely unaware of the sacrifices I have to make.\n\nDespite all this, the lesson I have learnt is not 'sacrifice have to be made' but rather 'Guilt can comsume the sanity of a man'. Unwilling to bear the emotional pain much longer, I seek the easy way out. Knowing only cowards would choose such a path. But at the time, believe it or not, I do not care. I just want to end the pain. Therefore, I committed suicide... (Or what one might call 'uninstalling the game')\n\nOne </3 heart out of One ❤\n\n3/5 Would get stupidly emotional again.","April 3, 2015","true","2.7"," 196 of 212 people (92%) found this review helpful 145 people found this review funny","92","196","212","145","3"

Play as an apartment manager (The Devil) and experience what's it like to manage an apartment complex full of monsters.\nI had a lot of fun building up my apartment. As my tenement grew, more monsters moved in, each with different stats, jobs, likes, and dislikes. I had to keep my tenants happy by fulfilling their special needs and buying them furniture. In return, they defend the apartment from invading adventurers and heroes.\n\nEverything in this game has character; from the funny text descriptions of monsters and furniture to the cutesy 2D art design. Tenants will go about their day, some will go to work, others will hang around in their apartment; some monsters don't get along with others. I found myself chuckling often to the various activities of my tenants. Also, the soundtrack is super catchy and light-hearted, which fits the game perfectly.\n\nThere's something satisfying about watching your tenants grow; you might feel a peculiar attachment. They can get job promotions, fall in love, and eventually make babies! There's nothing like unleashing a family of Cheepies on an unsuspecting hero.\n\nUnholy Heights is a very casual game; fun and enjoyable, easily worth the price of purchase. It definitely merits our attention.","June 6, 2014","true","6.7"," 81 of 86 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","81","86","2","2"

I'd say tower defence (which is not a perfect description of the game, but it is fairly close) is one of my least enjoyed genres. Unholy Heights is something special though.\n\nUnholy Heights gets me far more invested in the morality of my actions than pretty much any other game. In a game like Fable which toutes its morality focused gameplay, I will just shrug off the ultimatums. "Will you let most of the kingdom die?!" Yeah; they were all carbon copies of each other anyway. "Will you let your beloved get killed by the evil guy?!" Yeah... her hair is kinda weird.\n\nBut this game...\n\nI have some families that I accidently let the parents die, and now the child doesn't have enough money to pay the rent, but I feel so bad that I let her keep her room for free as a means of apologizing for her loss.\nAnd another family which has been falling behind on rent, but I don't want to kick them out because they just had a kid.\nAnd another family that keeps telling me to change the wallpaper back and forth and they're great at defending the place but I just can't stand their implied bickering, so I send them out as soon as there's an assault with the hopes that one of them will perish and I can finally either leave the room with smutty wall paper or plain wall paper...","October 4, 2014","true","37.2"," 71 of 75 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","71","75","10","0"

You are the devil that has just purchased a tenement. Just one tenement, there are no scenarios or anything, just this one tenement in the game. As time goes by, creatures will stop by to visit your apartment building, then they'll want to rent a room assuming you have free rooms. If you take them in, they'll take up residence.\n\nThis diverse array of creatures will then go about life. They'll head to work, sleep, eat, fall in love, have babies. You really have no control over what they do. The real game comes into play when at the end of the day and night cycle when a hero comes to your apartment to rob it and or kill your creatures. So what do you do to defend your building? Click on your doors to knock on them and they'll come out to fight. The only catch is will they might be at work and not in the apartment. Eventually, the creatures will come back from work and be able to fight if not start fighting when they bump into someone.\n\nEach enemy has one of three types of attacks: melee, mid range and long range. Your foes will have the same style of attacks. Its a nice system and since each creature lives in a different room, you can wait for the enemies to get to the center of your building, then call the first and last apartment to pinch them where they can't run away. They can also do the same to you of course. If one of your creatures gets weak, simply click them again and they'll run away to their room, to your devil headquarters or away from the building.\n\nThese daily attacks are more and less a grind. They won't give you much gold. Instead your tenants will give you daily gold in rent. If you want the most gold, you'll take on quests by clicking the sign on your screen. These quests result in larger enemy amounts in usually 3 waves. These 3 waves take place in short amount of times, so make sure your creatures are healthy. Each of these quests has a star / difficulty rating and bonus gold for completing it. Some quests are mandatory in red, and others are optional, but the optional quests seem more like steps to the red quests.\n\nIf an enemy gets to the top of your building, they steal gold and try to get away with it. If an enemy makes it out alive, you'll fail the quest and can do it again. It is a very forgiving system that keeps you in the game with no real way to lose. You'll always have creatures wanting to move in if you have an empty building.\n\nSo what do you do with all of this gold? When you're not being attacked, you can click on a room and see the inhabitants of the room, along with everything in the room. The tenants will want specific things like CD Players, fans, playing cards, plants and so on. You'll need to buy them things and by doing so, your creatures will be able to gain defense, attack and so on.\n\nYou'll also be tasked with keeping your residents happy, which really seems easy enough. Every type of creature has different needs to become happy. Such as skeletons need to defeat enemies, one type needs to live amongst plants or it'll get sick and other creatures become happy or sad based on the overall joy of the tenement. Some of your creatures will become sad if there are creatures they hate living in the building. The bestiary shows everything.\n\nYou can raise or lower the rent, and creatures each have jobs, so if they can't meet the rent, they can fall behind. Then it is your choice, do you evict them? Lower their rent? Or just make rent free to keep the good creatures you've worked into deadly killers. When new creatures arrive you can see their job so you know if they're some deadbeat cigarette butt collector or just unemployed in general. That doesn't stop paying tenants from falling in love with unemployed creatures that do nothing.\n\nEventually, you'll be able to add more floors to your tenement, along with unlocking more types of creatures and objects for their homes. Not just that, but you'll see the creatures fall in love and later have babies. What does this all mean for you? When there are 2 creatures living together, that's just more attackers for you. Their babies will grow into adults and be able to fight as well. Creatures can only fall in love and breed with creatures of the same species. There are consumable items such as balloons that will help a resident find love, and erotic cakes that will help a couple make a baby. Of course there are less funny consumable items like health potions as well. Your creatures will gain health when they eat, so you don't really need to micromanage anything.\n\nIn all, this is a really quirky, one of a kind game that I can highly recommend. The only down side is there seems to be a lot of grinding before you can get through the quests. The game does a great job of explaining things especially compared to other sim games. The game also seems underpriced, but if they had different scenarios, I could understand them having a higher price. The game has the right amount of depth to keep me interested, without overwhelming me.","August 10, 2014","true","15.9"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","61","67","0","0"

That's about the best word for it I suppose. The story is something else, you're the devil, and one day you decide to buy an apartment building to help fund your evil schemes and whatever. This game is sort of an apartmen managment sim mixed with a tower defense, you have to get monsters to move in and take care of their needs, while choosing which ones you send to fight the human menace!\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, but I like the simplicity and think they add to the charm of the game, it's kind of like a Deviantart chibi fanartist's wet dream.  The music is also pretty cool, all the tunes (except the boss music) kind of remind me of the Animal Crossing soundtrack, simple and sweet.\n\nThe monsters in the game are all unique, they have stats, wants, and even jobs. It's definitely nerve racking to have to fight a boss when your main tanks are out on their paper routes. The monsters types are all unique as well, the Helmcheepies are melee monsters, but when they attack they shoot a projectile that passes through enemies. And the Zombies have a life-leech ability to keep them fighting.\n\nOverall, if you want to buy this game, do. It's four dollars and has plenty of stuff for both casual and hardcore gamers, along with replay value that won't wear off until your third playthrough.

Sure build your tower, level up, stock better weapons to defend agains stronger enemies... la di da.\nOnly a few games in that genre manage to really stand out and - congratulations to Unholy Heights - this is one of them.\n\nIt's not you classic tower defense game, but it still fits the genre somehow, weird but true.\n\nIn the game you're the landlord of a motel where instead of towers your defenses are your inhabitants, but there's an other twist.\n\nTowers don't just walk out on you or get scared, your renters do.\n\nIt's really annoying when you've leveld up your renter and once he has a family he decides to run out on you, 'cause he's afraid of the villagers who attack the motel. It's really, really, really annoying, but also such fun, since it keeps you on your toes.\n\nA lot of tower defense game still follow the old set-it-and-forget-it principle, so you spend most of an attack just watching the masterpiece you've build do all the work, with little interaction required from you. Unholy Heights is different, if you just lean back an expect your renters to defend the motel without you, you'll pretty soon run out of money (villagesr not only kill your monsters, but also steal your money once they've reached the upper level of the motel) and renters.\n\nI'd totally recommend this to any fan of tower defense games, since it's something new and not the same-old-same-old, plus it's also a game for people who don't acutally like tower defense games; those kind of people won't even know they're playing a TD ;-)","March 29, 2015","true","94.8"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/249330/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","So the Devil quit his job as Lord Of All Evil to build an apartment building for monsters, and as its landlord you have to manage the tenants and get them to defend the building against overeager heroes. If that premise sounds Japanese as ♥♥♥♥ to you, then you're right on the money because the monsters are adorable, the heroes are Dragon Questy, and there are erotic cakes. And under all the weirdness and design quirks, there's a pretty good game.\n\nUnholy Heights is a mash-up of management sim and tower defense that's way, way heavier on the management part. You start with four apartments that monsters can apply to live in, and you have full control over the rent and furnishings. That means you can fill it with all sorts of beds, appliances, plants, PCs, board games, exercise gear, and other junk. Your tenants will often request specific things like a desk to study on or smutty wallpaper to stare at, but you can (and should) also furnish empty apartments a specific way to attract certain monsters. From the outset only a handful will want to take a room in your building, but with a little work you can catch the eye of powerful demons, elementals, beasts, and elder beings.\n\nApartments start as single residences, but your tenants can meet and bring home a spouse, and have a child. You can also add second and third floors after completing certain quests, ultimately giving you 12 apartments of up to 3 monsters each. Monsters have jobs that they'll leave part of the day for (unless they work from home), hobbies they'll indulge, and all sorts of weird statuses throughout like "staring at the wall" and "having a wet dream". They can get sick, they can be evicted, they can lose their jobs and not make rent, and on and on and on. The depth of the sim component honestly approaches something like Tropico with how fleshed-out each resident is.\n\nAll of this contributes to the tower defense portion as well, but not always in good ways. Heroes will come to your building in an effort to get to the Devil's office on the roof and steal your money. This can happen randomly, but usually it's triggered by taking a quest. Quests have all sorts of justifications and reward you with money, new monsters, new furnishings, or the ability to expand the building, but they all play out roughly the same. Heroes appear from the right side of the screen and wind their way up towards the Devil's office. You can knock on the doors of your residents to get them out and fighting the good guys. Monsters can be melee, ranged, or magical, with different resistances and speeds to track. They also get bonuses from being content, favorable weather, and so on.\n\nIt's a smart and entertaining combination that's only held back by a few gripes. If the heroes reach your office, they steal a bunch of your money and you fail the quest. Quests can be several waves long, so failing on the boss can be pretty discouraging. Losing monsters in battle can be a pretty stiff setback, since you generally don't have time to replace them between waves. You also don't really know what you're getting into until you see the heroes in action, so it's really easy to screw yourself by unknowingly taking a quest you can't win yet.\n\nThe absolute worst, though, is getting attacked while your monsters are out. Remember how I said they have jobs and hobbies? Well, when they're out, they're out. And once you start a quest, you don't get to pick when the waves come. So if your key melee tank is waiting tables when the heroes show up, you're screwed. I had one building where every single monster worked the night shift, which made quests almost impossible to complete.

You manage a building full of monster tenants who also fight heroes that try to rob you. It reminds me of one of those Kairosoft mobile games only with fighting. While this game does have that casual flavor as you are trying to make a profit and of course keep your monsters happy they work, get sick, fall in love and make babies. But if you want to spice things up you can always play one of the many quests to fight heroes and gain cash to spend money upgrading your apartments.\n\nWith each upgrade you attract a a higher breed of monster tenant all with different streengths and weaknesses. Housing placement also plays a factor as not all monsters get along and if you have two neighbors next to each other that don't get along one might end up leaving or skipping out on the rent if they can't pay.\n\nI found this game to be charming. Everything from the cute cartoonish graphics to the strange melody.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/recommended/249330/","Anitude","Annie T. Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","An apartment management tower-defense game about your resident monsters against humans.\nWhile the idea of being a landlord is enticing the tower-defense part can get incredibly tedious & repetitious since there's not a whole lot of strategy to use here from beginning to end.\n\nThe idea of the tower-defense is just to stop humans from stealing your money and if they get away with it you only lose your highly expendable tenant should they have died defending the money taken so there's no real fail state. You try and stop the humans by knocking on the room doors of the monsters of your choosing and IF they're home (which most usually are) they'll do their tower-defense thing and help kill the intruders.\nAs you get further into the game you're able to invite specific higher tier monsters depending on what monster race you've been appealing to or otherwise. To get further into the game & earn faster money though you've got to go do quests from a quest board. While every quest grants you money there are quests that unlock new monsters for you to be able to have in your apartment, quests that unlock a new piece of furniture you can buy for your tenants, and main quests that finally allow you to expand your apartment one floor at a time. The downside to this though is that every quest from side to important are essentially all the same "stop the humans" only with varying wave numbers and a few human types with soon to be higher stats. Whatever strategy you had against weaker humans you can do the exact same thing against the stronger humans with stronger monsters in somewhat bigger numbers because the monsters you get aren't entirely different either aside from the stats when it comes to being useful in defending.\n\nThe landlord simulator part is at least more intriguing. The job is primarily housing interested monsters of your choosing and appealing to their tastes by adding or improving things in their apartment, sometimes specifically when needed as some monsters prefer having certain items in the room depending on their race and/or job.\nIt's a bit more taxing to house monsters when you have a certain race that's disliked by another race living in the same structure. You can still appeal to both but getting them to all be satisfied in their living quarters would take much longer.\nThere's a maximum of 3 vacancies per room where each vacancy specifically houses one tenant, that tenant's lover, and those two's child. So long as one tenant in a room is satisfied and alive they'll eventually find a lover and conceive a child who will also grow up for you to take money from. If the child dies another child will be conceived by the parents. If a parent dies the other parent will find another lover. If both parents die then the grown-up spawn will eventually find a lover of their own and eventually conceive their own child. I'm not sure what happens if both parents die while the child remains a child. As all the tenants in one room are old enough they usually find jobs of their own which is supposed to be a good incentive for raising their rent.\nThe room upgrading is incredibly bare & simple which leads to a few questionable things. For example upgrading a two-door fridge apparently grants the room a BBQ set and upgrading that gets it a built-in kitchen. You can buy a tenant a game console and/or a PC tower for their room but I find it a bit odd that you're not exactly buying it for them but for the room itself, and you don't even have to buy them a television for the consoles as far as I've seen.\nDepending on how fancy a room is and what the current tenant's job is you can adjust rent to their's and your pleasing. Certain monsters though are less likely to even want to pay rent even if you set it to an incredible low. You can evict them for being deadbeats, wait a bit longer to see if they come up with the money, or wait for them to run away from paying you.\n\nThe game itself sounds better off as an idle-game somewhat but unfortunately alt + tabbing even when the game's a small window pauses the entire thing. It was pretty nice trying to be a landlord for monsters but with how tediously bland progress is I can't entirely like the game even for its cheap price.","December 3, 2015","false","59.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

And the combat relies on your creatures actually being there, which sometimes they are not, and you're just screwed. And it doesn't even tell you in anyway that they are out or not unless you look into the rooms, which is incredibly inconvenient. Not to mention I think it's impossible when an attack is happening. So, click away and hope they are there. There is a bit of micro managing you can do whilst in combat, but not incredibly so. You can't go full Star Craft, kiting your foes to death without taking any damage. Also, the pacing just seems a bit off. I'm not sure what it is about it. Could be the health regen is incredibly slow, basically meaning you just have to sit there waiting before taking quests...doing nothing... I'm not too sure\nIt is fun.

Heros will attempt to sneak in and steal your gold, to counter them you will use the monsters who reside in your hotel. You’re residence is perfectly safe as long as they reside in the room and don’t come out to face the heros. Resources will deplete as a result, though there is no way to game over.\n\nMechanics\n+ Hotel Room placement matters\n+ Monsters give clear indicators of needs\n+ Monsters have families/jobs\n\nSeparating enemies by using the positions of hotel rooms is a good way to separate their forces and prevent tanks from protecting the glass-cannon type enemies. The monsters have a numerous weaknesses and strengths depending on how you use them, for example a long-range caster can be good for taking hits from magical spells with enough vitality since they have more magic resistance than your knights.\n\nMonsters will get a bonus to their stats depending on their mood. Clicking on their rooms will provide you feedback on how to improve their residence. The amount you can tax them depends on the value of the room itself. The higher the room value the more you can tax without them feeling like they are getting ripped off. Once you hit a certain point you will notice that the monsters cannot afford the hotel with the job occupations they have, so you will either have to lower it, until they can get a promotion or find more prominent monsters.\n\nMonsters can find lovers, and eventually make babies. Which also factors into how much they can afford apartment wise. So lowering it a bit after they make a baby until he becomes an adult and can hold a job is a recommended idea. Babies generally have superior stats to their parents so wanting to breed over and over again is recommended.\n\nGym equipment and combat both help increase the stats of your monsters. Increasing their happiness by fulfilling their needs and increasing the value of the apartments also lead to bonuses highlighted in blue that will give you big advantages.\n\nVisuals\nThe quests are arranged in 3 colors, red for main quest, green for unlocking monsters, and yellow for unlocking furniture. Only one quest will ever be red at any given time since its a single main quest, with various side quests you can accomplish. There are repeatable quests per hotel floor stage so you don’t have to worry about hitting a wall.","August 9, 2014","true","8.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

That could work, but it probably wouldn’t be nearly as fun as what Unholy Heights’ developers thought of.\n\n"The Devil’s spent his savings on a place in the projects!" is the line that opens the game. Satan now owns an apartment building, and has to bring monsters in as tenants to not only get some cash, but also to protect the place from foolish adventurers looking to slay him. Priorities, see, after all those folks are dead, and we’ve some money in the bank, then we’ll talk about that havoc, and about world domination.\n\nYou have a side view of the building. Whenever you’re attacked, the adventurer party will climb floor by floor, attempting to reach The Devil’s room, and you have to call on his tenants to prevent that from happening. When you're not under attack, you’ll need to recruit more tenants and keep them happy, so they’ll fight better and pay more rent. Of course, you aren’t above evicting them if they fail at either of those things.\n\nIt’s very engaging, not only because of the gameplay, but the cute cartoon-ish presentation keeps you attached to each monster as they form their families and advance in their careers. It’s hard not to like them, or not feel slightly saddened when they die or leave. But, back to mechanics, the engagement also owes a lot to the surprising amount of depth to the game.\n\nHigher tier monsters have to be unlocked, and each has its own demands for that to happen, demands which aren’t always simple to meet. As you unlock those monsters, you’ll also need to mind the room allocation for battle: some monsters can tank more hits while others work better shooting from afar. To say nothing of the stat growth mechanics.\n\nStill, you can learn most of it in a few hours, without worry. It is truly a gem of an indie game, bringing together management, tower defense and real-time strategy, and still remaining quite accessible. You will need to read guides if you go for 100% completion, but whether or not you decide to, Unholy Heights still offers incredible value for its low asking price of four dollars.","December 19, 2014","true","26.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Monsters are cute and presentation is acceptably straightforward. The strategy system is very arbitrary and cumbersome. Controlling your monsters in battle can be frustratingly tough because of the lack of any overlap, identical health bars for friendly and enemy, lack of hotkeys/hotgroups, stupid/unpredictable AI behavior, and no strategy interface to coordinate your forces or do anything complex. Upgrading apartments manually takes forever and often is counterintuitive because monsters will demand things they don't actually want or need and frequently when you satisfy requirements and make a really nice apartment the monster you just spent a lot of money pleasing will stop paying rent because now he can't afford it. These kinds of unnatural hurdles are everywhere in this game. Unique nouns in the game generally reference internet games and meme culture, as seems to be the popular tactic of late for flash games where the author doesn't want to do any creative work.\n\nOverall Unholy Heights is not really worth spending money on unless it is VERY cheap and you've got nothing better to do than explore simple flash games.

While battles are certainly an entrenched element of the game, there is also an engaging sim management scenario spreading gleeful cheer to every Devil-infested corner of your complex. Monsters come to join your army, following the tantalizing odors of rotting flesh and cheap rent. Centaurs, demons, fish-people, and anthromorphic chickens are just some of the entertaining cast; over yonder succubi are speedily mating, and that pig-man may actually be Jack the Ripper.\n\nAfter you get the tenants to settling in your economic housing opportunity, they start insisting on upgrades to their rooms, which is a marvelous opportunity to oblige and raise their rent. Money pours in, some tenants fall on hard times and are unable to pay, while others sneak off in the night to avoid their debts. It's all humorously presented, and the random enemies and quests you can send your nefarious, penny-penching residents on is just icing on the cake. Battles are usually relatively easy, with only a handful needing retrys.\n\nAll in all, Unholy Heights shouldn't be missed by those who adore catering to sims. Yes, hidden beneath the huggable chicken coating is a light, kinda tower defense game, but don't let that scare you off. This little gem is absolutely worth playing.","July 10, 2014","true","14.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","5"

The encounters start to lose their sheen, just clicking on doors and clicking on them again when trying to reorder them or when their health runs low.

The tenants are all very quirky and quite endearing; getting to hear them ‘pillow-talk’ is also hilarious.\n\nThe game itself is pretty straightforward (the how-to-play section is very helpful if you get stuck), but in mid-late gameplay it can start getting a little muddled when it comes to choosing tenants. For example, if you choose to have demi-humans in your apartment, it would not be wise to put demons in there as well (they hate each other). Though this doesn’t deeply affect your game, it does kind of suck if you like having a variety of monsters living in your apartment.\n\nCompared to some more traditional tower defense games, your tenants are the ones on the battle field and are likely to die. It’s important to keep an eye on them if there is a battle going on and get them to retreat if the opponent is too strong. One strategy I found helpful when fighting enemy casters was to turtle: attack (ranged), retreat into room (before unit gets hit), and attack again, etc. You do develop a bit of a play-style the more you play. Don’t forget to raise the satisfaction of your tenants as well, the bonuses are super helpful.","August 9, 2014","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Five generations they lived in one room. Occasionally a parent or child dying in the battle against the humans, only fuelling their rage in the next clash of leaf against blade. One day though, on a thundering night the youngest newborn Flowery lay cowering in the corner of his room, listening to his parents fighting outside his door. Screams, yells and finally silence, for no one returned to his room that day. His parents had fallen in battle, and left their mark on his soul.\nFast forward, and he's all grown up now, heading to get his first job and to my surprise he comes back with the title of 'Bondage Master'.\nThe next day he was promoted to 'Pimp'.\nHe's filling a void, I can tell.","November 25, 2015","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/recommended/249330/","GoldenHopper1983","Ryebread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenHopper1983/","205 products in account","Unholy Heights is like a proposal for a game: a combination of scaled-down elements from Dungeon Keeper (RTS) and Sim Tower (Management Sim). The entirety of it is short, combat is simple, and you'll be managing a smaller amount of units (48 at most) and always in the same area, but this game gives the enjoyment of building up an unconquerable core of trusted tenant-minions for a very reasonable price, more so during steam sales.\n\nYou are the landlord of an apartment of minions, and must manage their happiness to bolster their effectiveness against hordes of incoming adventurers. You start off small with one floor of four apartments. Each can have a single tenant who can eventually become part of a family of three, and as the game progresses, you can have a maximum of four floors with 48 tenants in your care and functioning as your defense. And if you want these tenants to be good at defending you, you have to keep them happy with appropriate furniture and compatible neighbours.\n\nThe RTS elements come into play when looting adventuring march straight for your landlord's office. To safeguard your money, you can call out your tenants who'll then head straight for the closest enemy and fight until A: he dies; B: it dies; or C: you tell it to retreat. You can apply advanced tactics with positioning (call out tenants at the right time to attack fragile supporting enemies) and attrition tactics (summon and recall tenants to wear down larger enemies). But ultimately, combat boils down to having a meaty tenant as a tank and throwing as many ranged and long-ranged tenants behind him to supply additional damage.\n\nHowever, this feels more like an experiment than a game: to test if the developer could make a game like this, and to test if a game like this can be enjoyed. Parts of the game are ambiguous (how happy will this furniture make this monster? how important is breeding in making stronger tenants?). Also, your tenants' movements (especially when they leave the building for work or play) are uncontrollable beyond calling them out of their apartments during invasions. As such, you may find frustration in unpredictably becoming shorthanded.\n\nIn the end, I still enjoyed Unholy Heights, though much more as a Sim than a RTS. The appeal in this game is building up your apartment army like a deck of cards, trying to keep your tenants alive and happy so your building becomes more attractive to  stronger kinds of tenants. The payoff comes when you have built up a full army so strong that no invading hero can ever best you, and you watch on in satisfaction when the world cedes control to your unstoppable forces.\n\nIf you want an affordable low-PC-requirements game to while away a few hours offline or on a long trip, and have a taste for simulation games with a monster-management twist, then I heartily recommend Unholy Heights as a delightful demonic diversion.\n\nAddendum: The game boasts a lot of mildly amusing flavor text (sometimes due to the random generation) as well: Big hairy yeti dominatrixes, werewolf chefs becoming culinary geniuses, and of course, many behind-closed-doors instances of your tenants "making" more tenants.","January 19, 2014","true","18.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's something I'd recommend as a casual game as it is the perfect blend of idly decorating rooms for cute little monsters and then panicking as you're overcome by waves of attacking heroes. You can drop in and out of quests at any time.\nOther things to do is trying to breed stronger creatures to keep upping your stats, getting them to move in with others to make the best trio you can, which is both frustrating and rewarding.\nAnd there's some achievements you probably need to play the game through at least twice to be able to get, which gives it replay value.\n...Plus the wallpapers you get are really nice?","December 24, 2013","true","29.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play as the landlord of an apartment building that houses monsters.  You can raise their rent, buy furniture and evict your tenants.  The happier you make them the stronger they will become.  Being a good landlord is key.  There are quests that require you to have your tenants fight off invading guilds.  The game is not too challenging as long as you keep all your tenants happy.

It's very much worth buying!\n\nUnholy Heights puts together Tower defense and Hotel management simulation in one game. As the The Devil, attract customers (monsters in the game) and manage your hotel. Decorate your rooms with items that'll make your customers happy and content. The happier your customers, the stronger they get. At some point of the game, you'll be battling adventurers using the residents of your hotel. Be it a demon, undead, werewolves,it's up to you what combination you'll take. Each type of monsters have their own attitude towards items in the room and their neighbors so it'll be a challenge to balance all them. I won't spoil much, the rest of the awesome things in this game is up to you to discover!\n\nMy Personal Highlights for the game:\n+ Has many events and interactions to discover.\n+ The genre is unique and new. (Tower Defense/Management/Strategy)\n+ Many monsters to unlock and to use.\n+ The game is cheap. (bought it when it went on sale)\n+ Has a great variety of missions. (Rarely redundant)\n+ Has good art and gameplay\n+ Highly Addictive game\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone who loves tower defense and management simulations. :D","December 1, 2014","true","10.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I got Unholy Heights when it was on sale for only $1, and that was money well spent! The residents are super cute and you grow to love them really fast, especially once they start having families. Certain ones can be very needy (or sketchy) depending on who you allow to live in your apartments. I fell in love with my residents that were little perverts all the time; it was just too funny! Although, I kind of felt sorry for my single residents that just read dirty magazines all the time and lacked the motivation/confidence to find a decent mate...nothing a big ol' heart balloon can't fix! Just remember to keep your residents happy - the more they like you, the better your reputation will be with their monster type, thus attracting stronger monsters to your apartments. Literally, the only thing that can be a pain in the a♥♥ at times, is if you have two monster types that hate each other living in the complex. It doesn't matter if they're on different floors or what, they'll just keep b♥♥♥♥ing about it until you do something. Like seriously, I wish there was a "just deal with it and shut up" option. But overall, it's a pretty fun game if you're looking for something casual to play. It does get increasingly difficult with each mission, so I'd just recommend saving after each victory (because some of your favorite residents can/will die if you're not careful). Even at regular price, this game isn't a bad deal. I can almost guarantee that anyone that plays Unholy Heights will get hooked.","October 21, 2015","true","49.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

There are interesting things to do and a lot of things do happen. You get to manage these residents among which random events take place, altough I do not like the tower defence part of the game- a bit redundant really. The management side of the game is really neat and fun to play because of the "random" events. Of course, they are mostly discoverable but hidden rules/agorithms but the initial novelty is still refreshing. For example, some of your tenants fall in love with each other and decide to move in together so they will withdraw one of the rooms. Some demons hate or hated by other species- they do not get along. But you get to manage this. If they decide to live together instead of two seperate rooms, you should raise the rent. All in all, if you get it in a dirt cheap bundle, it is totally worthwhile.","August 18, 2014","true","12.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The music and sounds are okay, nothing too special, although I personally like to mute the sounds in favor of my own.\n\nThe tutorial is quick and very helpful at showing you how every mechanic works. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, and it is easy to understand everything about the game with one or two short playthroughs. The pacing for the game is completely up to the player, as you can continue grinding until you wish to increase the difficulty (by purchasing the next floor for your apartment).\n\nIn the game, you play as the Devil, acting landlord of the Unholy Heights apartments. You can accept different monsters as tenants, and these units are called upon whenever you are attacked by adventurers. The monster types you can add as tenants increases as you progress through the game and build more floors (this also increases the overall difficulty).\n\nEach monster has different desires, and purchasing their requests (room upgrades, like better computers, fridges, etc) will result in a satisfaction boost. This is useful because you can then increase the rent a little without incurring a penalty. At high levels of satisfaction, monsters will have bonuses to their abilities.\n\nDuring battles, you can knock on doors to ask tenants to fight for you (this is an interesting mechanic, because monsters at work will be unavailable, however, monsters that are unemployed are also less likely to pay rent on time). Your monsters will fight in a line, so clicking on a monster who is about to die will allow them to retreat (and bring the next monster in line to the front). You can purchase one-time consumables (like health potions) that are used during battle and when a monster returns to his/her room. If you fail to kill an adventurer, he/she will take a percentage of your money - and escape with it if you are unable to kill them by the time they exit the screen. Saving often is encouraged, since you can have your entire tenant list destroyed if you make a mistake and/or do not plan accordingly.\n\nMonsters can also meet mates (usually if they are employed and have better rooms), adding another person to your defense cue. Eventually, the couple can reproduce, earning you a third monster for a single room. Being able to keep families alive and happy is a great way to increase both your revenue and defense rating.\n\nBy default, adventures will appear fairly infrequently, however, you can access missions for gold rewards - a difficulty rating and brief description gives you an idea of what to expect. In order to build the next floor for your apartment, you must defeat a boss mission and have enough gold (quite expensive, so grinding is recommended).\n\nOverall, the game is a nice, casual time filler.

You rent out rooms to certain species of demons as you gradually gain popularity among them and, as a result, get stronger demons to defend the apartments. Watching the demons live out their lives can put a smile on your face. Because of this feature it helps the player to connect and relate to their tenants. The missions themselves are relaitvely simple, usually involving the tenants protection you from humans.\n\nIf you have some spare change in your wallet, Unholy Heights is a worthwhile investment with several hours worth of gameplay with adorable and collectible monsters.","January 2, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At the end of the day I didn't like Unholy Heights and I don't think anyone is missing out by overlooking it.\n\nThe most unfortunate thing anyone can ever say of entertainment is that it's dull, bland and boring, which summarizes Unholy Heights pretty well.  Hell, I wouldn't even go so far as to say it's a game.  At best it plays out like a cell phone game.  The idea is that you're running an apartment complex for monsters and that idea seemed cool but there really isn't anything to it.  Monsters stop by and if they decide they want to stay, they will ask to move in, at which point you may either accept them or do nothing and just wait.  Eventually you'll fill up your apartment and start taking on 'quests,' where adventurers attack your apartment complex.  In order to defend against the attack you must knock on the doors of your tenants so that they come out and fight for you.  You have no control over combat, and each monster is either a ranged or melee attacker.\n\nWhat kills this game more than anything is the amount of waiting it requires.  There isn't gameplay, you just sit and wait for events to happen and then they do and that's it.  The amount of waiting is also fairly ridiculous if you're not using the speed up button.  Between each wave of a quest, you wait about a full minute or two for the next to begin.  That just isn't necessary.\n\nThe only 'growth' that your tenants receive is iffy at best.  Sometimes they'll find a mate and that person will move in with them, doubling the effective strength of each house (due to having two monsters).  Wait even longer and these monsters might have a child, furthering their effectiveness.  Beyond that, they work jobs -- so they're not always around for combat when you need them -- and pay rent.  Well, sometimes they pay rent.  Sometimes they just stop paying rent and then ditch in the middle of the night.  If that happens, or the tenant dies, you need to refill the room.  The trouble with this is when you lose people during a quest it severely cripples your ability to finish it, as you are unlikely to replinish your ranks much during the downtime.  You can raise the rent on the apartment or get the tenants better stuff, which allows you to raise their rent a little bit more.  Other than that, the only direct control you have on the game is sending out units to combat or returning them to their apartment during combat.\n\nThe premise of housing an apartment complex for monsters sounded interesting but there isn't any gameplay to speak of and I felt very much like I was wasting my time.  As cool as the mechanics may sound, they don't hold up in any way due to a lack of control.  Further, the ♥♥♥♥ing waiting, man.. that's just all the game is.  Don't bother with this one.","August 19, 2014","false","2.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Well, it's got some bits of micromanagement and a tad bit of combat mechanics. I'll go into much better detail below.\n\nTLDR here and at the bottom for convience \/\n\nTLDR; Overall, Unholy Heights is a fun micromanagement game with moderately deep but easy to understand combat mechanics (RTS), quirky (and sometimes adult) humor, and cute simplistic graphics. Despite a small language barrier, with a small amount of time the game is easily understood. Later parts of the game can get a bit grindy, so it's better suited for small bouts of play for some casual fun.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\nJust as a forewarning, the original developers' first language is not English. While the game is understandable and funny at times, this will be prevelant throughout the game. Some descriptions for items won't make sense. Explanations for important parts of the game are sometimes vague. I had to figure out a LOT by myself, and you will too since the Wiki (the only one I could find) is unfinished and doesn't shed much more light than the game. Luckily, it's not too hard but you will be scratching your head at first.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Unholy Heights, you are . . . well, Satan himself. And you run apartments. Ironically, you hardly ever see yourself in this game apart from the beginning and a picture when you hover over your manager room. Immediately, you get monsters that want to move in. Just move in all the cute little monsters and you'll be fine, right?\n\nWell, sorta. Other than taking care of these monsters, you have to fight off pesky humans that wander into your land. While the combat is a HUGE part of the game, it's fairly simple. Cilck on a door to bring out the monster you want to fight. If they're there, they'll come out. Of course, each monster has their own attributes to contribute to the fight (Range, attack type, and physical and magical defense).\n\nSome monsters have 'perks' with different positives, the most common with "Stronger at -insert day/night/weather". While this sounds like it makes battles more interesting, you can't predict the weather or when the humans arrive so relying on this will screw you over. Improving your 'strategy' (when and where you release your monsters when you have attackers) is what you'll be doing most of the time in concerns to combat. Once you have a solid one down, it's just boosting up your monsters to match the enemies and hoping the ones you need are there when you need them.\n\nThis is where the apartment bits come into play. To get stronger monsters, you have to improve their apartments and make them happy. The happier they are, the stronger they get. Other than the obviously stronger higher tier monsters (unlocked through raising your interest/respect/like for the Devil and through completing 'Quests'), you can get stronger monsters through a couple having a baby. Randomly, one of your monsters will get a lover, and after a random number of 'Pillowtalks' they'll have a baby. When the baby grows up, they'll have significantly stonger stats then their parents.\n\n"Reputation" with certain monster factions/races will play a part in what monsters you can use, house, and unlock. Some can't stand each other. Others worry about how well your treating your residents, while others focus on how often your resident die/how long they live. This means you may have to sacrifice one for the other, since their requirements will be the opposite of another. Once one faction hates you, don't expect to see them again unless you do something huge to get them to like you again. Once a faction likes you and you complete the quest, you unlock new and stronger tiers that have a new set of attributes and likes and dislikes on their apartment. It's very satisfying to unlock these new creatures able to use them and just brings new life to the game after you've played for a long while.\n\nHowever, getting the stronger monsters to match the quests you have available can take some time. The difficulty increase is moderately steep, so even if you have a solid strategy you'll be grinding small random encouters to make money, waiting for rent to be paid, satisfy your monsters, and hopefully have them have babies. It's all random, so you'll be sitting there with the highest speed on waiting for things to happen. Hopefully you have a second monitor to watch things on; the game 'pauses' when you alt tab in both Fullscreen and Windowed mode. Luckily, watching your residents as they go about their life can be pretty entertaining, but even then you should probably take a break from this game every once and awhile to not get burned out on it.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nTLDR; Overall, Unholy Heights is a fun micromanagement game with moderately deep but easy to understand combat mechanics (RTS), quirky (and sometimes adult) humor, and cute simplistic graphics. Despite a small language barrier, with a small amount of time the game is easily understood. Later parts of the game can get a bit grindy, so it's better suited for small bouts of play for some casual fun.","December 14, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I found myself playing it for hours, and I liked the fact you were renting out the aparetments. It brought a whole 'nother element to the game than just battling, and I spent a lot more time balancing rents and getting monsters to breed than actually figting. Though it's really simple at first, you have to take a much more strategetic aproach as it goes on if you want to win, and I spent at least an hour and a half setting up my complex for the final battle. Actually figuring out the strategy is a bit hit and miss, and learning how to do things like getting people out of rent-debt is something you have to figure out on your own, but I enjoyed that. Did I mention it's adorable? It's really, really adorable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/249330/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Unholy Heights is certainly an interesting game... I've never played anything like it, but then again, I'm not very familiar with the Japanese indie scene.\n\nWell, you can certainly say that it's a very Japanese game. You're Devil, and you're managing an Hotel, gathering monsters to defend it, and eventually conquer the world, after "Natural" selection does its job.\nBasically, you'll have to buy more and better furniture for their rooms, satisfying each monster's necessities. For example, fiery monsters require hot temperatures, while icy monsters require cold. There are a variety of items you'll have to buy to satisfy each creature, but the learning process is gradual and pretty good, honestly.\n\nYou set the pace of the game by when you accept quests, and also have 3 different speed that you can switch between easily. There are 3 or 4 tiers, each one adding a floor to your hotel. Between the transition, you'll have repeatable quests to grind gold, basically. With each tier, the game gets harder, and you'll also get more money.\n\nIt's a very linear progression system in that way.\n\nThe game itself was fun at first, but seemed to get really repetitive later on, especially if you don't understand the creatures very well. Since they all start out weak, it also doesn't encourage experimentation very much (with the exception of the tier transition, in which you'll have to hire different monsters -- experiment then!).\n\nStill, what makes it shine is the flavour. Each monster is trying to get a profession as well as a love partner and have kids. And all of that has text associated with it. They're always performing actions as well, like "reading erotic magazines" or "engaging in pillow-talk". It's weird. But it's also unique, and certainly stands out for that.\n\nThe combat itself is very simple, but it has some depth to it, in the order that you send in your monsters by range, HP, and even the position of their own room can be important. The game got pretty hard by the end, but I was probably not playing optimally. There is room for advanced strategy and min-maxing, but it's not a necessity.\n\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a casual, but quirky game, you should give this one a try! For 4€ it's certainly worth it.","June 7, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Highly based off of simulation, the mechanics reminded me of many similar games I've played like it in the past, especially games from like Kairosoft, whom produces games on the iOS.\n\nBy upgrading rooms, adjusting rent, and hiring tenants that come every now and then, you can form an army of monsters that you then click to fight enemies that come in and try to steal your stuff. It's extremely repetitive, gave it some time before I couldn't even be bothered to open it again.\n\nWhether or not the four dollars is worth it is up to you.\n\nGot boring within an hour for me though.","December 13, 2013","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, wish no more because you can now fulfil that dream in Unholy Heights.\nIn Unholy Heights, you are the devil himself (think less horns and pitchfork and more fat middle-aged man) and you strive for world domination. How might you accomplish this? Well, what better way than to recruit demons to fight for you! They won’t do this for free, of course, and so you must provide a suitable apartment with livable conditions. In exchange, they will protect you and fight off any pesky villagers that try to take you down.\n\nPart Sim Tower and part tower defence, Unholy Heights is a charming little indie game made by four-dev team Petit Depotto. Each demon have their own stats (sword attack/magic attack/magic defence/sword defence), can find mates and even have a baby. To keep them satisfied and rent paid, you must buy them the furniture they desire. Some are logical. Ice mage needs cold air conditioning. Some are just a bit silly. I mean really, what flower demon needs a $5,000 computer?! But this is part of Unholy Heights appeal. The demons are simple 2D sprites but the artists blend cute with creepy to make the demons almost lovable. The sky and mountain background look pretty although a bit boring and with the added weather effects, which have an affect on your demons’ stats, change the day and night up a bit, however not enough to really notice.\nThe look of your apartment block changes with each upgrade and eventually you can transform your shabby shack to a beautiful Japanese palace. These upgrade changes are a nice touch to keep you playing.\n\nThe background music is soothing enough to be mostly unnoticeable but when two demons are, pardon my French, making babies, there is a high pitched noise which made my ears bleed enough for me to mute the entire game. It’s probably best you listen to music while playing this game because those demons bonk like there’s no tomorrow.\n\nThe gameplay is simplistic and can become repetitive but you can often find yourself stuck in a bad situation when, for example, some villagers attack while your best demons are at work.\nThe Steam version has two interesting achievements which add some much needed challenges - one for not evicting any tenants and one for not letting any tenants die. Doing both of these at once made the game much harder, as you’d expect. However, there was a loophole in which you can simply raise the rent enough that your demons would just move out. This doesn’t get counted as evicting them and frankly, is necessary if you try to attempt these challenges. While demons get stat bonuses when they are satisfied with their rooms, they don’t level up and this makes it impossible to keep your original tenants to the final battle. That being said, over time new tenants come along and it’s just as fun trying to collect each set of demons as it is fighting waves of enemies.\n\nFor such a small development team, Unholy Heights is quite impressive. This blend of Simulation and Tower Defence is a combination that works well together. I would really have liked more career options or at least a way to see how much each demon was earning so I could adjust the rent accordingly and being able to see what rooms look like rather than just picking furniture the demons wanted would have been nice too.  I hope these features get added in an update or DLC at some point but that’s probably wishful thinking. Priced at $5 on Steam, Unholy Heights may not be the best value game out there but I got an enjoyable 15 hours or so out of it and I’d definitely recommend picking it up.","November 6, 2013","true","19.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

At the end of the day I didn't like Unholy Heights and I don't think anyone is missing out by overlooking it.\n\nThe most unfortunate thing anyone can ever say of entertainment is that it's dull, bland and boring, which summarizes Unholy Heights pretty well.  Hell, I wouldn't even go so far as to say it's a game.  At best it plays out like a cell phone game.  The idea is that you're running an apartment complex for monsters and that idea seemed cool but there really isn't anything to it.  Monsters stop by and if they decide they want to stay, they will ask to move in, at which point you may either accept them or do nothing and just wait.  Eventually you'll fill up your apartment and start taking on 'quests,' where adventurers attack your apartment complex.  In order to defend against the attack you must knock on the doors of your tenants so that they come out and fight for you.  You have no control over combat, and each monster is either a ranged or melee attacker.\n\nWhat kills this game more than anything is the amount of waiting it requires.  There isn't gameplay, you just sit and wait for events to happen and then they do and that's it.  The amount of waiting is also fairly ridiculous if you're not using the speed up button.  Between each wave of a quest, you wait about a full minute or two for the next to begin.  That just isn't necessary.\n\nThe only 'growth' that your tenants receive is iffy at best.  Sometimes they'll find a mate and that person will move in with them, doubling the effective strength of each house (due to having two monsters).  Wait even longer and these monsters might have a child, furthering their effectiveness.  Beyond that, they work jobs -- so they're not always around for combat when you need them -- and pay rent.  Well, sometimes they pay rent.  Sometimes they just stop paying rent and then ditch in the middle of the night.  If that happens, or the tenant dies, you need to refill the room.  The trouble with this is when you lose people during a quest it severely cripples your ability to finish it, as you are unlikely to replinish your ranks much during the downtime.  You can raise the rent on the apartment or get the tenants better stuff, which allows you to raise their rent a little bit more.  Other than that, the only direct control you have on the game is sending out units to combat or returning them to their apartment during combat.\n\nThe premise of housing an apartment complex for monsters sounded interesting but there isn't any gameplay to speak of and I felt very much like I was wasting my time.  As cool as the mechanics may sound, they don't hold up in any way due to a lack of control.  Further, the ♥♥♥♥ing waiting, man.. that's just all the game is.  Don't bother with this one.","August 19, 2014","false","2.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

From the art style (which is childish and colourful)  to the BGM, this game screams cute. It's simple enough to pick up and put down whenever, but just complicated enough to make you growl in frustration because the skirmishes with heroes can take some planning as your residents sometimes disappear when you need them most.\n\nThe difficulty of skirmishes is surprisingly high and will call for actual strategic planning as well as a bit of luck. It's advisable to save your game frequently, especially if you're out to get through the game without losing a single resident, and use your money wisely. This sort of time and resource management is both in-depth and simple--a series of trials and errors that will leave you with a feeling of great satisfaction once you've figured out the perfect balance.\n\nBonus fact: did I mention there are cards? And the art for those are wonderful. I'll probably be getting the level five badge for this game because they are easily my favourite (art wise).\n\nUnholy Heights is quirky, clever, and will have you smiling and nodding your head at its (not-so) subtle references.

Between the tedious gameplay, lack of control, and disdain for story, it just ends up being an unenjoyable game.\n\nYou're the devil, you run an apartment building, you use your tenants to ward off invaders. Your tenants pay rent, but it's a pittance. The only way to get a decent amount of money is to take on quests. Doing a quest is the difference between making 10-15g for a set of enemies and 400g for often the same enemies, but because you clicked the quest on the quest board, they're now worth more. But the quests are really short, so you have to go into the quest board and click quests over and over again to earn gold.\n\nThen there's the rent. If your tenants fall behind in their rent, they'll leave. Sometimes this means your strongest monster goes away, so there's not much incentive to charge decent rent, particularly given how long it can take you to fill an apartment up to full capacity. A full capacity apartment is preferable because it's more monsters to fight off enemies, If a full-capacity apartment falls behind on rent, you risk having to go back to a single occupant and waiting for it to get back to full occupancy. So you basically end up charging your tenants almost nothing -- and sometimes nothing! -- just to get them to stay in the building.\n\nThe game also forces your first tenant to be a low value character. If you want the achievement, you won't evict him, despite the fact he's pretty worthless.\n\nThen there's the storytelling. All the monsters have names, jobs, and living in your apartment building, they build families. Don't get attached, though! Because the game doesn't care about telling stories. I watched the parents of a child be killed because of me, leaving me with a room occupied by an orphan, who immediately fell behind in rent, and then had to run away. (I didn't get the rent turned down to "free" quickly enough.) Just, tragic. I get that you're supposed to be playing as the devil, but you're also supposed to be appeasing your monsters to make them happy. It's such a disconnect.\n\nNext, the giant uptick in difficulty when you add a second floor to the building. The game isn't joking when it says to save before you do it. In the Starbound beta, there is a similar thing that happens when you build an item that summons the first boss. It drives people up the wall because you're running around making progress and suddenly this boss appears without warning and it's harder to beat than you could have ever expected, so the first few times, you just die and often times lose some elabroate structure you built in the process.\n\nUnholy Heights does this. But the thing is, the only reason it's like that in Starbound is because that game is in beta! It's not fully worked out yet! Unholy Heights is a finished game that does this to you. It's just not well-balanced to allow for the casual gameplay it uses.\n\nAnd that's another thing -- the game is clearly styled as something casual, you have very little control over combat aspects, but then you have things like the first big boss, which seems to want to make the game into a vicious timing strategy monster. It's inconsistent.\n\nThe graphics aren't bad, but they aren't great.\n\nAll in all, not a game I'd really recommend to people. It's too hard for casual gamers, and too casual for hardcore gamers. And so tedious and repetitive!","February 25, 2014","false","3.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/recommended/249330/","MuirDragonne","Muir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/","1290 products in account","Brief synopsis: Extremely cute game. You're the Devil. The Devil is a landlord of an apartment complex. Monsters and Demons are your tenants. Fight off the guilds and the heroes  and build your complex to the skies!\n\nProper review:\n\nStory: The story in this game can't really be called a story. Instead, I'd call it a "plot".\n\nYou've got the devil who has decided to open an apartment complex in "The projects". You start off with a delapidated, one story building with 4 apartments. Monsters and demons of various types and abilities move in.\n\nSoon, local adventurers hear about this and decide they need to rid the world of the evil there. Defeating these adventurers gives you money to improve your apartments as well as unlocking different and stronger monsters.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are simple, yet charming. The game itself only has one setting - The Devil's apartment building. One would think that this would get boring after awhile, but it oddly doesn't. I think that's because things are constantly changing. Sometimes it's nice and sunny, other times it's raining. There's also a day and night cycle. These changes happen quickly enough so that you don't get bored, but not too quickly. Also, there are speed up time buttons which also help.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The music is fairly decent and upbeat. The best song, in my opinion, is the one which plays during the end "credits" (which are well worth watching). The sound effects do get tiresome and annoying after awhile, but it's easily overlooked.\n\nLength: It took me about 24 hours to complete the game, though I tend to play games slowly as a personal preference. Others have finished the game in around 7-8 hours. Even if you only get 6 hours out of the game, it's still worth the asking price.\n\nReplayability: After beating the game, a "Free Battle Mode" is unlocked in the options menu which makes the game somewhat replayable. There are also achievements which you probably won't be able to get during your first playthrough which helps add to the replayability of the game (assuming you like achievements).\n\nOverall, if you like more "casual" games or are looking for a game which you can play in short increments and come back to later, this is definitely a game which you might like.\n\nMy advice: Try the demo and if you like it, buy it! :)","November 9, 2013","true","24.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You play as the Devil who invests in an apartment complex with your tenants being monsters of various types, grouped into seven different races.  Each type of monster is acquired differently and brings different abilities into the fold.  These abilities and the different roles are shared by monsters from different races.  Want a monster with lifesteal but not to kill so many tenants to get the Vampire?  Don't worry, zombies can steal life too!  Need a tank?  You can find one in almost every race!\n\nThe game does feel limited and at some point it got to feel repetitive.  The quests are almost all the same except in what adventurers attack you.  When you're not doing quests then most of your time is spend managing the apartment complex which consist of either buying the right furniture and amenities to please your tenants or doing what little you can to influence who lives where (moving people in is easy compared to trying to get one tenant to move in with another tenant).  However, if you like management games like I do, then this game is worth picking up, especially if it's on sale!","December 18, 2014","true","35.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has somewhat of an Animal Crossing feel to it, where the overall look and feel of the game is cutesy, and mentally engaging.\n\nYou play as the Devil, and you've somehow gone and blown all your money. So what does the ruler of the underworld gotta do to make a load of money? Naturally, it's become a landlord. Before long, you'll have monsters moving into your four apartment block, and you'll have to tend to their furniture needs whilst fighting off various 'good guy' types that come to try and thwart your money-making plan.\n\nEventually, things start getting a tad busy - you begin to have multiple floors in your block, and tougher invaders will start showing up. I found myself truly exploring my devilish side when this started happening - monsters that live in your apartments have the capacity to skip out on the rent you set for them, and I thought 'well, if they're not paying up I'll just send them into battle first. And they won't get the furniture they ask for.'. Not before long, you've got lavish rooms that act as bait for 'cannon fodder' monsters - ones that don't seem to do well. From then on, you're in between taking up various challenges from the quest board, and maintaining your monster's satisfaction, since they will gain power based on how happy they are.\nThe concept sounds simple enough, but beleive me Petit Depotto certainly did not skimp out on any detail of this game. Monsters can attract mates, engage in...er..'pillowtalk', have kids, go to work, do the housework, go for a walk, play outside...it's a very clever comedic factor when you click on a room and see one of your monsters are 'reading an erotic fanfiction' or 'sexually harrassing a pop star', and injects a very 'slice of life' feeling into the game: you see these monsters have lives, and fight, and love - you're the Devil, doing his everyday administration. The whole concept is a very cute, 'a day in the life of' thing, and is bound to put a smile on your face when you play it.\nThe music alone leaves me grinning at the monitor like an idiot.\n\nOverall, this is creativity in indie gaming to the maximum - a solid, novel twist on the tower defence type game and beautiful to experience. The art is like it's straight out of a picture book and envelopes the player with warmth, but when the going gets tough, you gotta be prepared to flex your brain muscles. If you're a fan of action-micromanagement games like Plants vs. Zombies and Recettear, then this is for you.","August 10, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some issues with the saved games disappearing though, and...\n\nI had a pretty big issue with not being able to get any of the demi-human class at all aside from the first one, since I played a lot of demons early on, and even with hours and hours of effort specifically trying to get even ANY of the demi-humans, I was still unable to get them, which was really disappointing, and considering the most powerful class in the game is a demi-human, it was a bummer. I think it's a bug with the ratings system, but nobody ever made an effort to fix or patch it.\n\nStill, an enjoyable game. Hopefully someone fixes the bug.","April 23, 2014","true","30.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Apparently you are the devil who is managing an expanding apartment. Human thieves, wizards, martial artists and other wannabe heroes will charge towards your apartment to try and steal your money. How heroic.\nApparently your apartment is well-known among cute monsters and demons from around, since they will come to your apartment looking to move in. Some more picky than others.\nOnce they move in you can ask them to fight off human invaders whenever they attack.\nDealing with these tenant however can be demanding, depending on the amount of rent you charge per room they may be satisfied or not. They also ask you for furniture and equipment all the time. Apparently these demons, while having jobs, are incapable of buying any furniture themselves, so they just complain to you. Maybe they are just too lazy to move that stuff in.\nA lot of the furniture they require can be quite unusual, but considering that these aren’t your nice grandmas next door, that is to be expected.\nTo pay for these outrages furniture requests you will have to wait for the tenants to pay rent every day or do quests, which involves groups of humans attacking your apartment.\nSome tenants will stop paying rent over time for various reasons and if their debt gets too big they might also flee in the dead of night.\nThe game shows you what kind of jobs your tenants have whenever you hover over one, and also shows you what they are doing right now. Since you don’t actually see your tenant doing their jobs (they just leave the apartment), the game designers got clever with the amount and variety of the jobs the tenants can have. The same is true for the activity they are currently engaged in, since you only know they are in their room and you cannot actually see what going on. So you can have a snail creature which has a job as an ice cream truck driver and likes to read up on magic spells in his free time.\n\nPotential tenants come and look at free apartments all the time, so there is no danger of running out, however tenants grow stronger over time depending on satisfaction.\nFamilies can grow over time too: A apartment shopping person may choose to live with another bachelor tenant and over time these couple may have a child. There are also items that accelerate this progress. This can be important because you only have a fixed amount of rooms but with couple or even families you can double and even triple the amount of tenants fighting for you.\n\nThere are many different types of tenants and if you treat each group well, stronger tenants of those groups will come to look at your apartment.\n\nThe controlsceme is easy to use, you can only use the mouse or use the keyboard for some short cuts like speeding up the game and slowing it down.\nAfter a short while of learning the interface it works fine, even some of the elements can be slight unintuitive.\n\nThe graphics are very appealing. Each monster race has cute looking artwork of it walking, waiting, fighting and what have you.\n\nThe only thing I could really criticize about this game is the auditory side of it. There are hardly any interesting sounds. Seeing as there are all these different kinds of monster, demons, devils, humans and whatnot you would expect some cute sounds to go along with it. However many sounds are reused and the sound really never changes throughout the game. The music is playing the whole game as well, however it is comfortable enough.","August 31, 2014","true","19.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jankanpo/recommended/249330/","jankanpo","Fox! ϡpeace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jankanpo/","597 products in account","This game is only $4!\n\nWithin the first day of owning this game, I played it about 12 hours straight through just learning how everything works.  If you watch the trailer, you can instantly see how adorable this game is, although the trailer doesn't exactly show how perverted your tenants are going to be.\n\nThis game is an independant release from Japan, that got translated and ported over through steam.  It plays out like a silly tower defense game, as well as an apartment and romance simulator at the same time.  The happier your tenants are, the stronger their stats will be for you to fight through waves of enemies.  Battles in this game takes a unique twist as you can knock on your tenants doors to summon them to fight, which you can use to micro them to stop the people invading your apartment without getting everyone killed.\n\nUnholy Heights actually has endless replayability as there are actually leaderboards in this game to challenge others in fastest game completion time.  The game only progresses when you go through the main storyline missions, and since there's repeatable quests, you can actually prolong any part of the game if you just want to breed monsters or customize rooms since you collect rent money.\n\nThe rent system is kind of dumb though, as a lot of the monsters will inexplicably run out of money, no matter if they are unemployed or have a job as a CEO.  You don't get THAT much money from rent, even at end game, but it does build up over time, and it does give a different method of earning money if the current quests are too difficult for you.\n\nEither way, this game is a steal at $4 from its humor, graphics, music, and gameplay, and I reccomend everyone try it out if they want something cute and fun to play for a few hours! :3","October 11, 2013","true","16.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A fusion of monster-breeding / tower defence, the cutesy graphics and quirky soundtrack add a touch of whimsy to the game. You basically spend your time managing your growing apartment, earning income to see to the needs of your population of tenants. Each race of tenants has their own demands and even ongoing racial rivalries that will require you to pick and choose who or what you want to stay and adds a touch of replayability.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the game though, it plays very much like a semi-idle game as some events like breeding, getting a house-mate and even a tenant you want are so random that you sometimes find yourself leaving the game running for hours. This would be okay if the game could run in the background while you do other things like surf or do your homework, but it does not. The feature of the game auto-pausing when the window is not active might ordinarily be a good thing, but in this case it only makes gameplay a little tedious since you become a prisoner of the window.\n\nAll in all, it makes for an interesting way to burn a few hours, but not if you like multitasking on your computer.","April 5, 2014","true","21.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's well worth the price and has plenty of (admittedly grind-y) content.\n\nYou start off with a little run down apartment building which can house five tenants and their potential families. You are landlord Satan (can you blame me for the pun), and it's your goal to upgrade the building, bleed your tenants as dry as you can, and eventually conquer the world. But that takes both money AND reliable tenants. By reliable, I mean they must not only pay rent on time, but also be capable of defending the complex from human would-be-heroes.\n\nCombat is very much tower-defense if instead of "towers vs. advancing units" it was just "units vs. units." Each potential tenant has different abilities: the centaur is an archer, the skeleton is a melee, there's a snail with a house for a shell that launches rockets (don't ask)... What's more, to unlock more units you have to please the various factions each unit belongs to. The undead like repeated victories in combat, demons like it when you send people to their pointless, cannon-fodder deaths, chimera appreciate it when you make sure everyone's happy... Some of these factions conflict in what they like, too, meaning you're going to have to pick which faction to hedge your bets on.\n\nThough the name pool for your tenants is surprisingly limited (I saw a lot of repeats), you'll find yourself getting pretty attached to some of the families in your apartments. Couples can have children, and children can grow up to be adult monsters as well. Your single tenant can potentially grow into a family of three of the same unit. As a plus, the more working adults are within the family, the higher rent they can pay, plus the easier it is for them to work their way out of debt, meaning you usually won't have to evict them.\n\nThe only cons of this game from what I've played of it are the grinding (can take a long time to grind up needed gold so you can invest in good apartments/expand them) and how easily it is early on to be susceptible to full wipes. If you've just started the game and are getting frustrated, my advice is 1) do the water witch quest after upgrading the apartment for the first time, 2) make sure to net a couple demihumans, they pay higher rents, and 3) don't feel pressured to take quests you're not ready for. This game is a slow burner, and if you try to rush through it it burns you in return.\n\nIn the end, this game is simple enough for a time waster yet complex enough to be enjoyable. It's well worth full price, and if it ever goes on sale for less, that's a steal. I definitely recommend it to anyone, unless you're just really, really impatient, in which case this game might not be for you.","March 31, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay consists of waves coming after you and trying to take your stuff, to which you respond by knocking on the doors of your tenants to get them to fight for you. As you do.\n\nThe Art is nice and cute, the music keeps you in the moment without being grating, and the gameplay loop is so satisfying it's hard to put the game down once you start. The variety of monsters is another high point. There are your basic elementals, monsters and skeletons, but also Succubi, furries, antropomorphic animals and even the Great Old Ones themselves. Also chicks (of the chiken variety). You'll have to play through the game multiple times to see all of the monsters though, which raises the replay value.\n\nThe game is just chock full of charm, from the quirky music to your tenant's various jobs and relationships. Your tenants can even fall in love and have kids! (d'aww)\n\nIt's not the longest game in the world, with a regular playthrough clocking in at well under 10 hours, but as I mentioned there's a fair bit of replay value.\n\nIt's not an unforgettable experience, but it's a nice, relaxing bit of fun that also scratches a certain kind of itch for cute, but also surprisingly difficult.

You play as the Devil who decides to become a landlord one day, when in truth, you're planning to conquer the world. How? By tricking monsters as your tenants annd turning them into your personal army of soldiers of course. It's pretty silly. And that's as far as the story goes.\n\nThere are various monster types and tiers, each with different tastes, wants and needs. Fulfill what they want and their satisfaction goes up and their stats are boosted too. Eventually your monsters grow more powerful and fight more powerful enemies. Typical game structure you'd expect.\n\nBut this isnt just a tower defense game. What makes the game special really, is the "Sims" aspect of it. After all, the monsters arent staying to fight, they need to make a living too. You can keep informed on a plethora of small things like what each monster is doing, see how they're doing, where are they, their jobs, occupation and their activities.\nMonsters can also sleep, eat, play, even find partners, make love and bear babies. Don't bother thinking on how monsters like skeletons are even capable of reproducing, they just do.\n\nOn the more important aspect of gameplay, Unholy Heights does disappoint me slightly with how the game turned out. Controls are a little frustrating to deal with, such as when trying to select a specific monster. Combat isn't so refined and in fact, feels unfair given how the only control you have over the monsters is to retreat or attack.  The 2D platform also gives rise to limitations and cheap exploits, like cornering an enemy and glitching the AI to be indecisive on which direction to attack.\n\nMany things are also based on luck and coincidence and this is where things can sometimes get a little frustrating. You could wait for countless hours and still not have some of your monsters refusing to give birth. The monsters freely entering and exiting the house whenever they like is another thing that sucks. Get into a battle but your useful monsters just happen to be away? You're deadmeat. About to get into battle but your useful monsters decide to leave the house half-way in? You're deadmeat.\nOr what annoys me the mos: when some of your weaker monsters suddenly return back home during a battle. Sometimes they're stacked in a row stretching so far away, you cant even see them on the screen. If they meet a more powerful enemy head-on, you're helplessly screwed.\n\nIn Unholy Heights. everything runs down to what matters most: Money. Money is generated primarily from rent income, but this makes for easy exploiting. Get a stable income and just wait in-game without doing anything for hours and you'll find yourself rich automatically, although this will put you at odds with a few monster types.\n\nAll in all, regardless of a few problems... most of which I'm probably just nitpicking at, this game is actually pretty darn great. It doesn't exactly feel fun but like any decent casual game, it can definitely be addicting to play. Almost too addicting for me.\nPerhaps it's the simplicity of the game, or how you can just lay back and do nothing while watching your monsters live their lifes, have sex everyday and make babies.","October 13, 2015","true","19.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's well worth the price and has plenty of (admittedly grind-y) content.\n\nYou start off with a little run down apartment building which can house five tenants and their potential families. You are landlord Satan (can you blame me for the pun), and it's your goal to upgrade the building, bleed your tenants as dry as you can, and eventually conquer the world. But that takes both money AND reliable tenants. By reliable, I mean they must not only pay rent on time, but also be capable of defending the complex from human would-be-heroes.\n\nCombat is very much tower-defense if instead of "towers vs. advancing units" it was just "units vs. units." Each potential tenant has different abilities: the centaur is an archer, the skeleton is a melee, there's a snail with a house for a shell that launches rockets (don't ask)... What's more, to unlock more units you have to please the various factions each unit belongs to. The undead like repeated victories in combat, demons like it when you send people to their pointless, cannon-fodder deaths, chimera appreciate it when you make sure everyone's happy... Some of these factions conflict in what they like, too, meaning you're going to have to pick which faction to hedge your bets on.\n\nThough the name pool for your tenants is surprisingly limited (I saw a lot of repeats), you'll find yourself getting pretty attached to some of the families in your apartments. Couples can have children, and children can grow up to be adult monsters as well. Your single tenant can potentially grow into a family of three of the same unit. As a plus, the more working adults are within the family, the higher rent they can pay, plus the easier it is for them to work their way out of debt, meaning you usually won't have to evict them.\n\nThe only cons of this game from what I've played of it are the grinding (can take a long time to grind up needed gold so you can invest in good apartments/expand them) and how easily it is early on to be susceptible to full wipes. If you've just started the game and are getting frustrated, my advice is 1) do the water witch quest after upgrading the apartment for the first time, 2) make sure to net a couple demihumans, they pay higher rents, and 3) don't feel pressured to take quests you're not ready for. This game is a slow burner, and if you try to rush through it it burns you in return.\n\nIn the end, this game is simple enough for a time waster yet complex enough to be enjoyable. It's well worth full price, and if it ever goes on sale for less, that's a steal. I definitely recommend it to anyone, unless you're just really, really impatient, in which case this game might not be for you.","March 31, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unholy Heights is a classic monster-breeding game. You invite in monsters, improve their stats, have generations of children, and occasionally fight off heroes who want to rob you of your hard earned rent monies.\n\nIf you don't enjoy spending hours on end trying to coax monsters into breeding with one another, you should probably avoid this one. It can be won without monster breeding, but it's really hard.\n\nThe game deliberately doesn't tell you a lot of the secrets you'll want to know to breed up great monsters. In that respect, it follows in the footsteps of Monster Rancher, Viva Pinata, and other games of the sort that left you scrambling for a comprehensive Guide. This has been folks' biggest complaint about the title, which seems silly as a lot of the stuff most reviewers complain about is actually documented in the game (It tells you right up front in the Bestiary, for example, that Abyssals and Chimerae hate one another. Or that Demons are only happy when lots of residents are dying all the time).\n\nIt's cute, cheap, and hours of fun. If you're a fan of the genre, buy this when it's under $5.

Even at the end because I didn't want my tenants to 'run' away, I simply set all the rent to like some horribly low number. Boring game.\n\nIt felt like every 'important' quest that had to be finished, you would just throw all your guys at the enemy... and when it's all said and done rehire everyone and wait until everyone made babies.\n\nNutshell:\nCute graphics and the beginning of the game was ok/fun.

And the ending is a bit anti-climatic.\nThe saving grace that kept me from not recommending this game is the monster. They are... lovable... and that's why it's even more heart breaking to see some of them "dying" or "lost" in the end.\nThe ending is somewhat randomly generated, and who does what has not much to do with their combat ability or job or how long their family has been in the game without death/eviction. I saw some of my favorite and most powerful tenants died... sigh.

Does the game look good?\n2. Is the game too hard for me to play?\n3. When I shut the game down is that the last time?\n\nSadly I can't give my recommendation to this game. Though it's an original concept with cute graphics, the gameplay does ths one in.\n\nVisually the game looks good, with a one screen premise and tons of cute 8-bit style characters. The pics on the store page give you an idea of the style, but therein lies the frustration.\n\nDifficulty-wise, this game is too hard to be a casual management sim and lacks a controls scheme in order to be a good button masher. I've tried TWENTY different times with different strategies to get to one expansion on the apartment building and I honestly don't think at this point that it can be done, No combination of monsters will beat the first boss unless I'm just impatient and not letting it run on its own for a few days in order to build up my monsters, all of whom seem to be unemployed and missing rent payments. Very frustrating when you just want to see what the game has to offer at early levels and can't get past the first stage.\n\nReplay value is a toss up. Like I said, I've given this one plenty of chances and I'm either too dumb to figure it out based on the instructions given or the game just isn't coded to be friendly to a new player (which is a problem a lot of games have these days). For me to go back for more, a developer has to make me feel as though I'm successful in the early part of the game so that I'll fight when it gets tough.\n\nNice try and worth a look in the bargain bin, but at full price give it a pass unless the developers come back with some gameplay fixes or some serious content.","August 2, 2015","false","3.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zameryth/recommended/249330/","zameryth","Zameryth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zameryth/","134 products in account","Unholy Heights is a simple tower defense game. It focuses on you, as the devil, renting out apartment spaces to other monsters that just want to live a normal life but are constantly attacked by people. The art design really caught my attention when I decided to play this game. However, that alone was not able to sustain my interest.\n\n-Lack of customization. It'd be great if you could change the aesthetic look of the apartment to your liking. It'd also be great if you can look into each individual room and arrange the furniture. Instead, we're stuck looking at the outside view of the apartment.\n-Monsters grow stronger only if they are satisfied with their room. There should be more options available than this.\n-Battles are random encounters with unsatisfying rewards.\n-If you're being attacked and some tenants aren't there because they're at work or school, then it makes it more difficult for you. Without a lot of depth in monster growth and gameplay, it's frustrating.\n-There needs to be a time system in game. I don't know when my tenants leave or when they come back. It would help greatly in planning when to do quests.\n-Progress is random. You don't know when your tenant will get a spouse or a raise at work. Sometimes, it took long for me, sometimes it only took me a few minutes.\n-Quests are very boring. There aren't any unique quests other than defeating enemies.\n-There's no way to heal your tenants. When you get couples, they spend so much time doing "pillow talking" and it reduces their health. With this occurring randomly, it's difficult to plan out random encounters or doing quests.\n-The siren is loud, annoying and unnecessary.\n-Realistically, the more time you put into the game, the more successful you will be. Most of the game is random and there's no strategy to it like other tower defense games.\n\nI'm disappointed because I expected a lot from this game. There was so much potential that was not utilized. If you enjoy casual gaming, then this is definitely a game for you. If you want a game that has depth in gameplay, I suggest looking somewhere else.","August 16, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Why?\n\nYou build up, but the game doesn't change. Managing the rent of 4 tenants every 2 minutes is fine, even 8 tenants I can live with. But then it's 12... then 16.\nYou will realise eventually that tenant X deals best with hero Y which gives you an edge next time you fight. But you can't just shift people homes so you're stuck with the initial order. Well, you can move but it's very costly since the tenants don't take the goods with them and you can't transfer the goods manually so you'll have monster X unhappy until you sell all monster Y's goods then rebuy their own and vice versa.\nNow with the above in mind, the heroes become VERY strong which makes battles difficult. They'd be manageable if there was a pause button, but you can't pause it to micromanage so while you're dealing with heroes on one level, your monsters are returning home (effectively flanking the heroes) and dying because you're focussing on the front monsters not dying.\nYou can't "level up" the tenants either, the weather can affect their stats as can living near a creature they hate I believe, but not being able to level up makes the game much more difficult too.\n\nI paid $4 for it and I'd say that is about the right price point for what I got out. I would give it 5/10. If the game stopped after three floors and added a pause button it could even push up to 6 or 7/10.","January 12, 2014","false","8.9"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

At first it was a little odd, then I really got into it.  It is definitely a casual style, and you can control the pace mostly, and can save and load as much as you want.  The mouse controls work really well.  I ended up playing it for 4 hours on the first day. [4/5]\n\nRuns great on my Windows 10, Alianware Alpha, no crashes or technical issues.  I run it on a 1080p TV, and I use the full screen mode in options.  Note that the highest resolution option (default, and less than 1080p) cuts off some of the screen when in full screen mode, so you just bump it down a notch, set to full screen, and it stretches to fill the entire screen.","January 24","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's surprisingly addictive to spend time upgrading your rooms, getting happy tenants, helping them find partners and have kids, then kicking them out so their kids can take over with superior stats.\n\nThe idler part is that often it's better to let it run on speed 3 a bit and deal with occasional raids whilst people heal, pay you rent, and you upgrade their rooms...and hope that they don't run into financial issues and not have rent money.\n\nThe monster bit is a bit annoying with regards to variety. There's 6 races and each like different things, but some monsters (any Undead) are just far better than others (Cheepies, who are utter garbage).

A very casual dungeon keeper is how I would describe it with a very strange, child-like, and charming artstyle with very relaxing music aside from a few annoying sound effects. For only $4, this is well worth my time and for those who likes management games in general, you might like Unholy Heights as well.","December 20, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's surprisingly addictive to spend time upgrading your rooms, getting happy tenants, helping them find partners and have kids, then kicking them out so their kids can take over with superior stats.\n\nThe idler part is that often it's better to let it run on speed 3 a bit and deal with occasional raids whilst people heal, pay you rent, and you upgrade their rooms...and hope that they don't run into financial issues and not have rent money.\n\nThe monster bit is a bit annoying with regards to variety. There's 6 races and each like different things, but some monsters (any Undead) are just far better than others (Cheepies, who are utter garbage). It's fun to try and organise who you have, but there's clear patterns as to what is good and what is not.","December 23, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Everything changed from there and I've done my best to protect him and his Cheepy family. I am proud to say that my boy Pip is well grown and now stronger than his parents.\n\nAside from that, this game is a very interactive "tower defense" kind of game.  Tower  as in tenants, meaning the monsters living within the rooms. Every monster is different in its own way including their attack, defense, satisfaction, as well as emotions. They all have different names, but sometimes you'll stumble upon a few with same names.\n\nFrom my own experience,  once you build the second floor, it becomes pretty hard. So think about what preperations are needed to be made before moving on to the next quest to expand your building.","January 10","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

VERY underwhelming.  The music is nice, and I like the concept, but it just doesn't "flow" the way you'd expect a game too.  It's a little hard to figure out what the tennants want, and combat feels very uncontrollable.  Sometimes you get attacked and there's no one there.  I understand the tennants have to go out to do jobs, but lets be honest shall we?  This is essentially a tower defense game where sometimes your towers just aren't there.\n\n","January 21","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WRONG! spending that dollar on a McChiken sandwich and then enduring the diarrhea that followed would be better time management. i spent a dollar on this game.. and i feel absolutely robbed.. i made sure to add these devs and all their games past and future to my "never buy or support" list. well.. back to the forest.. you know.. a game that works.. and is good.","January 24","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first it was a little odd, then I really got into it.  It is definitely a casual style, and you can control the pace mostly, and can save and load as much as you want.  The mouse controls work really well.  I ended up playing it for 4 hours on the first day. [4/5]\n\nRuns great on my Windows 10, Alianware Alpha, no crashes or technical issues.  I run it on a 1080p TV, and I use the full screen mode in options.  Note that the highest resolution option (default, and less than 1080p) cuts off some of the screen when in full screen mode, so you just bump it down a notch, set to full screen, and it stretches to fill the entire screen.","January 24","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
