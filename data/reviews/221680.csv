If you don't play guitar and are curious, it's actually good enough that I'd still recommend getting it. It is far and away my favorite music game on the market.\n\nBe warned that it's more of a guitar practice tool than a game. But that's exactly what it should be: a practice tool that has just enough game-y design to keep it interesting, but not so much that it gets in the way of practicing. The only linear progression the game has is in the form of "missions" along the side of the menus that encourage you to try different things. You can ignore them entirely if you want, but sometimes they are very helpful (especially the ones associated with the Session mode, which teach you bits of relevant music theory). It's a well-designed experience.\n\nThe interface is very slick and the game has no loading time or lengthy transitions between browsing and playing songs. This is great news because the interface was the main flaw in Rocksmith 1. "Riff repeater" phrase rehearsing options are integrated into the pause menu, so you can drop into them on the fly while playing songs.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent. It has hits (Knights of Cydonia, Paranoid Android, etc), more obscure music with fun guitar parts, and even a few tracks from small indie bands I have never heard of. The song Stay In by Jaws is one of the indie songs that stuck out to me. And it's very worth it to import Rocksmith 1 songs -- they have had their tabs updated to fix inaccuracies and to use new features in the new game (RS1 DLC songs have be updated as well).\n\nThe game has a Session mode, where you can load backing instruments, jam, and have them follow along with you. It's alright. It's implemented well and has a ton of options, but I and other friends find it odd that it follows you, rather than maintaining a constant rhythm for you to improv over. Your mileage may vary with it, but it's a welcome addition.\n\nThere are also a number of Guitarcade mini-games that focus on various guitar techniques. They are a distraction for when you're bored with performing songs, but some of them are pretty amusing. There is even a House of the Dead 2 spoof where you play chords to shoot zombies.\n\n\nI'm an amateur guitarist, but it's thanks to Rocksmith that I've kept up with practicing as frequently as I have. When learning an instrument it's easy to get bored when it turns into a grind and you don't know what music to try. You need some structure. Rocksmith is that structure, and it makes it easy to practice.","November 26, 2013","true","280.4"," 520 of 537 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","520","537","0","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumblebumpkin/recommended/221680/","grumblebumpkin","Kressle Nethers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumblebumpkin/","93 products in account","Having played guitar for nearly seven years now in rock, metal, blues, and jazz, I was really needing something that put interest back into playing, like a new piece of gear. I found that in Rocksmith, and played it nearly 35 hours in my first five days of owning it. I love having the callouses back. That being said, the game is not perfect. I'll make a simple rundown of pros and cons for simplicity.\nPros:\n- Definitely inspires you to play and learn songs. Whether you find your own style of playing before or after you learn a steaming pile of songs, it's always good to learn said steaming pile of songs. Rocksmith will definitely help you do this in a fun, relaxed, pseudo-Guitar Hero environment.\n- Has a nearly flawless session mode where you can construct your own band that has a wide variety of styles, sounds, progressions, and can play in all the basic modes and scales with all 12 roots. It also has a very helpful and changable neck layout to show you exactly what scale they recommend you use. This is like a loop station +4, people!\n- Songs have a fluid difficulty. If the game sees you rock, it'll make the next bit a little bit harder. If it sees you're having a lot of trouble, it'll dial it down. This spans from pretty much root notes only to having every note be invisible. This game has an infuriating way of making you learn songs ;).\n- Has a sometimes helpful section repeater for every song.\n- Has a MASSIVE amp emulator where you can try out digital versions of generic and some name brand gear to see what you want for a new song or purchase. These are all dependant on the quality of your computer speakers of course, but it's still nice to have a reference.\n- You can change your tone in the middle of a song if you despise song's preset tone.\n- An interesting pro, this program's DLC and price per song is generally roughly the same if not cheaper than sheet music, and you get a lot more. You get to hear the song, see a visual representation of how it's played, get alternate lead, rhythm, and bass parts, and a preview of how the guitarist got their tone with the amp emulator. Plus you get to beat the snot out of it over and over and score points.\n- There are several other little pros scattered throughout, but these are the big ones.\n\nCons:\n- My worst complaint with the game: Some of the ways this game has you play songs are ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS (yes, I mean to shout), and there's no way to change what frets it wants you to play from what I can tell. Fortunately, the game is just based on tone recognition, so if you can play it on a different string and it's easier for you, do it that way. Problem is, you have to ditch the way the game wants you to play at that point, so there's no on screen reference. For example, Are You Mine by the Arctic Monkies has you sliding all around the neck. I have learned to play it to where I hardly have to move from the second fret. Ultimately, this is kind of beneficial, as you should be learning the way you want to play, and hopefully that's without having to watch the Rocksmith screen. On a similar note, some of the rookie ways of playing songs can actually be harder than the advanced way because you don't know all of what's being played. This is a problem for me as an advanced guitarist because it's easier for me to play by chord names rather than some stepwise building of chords throughout the song.\n- The other pretty unfortunate bit of this game is that it has a serious case of death-by-interface when you're first starting out. Everything the guitarist played on the song has to come down this alley at you and convey, in it's entirety, everything about that note: string, fret, duration, slidel vibrato, bend, temolo picking, harmonics, tapping, hammerons, pulloffs, anything that the guitarist could do has to be contained in that one tiny note flying toward you, and it's one of several at a time. The game will modulate this problem a bit by removing some of the extra things like bends and tremolo, but this is still serious information overload, so be prepared to have some difficulty with reading what's happening for a pretty long time.\n- The nearly flawless session mode's one flaw is that it changes dynamically with how you play, which in terms of musical expression, is not always the best way to do it. Do you want to rip a screaming solo while the band lays back? Ehh... This will have problems figuring out what you want. Conversely, are you trying to rip a screaming solo, and the band's dying away? This happens too, especially when your guitar is producing rather low output like with tapping. It may be great to change with the band, but when you both follow each other, pretty soon the band stops playing 'cause you're too quiet.\n- The riff repeater can slow down parts and manually change difficulty, which is good, but all these parts are pre-determined by the game. If you have a problem with one part at the very end of a solo, it's very likely you'll have to play through the whole solo a billion times to get it right and understand what you're doing, which may or may not be a good thing. Also, and this is infuriating, the slowing down of a song has no metronome or click track that I can find, and past about 80% speed, the audio quality is so bad you can't tell what's happening anyways. Good luck finding a tempo here. You're better off just watching what is happening at slow speed and trying to master it at full speed from there.\n- The tone recognition isn't perfect, and it never is. This is extremely frustrating if you're going for note streaks, mastery score, and basic video game statistics. I've missed chords in the middle of strumming a long line of the same chords just because the game herps a derp (It was punk rock. 1/8th note power chords? Don't tell me I randomly missed one lol).\n- A few nitpicky things here: On the minigames, the notifications can seriously get in the way of what you're trying to see so you can play the right thing. The score attack sounds are also extremely distracting when you're trying to rock your awesomest.\n- And a technical note from one player to another: Always tune up. The game seems to hint that as long as you tune down to the right note (say for drop D), you're good. This is not always the case, especially if your strings are a little too thick for your nut. They can stay just a hair too tight on the playing end compared to the segment after the nut. This means that as soon as you bend or play one of the strings, your tension will equalize and you'll be slightly flat. So remember: Always go below the note you want and come up from below it. This could concieveably make you slightly sharp, but if you're having that much problem with string tensions, you need to get your nut slots widened for your apparently super-thick monster-tendon He-man/Hercules strings.\n\nSo, on the whole: Is it awesome? Yes. Will you learn guitar? Yes. Will you learn songs? Yes. Will you happily lose track of hours of your life? Yes. The review officially ends here, but I have a few personal notes for the dedicated reader.\nJust remember while you're playing this game, take the time to learn what's comfortable and right for you. Just because Rocksmith says you should play a song a certain way doesn't make it right. You'll love guitar that much more if you find your own voice on it. This game will definitely teach you to play if that's what you're looking for, but always try to put your own spin on what you learn afterwards. For example, the game doesn't recognize if you play more notes than are in the song, so I always add my own licks, fills, and harmonies when my part gets quiet just so I can get a better feel for what I would want the song to sound like. By all means quote songs you love and guitarists you idolize, but don't become a riff junkie who brings nothing new to the table. Put your own inflections on their ideas, because that's what makes your playing interesting.","June 10, 2014","true","299.6"," 407 of 412 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","407","412","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Den_/recommended/221680/","_Den_","Den","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Den_/","189 products in account","Ah, Rocksmith 2014, a sequel to Rocksmith and a game, which is claimed to be 'the fastest way to learn guitar' (and bass). I'm here to elaborate on this statement.\nFirst, I'd like to answer some potential questions related to the game.\n\nQ: "What do I need and how do I start?"\nA: Well, it IS in a way a guitar teacher, so you will obviously need a guitar or bass (notice: it can't be a classic or acoustic guitar) and the Real Tone Cable, so I advise the reader to buy the Rocksmith bundled WITH the cable. From what I heard, there was also a bundle with the guitar, but since I already had a guitar, I decided to buy Rocksmith for Xbox 360 with the cable. Starting is relatively simple, you plug the cable in your guitar and the computer, read the manual, and start the game.\n\nQ:"Will I learn to play it like a super pro?"\nA: I can't guarantee anything, it depends on YOU and YOUR dedication. If you want to master the guitar, you will have to train hard.\n\nQ:"How long will it take for me to master the guitar/bass?"\nA: Once again, it takes some people a couple of months to get really good, some might train for years. I learned the guitar in two years.\n\nNow, questions, aside, I should write down pros, cons, features and setbacks of the game.\n\nPros:\n-You can play this game anytime. Unlike having scheduled lessons, choosing the perfect time is up to the player.\n-This is not just a teacher. Rocksmith has many other features, which will be written down below.\n-Huge amount of DLC. You can buy lots of songs you prefer, from Social Distortion to The Smashing Pumpkins.\n-Cable versatility. If you, say, bought an Xbox 360 Rocksmith 1 version with the cable, like me, you can still play the PC version of Rocksmith 2014.\n\nCons:\n-Poor song selection. Not that I want to say there are more bad songs than good, there are just not enough free songs.\n-Lack of feedback. If you want to get better at a song, sure, there is the chord book and riff repeater, but it doesn't exactly tell you how to get better.\n\nFeatures:\n-Guitar lessons, Rocksmith 2014 includes over 80 interactive lessons to help teach you almost every technique associated with guitar and bass.\n-Session mode, where you can assemble and play with a virtual band.\n-Mini-games. Yes, Rocksmith 2014 includes mini-games, concerning different techniques.\n-Custom DLC's. Now that's a topic I would love to elaborate on. If the song list doesn't satisfy you, you can browse ignition.customsforge.com to find songs you like and download for free. For more information, check some of Rocksmith 2014 guides.\n-The tuner. You will also be provided with a variety of guitar tunings to choose from. Not all Rocksmith 2014 songs are in E standard tuning. You can choose from several open tunings, as well as Eb, Drop D, C; D, C#, C standard and many more\n-The chord book. It's not much of a book, but it sure has lots of different chords. Diminished, augmented, 13th, they're all there.\n\nSetbacks:\n-Uplay account requirement. Yes, unfortunately, you will have to create a Uplay account to play Rocksmith 2014. However, I somehow managed to start Rocksmith 2014 directly through steam, so I suppose it is no longer necessary.\n-"Paid" CDLC. In order to download custom DLC, you will have to buy at least one song (I recommend buying "Cherub Rock" by The Smashing Pumpkins. Not because of the taste, but because of the fact that the DLC ID would match that song's).\n\nOf course, I could not fit all of the things I wanted to say, but I believe it is enough to form the reader's opinion.\nBut in conclusion I would like to say that if you want to learn guitar, Rocksmith 2014 would be one of the best solutions. So, my final rating would be 8.5/10. The pros outweigh the cons, but some of them are just too significant to ignore.","September 6, 2015","true","294.2"," 270 of 283 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","270","283","15","38"

If you are a beginner reading this review, please understand that I can't fully appreciate the suitability of this software to your personal needs as a new player. I hope that you will still find my review useful.\n\nRS2014 is an interactive songbook which features fully notated guitar and bass arrangements for a great many popular songs, mainly from the past few decades. The base content is diverse, and the DLC includes a wide variety of genres and styles with the abilty to download band or theme packs or individual songs. Many songs have two guitar parts, plus bass. Not all songs have two guitar parts, but you'll find plenty to keep you busy.\n\nThe way the notation is presented may be difficult to get used to at first, especially if you are used to using TAB up until now, but you will adapt to it and find it quite intuitive. Beginners seem to have little trouble adapting where experienced players may be more....resistant :X\n\nRS2014 is the ultimate practice tool, motivating you to pick up the instrument often and therefore practice regularly. There are lesson features and technique guides which cover many aspects of guitar playing, like hammer-ons, slides, harmonics, pull-offs, etc. Some arcade style games are included, using the guitar as the controller. These games are designed to improve your skills and muscle-memory.\nA session mode includes a band that dynamically plays according to your own playing intensity. This is a useful jamming tool, and good for practicing and learning scales.\n'Learn A Song' is the main part of Rocksmith, and the notation will be simplified at first, then as you improve it gets harder until you have the whole tune. At the end of each song you will get stats on the percentage of correct notes hit and your longest continuous streak. This is a fun way to learn new songs and you always have something ready to practice, just a few clicks away.\n\nWith very few acceptions, the songs are the actual recordings by original artists, so you'll be playing along to tracks that sound like they should. Additionally, your guitar tone will sound like the guitar in the recorded version, allowing you to play the song more authentically. This raises the immersion and enjoyment level as well. I don't know if the emulation is perfect, but it is certainly very good.\n\nFor added motivation you can use the leaderboards, though I don't personally, but many others do and seem to enjoy the challenge very much.\n\nYou need the Real Tone Cable to use this software. I like RS2014 so much I bought an extra cable. Check online stores. One cable is compatible with all platforms and works with guitar or bass.\n\nThere are literally thousands of hours of value to be found amongst the core content and the additional songs available as DLC. This is not a game, this is a guitar practice portal. Rocksmith is a digital interface for an interactive guitar tutorial/songbook which encourages you to practice, makes you want to play, helps you hone your techniques, and teaches you songs.\n\nRock on, brothers and sisters.\n\nOh - and Hendrix. So, yeah.","August 31, 2014","true","472.7"," 147 of 149 people (99%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","99","147","149","2","0"

If you start learning songs in Rocksmith, you should REALLY practice through a real Amp, too, because, no matter how well your system is set up, you HAVE a delay with the Rocksmith Interface Cable. This confuses your "sense of rythm" or how you wanna call it on the instrument and really makes it almost impossible to play faster stuff (I noticed it on Toxicity by SOAD) if you really hear yourself playing with that delay.

Learning to play guitar or bass has never been more fun than this. All you need is your electric guitar or bass of choice, the game and a cable that you can buy in a lot of stores that sell things related to music or just electronics in general.\n\nWhen you first start up the game you get to set up a few things just so that you get the most out of your Rocksmith experience. I went with the option of starting out as someone who has never played guitar previously although I did have some knowledge about how to play. If my memory isn't failing me you get to calibrate and tune your guitar before the game lets you continue onwards. The game then explains the basics and how the layout of the so called 'Note Highway' will show you what notes to hit on the guitar. After you've made it through the basics you're ready to go!\n\nAt the start menu there are a lot of options to choose from such as 'Learn a song', 'Lessons' and 'Guitarcade'.\n\nAs most other people I went with Learn a song instantly because I was so excited to start playing songs. If you chose the option of starting out as a complete beginner the game will take it easy in the beginning by only giving you a few notes now and then. It will feel slow but it was still enjoyable for me. The way this works is that the more notes you hit and the better you do will increase the amount of notes you get on screen. This is called 'Dynamic Difficulty' and is one of the main reasons Rocksmith actually works as well as it does.\n\nI would recommend starting out in Lessons learning some more of the basic stuff like posture, picking and how to use a strap if you want to play while standing up. I think that most people, like me prefer sitting down when playing Rocksmith or they just don't have a strap to stand up. There are a lot of great lessons ranging from the more simple techniques like chords to the advanced stuff like tapping.\n\nSomething that a lot of beginners tend to neglect is the Guitarcade, I really think that the Guitarcade is one of the most important features of Rocksmith as the mini-games are fun and help you build up muscle memory that you will need if you want to play the guitar. One of the best mini-games for me is the 'String skip saloon' as it helps you learn to hit the right strings without looking. 'Ducks ReDux' is another important one teaching you the distance between the frets of your chosen instrument.\n\nThe most commonly asked question is probably: "Does Rocksmith 2014 really work?"\n\nYes! It most definitely works. It provides the motivation and fun aspect needed to learn to play the guitar and your favourite songs. If you are thinking about buying this game and your biggest concern is "does it actually work?" then buy it and see for yourself, I can guarantee that you will atleast to some degree improve your playing and general technique.\n\nRocksmith 2014 has to be one of my favourite games of all time just because of how detailed and enjoyable it is. A function that I didn't even discuss but is a great way to get better is the 'Riff Repeater'. It lets you slow down and practice certain sections of a song or a lesson and really fiddle around with a lot of settings to make it easier for you to learn. Also in 'Session mode' you can jam with AI musicians playing scales at your own tempo and with a lot of different instruments.\n\n10/10\n\n- Liam","February 7, 2015","true","110.4"," 116 of 118 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","116","118","6","0"

I've been playing it for over 15 years. I bought the game out of curiosity, and what can I say? It impressed me.\nI remember my days learning to play guitar. The basics are crucial. The exercise and motivation are crucial. It is very difficult to do it by yourself. I needed a teacher for over 6 months before I could start searching and learning things on my own.\nWith Rocksmith you have a teacher at your place. Not only have everything you need to learn to play guitar, but it’s also fun for people that already know how to play. People compare this to Guitar Hero, saying it’s like Guitar Hero but with a real guitar. I wouldn’t say that. Guitar Hero it’s an awesome and fun game, but what Guitar Hero can teach you musically ends in maybe a month. I think Guitar Hero can teach you a little bit of rhythm, but that’s it.\nThe only issue you might have is that you need the cable to play it.

It might be remind you a bit about games like Guitar Hero. The difficulty adapts after how good you are, and get harder and harder as you learn more and more.\n\n''Session Mode'' gives you a virtual band to play with! You can customize and choose your scales, tempo, groove, atmosphere (club, studio, arena) and what instruments that is in your band. Or you can load up a stock one, like ''Electric Blues'' or ''Psychedelic Rock'' all after what music you intend to play.\n\nThere are also a whole catalouge of lessons that learns you everything from playing chords and the basic scales (and even how to hold your guitar, lel), through harmonics, hammer-on's and pull-off's, to the master classes.\n\nAlso there are arcade style mini-games that let's you train on your tecnhicques. Temple of Bends, Scale Warrior and Harmonic Heist are some examples.\n\nAlong with that you get some very useful tools. The tuner which allows you not only to standardize your tuning, but also change into different tunings based on the song you are playing. So it might be smart to plan ahead so you aren't stuck too long in the tuner. Also you get ''Tone Editor'' which allows you to change your effects, pedals and amps. Coolest product placement ever with Eden, Orange and Marshall. Every song that you play also have an ''authentic tone'' that loads up when you start the song. If for example the solo and the riff has different tones in a song it changes automatically. You can also load up these in Tone Editor so you can play with it in Session Mode.\n\nThe included songs ranges from hits like ''My Generation'' and ''We Are The Champions'' to songs from underated indie bands that no one has ever heard of. Try to play every song, you might find something you like. If you have the original Rocksmith you can import them with updated tabs or you can buy it if you didn't own it previosly.\nLooking at the large amount of DLC, it's easy to think of this as another ''DLC: The Game'' but it isn't. New songs are released to this game constantly, but the artists need to be paid. So you have to pay for the license.\nIf a song you like hasn't been released however, you can download custom songs for free using some modding tools. They might be faulty however since they are made by sparetime modders.\n\n\nThere are some things to remember though: This is not Rock Band or Guitar Hero. You might and should have fun while playing this game, but remember it's an educational game. This means that you can't expect to learn the songs by playing it over and over again. You have to go deeper and use the ''Riff Repeater''. Riff Repeater allows you to slow down certain sections of a song and play it at any speed you want, again and again until you get it.\nAlso this is a TOOL not some kind of potion that magically transforms you into Jimmy Page. The challenge to take the skills you learn in the game into the real world might be tough. Sometimes you will find yourself cutting shortcuts just to hit the notes, which makes things even worse (espescially when soloing). If you really want to learn, you are gonna have to use other means too.\n\nIn short: It is a great game if you want to learn the basics of guitar/bass, improve your skills or just have some fun. Use it with caution and don't rely solely on it if you want to learn guitar properly. Great songs, good tabs and useful tools. It's worth buying for every aspiring or aspired guitar player out there.","November 8, 2014","true","104.2"," 100 of 107 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","100","107","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HGB/recommended/221680/","HGB","Heavy Viper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HGB/","398 products in account","Rocksmith is a brilliant package. It's essentially a self-contained training program. The main component is an automatic tab player that lets you play along to album versions of songs. The self-adjusting diffuculty is key here - if you're playing well, the game scales up the complexity of the tabs to match, eventually having you play the song for real, chords and all. The majority of the songs come with seperate lead guitar, rhythm guitar and bass guitar tracks, so you don't have to stop at learning just one part of a whole song.\n\nThe game also comes with a collection of arcade-style games designed to help you develop muscle memory, teach you chord names, fretting, scales, bends, harmonics - the works. There's also a dedicated lesson section to help you learn the basics of guitar playing and maintenance. Another interesting feature is "Session Mode." Here, the game lets you set up a virtual band that plays along with you. You play hard and fast, so do they. Play softer, they slow down too. It essentially gives you a crash course on how songs flow and gives you a free environment to get creative with your playing.\n\nNow, the bad news: while it IS good, Rocksmith is not going to magically turn you into some kind of Hendrix-Slash-Dylan-Malmsteen-hybrid guitar beast. Think of it as a tool, not a magic potion. If you want to learn guitar, and you're serious about it, Rocksmith will definitely help. In the end, though, it comes down to you.\n\nBasically, let me put it like this: the game has an achievement named "0.25% of the 10,000 Hour Rule." Google it.","February 13, 2014","true","358.1"," 92 of 96 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","92","96","0","0"

I have used it for practicing guitar and bass, and my skills have developed a lot since I started playing the game.\n\nThere is a plethora of features to be found in Rocksmith 2014, the most prominent being Learn a Song mode. In Learn a Song mode, the game basically plays similarly to Guitar Hero, except the notes may span the entire fretboard of the actual instrument you are playing (guitar/bass). When you are first beginning, the songs are watered-down. Rocksmith decides to just throw a few notes at you at a time, until you get the hang of it, then it gradually increases the complexity until you are playing it just the way it was recorded. The game registers all kinds of techniques that are used with a guitar, such as hammer-ons pull-offs, slides, bends, harmonics, palm-mutes, etc. The Real-Tone cable just knows. You can unlock new songs by doing missions, you can also buy song-packs as DLC.\n\nAnother feature I enjoy is Session Mode. It allows you to program a backing band that plays according to the scale that you are playing. It sounds really sweet and gives you a feel of playing with an actual band. Session mode also gives you some pretty good tutoring about scales, and playing with a band if you follow the in-game missions. Also, the game offers a huge amount of video based, interactive guitar lessons, to help out the newbies, and experienced players too.\n\nRocksmith has local multiplayer for Score-Attack mode, Session mode, and Learn a Song mode. It works great, you just need to have two of the Real-Tone cables (and two guitars, of course.)\n\nThere is a tone designer within Rocksmith, which basically allows you to choose equipment and effects for the game to synthesise. Allow me to say, the game sounds almost as good as my amplifier through my stereo, and the latency for playing a note is unnoticable. You can unlock new sounds for your guitar, just by playing the game.\n\nRocksmith also offers arcade-style games to help you practice with techniques, which are pretty fun, to say the least. I have put in a lot of hours just trying to get the achievements in these, and I'm still working at it.\n\nDoes anyone else play this? Add me through Steam if you do, I would love to have some friends to compare scores with and stuff. I got it around Christmas time and I'm up to 250 hours through Steam (only counting online sessions.)","March 12, 2014","true","356.5"," 63 of 66 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","63","66","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/221680/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","I was dubious at first about Rocksmith 2014, mainly due to how quickly I grew tired of Rock Band and Guitar Hero. However, those fears were quickly put to rest due to one simple element - the use of a real instrument. I've been playing guitar on and off for over a decade now, but hadn't played for a few years due to no longer being in a band. So Rocksmith was a great excuse to pick it back up and give it another go.\nSo if you had any fears about this being another Rock Band or Guitar Hero put them to bed, this is guitar tutorial software wrapped up as a game. It'll take you through all the techniques you need to know to play guitar, with explinations and video demos. It even teaches you scales... SCALES! Imagine that. Scales in a music game. Black Magic.\n\nIt does a good job of easing you into the program, and providing you with some lessons and advice before jumping into a song. When you do pick a song to play it starts off with an easy note track to follow and play. Basically a reduced note count, often root notes, to get you used to the song and moving single fingers around the fret board. As you get better at the song the complexity increases and chords start to form, and more notes in a bar (Section of music) appear too. This can be a little confusing at first, especially if you're somewhat used to playing guitar and want to play all the notes you hear, however from a beginner's point of view I can imagine this is a very useful level progression to build up confidence.\n\nThere is a slight 'delay' from auido input of guitar to audio output through the headphones, which can be a little disorientating, however you grow used to it if you continue to play. Other than this I've had no real issues with the game, and enjoy an hour or two once and a while.\nI've lost countless hours just jamming away in the Session Mode, while it isn't as complex as I hoped it's still a good little tool for popping out riffs and licks.\n\nI think the only real issue I have with Rocksmith at the moment is the lack of some genuine Classic Rock songs in the track list, however I'm hoping this will be resolved via DLC at some point.\n\nSo if you've been interested in guitar and sort of held back about learning then this could be a useful game for you, especially if it has songs you like on the set list/DLC. Likewise if you have a guitar but haven't touched it for ages due to a lack of interest, why not dust it down and plug in!\nThe only caution about buying the Steam Version of the game is that it DOES NOT come with the Real Tone cable that you'll need to play. However, you can pick up Rocksmith with a Real Tone Cable very cheap on Amazon (with the added bonus of being to port over the RS1 songs to RS2!).","December 22, 2013","true","122.7"," 54 of 55 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","54","55","0","2"

While I haven't gotten to "hero" yet, I've gone from Zero, to well, having callouses and being able to improvise over scales in a mere 30-something hours of practice with the app.\n\nThe way I've been explaining this game to my friends is, think Guitar Hero but make it an educational game with a real guitar. Individual phrases are simplified and you level them up individually from each other, and instead of "failing" you if you miss too many notes the game tries to keep you at a level to where you're on your toes.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate about this game is that it's teaching me actual songs I can relate to. I sat down the other day to practice a prhase from one of the Radiohead songs, realized it's in the same key as the primary Salsa riff, the Game of Thrones theme, the Legend of Zelda theme and the Super Mario Castle music, and had a lot of fun going between them all. I'm not just learning more about the guitar, I'm learning more about music.\n\nOne thing I find really frustrating with this game is that it has a hard time recognizing my playing of some techniques. It doesn't recognize a vast majority of my pitch bends, for example, though an accomplished guitarist friend of mine says they're fine. The game doesn't offer any feedback on how I might improve them, other than to watch the tutorial video again.\n\nOverall, if you want to learn guitar, it's hard to go wrong with this game as part of a larger practice. Props to Ubisoft for creating something that's more about learning and less about ego.","October 2, 2014","true","78.4"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","45","52","0","0"

Started with my Acoustic Encore and play with that for a while. This game really works well with my acoustic, but fo obvious reasons, is not the best, it got me started.\n\nI later decided to buy my first electric guitar and used that for a while (Epiphone Special 1 for anyone who is interested) It worked perfectly, no problems at all, literally, none.\n\nAfter a while, i felt guitar wasn't for me, and switched to Bass guitar. Got myself a Vitage Rockbass and used that so much, i had to go to the hospital because the skin on my fingers were damaged so much. I loved it, it felt amazing to say that i finally can play an instrument. The bass integration on this game is immaculate, picks up every note, and gives an amazing sound quality back.\n\nI recently purchased a Warwick Rockbass and have starteed using that, and have been non-stop playing.\n\nBecause of this game, i am now in an Indie rock band traveling over England, gigging.\nIf this game wasn't in my steam library, i'd probably still be playing CS:GO daily.\n\nI cannot stress enough that this game is amazing.\nSo good infact, if there was a rating out of 1000, i'd give it 999.

Ive been playing for 7 days at this point and can play 2 songs completely at about 98%.  It works.  Like any instrument, hours of practice is how you get better, but the thing with Rocksmith2014 is that it helps you feel like you aren't 'working' or 'practicing'.  It cleverly disquises learning chords, progressions, scales and harmonics (you know, all the boring ♥♥♥♥) by putting them into arcade games.  It also spoon feeds you (if you need it, which i do) in learn a song mode, gives you a little bit at a time, but also helps you by pushing you with new techniques and chords.  But the BEST FEATURE is RIFF REPEATER,  at any point you can stop the song and repeat any part on any difficulty at any speed up to 100%.  keep cranking up the difficulty and speed until you're playing just like it was written.

If you have an electric or electro acoustic guitar/bass that you haven't learned how to play, money for the cable (I believe it's around €30) and time to dedicate I would strongly recommend you to buy this game. Guitar/bass is a great skill to have in life. I've been playing Rocksmith 2014 for over a year now (26 December 2015 is current date, game bought for PS3 on 19th June 2014)\n\nPros- Easy way to learn guitar/bass\n- Really fun to play\n- You can practice in your own time\n- If you buy Cherub Rock you can also get loads of Custom Downloadable Content (CDLC) from http://customsforge.com\n- Guitar/bass is fun\n- The game features an automatic level up/down system called the Riff Repeater. It will judge your skill based on how well you've been playing at the current difficulty and make the riff easier/harder to play.\n- Loads of DLC and CDLC is available\n- Includes minigames to practice scales, techniques and chords\n- Rocksmith can tell you what you need to improve on, for example, if your bending was a little poor Rocksmith will say "Check out this Bending 101 lesson"\n\nCons- Riff Repeater can sometimes be annoying\n- The Real Tone cable is pricey and a bit fragile\n- You don't get a Real Tone cable with the Steam purchase. I would advise you to buy the disc edition starter bundle (two exist, one with game and cable and one with an Epiphone Les Paul, game and cable). The disc edition is installed through Steam.\n- The game sometimes has trouble picking up signals from your guitar\n- Audio latency can become an issue. It's advised to have your video and audio running through 2 different cables. I have my video going from my laptop to my TV via HDMI and sound going from my laptop to my headphones via 3.5mm.\n- lag between video and audio can throw off your sense of rhythm\n\nI've taken lots of care to cover as many pros or cons in my review, if I've missed any, please tell me.\n\nIf you enjoy Rocksmith I strongly recommend you to buy an amp for your instrument so you can practice outside of Rocksmith.\n\nFinal conclusionRocksmith 2014 is a great learning tool/game and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking to learn how to play guitar/bass. If you have enough time and dedication I guarantee you many hours of fun.","December 26, 2015","true","170.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","1"

I started playing 9 years ago and still love it to this day. However, at some point I stopped playing for a few reasons. Guitar is an instrument that suffers from feeling kind of lame if you aren't jamming with other people. Playing alone to a song is cool, for around an hour or two, but then you start wishing you had a drummer, or a singer, or a bass. Hence the reason why lots of people form bands and showcase their talent, put it to good use. I was like many who didn't have the opportunity growing up to join or form a band, I just simply didn't have enough friends that played instruments that would sound good together. That's when Rocksmith came around. I'm sure you understand the basic premise of Rocksmith. Simply put it's real life guitar hero. Notes come on the screen in vibrant colors to actual rock songs and you play along, except the catch is you play on a real guitar and are actually learning to play the songs. Great concept!\n\nHere's the deal. Rocksmith will NOT teach the average Joe how to play guitar. The thing Rocksmith succeeds at is making guitar fun for people who already play guitar. I'm sure if you gave it your all you could learn to play guitar with Rocksmith, but it doesn't teach you how to read sheet music or tabs which are rather key in playing guitar outside of Rocksmith. Nevertheless, Rocksmith is awesome for people that play, and it also took me down a peg, realising that playing guitar is NOT like riding a bike. You don't just set it down for a couple years, then come back to it and start jamming to Holy Diver. You have to rebuild lost calluses, regain flexibility in your fingers, all that great stuff.\n\nIf you have never touched a guitar before and think you can learn how to play guitar from Rocksmith, that all depends on your determination but like I said before it doesn't teach you to read music. If you're a guitarist like me and are looking for something to bring back that initial spark in your marriage to your guitar then this is the preverbial sexy weekend getaway. With some drinks, a few half broken guitar picks, a spare pack of strings, and a whole lot of 80's hair metal.","January 5","true","15.4"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","2"

Over at my place the cable is not easy to find and is rather expensive so you don't want to go through hassle of getting another one or modding a guitar usb cable.\n\nRocksmith is a fine tool for beginners and pros alike. There are plenty video lessons that would be helpful for beginners, even when you are playing a guitar for the very first time. In Rocksmith, you don't do readings, unlike reading tabs, chords, music notes or using Guitar Pro software. Rather you learn through videos, visual graphics and repetitive motions.\n\nAll you really need is an electric guitar, and the game will handle the rest. The tones, amps, and all the tools that will mod & filter the sounds that are available in real world are all installed in the game and it sounds really, really awesome. *Branded, expensive stuffs, mind you*. Jamming in real life won't get you the exact sound without these proper tools thus in this game you will play the songs as it is meant to be played. *Thank god the tones are not DLC's* *No, I'm not giving any idea, Ubisoft*\n\nThe game has a mode called Riff Repeater where it allows you to learn sections by sections of the songs. It also have difficulty setting whereby you can control your pace of learning so it really caters to beginners very well. *Imagine learning the solo's without this mode, oh god*. Practicing would be boring, if you're not interested in the song in the first place. So song choice matters! Start immediately with the songs you like and don't just play at random! Also, it has a build-in tuner so you won't get your tuning wrong for all the songs. Having said that, outside of the game, you gonna have to learn how to tune the guitar to suit the songs perfectly and that would depend on your own initiatives.\n\nUltimately, with or without Rocksmith, you have to be passionate and dedicated enough to be able to enjoy playing the guitar. Rocksmith is just a tool, and it's not a game where you will have fun without practicing a song over and over again. I see that many started this game but stopped after a short while because they seem to lost interest. So take this into consideration if you are going to start this game as you don't only have to buy the game, but also the guitar and its cable and almost everything that accompanies it which by then you will find out this hobby is as costly as any other.\n\nPoints doesn't matter, as long as you enjoy playing & I do, I enjoy playing. So if you are looking to play a guitar, whether beginning or restarting the musical journey, I wish you good luck and have fun!\n\n","June 27, 2015","true","20.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

The past two being on the 360 and One. (Not including the first installment) I can tell you right now that if you aren't prepared to spend a lot of money, or don't have the mindset to learn, then do NOT buy this. If this doesn't fit you, keep reading.\n\nRocksmith 2014 is a game that requires you to plug in any electric guitar into your computer and play along to a set of notes on a screen. This means that in addition to buying the game, you need an electric guitar, and the Rocksmith Real-Tone Cable, which you can find here: http://www.amazon.com/Rocksmith-2014-Cable-Trilingual-playstation-2/dp/B00I0701P4/ref=sr_1_1/183-4779015-1118238?ie=UTF8&qid=1462759501&sr=8-1&keywords=rocksmith+realtone+cable . I have heard there are ways to use a microphone to listen to your guitar and effectively do the same thing, but I have not tried it and I recommend just using the factory issued cable.\n\nNow to gameplay. With about 1000+ hours between all my copies; I can tell you firsthand that this game will teach you to play from no experience, as what I did when the first game came out. This game is for all levels of play and is not restricted to experts or newbies. This is the current way to learn guitar fast, while being fun too. With the overwhelming amount of dlc (It's like $3000 for everything at full price atm), you can also download tracks that other users have created here: http://customsforge.com/ (You need to make an account).\n\nGiven what the game is, the replay value of this game is literally limitless, and is well worth it. The final bits to note are to not give up on this game! The better you get at the game, the more fun you will have mastering all your favorite songs.","May 8","true","13.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Once you have the game optimized though you will find that the game is pure gold if you are truly trying to learn the guitar.\n\nThe first point is riff repeater, being able to slow a song down and play with the slowed tempo note for note while having the correct tablature is absolutely amazing. You play with the song at a slower tempo to match your current skill level, just as a student of the guitar would try to learn via a metronome however you feel the groove and you can miss some notes.... people trying to learn a new song for the first time miss notes all the time, and the game lets you know what notes you missed for further improvement...constant practice is ideal and this system is the best I have found.\n\nThe second point is the in game effects. Being able to play any song that’s on the game and not having to worry about effects (it automatically switches for you) is a great addition. In order to play and sound similar to songs at home you need to have effects, all of which cost money to have in pedals or software programs. You can also have have fun in tone designer where you can create any tone you want via the provided effects, which seem somewhat comprehensive.\n\nThe last point is the session mode. As a guitar player you will be expected to improvise and jam. Session mode lets you load up any scale you are currently studying, or just for a jam to be played with automated band mates. The mode is great for "finding yourself" on guitar and its displays all of the notes that you are trying to jam on.\n\npros:\nguitar hero like learning experience that has been optimized for real student’s players\ntrue guitar effects offered in game that would cost much more than retail price of RS14\nRiff Repeater... need I say more?\nSession mode to be there when you have no band mates.\nAs a gamer it seems like it makes learning fun,\n\nthings not mentioned are guitarcade, score attack, in game tuner to many popular tunings.\n\nCons:\nRequires purchase of real tone cable. (this is a small cost when compared to the value of RS14)\nRequires guitar to be setup or in the ball park. (you cannot accurately play RS14 with a cheapass guitar, care about your tone and be careful about buying a guitar. look for an ideal neck and most importantly play the guitar and get a feel for it. I add this only because my first guitar had a warped neck due to the ignorance of myself, the buyer when I purchased it from a pawn shop.\n\nadditional thoughts:\nGrab a guitar, have a positive outlook on things and I can guarantee that you will progress as a player. Take the time to slow songs down, develop your ears, and try to improvise as a player. Check out guitarcade if you get burntout, however its more of a game than a teaching tool\n\nI would be estatic if a new release of this tittle came out, till then jam out brothers.\n\nfinal verdict: 9/10\n","April 21","true","749.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

I have both this and the original Rocksmith and this one is better. Though I do miss a few things from the original, that this has superior note recognition, less lag and a few more techniques give it a solid edge.\n\n2. I can only review this as someone who has played guitar for years. I think it would work for learning guitar to begin with but what I can say for sure is practicing with this will maintain and improve your guitar skills if you already play. It is much better than just picking up a guitar and noodling around for an hour and it is more fun than practicing with a metronome. The only thing I could recommend over this is jamming with other players.\n\n3. For new players: learning guitar takes a long time. That 400 hours you spent before you got really good at twitch shots in Counter Strike, that is not even close. Sorry you had to hear it from me.\n\n4. For everyone: learn to play and get good at the songs you don't like. You will be exposed to techniques and rhythms you would otherwise miss. It will make you a better player.\n\n5. Getting 100% on a song does not mean you can actually play it well. I have seen way too many YouTube vids of people 100%ing songs with this that just sound all kinds of shaky rhythmically. This gives you the ability to listen back to your performance. Give your fingers a break and do this every now and again.\n\n6. This still has trouble with note tracking on bass sometimes. Sometimes it's pretty severe. Yes, I checked my intonation.\n\n7. If you follow the path specified for you in this game, it makes you spend a lot of time playing w/ these cheesy jam-along tracks and that is just annoying. I dunno about you but playing scale notes to a poor sounding fake classic rock band is just not my idea of a good time.\n\n8. The guitarcade games actually help you so play them. They do help w/ your playing somewhat but they really excel at is keeping your attention on the screen and not on the fretboard since you can't memorize them like you do a song.\n\n9. It is kinda a bummer that they make you pay an extra ten bucks to play the tracks from the original game. Or, not so much that, but that you pay ten dollars and it still doesn't transfer your progress over. Sucks to you for that, Ubisoft!\n\n10. The feature in this called riff repeater that lets you repeat and slow down tough parts of the songs is way better than in the original where I found it nearly unusable. I do wish you could just play slowed down versions of whole songs though.\n\n11. I would not suggest sinking too much money into a guitar for this if you are just beginning. A guitar in the range of like $150 or maybe even cheaper will be perfectly adequate. Buy it at a guitar store and ask if they will check the intonation and set up for you as a condition of your purchase. This is a reasonable thing to do and they won't think you are being a big nerd or anything.\n\n12. Every now and again you will be truly killing it on a rad song and the dumb cable will stop working and you will get really, really mad. Express this anger. You are an artist.\n\n13. There is more to life than video games and more to life than playing guitar but if you put both together, you are pretty damn close. Maybe have a kid or something if you feel unfulfilled. I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life.","May 10","true","23.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","14","15","8","0"

I have the game set to Rhythm Guitar.\n\nIn short, the game is definitely good, it will definitely help you learn an instrument in a way that is more fun than having a tutor throwing mass amounts of complicated difficult to remember information at you, but has enough imperfections to make you frustrated and annoyed with each song until you're able to push through them with patience and get used to it. So it might not be better than a tutor, but it's probably not worse either. And it's likely a lot cheaper too... so there's that.\n\nI don't know the game all that well, so I won't pretend to know everything about it, and there's a good chance I might be wrong on a few things I'm about to write, but this is my experiences so far.\n\nI wish the game had better options for setting the difficulty and song speed before starting each song and during the song, instead of a regular speed and instead of the difficulty curve based on how well you do during the song. Because most of the time, I'll finally start to get the hang of the song's current difficulty, but then throw a bunch more new notes at me, overwhelming me with notes I can't handle at all. Most of the time, it'll go from 1 or 2 notes per strum to 5 or 6 in a very awkward hand position on the guitar and quickly go to other notes without even giving you a chance to figure out the first set of new notes. I just end up looking at the screen and going "Are for f****ing kidding me?" and just quit the song and move onto another one that I haven't played yet. Now if I was able to manually set the difficulty myself and maintain that difficulty until I'm ready for the new notes, and if I was able to manually set the speed of each songs, and maybe increase or decrease both while in the song... then I'd probably be a lot less frustrated, would enjoy the game far more and would definitely learn a lot quicker too.\n\nI will add that this is currently the only way that has helped motivate me into learning an instrument. I've tried to self teach myself into learning the piano, drums, etc... I could never learn proper notes on a sheet, let alone get used to the hand positions and hitting the right notes, etc... I can see this game becoming quite fun once I actually start getting pretty good at it. So far, the highest I've reached so far is about 55.9% on 1 song, 50% and lower for the rest, but one of them hurts my fingers a lot (and it tears through finger tip protectors quickly, which isn't good cuz they're expensive) and the the rest seem to get more and more difficult rather quickly.\n\nThe game is really good for tuning your instruments (even better / more accurate than the built in guitar tuner), picks up on the notes while playing surprisingly well (unlike Songs2See), it even has options to allow the game to be more lenient on your imperfect / badly timed note playing so even if your instrument isn't tuned in 100% perfect, it'll still pick it up just fine so long as it's set up at a lenient setting.\n\nI do definitely recommend this game since it's currently the best program / game out there for learning how to play an instrument (much better than Songs2See even though S2S might be better for learning the actual notes on a sheet).\n\nOn a side note, I do wish the game had a few easy / beginner songs in which rookies could actually complete 100%... like a sort of tutorial, to allow us to get comfortable with this style of game and feel like we accomplished something. Right now, I have a nasty bloody blister on my thumb, I still feel like I completely suck at playing the guitar, I have nothing at all to show my friends for all my efforts, even after almost 20 hours of playtime, I still don't know how to play any of the songs and I have the feeling it's going to require around 100 more hours before I can finally complete 1 song. I have no intentions of quitting, of course, but I just wish the game had a motivational song which we could complete 100% instead of slowly being able to get better over time and maybe someday be able to complete most if not all the songs all of a sudden (since they all feel equally very difficult).","February 26, 2015","true","32.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","2"

For so long I would just pick up my guitar for specific things, like accenting synth lines or playing the same Cure and Bauhaus songs that I've been playing for years. Rocksmith has kind of lit this spark in me where I once again am picking up my guitar with a renewed sense of joy and wonder. I've been playing Rocksmith a LOT, but an interesting side-effect is that when I close it, I don't want to stop playing.

My friends all told be "Just look at some YouTube Videos" or "just get some tabs and you're away". Realistically, you need 1 on 1 tuition to get started and for the price of a couple of lessons you can buy this game and a real tone cable. I am really glad I got this, it encourages me to pick up my guitar every day and practice. I am sure I will reach a wall in terms of how useful it is, but it got me over a lot of hurdles and gave me a lot of confidence. I still have a long way to go, but I feel like a have a path mapped out and I look forward to playing a little every day, which is always a good sign for musical instruments or games.\n\nBased on discussions with a lot of my muso mates, I picked up a Yamaha Pacifica to use with this and it works really well. I have suffered no input lag with the real tone cable and I've really enjoyed how it lets me play the way I want to. I have learned a lot by playing the songs and then going into session mode and mucking about. I am not a huge fan of the arcade stuff, but it's easy to avoid.\n\nIf you've always wanted to learn to play then I think this is a really great place to start. Alternatively, if you have never really cared but have enjoyed playing games like Rock Band or Guitar Hero, this is the natural progression (a basic starter guitar like the Yamaha doesn't cost much more than the cheap plastic peripheral you need to buy for these games either, and it certainly feels a lot nicer to hold)","April 21, 2015","true","32.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deaththreatuk/recommended/221680/","deaththreatuk","Death Threat UK!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deaththreatuk/","687 products in account","Ever wanted to try out the guitar? Or maybe you laready own one, and you need help geting good at it? This might be the tool you need.\n\nWhen the first RockSmith came out, it was a novel idea, but not a new one. Games had tried to teach people to play music for real before, and the guitar was no stranger to this. But what made RockSmith good in my eyes was that it actually worked. It didn't just drop you in the deep end and say 'go', it helped you get through each riff step by step until you could play them note for note without even seeing them on screen.\n\nBut it wasn't without it's faults and shortcomings. Thankfully, that's where this version comes in.\n\nThe 2014 version added many features to the game, but it's overall shape became much less of a 'game', so to speak. The score you earn for each song is outright removed (available in a seperate mode if you still want that though) so now learning a song only tracked your progress in learning it. You still have objectives to clear, but these are all again geared towards advancing your learning of the instrument. While bass guitar was added late in the first game, here it's a native choice to play bass. And for both the guitar and the bass, the style of playing guitar has taken leaps forward. Gone is the options of learning a chord ttrack, single note track and combo track for each song; Now they exist as a much more sensible Rhythm and Lead option, alongside the Bass.\n\nPlaying the instrument itself is now much clearer too. Many styles of guitar and bass play that were sorely absent from the last game, such as two-hand tapping, pinch harmonies, fret hand muting, and slapping and popping for bass, are now in the game for you to learn, alongside a far more accurate slide and bend notation, that actually shows you how far to bend the string this time and where to raise or lower the bend as the note carries on.\n\nBut if you ever want to make it just  little more 'fun', then the returning Guitarcade can perhaps help you there, featuring a much nicer looking set of games to help you learn guitar play while under pressure. As earlier mentioned, there is also a new Score Attack mode for those that still want to chase the leaderboards with their songs, and it also features the ability for you to fail out now, meaning you'll have to know what you're playing before you come in here.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Session Mode. An entirely new addition, this is a more free-form jam mode that allows you to play your own riffs and have an AI band back you up. It also helps teach you the different scales. A very useful addition for those looking to move beyond playing cover songs.\n\nOverall, RockSmith 2014 is an improvement over the first game in far too many ways to count at this point. You'll need a decent rig to run it, mind, but if you're looking for a good fun tool to get you somewhere on guitar, there isn't really anything else out there that meets this standard.\n\nAs long as you can get the RealTone Cable, of course.","February 25","true","165.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Suffice it to say that I love it! It is a really engaging way to learn to play the guitar. There's hundreds of songs to learn to play, dozens of games to play, and lots of video lessons to take. There are exercises at the end of each lesson so you can test yourself to see how well you've mastered each one. The games are pretty cool, each game covers a different playing technique, so if you feel like you might need more practice in a specific area of playing there is most likely a game that corresponds to that certain skill, i.e. scale games to build speed and learn the notes and scales and chord games to build up your set of chords and to learn to shift between them.\nLearning to play the songs is by far the best part of the game to me. You might want to check out the game thoroughly to see if the DLC and the core game has music that you like! I know the game is called ROCKsmith, so if you are a country music fan and want to learn by playing country tunes, you might be a bit disappointed by the absence of country tunes in the game. I can see that the devs really try to keep a healthy mix of rock tune styles, which I really enjoy. I have heard a lot of songs that I would not have ever have had the chance to hear if it were not for Rocksmith-it really has broadened my musical horizons, as it were.\nI am still on the "easy" levels but I can feel myself inproving. I really look forward to practicing my guitar now because I truly enjoy playing Rocksmith 2014.\nLastly, the other people on Steam that play the game are pretty cool. I can say without reservation that Rocksmith 2014 has the best Steam Community that I have ever seen. There's lots of help and support and friendship from the other Rocksmith players should you ever need it.\nGet it! Play it!

I did this and then started learning some music theory to, just to expand my abilities and understanding of music. It is rather a tool than a all in all guitar experience, do not fool yourself into thinking that you can be a guitar player just by following this simple yet addictive teaching platform.\n\nNow, first of all, it does not have everything, it misses the human interaction but I guess, it excuses a real teacher from having to wait for you to get better. You can learn at your own pace without having to get distracted, it is just you and your will to learn. Now, that is fine as long as you do not resume your learning to just that of the game, it is fun, simple and addictive, but why not take it further and start learning music like a pro? You can do this but only outside the game, as Rocksmith 2014 does not teach music theory, only techniques define-related to guitar or bass.\n\nThe presentation of the game and menus are nice and they tell you exactly what to do, but it can get overwhelming sometimes, as too many representations of notes on screen will get you into believing it is all a sad joke. After a while you get used to the pace and start playing by memory because simple eye-hand coordination from the display wouldn't normaly be enough to play, it is that fast.\n\nIt has a guitarcade, an area of the game where you do stupid-fun games to further enhance your skills, these are fun laid back games, made for gamers. These minigames are difficult and they will better your dexterity and skills with the guitar, a nice addition to a good package.\n\nIt also has a session mode, where you jam with your guitar in different rithms and beats accompanied by other simulated instruments. The way you sing and the pace you give the play will make the instruments come to a good play and you can sing like this for hours. Great mode!\n\nI will give this a 9/10 for minor bugs and crashes. The only downside is that it can only be compared to it's earlier version, Rocksmith. It is a great and simple tool to make you start playing the guitar. If it does this I guess it serves it's purpose.","June 28, 2014","true","71.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

I will start off by saying that I'm 38 years old and I haven't touched an instrument in years. I played piano for 6 years (grades 2 - 8) which taught me to read music and a lot of music theory. I plunked around on an acoustic guitar here and there in high school, but never really learned to play anything. A few years ago I was introduced to Rock Band 3 and had a lot of fun with it. I got back into Rock Band with the release of 4 and started wondering about turning that Rock Band experience into real music experience. I remember running across Rocksmith reviews and reading good things about it. I started looking into Rocksmith, reading reviews and watching videos. I was floored when I saw that playing along with songs was nearly identical to Rock Band. Hey! I know how to do that! :)\n\nFast forward through boring details about buying a guitar with my boyfriend and then buying a bass for myself...\n\nGoing into Rocksmith, I knew that all the important technique things that you need to force yourself to practice were disguised as games (the Guitarcade). I usually don't get caught up in score chasing or leveling up or earning banana stickers so I wasn't sure if I'd be motivated enough to play them. Holy cow, they are fun! My goal is to be able to play without looking at my hands and playing String Skip Saloon and Ducks ReDux has gone a long way in helping me do so. I was spending 50% of my play time (playing at least 1 hour a night) in the Guitarcade and it was paying off in leaps and bounds. My boyfriend, who has been playing guitar on and off for years, noticed that I was outpacing him in a few areas. (He tends to put on continuous play for an hour and go through songs.) He remarked "I need to start playing more Guitarcade games!"\n\nI also follow along with and try to complete the goals that Rocksmith sets out for me. Although I don't do much with Session Mode, I did learn a lot about using it and learned some important music theory along the way. Pretty neat!\n\nAfter 3 weeks of playing, I am floored by the progression that I have made. I never expected to be as far along as I am. I am by no means a "Rock God", but I'm doing way more than plunking out Mary Had a Little Lamb or Happy Birthday. :)\n\nI look forward to practicing. Let me say that again: I LOOK FORWARD TO PRACTICING. Crazy! The Guitarcade games are fun and challenging. It's fun learning songs and there are a lot of fun songs to learn that come with the game. Through Guitarcade playing I found that I unlocked some original Rocksmith songs. Neat! I haven't bought any DLC yet and I'll wait for the Steam sale for that.\n\nWe bought a second copy of Rocksmith and we will sometimes play multiplayer mode. It's a lot of fun! "Oh my god! This is real life Rock Band!"\n\nJust like any talent, if you put the time into it, you'll get something out of it. Rocksmith makes it super easy and fun to put that time in.","March 31","true","71.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Almost 1000h later and I can actually play the guitar, I can play what I feel like playing now. Rocksmith is an awesome teacher but don't pretend like you can do this without your own effort. 1000H of your life can be a lot of time to dedicate, and if you aren't willing to at least pour in a hundred hours you won't get much out of it.\n\nThe guitarcade is the coolest, it's so much harder to stare at paper with notes on it trying to figure out how to play a scale when you can just hop on scale warriors - and work your way through A LOT of scales(even if you suck at first). Rocksmith gives you knowledge and the ability to feel like you are actually progressing, without progression you can feel real lost, this game is very good at keeping it interesting.\n\nEven if you don't like the songs there is a site called customsforge that has sooo many songs you can download from.(Granted the tabs are not all perfect and some I had to re learn online but in my opinion it shows you multiple ways to make similar sounds). Overtime you can easily start to see paterns and learn from your senses.\n\nOverall this game is totally worth it, so if you are into music and you want to play the guitar, hop on board!","March 10","true","844.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Rocksmith 2014 is fantastic. It improves upon every aspect of the original game and has a metric tonne more features to rock out to.\nFirstly it has done away with the performance mode, which was where you would play a gig at a number of Royal-Albert-Halls to a crowd of cardboard cutout people. The people were well rendered greenscreens of actors, in a very L.A. Noire-esque style, but they were all individually animated and in great abundance, so the game would lag on a lot of systems potentially making the songs unplayable. The other problem was that the actors danced away to a predetermined tempo, so every few seconds the animation would have to restart itself, assumably to prolong the lie of synchronisation. Rocksmith 2014 has scrapped the stadiums in favour of silhouettes of your audience all dancing in time. It's simple, pretty and doesn't defeat the object of a musical game.\nEverything in the game feels a lot more smooth. There's no delay or lag within songs like the previous game had, especially when the computer had to decide if you played a chord right. There are 100% no loading screens. You pick a song and it throws notes your way. It is nice to see that Ubisoft have taken what the community says on board. The original greeted a loading screen with the information that you could give your guitar a little play while you wait. After suggestions from consumers, you can now play at any time in the menus.\nThe types of notes that you play are improved very well. The bend notes are described excellently telling you how far to bend and how long to bend the string, which is a damn sight better that the "It's a bend, off you go" from the first game. The same goes for slides, which before reminded me of "cut it carefully" from the Cooking Mama series. You can now expect to see palm mutes within chords as well as single notes and you can expect regular mutes as well. Two-hand tapping is also included in the songs which is great fun.\nIn short, this game is everything a sequel should be: more refined, more features and so much better.","January 8, 2014","true","91.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Before too long you'll be given chords, double-stops, legato techniques, and plenty of other new bits to play.\nThe way the difficulty works is good, it won't give you something to play that's way over your head (too often), but keeps you improving at a good rate.\n\nIn the few weeks I've been playing, I've progressed a lot further with my skills than I have in all my previous attemps to learn guitar without Rocksmith.

New songs are released every week though.\n* There's no option to see the music to play in Tab format.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend it, it's a lot of fun and you learn something while you play.","November 10, 2014","true","65.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I now have 100 hours in this game.  I sometimes do exercises and cord drills while watching TV but not as much lately.  So why am I changing my review?  Well, although I feel that I am not musically gifted I now know that I can play and this is really growing on me.  I can actually play songs, hear what I am playing and am actually getting better at them without even using Rift Repeater.  I have more fun playing every song on lead and rhythm over and over and naturally progress.  Now Rocksmith will never let you rest so you have to be patient and know that if you nailed that song the last time then it will be harder this time.\n\nI can now say that I am very happy to be doing something really fun like playing a guitar rather than just playing some other game that takes you nowhere – I still do love unwinding with Defense Grid 2 and watching people playing Rocksmith on Twitch.\n\nAs for errors: Once in a while a song by Foreigner and another song lose their tone but that is it.  The broken string thing never happened again.  As for the Xbox – Have not went back to that as I loving it on Steam with no issues.  For the bass – I am so busy with both guitar modes that I have yet to have time to get to that.  As for not hitting notes when you do – Try not to retune a lot and when you do tune again once you enter a song and you should be fine.\n\nSo lately rather than logging out and feeling like a failure or know understanding my progress I now able to improve on practically everything that I play.  There are a couple of songs where I just need to dive into the Rift Repeater to move them forward.  Right now though I am just playing everything in both guitar modes and having fun.  In a few months from now I will probably start attacking songs one at a time and finishing them up.\n\nAs for this being a computer game it could have some really easy improvements in functions and graphics but it does do what you want it to do.  So after 100 hours I can really see some improvement, can learn new things on my own, am having more fun and suggest this game for you to try.  Still faithfully doing 1 hour each night (even if I am in the mood or not  LOL).\n\nFIRST REVIEW.....\nIf you REALLY have a passion to learn the guitar or bass then get this for sure.  If you want to play a game and learn guitar then pass.  For computer gammers the graphics are just horrible in the learning games.  There are no slow modes in the games so you spend more time restarting the games rather than playing them.  Every time the game tunes me from E standard to E sharp my little E string breaks - Lost 2 now.  DRM so watch that.  The people that you see ripping it up on Twitch have all played for years and just use Rocksmith to see what to play on a PC rather than on paper.  This game will not teach you to read music but only Rocksmith string colors.  Rocksmith also seems to favor speed over slowly developing good habits.  This is probably because the game is geared to hard rock, metal and alternative music.\n\nNow, I am probably not a natural at this and am a total beginner.  Am I getting better? - No clue really.  After 40 hours still cannot play Mary Had a Little Lamb yet.  I can play partials of many songs though - That said I have yet to attack any one song and have played everything once on lead and rythm.  Even when I do good on a song run I play it again to relive that experience and they throw more at you - You really never get a chance to just relax and repeat things.\n\nI play some pretty intense computer/console games and always have fun - I seem to log out of Rocksmith a lot feeling like a failure despite getting good progress in most things.  I have even logged out flustrated a few times.  Each night I play the games until I beat any 2 of my high scores then off to songs.  Lessons are horrible for me as I have to practice just to do one - Well the first few are easy but after that they are just way to fast.  Session mode is really cool if you can already play but if you are like me then you are just making noise even though they tell you what notes to play.  Game has some weird issues at times like the path tells me to go into session mode and tune my guitar using the tools - I do that but never seem to get the progress.  I have two hung progress goals so I quit doing those.\n\nI first bought the game for Xbox One thinking that this would be a cool living room game but that was a total failure - Freezes/hangs and is practically unplayable.  The PC version from Steam is much better with only minor issues.  No matter how good you play you will see everyone on Twitch rebooting the game after an hour of play.\n\nI have tested the bass and guitar.  My guitar is a Mexican Fender Stratocaster and I seem to like it but cannot tell you what is the best one for me or you.  So for me Rocksmith did show me that I can learn the guitar but I doubt that it will be my end game.  I have found some passion and play 1 to 2 hours each night.  I am also afriad that I am doing things wrong that I will have to unlearn later.  I might look into lessons later but will continue to test this out.\n\nOh, one more thing: A note to play comes down to you put #1 finger on it and play it only to find out that that you are about to play some notes in the other direction so you need to shift.  Why not just show you the range that is coming down?  I will keep at this game and see where I am at a month from now but I am already worried because I cannot seem to feel good despite getting better.\n\nGood luck to you all with this game....","December 6, 2014","true","601.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

I've put this game down and restarted so many times my ACTUAL gameplay count would be like... 2 at best.\nNow, onto the review.\n\nThe bad:\nMissions. Missions you say? What is this, GTA? Skyrim?!\nYes, this thing has "missions". And that little rectangle will ♥♥♥♥ you off beyond belief. A good chunk of said missions are useless. "Play ____ in the guitarcade!". Yes, "guitarcade". You get to play little minigames, like a weird version of flappyybird or some kind of space invaders thing. Except with ducks. I don't know why ducks either.\nThe idea is THERE, again, but the ♥♥♥♥ poor ability of the cable to distinguish various sounds makes it harder to actually hit anything. And god help you with the chord games.\n\nThe tuners.\nThere are two tuners in the game: one when you calibrate your gutiar between songs (eg. one that is regular E and one that is dropdown D) and the tuner in the options. The calibrating tuner is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Sure, you can't expect your guitar to be precisely calibrated every time because tension physics is a thing. I would suggest using the tuner in the options more than the calibration tuner. It's more accurate.\n\nMore songs than technique.\nThe game has a lot of songs. Like fifty that come with the installation and an option to download more, assuming you're willing to shell out a few bucks. They're not too expensive, though I must say that I haven't tried to purchase any yet. Not sure how THAT bit would work.\nMy guess here is that Ubisoft is going for the idea that if you learn a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of songs, you'll be able to rearrange the chords into your own style. Kinda having this whole thing as a secret, GIGANTIC tutorial.\n\nThe good:\nThe game does try to encourage you using recordings of a "hip" guy, presumably in his thirties who may or may not have played in a band in college and now his life is in shambles as he tries to recreate his glory days.\nHe somehow sounds both happy and depressed at the same time. Not sure how, but he also has this "punch me in the face RIGHT NOW" voice.\n\nThere is, in fact, an amount of basic explanation of how to perform various techniques needed for songs. Sure, there's no explanation of how to practice them, but at least you're getting information on what you can do with your guitar. Before I encountered Rocksmith, I thought you just hold strings and flail like a maniac.\n\nThe basic pack is actually good!\nIn many games with a ton of DLC, such as Rocksmith, the basic pack is there to provide you with a reasonable experience, ending up with you yearning for more. Usually, the DLC is stuff you wouldn't even ponder. Here, the situation is quite the opposite: You get quite a versatile list of free songs to choose from, and if you want to search for a song that you desparately want to learn and it's not in the free pack, it's probably in the DLC somewhere.\n\nThere's a ♥♥♥♥ton of DLC\nContinuing my previous point, there is indeed at least one metric ♥♥♥♥ton of DLC. Assuming you don't get bored and/or die of natural causes as you attempt to bring all of the free songs to 100%... level...? rating...? You have quite a lot of DLC to choose from. So far, it's only extra songs to play, meaning, no equivalent's of Skyrim's golden horse armor plating. The DLC in Rocksmith is actually USEFUL!\n\nConclusion\nIs this game fun? It depends on the personality. I personally tend to get obsessed with a game and the drop it for a year. As I'm writing this, I'm trying to get my obsession back up.\nI do believe that if you give it quite some time, you will master the guitar much faster than youtube classes.\nYou may also end up in ER with insane calluses, bleeding fingers and possibly, bone fractures on your fingers and wrists, but at least you'll enjoy getting these injuries.","March 19","true","96.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","5","6","4","3"

You may have zero knowledge about music and musical instruments yet still play the game and get results. It will teach you everything you need to start playing and creating music - from how to attach the strap to the guitar to more advanced things like slapping or using effects pedals (available within the game).\n\nAnother thing is that even if you're already a good guitar player, you can still enjoy playing Rocksmith. There are over 50 songs of different genres and decades you can play along with. You can have a friend connect their bass guitar and join you, or you can even sing in the mic. You can also treat the game as something to beat, by mastering all the songs without any visual help from the game. You also get to experiment with the large amount of sound effects Rocksmith provides. Still not happy? Try the mini-games with leaderboards. Beat the world or just your Uplay friends at sliding, playing chords, scales and so on. And if that doesn't satisfy, the Session Mode will give you a band that can equip a variety of instruments related to many genres to create a rhythm for you or support you adjusting to the way you play.\n\nAll in all, it's a must-buy if you have an electric guitar or a bass. The amount of money invested totally pays off, even if you buy the Import tool to get the tracks from the original Rocksmith or choose to add more songs by buying separate DLCs from well-known bands like KISS, AFI, Muse or The Police (Sting).\nHaving a music teacher, finding a band, guitar tabs, buying amps, effects pedals or a dedicated computer program that would emulate these would require way more money and effort.","August 7, 2014","true","174.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

No more stumbling around or being unsure how to hold your hand for a certain chord. Rocksmith has everything easily explained, as complicated as it knows you can play, rewarding with levels of progression, and an awesome session mode. It suggested I play along with it's band for 10 minutes, and I was locked in learning scales and chords for two hours.

Or Love music rhythm games, well this is for you.\n\nPersonally from my experience so far, Rocksmith 2014 is much more polished and with lots of new fun features in the new 2014 edition to the first release, arcade games are better and the learning process for each song has improved too with feedback and recommendations after you play, built in video guitar lessons from professionals (which are very good), and you learn at your own pace. Even if you cannot play guitar after playing this you will be able to learn to play or enjoy playing a simpler version of the song with the simplified notes.\n\nAlso another thing is back in high school i took guitar lessons, and played guitar but i never actually played a song from start to finish, usually just random riffs or just mucking about, but Rocksmith makes learning the song and practicing even just a single song for hours fun.\n\nAlso for a low price, if you own a guitar and don’t already own this game, I recommend giving this a go, Super fun, and makes even the boring and hard part of learning guitar extremely fun, and having the progress bar is extremely nice to see how well you are doing and the game motivates you to try and 100% master the song. Also for musicians the Jam sessions have intelligent Ai to Jam with which is pretty cool.\n\nOnly issues I had was a little audio lag, and also the volume on my High E and sometimes the B string might not get recognized however takes a bit of time calibrating the right settings, but once everything is all set up and sounding nicely, it’s a very fun game and fastest guitar learning software & game out there.","October 26, 2013","true","27.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/recommended/221680/","arleas","arleas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arleas/","1379 products in account","Back in the day when Guitar Hero and Rock Band became popular, I used to think how cool it would be if you could do the same thing but with real instruments.  Well, I've only put 10 hours into this so far, but it's very useful for learning to play guitar.\n\nThe starting selection of songs is OK with at least one or two songs I wanted to learn to play.  The prices for some of the DLC songs is a bit much for my liking but assuming they keep adding to the list of songs it may very well prove to be a case where I'd actually WANT to purchase and use the DLC.  Right now I think I can live without them (especially since I'm still very much a beginner).\n\nYou've got basically a set of lessons for everything from how to hold the guitar and manually tuning it all the way up to some complicated techniques.  These include practice lessons so you can demonstrate to the game that you've mastered it (except for the first few lessons that don't include actually playing).  From what I've seen, most of these lessons can be taken from 0% to 100% mastery in no time at all, though some of the techniques are tricky enough that it could take some hard work to get it down.\n\nThe Voice Over/Teacher in the game does his best to sound non-intimidating, but can instead come off sounding insincere, especially when you know that you flubbed the lesson and he says "good job!" at the end.  Then again, at least one point he told me I needed more work and yet another time I was told "it could be worse".  Gee, Thanks.\n\nYour other options include "Learn a Song", Session Play (where you have a virtual backup band play for you), and the guitarcade.  Learn a song is self-explanatory, Session Play could be fun when you're ready to jam assuming you can tell the backup band just which chords you want to play, and the Guitarcade is a great way to practice without it feeling dull.\n\nI've played a bit of the guitarcade to help familiarize myself with the guitar and it's slowly helping.  I can feel myself reaching for the right strings more often, and hitting the proper frets without having to look quite as much.  I am not sure I exactly agree with their system of levelling up on these games, but that helps to give you a secondary goal to just increasing your score.\n\nSpeaking of goals, this game is chock full of them.  Sometimes the game will decide it's time you looked at a new song, or tried a new mode, and other times the game considers you need more practice with chords and sends you to the guitarcade to work on it.  This is kind of a nice feature, but it feels too random at some times.   Other times the goals make more sense, like when you're learning a song, it may recommend you work on a particularly hard phrase.\n\nHowever, It can be rather demanding for a newbie.  When you first learn a song, it tells you to play one note on one string and that's it.  After you demonstrate you can do this ONCE it may decide to up the ante and now you're playing two notes on two strings.  Just when you think you're getting the hang of it, it throws more at you until you feel like you're overwhelmed again.  I would like to feel like I've made progress first before going into the harder territory.  I think there's a way to reset progress on a song but that could put you too far back.\n\nAt least when you're using the "Riff Repeater" you can choose how much it throws at you, for how long, how many times you have to play it before it moves on, if it should get harder or not, etc.  The riff repeater is probably the best thing about learning a song since you can customize it fully.\n\nThe store has tagged this mistakenly as having Uplay.   The game itself does not require Uplay at all though.  It doesn't show up in my list of games on Uplay when I do launch it, and even though I am given the option of logging into Uplay, it's through the game with an email and password only...No Client running in the background.\n\nAlso, the Rocksmith website offers a "60 day Challenge", where you can show your progress from complete beginner to novice guitar player in just 60 days.  The caveat to this is that they expect you to play at least one full hour per day, and the timer doesn't run unless you're actively in a lesson, learning a song, doing the guitarcade or whatever.\n\nSteam at this time says I've played for 11.4 hours, Ubisoft says I've played for 3 hours and 44 minutes and the 60 day challenge website says I've done 2 days worth of practice. :(\n\nI was going to update this at 60 game hours but that  blew right by so fast I had no idea it was gone. Instead I'm editing this at the 60 day mark since I got the game.  Can I play a song 100% No... almost though.  I've got a couple in the 80%-90% range right now.\n\nNext update when Ubisoft thinks I've completed their challenge.  It seems to only record 1 day of the challenge if I've spent at least 2 hours in game (not in menus).","February 19, 2014","true","368.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

A couple of years later I'm actually a passable guitar player.\n\nWhat the game will not do:\nIt won't make you Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, Guthrie Govan, or guitar hero x.\nIt won't hold your hand or answer every minor question you have when you first start playing.\nIt won't teach you all the theory behind the songs you're playing.\n\nWhat the game will do:\nIt will teach you enough theory to get by (via some pretty generic lessons and mini games).\nIt will introduce you to improvisation (session mode).\nIt will probably introduce you to some pretty cool music you haven't heard before.\nPossibly trigger a mid-life crisis.\nProbably turn you into a guitar gear junky.\n\nBut most importantly it will get you past those first HUGE humps to learning guitar - building callouses, finger dexterity, and getting in some effective practice.  The biggest roadblock for me on my previous attempts to learn was wondering WTF to play when I did sit down to practice.  This game helped me personally with that a lot since you can just flip on a great song and play along without turning the pages in some book or trying to decipher a tab.  The dynamic difficulty has some quirks no doubt, but in the end you can always manually adjust what level you want the song at (for those wondering how to do this, just put the whole song in riff repeater).  So even beginners can fire up Satch Boogie and just put it on the lowest difficulty and play along (admittedly even on lowest difficulty this one could be tough for beginners).\n\nIn the end, I would call this an extremely effective introduction for brand new guitar players, and a very good practice tool for beginners and intermediate players.  If you can't get into playing using this software, then playing guitar may not be for you.","May 20, 2015","true","819.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

This game is the most awesome learning experience for a musical instrument I've ever encountered in any media.  I've tried learning guitar a few times in the past but it was boring and painful making it hard to stick with it.  This game isn't perfect but it gets so much right, you just want to keep coming back for more.  I hope this game has a very long life.\n\nOne of the achievements was bass only so I decided to get the Electro-Harmonix PitchFork pedal so I could switch between playing all 3 paths (lead, rhythm, bass) at the press of a button.  That was a great addition to my setup and opened up all the bass items which are a lot of fun too.  I'm playing with a basic starter guitar: Epiphone Special II.\n\nPros: The most motivating features for me were the achievements and the methods for grading your progress.  Each song has 5 ways of scoring your progress (Learn A Song percentage, 4 levels of Score Attack) that makes me want to ace them all.  Learn A Song supports a breadth-first progression through a song (gradually adding notes as you get better in each phrase) and Score Attack is an arcade-style depth first progression through a difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Master).  Master mode hides the notes and was scary at first but its a great motivator for weaning you off the sight-reading and encourages you to listen for cues instead.  Learn A Song also has Riff Repeater which allows you to mark a section and then slow it down and vary the difficulty level -- this is indispensible for getting those hard riffs down.  I also enjoyed working through the Lessons and Guitarcade.  Guitarcade is a collection of about a dozen games and they are an excellent way to get some technique practice in without feeling like you're doing something as boring as scales.  I'd really like to see more of these mini-games as they are much more fun than practice exercises.\n\nCons: Ubisoft sites really suck at consistency.  Achievements and unlocks are shown on the Ubisoft site, the Rocksmith site, and Steam.  Steam is rock solid but the others are woefully inconsistent and aggravating to use.  500 missions?  Really?  What an annoying achievement!  Guitarcade's Hurtling Hurdles seems much too sensitive and poorly balanced compared to the other games.  Session mode -- the mission system kept pushing this but I found it a dreadful bore since I'm not good enough to improvise anything interesting at this point.","April 14, 2015","true","450.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It would also be great if you could study music and art at the same time and tour with a band to learn your instrument.\nthe problem is, not everybody has the time and oportunity to do this kind of stuff, it also involves quite a commitment. This is where rocksmith shines, it gets you playing. Despite all the flaws and the lack of theory it teaches you it gets you started soemwhere you gain not only an understanding on how to play the instrument but also an actual feeling for it.\nI'm looking back on playing the guitar for around 1000 hours now thanks to rocksmith, whereas in total the rocksmith hours float around 300ish i think... the other hours i played outside of rocksmith using whatever rocksmith taught me to understand and work on music theory to become an actual musician the way i like it.\nRocksmith will teach the fastest and the most effective on how to improve technically on the guitar. How your fingers move on the fretboard, how to hit your stuff. It won't teach you how to compose a song, or what actual music theory is, but let me tell you this:\n\nit's great WHEN you decide to dip into music theory that your hands are not holding you back anymore because you can translate what you learn so much faster than if you had to learn this from scratch as well. (and THAT is boring as hell).\n\n10/10 for this life changing game.","March 12, 2014","true","203.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've had Rocksmith since February 2014 and at the point of writing this review in July 2015 and after putting in I'd say around 200-300 hours with the xbox 360 version and now the PC version, I've pretty much got to a point where I can play most songs without trouble, some chords I still struggle with and obviously Sweet Child O'Mine can be a tad difficult but I'm definitely pleased with how far I've come in regards to ability.\n\nThe learning tools are fun and the skill games in arcade mode are challenging and actually help with remembering notes. The DLC track packs are constantly being rolled out so you're never short of songs to play, not to mention CLDC being made by members of the community (check out Custom's Forge, they have literally thousands of songs to download for free).\n\nAs far as the graphics go there's not much to say really, similarly to Rock Band graphics aren't really important, that being said the menu's and in game interfaces are all solid.\n\nOverall, well worth the money, I don't think I'd have ever got to the point where I can actually say yes I can play an instrument.","July 30, 2015","true","300.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

My biggest concern as I write this is that I've reached the point where the bass parts have two notes at the same time, and Rocksmith isn't recognizing when I play them. That will make playing some of the later songs more difficult, but hopefully Ubisoft can patch that up. I guess I'm also concerned that the further I get in, the bass parts will be more "difficult" if only because its throwing more and more strings of single finger position sixteenth notes.

I've enjoyed Rocksmith for the most part, and it's definitely improved my playing skill as time has gone on. My biggest concern as I write this is that I've reached the point where the bass parts have two notes at the same time, and Rocksmith isn't recognizing when I play them. That will make playing some of the later songs more difficult, but hopefully Ubisoft can patch that up. I guess I'm also concerned that the further I get in, the bass parts will be more "difficult" if only because its throwing more and more strings of single finger position sixteenth notes.

Very easy to pick up, very easy to learn songs, and there's a huge selection of them as well - you're bound to find something you like. The main downside of RS is the price, which comes with all music-related things. The game itself is kind of expensive, then you have to buy a guitar (if you don't have one already) and the 40mm-to-USB cable which costs quite a lot for a cable. I bet it's gold plated. Also the DLC is 2.99 per song, so don't waste your money on four minutes of power chords. At least there's a lot of artist packs which allow you to get more songs for less money.\n\nIn short: great game, kinda expensive, but that's to be expected with music things.

His point was simply that there was no substitute for putting in the time, and no real shortcuts  - though of course good instruction (such as his own) would help.\n\nRS2014 went away from its more "gamey" style predecessor to become more of a full-fledged training tool for the guitar. This was a good move. It's easily three times better than the original Rocksmith at meeting this goal. Everything is much, MUCH more instructive and convenient. It gives you lots of tools to learn popular (and not-so-popular) songs... really learn them, to the point where you can completely play them from memory. From the basic "Learn a song" tool to the flexible "Riff Repeater," which allows you to practice a section of a song over and over again, to the ability to test yourself at various skill levels in Score Attack - which is a lot like classic Guitar Hero / Rock Band type play. But it also includes dozens of lessons - many with practice tracks. And a number of "Guitarcade" technique games to take some of the boredom out of common drills.\n\nYou can simulate a large number of amps, cabinets, and effects to simulate all kinds of tones and use the game like a sound system and amp - and to learn how your favorite band got a particular tone for a particular song. `There's a "Session Mode" where you can practice jamming and improvising with a computer-controlled band. The game supports lead guitar, rhythm guitar, *AND* bass techniques - including a "bass emulation" mode to learn to play bass on a regular six-string guitar. And there's multi-player (really 2-player) capability, so a friend can plug in (with another cable, which currently runs $30) and the two of you can learn songs together, jam together in Session mode, play a duet with different song parts for a high score, and go head-to-head in a competition at the same difficulty level and part to see who is the better player.\n\nThe game isn't perfect in detecting the notes, and will allow some sloppiness in your playing that does not sound good to the human ear. Unplugging or adjusting the mix and really listening to yourself is a must, or you could develop some bad habits because the game will let you get away with it.\n\nUltimately, the success of the game is dependent on how successful it is at teaching you to play guitar. It's supposed to be "the fastest way to learn guitar." I don't know if that's exactly the case. But I will say this - it's helped me make more progress in the last six months than I had in twenty years on my own, so that's a good sign. I've been playing about 45 minutes per day, on the average, and it's really made a difference.\n\nBut the important thing to remember is that it doesn't work miracles. If you think you can master the guitar in the time it takes for you to master Super Mario Brothers, you are going to be disappointed. You won't go from being a beginner to playing like Eddie Van Halen in 60 hours. That 3000 hour thing is not super flexible. The game does help in two ways:\n\n1) It can provide lots of feedback and support to help make your practice time more efficient. This may yield somewhat greater improvement per hour of practice than doing so unaided.\n\n2) It can make your practice time more fun, which may encourage you to practice more, and stick with it.\n\nAnd that's really all it can do, though that's awesome. In the end - if you want to learn to play guitar, you are going to HAVE to put in the hours. There's no way around that. If RS2014 makes those hours more productive and more fun (and I believe it does), that's a win!","May 27, 2014","true","570.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanlumiere/recommended/221680/","sanlumiere","Sanlumiere","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sanlumiere/","372 products in account","I will offer a review in two parts.\n\n1) The software itself\n\n2) The steam application that supports it.\n\nThe Software Itself.\n\nI was a professional guitarist for a number of years, a guitar teacher for a few more, and have played guitar for somewhere near 30 years.\n\nRocksmith 2014 is a remarkable tool for entertainment, and most importantly, education. The teaching system is very well realized and the result is a product that gently guides you through the process of learning guitar by teaching you to play songs.\n\nDynamic and responsive difficulty means the song gets harder as you get better at it, and the recommended lessons that are also in Rocksmith are about 80% relevant.\n\nSince you are using a real guitar, the quality of the experience of actually playing is under your control. So since I use a very carefully set up guitar designed for fast lead, it's a comfortable and pleasant experience even if you get caught up in the features for hours. A cheap squire strat would work just as effectively, but I am sure you would tire more quickly.\n\nThe song selection is, in my opinion, diverse to the point of ludicrous but out of the 50 or so songs, you can find a good 15-20 you would probably want to learn.\n\nAs an experienced guitarist, I would appreciate the ability to set a certain degree of difficulty for the song so that I don't go through the callibration process of making you play one note instead of 6 chords.\n\nThe tone editor is neat and you do get access to a pretty extensive guitar "rig" so you can tailor your sound, but more often I found myself simply using the tone supplied with the song as generally they were sufficiently well designed to match.\n\nThe session mode is a slightly infuriating combination of unbelievable to unusable. The correct way to fix this would be to allow the guitarist to lead the band, or have the band start the jam with an intro. While blues works amazingly with a blistering solo lead which sets everything up, the other options, such as funk or metal would be very well served by an intro fill and first few bars to establish the key, chord progression and the like.\n\nBlues, however, is custom made for this (Jazz should be looked into, but may push the dynamic element too far) and the structure of 12-bar allows you to know where the band will go so you don't need to lead anything other than the actual dynamics of the tune.\n\nGuitarcade has don't nothing for me so far because it relies on the callibration to be better than it is.\n\nSo as a product, rocksmith 2014 is excellent and the flaws, while apparent are not enough to stop this being a truly engaging and effective teaching tool, or in my case, a tool to keep skills sharp by using all the various options the software has to offer.\n\n2) Steam implementation.\n\nThere is a significant issue with the steam application and this game, and since they are directly tied together, there is no escaping the issue.\n\nIf you buy the ps3 or xbox 360 version, you can use any of the previous title Rocksmith's DLC and it works just fine (though with fewer features) in 2014. You don't need the previous rocksmith.\n\nThe software and ubisoft themselves tell you this is the case. But not so with Steam. If you want to download the Cliffs of Dover by Eric Johnson it would cost you 33 dollars on steam. $3 for the song, and $30 for the inferior guitarsmith to allow you the right to buy it. This is pathetic and an issue that has no excuse not being fixed. Should you think that perhaps $30 is a good enough deal due to the songs you get in rocksmith (which you can transfer to the 2014 version) I will warn you that it will cost you $10 just to do that ... making rocksmith more than just a piece of software you never use by taking the songs in to 2014 will be a $40 endeavor. Clearly steam is profiting from this as there are people doing exactly that to get the content - and thus may be the reason they haven't fixed it, but this is something you should absolutely be aware of if you had plans to get some of the DLC songs to learn as part of your Rocksmith 2014 experience.","December 28, 2013","true","32.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I always kind of felt a passion to make music, even spent a ton on a music producing program "Stagelight" and just can't figure it out. So to get on with it... my Birthday was this month, and my pops gave me an Amazon gift card for a couple hundo. Finally a music note slapped me in the face and BAM.. ordered an electric guitar. Never played a stringed instrument in my life.. no f**king clue what I was getting myself into.\n\nI travel for a living so getting someone to help teach me just wont happen (lol) so I found myself picking up this game from Gamestop. I dont think I could be a happier man right now. Traveling around Cali, learning how to play guitar by myself.. actually making it sound good. My time shows 22.2 hours as of right now and I think 10 hours were AFK on accident. In those 12.2 hours though (5 days)... my fingers are getting trained by the session to not hurt, music notes are starting to come out, I feel very comfortable with a guitar now. I can't wait to rack up more hours on this game learning where my failing fingers need to be placed.\n\n***This is said in below posts, but the one bad thing I wish was more in this game was learning how to read music and tabs. I've always heard to play guitar you really just need to learn tabs. This is something you will have to research on your own. There is tons of info on this online though.\n\nI cant speak for the game as someone that already knew how to play guitar, but just starting out... this game is badass. If you have the opportunity, go balls out. You can pick up a great electric guitar online or in a pawn shop for less than $200.","April 22, 2015","true","24.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You plug in your guitar to a USB port with a special cable and can play through step by step guitar lessons, learn specific songs and riffs and play a variety of arcade style games with your guitar as the controller.\n\nEverything the game does is done in a very incremental, adaptive and intuitive way, from the games to the lessons, everything is designed to help you retain information about notes, chords and scales, etc, as well as building up your muscle memory to improve your skill at playing guitar. It’s obvious a lot of work and research has gone into making Rocksmith 2014 a powerful education tool that can teach anyone to play guitar while still being fun.\n\nThe lessons try to teach you how to play in the way a real guitar tutor would; by explaining techniques, showing you how they are played and then giving you a go while gradually making things more advanced each time. The practice riffs also slow down and let you do things at your own pace if it thinks you are having trouble.\n\nThere are also a decent amount of ‘Learn a Song’ songs that come with the game that start you off by getting you to play the very base notes that hold the song together, the game reacts to how well you are doing and gradually adds in more notes if you are getting everything right, eventually the notes will become chords and with enough practice you will easily learn how to play a song from start to finish.\n\nThe arcade games are designed to make you remember specific aspects of guitar playing as well as increasing your reaction time, muscle memory and being able to play without looking at the guitar neck. One game has you shooting ducks by playing the right note as they appear in front of different frets, another has you strumming entire chords in a zombie rail shooter. I found all the games to be both fun and very helpful.\n\nSome other nice features Rocksmith 2014 has is a full tone designer where you can create your own digital sound using a variety of pedals, amps, loops and more. The real life equivalent of this kind of equipment is really expensive so I found it really fun to be able to play around with this kind of stuff. There’s also multiplayer modes, online leaderboards and session mode where you have an automatic band accompanying your guitar as you play.\n\nI don’t have many bad things to say about Rocksmith 2014 other than the song selection not being entirely to my taste, but a few DLCs fixed that for me. I also had an incredibly hard time getting a Rocksmith RealTone cable in Australia, all of the retail stores were sold out for over a month and I had to order one online. Some may also argue that the game is too repetitive, but with learning any instrument, repetition is the key to success and I think this game really makes the repetition as fun as it can possibly be.\n\nIf you have a guitar sitting in the corner of your room which you don’t really play because you’ve given up on learning it on your own, then I highly suggest you try Rocksmith 2014, you will almost definitely improve at playing guitar, learn some new songs and have lots of fun. If you want to learn guitar on your own, this is the way to do it.","April 24, 2014","true","79.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Because note by note is how we read and play tabs, right? You look down at the note, play it on the guitar, and move onto the next; it's not as if your eyes skim past the tab while your fingers helplessly play catch-up, but that's how this game does it.\nGranted, you can emulate something close to that with their Riff Repeater mode set to 1% speed, but that also isn't perfect.\nThe note-by-note function is already present in the very start of the game, but you never see it again after that. I just wish the developers provided an option to play songs using that.","June 26, 2015","true","39.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been "asked" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.\n\nPerhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.\n\nI would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves "Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not." These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.\n\nAs David Berman once said: "I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming." If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.","June 24, 2014","true","76.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It takes the addictive elements of guitar hero and rock band, and teaches you real guitar techniques.\n\nThere are lots of fun songs across all genres to learn, and the game does a good job of letting you ramp up until you are playing every note. It also has a cool "riff repeater" mode that lets you slow down and repeat sections of the song in order to practice. I've played about 50 hours of the game and I can actually play a few songs on my own already.\n\nThere is also has a mini game mode that turns practicing scales, chords and other drills into games, which is more fun than just practicing those things over and over.\n\nMy only complaint with this game is that it doesn't have very good tools for calibrating audio/visual input lag. I wish it had more robust tools like Rock Band does, because there's not much you can do to correct it. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who has had fun with Guitar Hero and wants to actually learn guitar.","November 29, 2015","true","75.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsiAurora/recommended/221680/","ItsiAurora","Aurora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsiAurora/","96 products in account","Let's get down to business...\nThis game was certainly one of Ubisoft's best games. You require an Electric guitar/bass guitar and a Rocksmith Real Tone cable in order to play this game. But I'm very impressed with how it worked, I understand that there are so many glitches in this game, but when the game works, it is just amazing.\nTo simply state upsides and downsides, I'll list them:\nPro's:\nYou can learn guitar easily.\nThere are many songs to choose from whether it's Rocksmith 2012/2014, DLC, or CDLC.\nYou can get a Rocksmith 2012 import for Rocksmith 2014 giving Rocksmith 2014 a lot of Rocksmith 2012's songs.\nThere are lessons and arcade games to play which uses the Electric guitar, it certainly helps.\nMissions to unlock songs/gear/inlays.\nLayout is simple and easy, whether it's the interface or the Riff repeater.\n\nCon's:\nFor some, guitar is hard to play, I certainly had trouble, and that was beacuse I didn't practice the practice tracks, which I recommend you do if you're having trouble shifting/bending etc...\nDLC is way too expensive, asking £2.39 for a DLC with Rythym guitar, lead guitar, bass guitar and vocals... a little too much right? YOu can find all this stuff on the internet, but I buy these DLC's to help me learn the songs.\nSome CDLC may crash, and a while back Rocksmith 2014 just kept crashing when I started a song or lesson.\nSetting this up with a ♥♥♥♥. took me at least five hours to fix the bugs myself and get my guitar to be picked up on this game... thanks internet too.\nMissions... now, these... are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I've never seen a game as bad as Rocksmith 2014's mission system... you had to do it... you had to be a bunch of idiots, put a basic coding into the missions, and from like... play 1 new song, you ask for 3. From a 10 note streak, you go up to 300 after a while, and you have to get 100% mastery in songs... and yet, no matter how many times I repeat the song, you can't get 100% mastery, and once it had bugged out and not registered. And every single mission is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, allow for skippable missions and I'd recommend wasting time completing missions. I have to alt-f4 and launch the game to get a decent easy mission since I am only a beginner. Ubisoft idiots went too far with judging players skills, Beginner mode is what I started out as, and because of missions, they appear to think I'm pro.\n\nAbout the stupid coding stuff... let's just say, there's only 2 songs on each path that the game recognizes, or at least 3. 2 CDLC's and one Rocksmith 2014 song... why not any of the others? Why not? Seriously, fix this or at least release an expansion pack that doesn't cost anything.\n\n\n\n\nBut I recommend this game for the guitar player who wants to learn songs and learn guitar.\nBut this is not for completionists, it is impossible to complete this game, it's just an unlimited game.\nFor ♥♥♥♥s sake ubisoft, release updates for this, not DLC.\n","November 8, 2014","true","722.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It is that every guitar and bass I own apparently has a really low volume. Every time the tuning screen comes up it says it. These are not low quality instruments. Apparently my massively loud Rickenbacker 4003 is too quiet! I don't not what guitars and basses they were testing with but seriously? So with that out the way I think I can talk about the rest of the game.\n\nIt's fun! Though I'd question it's worth as a teaching tool. I picked this game up with 7 years bass experience, so I haven't really used it as a teaching tool. I got it because I'm a big fan of guitar hero and thought it'd be cool if I could learn some songs on the way. Unfortunatly, many years of playing Guitar Hero have made me quite good a sight reading this game. Every time I learn a song in the game to 100% or near mastery, I can't remember a single note when I come away. This isn't so much of a problem with the game as a problem if you've played a lot of Guitar Hero that I thought you might want to be aware of.\n\nThis game has made me less prone to looking at the neck of my bass though. I didn't actually realise how much I did it until I started playing Rocksmith. It has taught me to only look down for the big jumps, which is cool. So it's not without it's uses if you're experienced.\n\nThe big thing I wanted to get out of this game apart from another cool rhythm game, is a few new songs to learn that I otherwise may not have thought to. It has done a great job of that. I've learned Radiohead, Stone Temple Pilots, Dead Weather. It's all good stuff. Plus there are an enormous amount of custom songs available for download. They're easy to install and they're all actually of pretty good quality that I've tried. Not like they were in Guitar Hero 3. So check this out if you want to learn some songs. Though I haven't seen anything that explains any music theory to you, which you really need if you're starting out. So maybe only get it if you already have a pretty good idea what you're doing.","October 26, 2014","true","91.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've owned guitars for a long time, but never really stuck to practicing.  Most of the time before playing Rocksmith 2014, I would just fiddle around with making melodies and wanting to figure out how to make chords go along with the melodies I was creating.  I didn't get very far with Guitar.\n\nWhen Rocksmith (original) came out I was excited to pick it up and give it a shot, but had many issues with the game:  Input Lag, Audio feedback, and just wasn't really into the method.\nThen comes Rocksmith 2014!  So far I've put about 45 hours into 2014, and I'm still having a blast.  All of the issues I experienced on Win32/x360 versions of Rocksmith 1 have been resolved.  And now there is a recommendation system that suggests things for you to do.\nRather than level up like in the first game, you focus on mastery of each song.  Once you have mastered a section of the song, the notes will fade out, and force you to memorize the patterns. (brilliant! and optional if you dislike it)\n\nI have yet to play Bass with this, but from what I can glean about being able to play Lead Guitar or Rythm Guitar, I expect it will be just as fun to play.  (I will probably pick up a bass soon; but there is a bass emulation mode as well for guitar)\nI have a deep musical background, and the only thing I find lacking is that it's all focused on Rock.  (But it is Rocksmith after all!)  I wish it had some classical guitar tunes that can be very technically hard, so I could focus more on picking and more difficult techniques.  But overall this is a great start, and I'm excited to see where this takes me after another 40 hours of play (or practice)","December 24, 2013","true","64.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Keep in mind, while Rocksmith goes through the basics of holding the guitar, pick, how to strum, etc. you'll definitely want to look to other sources if you're serious about learning the instrument.\n\nI can say though, as someone who started never playing guitar before, that you'll at least be able to pick up new songs pretty easily after a couple months. You feel completely comfortable with the instrument, but with some basics practice, you'll get the hang of it in no time.","February 4, 2015","true","225.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely recommend this to anyone who plays, or wants to play, guitar and bass.  A great teaching tool, and a lot of fun.\n\nWhat I love about Rocksmith is it doesn't punish you for playing additional notes.  While playing rhythm parts you can feel free to jam out without worrying about losing your progression (or level) on the song.\n\nI still think they need more songs... particularly acoustic/campfire songs.

While there ARE mini-games designed to help your muscles memorize movement, and there is an Arcade mode with leaderboards, the meat of this game is education.  There are hours of video lessons which work side-by-side with you, changing the exercises as you struggle with them or breeze through them.  The game recommends lessons and other songs to help you build up skills you need for more difficult songs, and the "free play" Session Mode has its own lessons, which focus on music theory and composition.  This teaches players not only how to play songs, but how to improvise and write their own music.  I recommend this program for ANYONE who has an electric guitar or bass.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/highkingslick/recommended/221680/","highkingslick","High King Slick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/highkingslick/","290 products in account","Read bottom of review for a condensed review\nI bought Rocksmith when I had 5 days experience of playing guitar, so I was a complete beginner. To cut a long story short, 6 months down the line I can actually call myself a guitar player, but there are other factors which you may be interested in. Rocksmith is a great way to convert from playing guitar hero to a real set of strings, and the UI was one hell of a way to go about it. It's easy to understand and ushers you on your journey from pleb to rock god, so what about the game itself?\n\nWell, if I am to be completely and utterly honest, all Rocksmith has done is teach me a few techniques, and how to play certain songs, sure it makes it more fun and attempts to immerse you in the song you're trying to master, but to be blunt, it is just music tablature, but with a more 'arcade' feel to it, and then of course there's a few minigames to try keep you from getting bored.\n\nThe cons? The song list seems particularly limited, which reduces the lifespan of the game. The only way around this is by 2 ways, 1) You purchase the DLC, which I personally believe is rather expensive, I'd prefer to see them go down to about £1.50 per track, but hey, you're learning an entire song right? So on that ground I'm not complaining too much. 2) Use custom DLC, which basically lets you import whatever song you wish into the game, provided the community has made the track for it. This is modding the game of course, and because it's ubisoft, it's probably against their terms, but it didn't stop me. Besides the song list, after using rocksmith for quite a while you begin to discover that all you are doing is learning songs, not so much guitar, so don't expect to be learning musical theory on this game.\n\nConclusion\nDefinitely not a subsitute for a real guitar teacher, but something that might assist a guitar student. If you just want to learn songs then this is for you, but don't disregard youtube or normal music tablature (which is mostly free). After 6 months, I find more use in the cable so I can use guitar rig instead of rocksmith.\n\n6/10","August 8, 2014","true","67.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't stand it. Makes playing tricky fast sections really hard. Also its soo strict with actually playing chords. If you miss a note in a chord (or even play it a little too quiet) - it decides you havn't played it properly, even when it sounded perfectly fine (to my ears). Yet other times i would blatantly make a mistake which sounded terrible and it didn't catch it. It became hard to tell if i actually made a mistake, or the game was flagging false positives. I stopped playing after a while becuase of this.\n\nSeveral months later i was bored one day and decided to checkout session mode and worked through a few more missions. Then i fully comprehended what you can do in session mode. Its the perfect practice tool, i started doing my scales and playing along with the band. Now I just jump in session mode and jam for a while, practicing new and old techniques. As there's no critical timing in session mode, the lag isn't so much of an issue. I am enjoying it way more now.\n\nOverall i would recommend this game becuase of session mode. Once you had a bit of fun with score attack and learning a few songs, start using session mode and work through the missions.\n\nNote: I would consider myself an intermediate guitar player at the time i bought RS2014","July 30, 2014","true","59.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So I purchased my guitar , a squier classic vibe (really solid, great sound for beginners) and purchased the cable and the game. First of all i thought the cable was a little expensive for a simple ADC and later I noticed that there were some great alternatives, if you know nothing from adc cables just stick with the one from ubisoft though.\n\nThe game is great for any level honestly, there is not much theory but instead you can watch some short videos explaining techniques and you try them out, which actually worked fantastic. Only downside for me is that sometimes the cable doesnt pick up the signal, which makes me lose my streak.\n\nThere are not so many songs in the basic game, but every week, ubisoft brings out some new songs which you can purchase (for an ok price). Yet ubisoft doesn't let us download songs from the previous version of rocksmith  unless you buy the previous version, they claim it's an error of some sort, but after 5 months they haven't fixed it (yeah right).\n\nAnyway, great game, I enjoy spending my time on a game and still learn :)\n\n","March 14, 2015","true","180.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A REALTONE CABLE TO PLAY THE GAME. So I hope you consider picking up that old guitar or bass, or consider getting a guitar or bass and start learning today.\n\n\n*CDLC is Custom DLC made by the community and is free.

I have been self-taught and playing guitar by tab for years. I could usually select any tab and make my way through it. This game finally introduced me to the theory side of music. **However, this game introduced me to theory by showing me new chords and new progressions/scales - I still had to take the time and learn a good chunk of the theory on the side. The difference... this game finally inspired me to do so!! I knew I had to understand these things to be a successful guitar player and Rocksmith ENCOURAGES you!!\n\nThe layout/interface of the game and the options it gives you are phenomenal. Sometimes I find it annoying playing one note every 5 seconds in "Learn a Song" but Rocksmith quickly realizes you can handle it and adds more. Just wishing there was an option to get more notes/chords right away without having to use riff repeater to cheat the system.\n\nOverall, this game is great for any level of guitar player (simply learning a song - beginner/intermediate, to playing session mode for hours trying new lead licks or creating new music - advanced).

It completely lowers the barrier to entry for a starting musician. Years ago, you'd get your first instrument and make absolutely horrible noises for months, eventually graduating to semi-tonal, repetitive boring folk tunes. After about 5 years of hard work, you might actually be able to play something resembling a modern popular song. If you were practicing alone, you could only hope to simply play along to a recording if you wanted to hear the rest of the band.\n\nEnter Rocksmith - now from the first note you play you sound awesome. The rest of the band is there, sounding awesome. Next time you play, you learn a little more. You still sound awesome. Do a couple of 5 minute lessons, learn how to sound more awesome. Not awesome enough? Put on some headphones.\n\nThere are enough songs to cycle through that your roomates/parents/neighbors aren't going psychotic after two weeks of "happy little teapot" over and over and over again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/highkingslick/recommended/221680/","highkingslick","High King Slick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/highkingslick/","290 products in account","Read bottom of review for a condensed review\nI bought Rocksmith when I had 5 days experience of playing guitar, so I was a complete beginner. To cut a long story short, 6 months down the line I can actually call myself a guitar player, but there are other factors which you may be interested in. Rocksmith is a great way to convert from playing guitar hero to a real set of strings, and the UI was one hell of a way to go about it. It's easy to understand and ushers you on your journey from pleb to rock god, so what about the game itself?\n\nWell, if I am to be completely and utterly honest, all Rocksmith has done is teach me a few techniques, and how to play certain songs, sure it makes it more fun and attempts to immerse you in the song you're trying to master, but to be blunt, it is just music tablature, but with a more 'arcade' feel to it, and then of course there's a few minigames to try keep you from getting bored.\n\nThe cons? The song list seems particularly limited, which reduces the lifespan of the game. The only way around this is by 2 ways, 1) You purchase the DLC, which I personally believe is rather expensive, I'd prefer to see them go down to about £1.50 per track, but hey, you're learning an entire song right? So on that ground I'm not complaining too much. 2) Use custom DLC, which basically lets you import whatever song you wish into the game, provided the community has made the track for it. This is modding the game of course, and because it's ubisoft, it's probably against their terms, but it didn't stop me. Besides the song list, after using rocksmith for quite a while you begin to discover that all you are doing is learning songs, not so much guitar, so don't expect to be learning musical theory on this game.\n\nConclusion\nDefinitely not a subsitute for a real guitar teacher, but something that might assist a guitar student. If you just want to learn songs then this is for you, but don't disregard youtube or normal music tablature (which is mostly free). After 6 months, I find more use in the cable so I can use guitar rig instead of rocksmith.\n\n6/10","August 8, 2014","true","67.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Huge, HUGE improvement over the first Rocksmith game in just about every way possible. This is the best way for beginners to learn guitar with its many lessons while keeping it fun at the same time - also great for intermediate to advanced guitarists looking to improve or touch up on their skills.\n\nThe mini games are also a huge plus. They are basically lessons for scales, chords, slides and bends disguised as little arcade games. What other games make you say you played a beat 'em up with your guitar while learning scales at the same time? Exactly.\n\nSession mode is a lot of fun as well. Pick your AI band's instruments, the complexity of the jam, a genre, hell, faff around with pretty much anything, and start shredding. The band plays along with you. You'll feel like a rockstar in no time! Fantastic way of learning how to improvise as well - especially when you feel confident enough to add mini solos for the hell of it. Great feeling!\n\nThat's not to say there's a couple of (minor) cons with this game. Sometimes the game crashes when picking a song or going to riff repeater, but it happens very rarely now. Also, the note detection, especially for power chords (for me, anyway) can be a little iffy. Also the in-game tuner is a little... whack. Get yourself a chromatic tuner, go with what the game says and then retune it yourself. Don't let this deter you from an absolutely amazing experience though. These are just the small problems I personally have with the game.\n\nAll in all... worth it. So worth it.","August 1, 2014","true","323.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't stand it. Makes playing tricky fast sections really hard. Also its soo strict with actually playing chords. If you miss a note in a chord (or even play it a little too quiet) - it decides you havn't played it properly, even when it sounded perfectly fine (to my ears). Yet other times i would blatantly make a mistake which sounded terrible and it didn't catch it. It became hard to tell if i actually made a mistake, or the game was flagging false positives. I stopped playing after a while becuase of this.\n\nSeveral months later i was bored one day and decided to checkout session mode and worked through a few more missions. Then i fully comprehended what you can do in session mode. Its the perfect practice tool, i started doing my scales and playing along with the band. Now I just jump in session mode and jam for a while, practicing new and old techniques. As there's no critical timing in session mode, the lag isn't so much of an issue. I am enjoying it way more now.\n\nOverall i would recommend this game becuase of session mode. Once you had a bit of fun with score attack and learning a few songs, start using session mode and work through the missions.\n\nNote: I would consider myself an intermediate guitar player at the time i bought RS2014","July 30, 2014","true","59.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've hung onto a couple of amps, guitars with various sentimental values and rarity in the market place through several moves, but in all honestly only jamed on them a handful of times, and usually just playing the old stuff form muscle memory. Rocksmith is perfect for me with a variety of progressive difficulties, and challenges to learn new material and get outside my comfort zone. Been working too hard to play recently, but since I bought the game I've plugged in more in the last couple of months then I have in the last several years!

I had expected them to either focus on improving the "game" part or simply make the game more of a digital guitar tutor; which was the primary issue with the first game as it failed to really properly do either. Instead, Rocksmith 2014 does both, and brilliantly at that.\n\nAs a guitar tutor it eases you in if you are new (as it asks your skill level at the beginning) and is, unlike a human tutor, infinitely patient. As I had previous experience (including the first Rocksmith) I was able to jump right in. The lessons are much more fleshed out; with several of the techniques having several lessons and practice tracks to play to really learn the skill. Most importantly, the Learn a Song section of the game is not only accessable, lets you choose what song you want to play and learn and do it. On top of this they made the Riff Repeater simply part of the Learn a Song, so if you want to go back and retry a part you missed you can do so. Slow it down, make it easier or max it out. You can do it at your pace and really learn what you want. You can even make it mark notes you missed so on th next pass you can be on the look out for them.\n\nOn the other side of the coin is the game mechanics. The first rocksmith tried to instill game mechanics through a kind of "path" but really all it did was restrain gameplay. Instead you have free access to every song and guitarcade game from the first moment you start the game. Not only this but they have added a "Score Attack" mode which approximates one of its plastic guitar forebears, but with the real thing. The guitarcade games have gotten a massive facelift as well. Most of the games in the guitarcade are not only solid but assist in developing key skills; and most of them are references to old school games (I was particularly impressed with the "Rad Racer" reference game Scale Racer.)\n\nOne thing I don't feel goes in game or tutor sides of the fence is the Session mode. Essentially it can be thought of as a virtual band that will jam with you. They don't follow any particular song, and neither do you. You play what you want and they will join in as their AI decided to. You choose whatever instruments you want in your band, how fast, in what scale and go. The game teaches you how to play wiht the digital band (and even how to use this with a real band) and lets you have fun playing whatever you want.\n\nIt is really interesting in that you spend some time with an AI band and you can adjust your sound to match the band; or just rebuild the band, or tweak it. Granted this doesn't allow you to write songs for the band to play; but instead it is what it says, a jam session. You play what you want and the band does too, they tend to be swayed based on what you are playing but you can even take more of a back role. Turn up the volume on one of the AI members and let them do their thing.\n\nAdmittedly there are some faults with the game. Firstly and most importantly, a lot of the best and most popular songs are DLC. I understand that the base game is trying to pick and choose a wide selection, but when you put the B or C lister songs from an artist in the game then put out A list songs as DLC it does feel a bit wrong. Granted you can knock this up to the song licensing company having higher costs for popular songs, but it is irritating nontheless. Another thing is that occasonally the fact that the game doesn't catch a note due to the simply the game not catching a note will happen. Occasionally you will play somehting right and the game misses it. While I don't expect the technology to be 100% perfect, it does get irritating, and is especially common on palm muted notes.\n\nOverall for the price? This game is amazing. You get a guitar tutor that is infinitely patient, willing to repeat lesson after lesson and tell you when you do things wrong. You get a long list of songs to learn, even longer if you are willing to shell out a few bucks. You get a fully fledged rythym game where you can try to go for high scores. You get a slew of practice minigames that all focus on pumping up your techniques. You get an AI Band that will play along side you.\n\nAnd most importantly of all, you get motivation that may not have been there before. One thing any musician will tell you is that you have to want to get better to get better; and Rocksmith 2014 provides so many reasons to practice just a bit longer that you would have to try hard *not* to get better at guitar from playing it.","December 2, 2013","true","105.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Huge, HUGE improvement over the first Rocksmith game in just about every way possible. This is the best way for beginners to learn guitar with its many lessons while keeping it fun at the same time - also great for intermediate to advanced guitarists looking to improve or touch up on their skills.\n\nThe mini games are also a huge plus. They are basically lessons for scales, chords, slides and bends disguised as little arcade games. What other games make you say you played a beat 'em up with your guitar while learning scales at the same time? Exactly.\n\nSession mode is a lot of fun as well. Pick your AI band's instruments, the complexity of the jam, a genre, hell, faff around with pretty much anything, and start shredding. The band plays along with you. You'll feel like a rockstar in no time! Fantastic way of learning how to improvise as well - especially when you feel confident enough to add mini solos for the hell of it. Great feeling!\n\nThat's not to say there's a couple of (minor) cons with this game. Sometimes the game crashes when picking a song or going to riff repeater, but it happens very rarely now. Also, the note detection, especially for power chords (for me, anyway) can be a little iffy. Also the in-game tuner is a little... whack. Get yourself a chromatic tuner, go with what the game says and then retune it yourself. Don't let this deter you from an absolutely amazing experience though. These are just the small problems I personally have with the game.\n\nAll in all... worth it. So worth it.","August 1, 2014","true","323.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's when I decided to pick up the real guitar, but frankly it was a little difficult to commit in the long run because it was sometimes hard to find tabs, know what to play, and it didn't always sound great alone. It's been 3 years since I've touched my electric guitar so I decided that if I didn't get rocksmith, I'd never pick it up again. It was a great decision; for me the gameplay is about as much fun as GH but with practical experience, higher potential for difficulty, and it teaches very quickly. I can't wait to see how far it takes me. The biggest downside I foresee is the pricey $3 per song in the dlc, though the game has a good number of songs.","December 25, 2013","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have been self-taught and playing guitar by tab for years. I could usually select any tab and make my way through it. This game finally introduced me to the theory side of music. **However, this game introduced me to theory by showing me new chords and new progressions/scales - I still had to take the time and learn a good chunk of the theory on the side. The difference... this game finally inspired me to do so!! I knew I had to understand these things to be a successful guitar player and Rocksmith ENCOURAGES you!!\n\nThe layout/interface of the game and the options it gives you are phenomenal. Sometimes I find it annoying playing one note every 5 seconds in "Learn a Song" but Rocksmith quickly realizes you can handle it and adds more. Just wishing there was an option to get more notes/chords right away without having to use riff repeater to cheat the system.\n\nOverall, this game is great for any level of guitar player (simply learning a song - beginner/intermediate, to playing session mode for hours trying new lead licks or creating new music - advanced).

The songs are of different difficulty, so almost anyone can play this game. Having played guitar before always helps, anyways.\n\nAll the other music games I have played have not been about learning songs on an actual instrument, but rather pushing a couple of buttons to make sound. However, this game actually lets you learn the songs, as you use a real guitar. It will not force you to play the song as it is at once (Unless you choose it, that is), but it gets harder as you manage to play the songs better. This is a great tool for learning to play some songs, though it may not be for everybody.

For a person who wants to learn how to play the guitar it is a great tool as well as entertainment. Apart from many improvements made in comparison to the first Rocksmith, you really have to appreciate the session mode. Learning scales, improvising, learning to listen to the virtual band, it is really helpful in improving guitar skills. I played guitar for quite a while, but having Rocksmith gave a huge boost to my playing ability. Even when it comes to things like learning songs it's much better than tablatures. I learn faster, it's more efficient, I highly recommend it to anyone. Beginners will find it easy to use, intermediate players will have a great tool for practicing in my opinion, and for those who like a challenge there are always difficult songs which are very demanding, and if that's not enough try everything on master mode (I actually like it a lot when parts or whole songs disappear while you play, after all the more demanding it gets the better you try to play). The thing I didn't like in the first Rocksmith as well as Rocksmith 2014 is the range of songs. Although the variety is great, I really wish there were a loooooot more DLCs to choose from and the prices could be a little lower. And now it's time to plug in the Real Tone cable again.","December 29, 2013","true","414.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's when I decided to pick up the real guitar, but frankly it was a little difficult to commit in the long run because it was sometimes hard to find tabs, know what to play, and it didn't always sound great alone. It's been 3 years since I've touched my electric guitar so I decided that if I didn't get rocksmith, I'd never pick it up again. It was a great decision; for me the gameplay is about as much fun as GH but with practical experience, higher potential for difficulty, and it teaches very quickly.

You get about 30-40 songs with the game but fear not you can download extra songs and add it to Rocksmith. Google Customforge, make an account and download extra songs. (You cannot download official DLCs by Ubisoft from Customforge) In writing moment there are 17,070 songs up on Customforge.\n\nWhat I think make this game so great is that you can slow down the speed of the song in Riff Repeater and on top of that choose a specific section of the song which autorepeats itself, this is an awesum feature. You can also choose difficulty but seriously who would not like to learn the song on 100%?

Got this as a birthday present. I did not expect this game to be so huge.\n\nPersonally I think that it would not be wise to learn guitar through this as there are some pretty important differences in playing real guitar, like the immediate effects that get thrown on there, and the fact that the sound is an usb input which means information of the signal is lost, but the game on itself is really fun to do and gave me motivation to pick up the guitar more often. Also you skip the fact that you don't have to buy a lot of expensive gear to try to immitate the sound on a record.\n\nAn amazing surprise is how much effort the game put into the learning video's and especially the "Session Mode". This mode forces you to learn the complete neck of the guitar and has definetly improved my solo guitar sessions. My muscle  memory and finger speed have both increased because of this mode.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the game and would definetly recommend it to guitar players who have been playing for a year or two and want to play along some great classics without too much effort.","February 6","true","49.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've played guitar for years so I don't know how easy it is to learn with this, but still a lot of fun to learn new songs. At first it was a bit hard to read the note highway as I'm used to guitar tabs, but after a while you get it. And of course harder songs need to be learned first and not while playing for the first time the whole song.\n\nQuality of the transcriptions will vary, some song are very good some are not as good transcriptions. Some lead tracks don't have rhythm almost at all which is in accurate in most cases. Mostly RS1 songs and DLC are crappier than RS2014, but had to buy the old one to get old dlc...\n\nOtherwise I enjoy this, it's the best that is available at the moment, hope they bring new version later and add possibility to see the songs in TAB format!

I'm probably going to regret not practicing the basic scales and chords as much, since I've been playing along with some hit songs more during my practice sessions. The fun factor for me is quite high, but I've only found annoyance with the GuitarCade mini games so far. The lessons aren't nearly as in depth and useful as I had hoped. It's also hard to gauge my progression in skill outside of each individual song. I've also noticed it may be a bit too forgiving for timing. I've been singing pseudo-professionally, and feel the timing window might leave too much leeway for folks who aren't particularly good at rhythm to begin with, not giving enough feedback to develop well. 5/5","July 5, 2014","true","51.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not great, but I certainly knew how to play. At first, I struggle with the game because of the layout of the tabs. These are vertical instead of horizontal, but after a couple of plays I managed to memorize the colors of the strings. The lessons are very good. They are very clear on how they teach and they are totally optional.\nThe Soundtrack for the game is solid. I think there were some better songs that would have fit in the game instead of others. I wish there were more, but the dlc seems to take care of that. I wish the develepors wouldn't just have over $1000 worth of dlc and instead offer more songs at the start.\nThe customization of amps, effects, pedals, etc. is amazing. I have spent plenty of time just messing around with various effects trying to get one that sounds kickass! If you aren't looking for that deep of an experience, Rocksmith gives you the option to choose a songs effect instead of making your own from scratch.\nThe games are fun for a little bit, but I found myself going back to songs.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nThe only problems I had with the game were problems with bends during songs as they would not count.\nLESS DLC...

No need to get an expensive electric guitar, i've been using a signature guitar (Rs 3500) and a humbucker type pickup (Rs. 650) to play this. It's not the best way but it'll still get you started\n\n2. Constant updates: Team Rocksmith (RS) is continually rolling out improvements and new songs for this. At about Rs. 180 per song it might seem steep but compare that against taking proper guitar classes.\n\n3. Broad range of stuff: Formal guitar classes mostly focused on getting me to learn a particular song. If you follow the RS missions they'll take you from songs, to learning scales, to learning techniques like bends (each of which has its own game that you can play while training your fingers) to various tuning styles of the guitar. It's more holistic than just being able to repeat a bunch of songs\n\n4. Takes the boredom out of practicing: the point at which most people leave the guitar is the long hours spent training your fingers to move on the frets. It tedious, repetitive and there seems to be no improvement taking place. Rocksmith makes that fun by giving crazy arcade games, easy versions of songs, score challenges etc. You'll play it for the fun and sense of accomplishment while learning all the key skills\n\n5. It's not a perfect solution: You'll still need to visit websites/youtube etc to get more info on the basics. It won't teach you to read tablature (tabs) that real guitarists use to learn songs. People will tell you to learn the basic chords first (A, E, D, B, C) but Rocksmith seems to favor power chords.\n\nBut it'll help you learn, it'll help you stick to the guitar when you would've grown bored and left it, and then one day you'll be a guitarist my son","January 9, 2015","true","223.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Got this as a birthday present. I did not expect this game to be so huge.\n\nPersonally I think that it would not be wise to learn guitar through this as there are some pretty important differences in playing real guitar, like the immediate effects that get thrown on there, and the fact that the sound is an usb input which means information of the signal is lost, but the game on itself is really fun to do and gave me motivation to pick up the guitar more often. Also you skip the fact that you don't have to buy a lot of expensive gear to try to immitate the sound on a record.\n\nAn amazing surprise is how much effort the game put into the learning video's and especially the "Session Mode". This mode forces you to learn the complete neck of the guitar and has definetly improved my solo guitar sessions. My muscle  memory and finger speed have both increased because of this mode.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the game and would definetly recommend it to guitar players who have been playing for a year or two and want to play along some great classics without too much effort.","February 6","true","49.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a week or so, already at 70% for Bat Country (rhythm guitar)! You go from simple notes (think Guitar Hero on Easy) to actual chords!

Got this as a birthday present. I did not expect this game to be so huge.\n\nPersonally I think that it would not be wise to learn guitar through this as there are some pretty important differences in playing real guitar, like the immediate effects that get thrown on there, and the fact that the sound is an usb input which means information of the signal is lost, but the game on itself is really fun to do and gave me motivation to pick up the guitar more often. Also you skip the fact that you don't have to buy a lot of expensive gear to try to immitate the sound on a record.\n\nAn amazing surprise is how much effort the game put into the learning video's and especially the "Session Mode". This mode forces you to learn the complete neck of the guitar and has definetly improved my solo guitar sessions. My muscle  memory and finger speed have both increased because of this mode.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy the game and would definetly recommend it to guitar players who have been playing for a year or two and want to play along some great classics without too much effort.","February 6","true","49.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a good idea to get the first game, too, to be able to play it's DLC packs natively instead of through 2014, cause some of them were just plain better played through the old game.\n\nAll in all, though, still  fabulous game and learning tool.","March 25","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rocksmith is pretty straightforward on the face of it. But underneath the hood are the tools that players of all levels can use to improve their performance, from Guitarcade mini-games, which make speed and technique drills better and more rewarding; to the Riff Repeater, which can slow down a single section of a song so that you can get it down right. A vast amount of DLC for this game means you should be able to build a huge library of songs you enjoy playing, and the Session Band lets you put together a band that will automatically play along with you.\n\nIt should be noted that a Rocksmith RealTone cable is required to play this game, and that costs extra, so if you want to save some money then you should buy Rocksmith on sale. But any guitarist who feels like guitar games are a good idea but that implementing that with a toy instrument is disingenuous should look no farther than Rocksmith 2014.","July 2, 2015","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the other hand, my daughter has become quite good in only a matter of a few months. Clearly, she had a hidden talent. Tomorrow she will be playing Weezer's "Buddy Holly" for a talent show at her elementary school, without using Rocksmith.  Rocksmith is great at adjusting to weaker players like myself, only giving me a portion of the notes and filling in the rest.  If there is one fault, it's that Rocksmith doesn't teach the fundamentals or theory very well.

Really great job!!! I'd love to see som improvements in terms of the steam site and the DLC. Also, i'm a big fan of the DLC, keep em coming!!! My only problem with the DLC is that the list inside my actual game is not current which is kind of annoying and the DLC page in the actual steam browser never opens up... I've purchased my DLC through the rocksmith page by scrolling down but even that list does not include all the DLC that has come out. Either way fixing it in the game i think would be best because it is easier to sort through. Also would love to see eventually Rocksmith incorporates vocals and keyboards, it's such a great way to learn and at the very least i feel that singing is an integral part of playing guitar.

I started the game up, and shreded away. The best part about the Rocksmith franchise is that it is not biased towards beginers or experts. You can start the game knowing nothing about how to play guitar/bass, but if you give the game some time, it will pay off, I promise. The best feeling while playing this game is when you reach 100%+ mastery on a song. I remember the first time I did. I noticed the notes seemed to be fading away until they did not show up anymore. It was as if I was jamming to this song in my room. The game automatically put the song on "Master Mode" seeing as I had already been hitting every note. I finished the song, and I was ecstatic to see that I had 104% mastery. This game is for anyone interested in learning guitar, or simply just jamming if you already know how to play. Do be warned though, it's like being on a diet; results do not show up overnight. If you want improvement, give the game time and patience, and be sure to practice frequently.","May 28","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nommynomm/recommended/221680/","nommynomm","Nommy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nommynomm/","313 products in account","What can I say about Rocksmith that hasn't already been said... In short, this software is absolutely amazing.\n\nI have a hard time calling Rocksmith 2014 a "game". It's more of an absolutely massive software package featuring many of both learning tools and games in a beautifully intertwined and perfectly balanced format. Everything within this software is meant to help you both learn and improve your skills on guitar and bass, and have fun doing it.\n\nLet's say you're a complete novice. You've picked up a guitar once or twice in your life, strummed some strings, and probably thought maybe this is too hard, as all the neighborhood household pets scream in terror/anguish and attack you on sight. But fret not my poor mangled friend, for Rocksmith 2014 will pick you up off the ground, show you how to hold the instrument upside right, and guide your dainty fingers heavenly across the strings and make you feel like you're a rock god(dess).\n\nI say dainty, because as a warning, if you don't play guitar or practice any other highly strenuous fingering activity (okay, calm down kiddos) you will be fighting both your learning mentally, and physically as your fingers will need to bulk up quite a bit to get these skills under your belt. So don't feel discouraged if the skills feel impossible or out of your grasp. Keep practicing, and keep playing mini games (especially with chords). You'll get there :) Oh, and that stinging/burning/flamesfromhell feeling you are having on your finger tips, that goes away after about a week. As with all feeling at all, so enjoy that.\n\nAnyways, back on track. Rocksmith does this by first asking you how skilled you feel you are with guitar. It'll then ask you a few more questions to get an idea of what kind of guitar player you are. If you go with novice, it'll show you everything from how to attach your guitar strap, hold your guitar/pick, etc to how to actually pluck strings and play notes. (You can obviously skip the super basic stuff by picking one of the 3 higher experience levels)\n\nIt then throws you into a song at a super basic level, and from that point on (through almost everything you do) it guides you through everything you need to know/do/practice to get better at guitar. It adapts itself and the difficulty of the songs you play so it's constantly pushing you to do better. It provides you with a lot of things to help you along the way as well. 2 primary things:\n\n1) The Lessons portion of the software actually teaches you, in a very interactive manner, things you need to know to play guitar, as well as own them and take care of them. Want to know how to string a guitar? It has you covered. Want to learn how to play scales, chords, notes, slides, bends, harmonics, and much much more? It'll teach you what you need to know, and coach you through it with advice such as "It sounds like you have a finger touching the G string..." (again, kiddos, lets keep it PG, eh?) "... try it again, being sure your second finger is only touching the string(s) it should be."\n\n2) The Guitarcade. This section of the software is a whole suite full of very well made arcade style mini games that allow you to practice almost everything learned in the Lessons section of the software in a fun, score centric environment. There are arcade games that allow you to shoot a target by picking the designated string at the fret shown on screen, games that give you a chord that you must form and strum to shoot down an enemy space ship, "String Skip" which is pretty self explanatory, and lots lots more.\n\nAll along the way, Rocksmith is going to be giving you multiple suggestions for what you should do next so you don't get lost, however you still remain free to do as you please. Between the lessons and mini games, and the actual main portion of the software which is the Guitar Hero meets Guitar style gameplay (which is of course very fun and productive) you're going to learn and/or improve your guitar and bass playing abilities.\n\nOne last thing. The Session Mode. It's hard for me to put my excitement concerning this feature into words, so I'll keep this short. Try it out, you'll absolutely love it and will spend a lot of time there as you grow your articulation skills. It shows you a scale based on your settings (of which there are many) and allows you to play along a fully dynamic band that plays to your music. The band is entirely customizable, or you can pick from dozens of preset bands that include drums, bass, rhythm guitar, lead guitar, and piano/other instruments. If you stick to the scale, it'll sound really good to you, pretty much regardless of your skill which encourages you to really work at it and keep coming back for a couple hours a day. This is a great learning tool for scales, and also wonderful for your motivation. I recommend playing 30 minutes at least of Session Mode at the end of every time you play.\n\nTL;DR: Buy this. You'll love it. It's going to blow your expectations away. This is an incredibly valuable tool for any present/future guitarist.\n\n-No\m/\m/y","December 30, 2013","true","32.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceror/recommended/221680/","Ceror","Cero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceror/","185 products in account","More than a game this is a tool that makes guitar learning fun. This edition offers a simpler and better interface, with a much more streamlined experienced when compared to the original Rocksmith. You no longer have to go through 10 menus to play a song and back through the loop to play it again. Career and free play modes have been condensed into learn a song, which brings you right to track list which you can sort in a number of ways including difficulty or recommended, which replaces the old career stages, meaning you no longer have to go through that particular song you don't like and don't want to play in order to progress.\n\nExperienced players should enjoy the option to set the difficulty right to master mode from the start and use the game as colourful moving tabs, also the new session mode which lets you form and ajust your own band to play along your jam sessions. The continuous play mode is neat as well, you can set the time and remove songs you don't want to play and just go along with what gets thrown at you.\n\nFor begginers you get a nice set of lessons and practice minigames that help grasp or refresh the basic techniques. These aren't compreehensive and don't replace more thorough resources but serve well in providing you with the fundamentals to jump on to the stage and massacre a classic or modern rock song you know and (used to) love. It's a blast when you hit that 1 note that nearly made the song sound alright, much better than painfully repeating tedious lessons with no sense of progression.\n\nThe track list is considerable, including DLC and the option to import all the content from the original Rocksmith, you are going to be doing a lot of scrolling. So far I haven't found any major flaws with this edition, however there are some mildly annoying details (grab your seat!), the new achivements are crap, you will get 10 for visiting the uplay store (whatever that is) and none for reaching master mode in a song for the first time, which brings me to my major complaint thus far: half the time you will try to log in with your uplay account and you will get a "server is not available try again later", which is harmless until you want to play that new song you just bought and can't because you need to be connected to uplay and activate it in the ingame store after buying it on steam (thanks jewbisoft). Curiously the first Rocksmith had none of this uplay mischief, and so the DLC you get from the original gets imported automatically without the need for uplay consent.\n\n9/10 - I look forward to hundreds of hours of relentless cacophony. By the time I hit half the notes in Aces High I'll probably be a chosen champion of Slaanesh and have sprung into existance a noteworthy cult, mostly consisting of unwilling neighbours whose mind and spirit will eventually bend with the force of my unstoppable musical onslaught. But I will have one hell of a fun ride along the way.","December 31, 2013","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A complete overhaul.\n\nThe greatest feature of Rocksmith 2014 is one thats not even included. The modding community. In a heartbeat, you can download hundreds and hundreds of custom songs. That alone is worth the $60.\n\nYOU CAN SET DIFFICULTY TO ANYTHING AT ANY TIME. The worst part of Rocksmith 1 was lack of difficulty control. Rocksmith 2014 so effortlessly integrates riff repeater, that in learn a song mode (most peoples favorite mode), you can start and exit a song 5x faster than Rocksmith 1, and riff repeater is available anytime before or DURING the song. My favorite mode, in the guitarcade, score attack, lets you choose between Easy, Medium, or Hard, with Hard being all phrases at 100%. Not sure what set percentage it is for Easy and Medium, but its constant. And i like this mode because it keeps track of scores more effectively and uniformly.\n\nSession mode: You pick you backing track, drums, basses, guitars, pianos, percussion, you pick you scale and your key, it shows you a fret board with every note of that scale. And highlights the ones to land on according to the current chord playing. This is just mindblowingly helpful for people just started out in the improv and jamming department, such as myself.\n\nAs a metal fan, I'm liking the song and DLC selection quite a bit more in this game than the first Rocksmith, though again, with the customs, that doesn't matter too much. Anyways...\n\nIf you bought Rocksmith 1 and thought it didn't live up to its potential, GET ROCKSMITH 2014. It fixes all of Rocksmith 1's caveats. Ubisoft really hit a homerun on this game. I've already recommended this to 3 friends who went out and bought it because they're trying to learn guitar. The only reason you should not have this game is if you have absolutely no interest in guitar.","January 20, 2014","true","87.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Those same people might realise that I never did that. (Good old college finals wrecking everything...) So now that I'm finally on break, I decided to start putting some serious time into Rocksmith 2014 starting with the new year, and make learning a thing or two about guitar my new year's resolution, so to speak. Well I've managed to keep with that promise to myself fairly well, and have been playing quite a bit this year, making sure to spend time practicing and doing finger workouts (Yes! Finger workouts!) every sing day. From my time spent right after buying Rocksmith 2014, I'd learned a few things about playing, but hadn't put much serious work in till the start of this year, so in effect the 4 days of 2014 I've had prior to this post are the only real time I've spent actually trying to learn and improve and not just screw around.\n\n(TL;DR I've been practicing for 4 days)\n\nNow that we've got that little bit of exposition out of the way...\n\nWow.\n\nRocksmith works. It seriously works. It brings all the tools to the table for you to use, and then just simply shows and helps you use them to improve, and improve fast. After 4 days of Rocksmith and a few youtube videos, I'm comfortable enough with the fretboard to play through a handful of the lower difficulty songs with solid hit rates, able to figure out spots I'm having trouble with and practice them until I feel comfortable, and challenge myself to get better all while having fun and actually feeling like I'm making progress.\n\nIn fact, the feeling of making progress is my favorite part of this game/tool. Every single time I stand up to play it, I feel like I'm moving forward, becoming just a little bit quicker with my fingers, more consistent with my strumming, and more accurate with my timing. This software manages to perfectly blend combine a learning environment with the entertainment and approachabiality of a game in a way that's convinced me that I want to learn, I want to keep hammering away at Blitzkrieg Bop and Next Girl, that I want to struggle with the weird way Smoke on the Water is played, and that I want to spend time learning guitar rather than playing other games.\n\n(TL;DR After 4 days I feel like I've made real progress, and I'm motivated to keep progressing)\n\nThe game won't teach you guitar yourself, you've got to bring your own motivation to the game to get anything out of it, but if you're willing to work, the game helps you in ways that make your work feel rewarding. I finally brought my motivation into Rocksmith, and I'm starting to get skills out of it that I find absolutely amazing, and I can't wait to see how much more progress I can make the next time I stand up and play.\n\n(TL;DR If you're motivated, like I am now, this game will help you turn your motivation into real guitar playing skills.)\n\nAbsolutely reccomended.\n\nEdit: Just as an FYI, I bought this with the Epiphone Les Paul Junior through Amazon for $200, and I'm extremely happy with guitar as well.","January 4, 2014","true","23.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I find myself listening to a song and tell others around me hey I know this song and how to play it on the bass or guitar, and the best part is that I am telling the truth because as the song plays out I can picture the notes that need to be played to complete the song. this is the best learning/teaching tool for the money that I have ever seen. I have tried to learn from other souces but just couldnt seem to keep my focus on the program as it was layed out for me to follow. With Rocksmith 2014 you do not need a game plan or a focus point because of the game aspect it becomes a challenge to play any song you wish thats in your playlist. You also can get DLC thats outstanding at a reasonable rate.

I ended up enjoying a few of the games, but I was always dissapointed by that cheap plastic controller that it came with.  A few years ago Rocksmith came out and I finally had the game I had always wanted.\n\nThe first Rocksmith game was an awesome teaching tool.  I was pretty much an absolute beginner when I got it.  Today I've still got a long way to go, but I'm miles ahead of where I started, and I can now complete some of the easier songs with 100% completion.\n\nRocksmith 2014 improves on the base game in almost every way.

Definetly great for begginer players like myself. It helped me build my hand dexterity and endurance in addition to being great fun. It's really great to be learning an instrument (in my case bass guitar) while actually playing music with it. If you are more of a technical person this does offer rather good technique guides and exercises. One thing that is a bit dissapointing for me personally is the session mode. I cannot claim this to be true for regular guitar but for bass it just feels unnatural and sounds like some out of sync backing tracks. Sometimes it does sound good enough and I can't really fault them for trying but I mostly used it to practise scales. Also had a small issue at launch with the instrument playback being way too silent. However the issue has been adressed and is solvable by a simple windows options tweak.\n\nOverall a great learning tool (as I don't really feel like calling this a game per se) and lots of fun. Vastly superior to the original Rocksmith which I got few months before release of the 2014 version in order to get the cable and now I have basically doubled the songs available for me. By suplementing the game (which provides a great practise environment) with musical theory and technique guides available online (shoutout to http://www.scottsbasslessons.com/ for some superb free bass guitar content) I feel like I'm really developing my playing skills faster than I otherwise would have just with theory alone.

Now I can pick up any guitar and play and sing along with a pretty impressive song list. By the time you read this review you'll see I've spent nearly or over 500 hours on this game. It's my most played game in my library, averaging around 10 hours a week, sometimes more if I get a wind of motivation going up to as much as 20 hours a week. Point is, I clearly like this game, and you don't need a review to see I would recommend it. You can do that just by looking at my profile activity. Note: My Steam time isn't my total time spent on guitar. I dabbled with the original Rocksmith, played quite a bit of 2014 on the Xbox 360 before switching to steam and have also spent roughly the same time playing acoustic.\n\nBut this isn't just a game. It's a game that teaches you a real skill, so instead of answering the usual questions of how the game works (It's got a UI similar to the Guitar Hero and Rockband games) or the graphics (Pretty straight forward here. Graphics are functional but not over intrusive over the note highway). Instead I'll answer the question people are really interested in ’If I buy this game, will I learn guitar?’.\n\nI can’t answer that with a straight yes or no. However, if you were to say to me, ‘I’m learning guitar, should I buy Rocksmith?’ the answer is a clean yes. Why? Because Rocksmith is NOT the ultimate tool for learning guitar. It can, however, be used as part of a toolbox of educational tools (all free minus price of guitar) to strengthen many of the skills needed for effective guitar playing. It just doesn’t teach you them all. If you buy it expecting it to magically teach you guitar in a few months, you’ll be sorely disappointed. If however, you’re committed to learning the guitar, you’ll find it an irreplaceable tool. There are certain things that unfortunately Rocksmith can’t teach, and it comes down to the will and determination of the individual to plough through these physical limitations.\n\nFor example, if you’re a complete novice picking up your first guitar, you have two hurdles from your body. Firstly, you’re lack of knowledge of the fretboard will have you spending more time staring at your hands position then anything else. This can be frustrating in Rocksmith because trying to play a song, even on the easiest difficulty, will still result in more time looking at the fretboard than the screen. This causes frustration and that’s dangerous because that is when people will start to think ‘Screw this, I’m going to go play to play League of Legends’ or whatever the young people are wasting their time on nowadays and the guitar is never picked up again. Another common issue for the novice is limb independence. This is a person's ability to move one arm independent of the other. At the early days of learning a guitar, again, you’re going to want to focus on hand position and the fret board. This means being able to strum without thinking about it and that’s a challenge in itself.\n\nTrying to master both at the same time can be rough for a guitar noobie, and it’s the first and most common wall people will give up on. The good news is that everyone has the same problem when starting out and it’s simply an issue of muscle memory, meaning if you practice then the body will learn by itself and if you stick at it, you’ll have one magical day when something clicks and you’re body just starts to work. You won’t have to think about strumming and your hands will feel like they are more naturally falling into the chord shapes at the right position on the fretboard. This is a magical day for all budding guitarists, and this is when I recommend moving on to Rocksmith because now you’ll be able to play the simpler songs on 100% difficulty at full speed and once you do that, you’ll start to actually feel like a guitarist.\n\nRocksmith’s gift is that it is second to none for being a tool develop accuracy and muscle memory in many of the skills required to play guitar. Add CDLC (Google it) and it becomes essential. If you’re already learning guitar you can jump in at any level and take advantage of Rocksmith. It makes practice time, fun and easy to measure progress. However if you want this to magically and effortlessly turn you into an irresistible guitar playing woman magnet.. well, keep dreaming.\n\nSIDE NOTE AND RECOMMENDATION\nIf you genuinely want to learn guitar, then instead of starting here, I recommend buying an acoustic and putting ‘easy acoustic song tutorial’ in to Youtube. Start with something like Green Day’s Good Riddance or Oasis’ Wonderwall. Learn the basic chords and get efficient at transitioning between these chords and strumming at the same time. This may take months, even a year of solid practice, maybe even longer. There will be times when you feel like you won’t get it, but I promise your body will eventually start to move on its own. Then move on Rocksmith. Stick to the Rhythm side of things when starting out and once you’re able to strum and change chords effortlessly, move on to the more demanding Lead position with songs that have the face-melting solos. The trick is gradual and persistent practice. Trust me :)","December 29, 2015","true","472.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But I just wanted to tell everyone how pleased I am with this piece of software.\nI'm somewhat an experienced "musician" but not on guitar- it's been always my dream to play it though but I think my parents were in shock seeing LED Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix or KISS in the 70s and never wanted me to be a guitar stomping maniac \m/(~.~)\m/\n\nAnyways, I picked up a guitar a few years ago but never really got me more than strumming a few chords. My problem certainly was playing not daily as I used to on my other instrument.\nNote: It's not just about talent or a teacher- even the best teacher can't practice for you! You need to play and practice regularly with a certain amount of devotion and variety.\n\nAnd this is exactly what this "game" does. You pick a song you'd like to learn und play guitar hero like by first just plucking a few notes; the program recognizes your failures or your skills and advances the next time and/or recommends to practice the riffs you've been bad at.\nI can't tell how much fun it is to learn a song step by step.  It's highly motivating. I never played the guitar as much as now. One of my friends is a professional guitar player and he told me that he skipped 3(!) teachers until he found the one that finally taught him with devotion. In contrast to his earlier teachers- this guy said.. Ok, now take the guitar and let's play Smoke on the Water! Just like Jack Black.. xD\nI mean ..come on- didn't you ever want to play a song for yourself when hearing that? "Airguitaring" it when you're alone? xD\n\nAlso, there is a huge arsenal of guitar technique videos- holding the guitar, chords, arpergios, slides... basics but also very advanced techniques just to name a few.\nAnd these are not just show off videos- you'll be shown the technique and then you'll have to play it and the computer analyzes your progress.\nIf you're really into really into learning guitar... then get Rocksmith 2014 and the cable! You'll never regret.\n\nROCK ON!","January 4","true","34.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The second part of that sentence is true as I have spent the majority of those 200 hours playing songs that have been modded in by the extensive, constantly growing community.\nWhen people think of modding normally they may think of reinstallling skyrim countless times due to corrupt files and installing loads of pointless software off dodgy websites. Rocksmith isn't like this. All you have to do is 1. own a DLC off the game (they cost a pound it isn't bad) 2. download a song of your choice off about 700 pages of songs 3. Change the DLCs ID so the game thinks it's the DLC you own. Thats briefly what you need to do theres tutorials all over the internet on what to do. I've installed 360 different songs onto this game and I've never had an issue.\nWhen I bought this game I wasn't a noob to the games. I had played the original game which was alright and I had been playing guitar for years anyway. I've used this game to practice songs for performing and it has been very successful. The design of the game is simple to use and easy to play along to. This game is one of the few good ubisoft games (other great titles being king kong the video game and Howrse.)\n\nIn summary this game is perf if you want to learn or become better at guitar. Once you've played the base game theres a hell of a lot of CDLC for you to chose from.\n\nOnly bad thing is you have to pay for "Smoke on the water" and thats just down right offensive.","March 9","true","358.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The second part of that sentence is true as I have spent the majority of those 200 hours playing songs that have been modded in by the extensive, constantly growing community.\nWhen people think of modding normally they may think of reinstallling skyrim countless times due to corrupt files and installing loads of pointless software off dodgy websites. Rocksmith isn't like this. All you have to do is 1. own a DLC off the game (they cost a pound it isn't bad) 2. download a song of your choice off about 700 pages of songs 3. Change the DLCs ID so the game thinks it's the DLC you own. Thats briefly what you need to do theres tutorials all over the internet on what to do. I've installed 360 different songs onto this game and I've never had an issue.\nWhen I bought this game I wasn't a noob to the games. I had played the original game which was alright and I had been playing guitar for years anyway. I've used this game to practice songs for performing and it has been very successful. The design of the game is simple to use and easy to play along to. This game is one of the few good ubisoft games (other great titles being king kong the video game and Howrse.)\n\nIn summary this game is perf if you want to learn or become better at guitar. Once you've played the base game theres a hell of a lot of CDLC for you to chose from.\n\nOnly bad thing is you have to pay for "Smoke on the water" and thats just down right offensive.","March 9","true","358.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For various reasons, I never took formal lessons on guitar; although, I have taken formal lessons on quite a few other instruments (clarinet, saxophone, piano, chello, violin).\n\nI've successfully taught myself how to play many songs in fingerstyle guitar on acoustics, but could never progress very well with electrics. So, I could never really crank out the rock tunes that I grew up loving.\n\nWhen the original Rocksmith came out, I immediately purchased it and played for a week or two, but couldn't get used to the notation, and stopped playing for months. Then, when Rocksmith was released on PC, I thought I'd give it another chance. At the same time, I was starting to play rhythm guitar in a band (badly), so any method that might help me learn was welcome.\n\nI decided to give the original Rocksmith more patience, and after a few weeks, was noticing that I could play things with a pick, on my electrics that I had never been able to play before. I was also building up the ability to play chords and progressions that I'd never pulled off successfully.\n\nHowever, the original Rocksmith had a long list of flaws that made the experience often frustrating: poor note detection, stability issues, performance problems, long loading times between menus, interesting, but poorly implemented "games" for guitarcade; the list goes on.\n\nRocksmith 2014 has fixed all of those issues. Assuming your machine meets the minimum requirements, and you configure things correctly, Rocksmith 2014 is a pleasure. With improved notation capabilities, in the last 3 months, my bends have gotten significantly more accurate, I can palm mute and frethand mute in ways that I've never done before.\n\nAre there still some issues? Yes. Is Rocksmith 2014 worth it? Absolutely.\n\nHowever, Rocksmith 2014 will not teach you everything you need to know. Youtube videos or some commercial online guitar teaching sites can augment Rocksmith very well. And, of course, a live guitar instructor will be able to provide feedback that will help you advance all that much faster.","November 14, 2013","true","931.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The mini games are really fun and challenging such that you're getting more skills practice without really being aware of it.  The setlist included is diverse enough to cover most tastes and the additional songs coming out will help keep everything fresh for the long run.

Whereas RS14 feels more like a tool and makes you go to riff repeater to learn sections.\nDefinately advise anyone interested in learning a guitar/bass to pick this up as you find yourself learning songs way quicker than from a teacher/youtube. As a tool for learning songs I thinks its second to none though for music theory it is a bit stunted, certain things like theory and strumming patterns etc need to be taught by a teacher or youtube/videos/books.\nBut pretty amazing software, I 've played more guitar in the last few weeks than I had in the previous couple of years.","January 20, 2014","true","292.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It loads faster, the menus are much easier (and snappier) to navigate.  The actual game itself feels snappier as well.  I do very much like their decision to move away from the Guitar Hero style career mode, and focused on it's strengths as a tool for guitarists veteran or novice to learn, practice, and play music they like. I also feel that the base set of music is much more diverse and relevant than in the first game, and I'm looking forward to buying more songs for this game.\n\nOnly gripes about it are the initial price, especially if they are going to be selling song packs, but I'm sure that the price will go down in the coming year.  That being said, I would highly recommend picking it up, especially if you want to learn to play guitar.  Picking up a cheap $100-300 guitar and this game will definitely save you a lot of money in the long run, because it does not require any other gear, and by time you feel comfortable playing the guitar, you'll have saved enough to buy an actual rig. But ultimately, any guitar will do. Right now I'm playing with my sister's guitar that came in one of those $90 starter kits from Best Buy, and it works perfectly. Can't wait to go home and try it with my own guitar.","November 26, 2013","true","29.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's a very annoying latency issue that can make professional guitarrists or anyone that plays on a real amp for sometime really mad! The Session Mode is the star of this new version, I bought the game just for it and as far as it seems I'm really enjoying it! There are lots of stuff you can do with it. The game itself is pretty much the same, there were a lot of graphic and sound upgrades, and the new Online Teacher is a quite nice feature. The new setlist presented in Rocksmith 2014 is full of wonderfull content, as well as it's DLCs. The Riff repeater feature is better than ever, allowing you to stop in the middle of a song and repeat that phrase, controlling the difficulty and speed it will come at you.

I ultimately have very little idea what I'm actually doing with the guitar (save a few chords and memorized riffs here and there). Pure noob.\n\nWhen I first heard about the concept of Rocksmith years ago I was very interested in the idea of a Guitar Hero or Rock Band type game that you actually played a real guitar. (I was a huge fan of those games.) The problem...I didn't know how to actually play a real guitar. Could it be possible that a game like Rocksmith could teach me to really play? The verdict went out, most reviews and videos I watched came back ecstatic about Rocksmith being not only a game, but a fantasic teaching tool as well. The only downsides I caught wind of were a horribly designed interface, some sound interface and gain issues. Alas I decided to hold off and moved on never purchasing the 'original Rocksmith' game.\n\nThen came Rocksmith 2014. The same excitement bubbled up within me about a life long desire to teach myself guitar and play some of my favorite rock songs I've been listening to over the years. But would the game have fixed it minor short comings from the prior release? The reviews came in ....fantastic, 10/10, 5 stars, 9.5/10 etc.etc. Wow. They got it right and what's more they seemed to have greatly improved not only the interface, but the whole game experience itself. From the in game arcade where you can hone your guitar techniques that many guitar instructors teach in their lessons. To a great lesson section in which all the techniques and terminologies are carefully and skillfully delivered to those who need them, along with a practice session that increases the difficulty as you perform the lesson better. Then (of coarse) the actual learning of a song. Wow. Super fun. The problem with the real guitar lessons that my friends and other took is that they plateaued and grew bored with their slow progress and lame nursery songs for beginners. Rocksmith masterfully throws that old paradigm out the window and allows the player to learn their favorite songs, but at the level it detects the user can handle. Then it slowly increases the skill level as you master more perfectly the notes/chords that are launched your way. It is fun, motivational, and very progressive. Your skill will increase in just the first few weeks alone.\n\nThe game also includes and virtual band called Session Mode where you can play with your own band that you define and calibrate then play with. They adjust to your key/chord progession, tempo, style...etc.  Just another of many wows within the game. This game is a gem and has found it's place in my heart.\n\nUbisoft it seems has fully embraced the notion that a game like Rocksmith is equally used as a learning tool to learn from scratch how to play the electric/rythem/bass guitars, or the hone your skills even if your a guitar shredding vet. Both types seem to be happy with what Ubisoft has delivered this run.\n\nTheir are of coarse a good selection of tracks included with the game itself. Or they are always adding to the growing library of DLC songs or song packs to more greatly expand your library of favorite guitar songs/licks/riffs etc.\n\nI haven't played a game where I was actually learning something that truly had a place and meaning outside of the gaming world. What a breathe of fresh air. They are trailblazing a new type of genre in effect. Not just the guitar playing genre, but the learning a real skill game genre. (lame name, but you get it.  :P  )\n\nVery excited about this one. It's just different in all the right ways from anything else out there. Try it, find out for yourself.\n\n-GooseSwan","December 22, 2013","true","186.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was surprised at how much I actually learned just in the first day. In fact, you learn almost everything you need to know about guitar in Rocksmith that you need in order to play. The problem arises in the ways in which you are able to practice. As I suspected, the game is riddled with connectivity issues between the game and the guitar you are using between the Real Tone cable. Being a former 'professional' Guitar Hero player myself, I was afraid that the mini-games would be pretty much unplayable, and I was right. Sometimes strumming the correct note will result in a miss, and if strummed hard enough, you can actually strum any note, and the game will classify it as the correct note. Overall, I would still highly recommend picking up Rocksmith if you want to learn guitar. But I would advise staying away from it if you want to use it to practice.","December 31, 2013","true","13.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm not 13 anymore, so I don't expect to get anywhere near good as quick as the young'uns will, but this game is able to keep guitar fun and interesting, a tall order for an instrument with such a steep learning curve.\n\nAs for the DLC, I'm pretty sure the older Rocksmith stuff is compatible with the newer, and once you see how much work goes into every single song offered (the riff breakdowns, the practice modes, etc.), the price is understandable.

The Score Attack and Guitarcade are also highly entertaining ways of spicing it up with variety too.

I previously had the Xbox version, and I hated playing on my console through a TV.  The HDMI lag was not great.  With Rocksmith 2014, I bought the Steam version, installed in on the Mac i use for music work, and have it running through my studio setup.  Makes all the difference in the world.  Zero lag, great sound.\n\nImprovements this version include a session mode, where you pick a key and some band members, and they just sort of follow along with you.  While they arent the best backing band, it does give you an opportunity to practice scales and riffs with a rythm section behind you.  Another improvement is that it seems to more accurately catch what you are playing, shift difficulty at more appropriate times and the riff repeater is superb for really learning a part.  You get a ton of control over when it ups the difficulty (or whether it does) and speed.\n\nI've been playing guitar, rythm, lead and bass, for over 30 years now, and I can honestly say that while I thought this was going to be a toy, ala rockband, I have definitely increased my skill by playing it.  At first I dismissed the guitarcade as a gimmick, but it definitely has made my scales faster, and my accuracy and fretboard position awareness significantly better.\n\nThe only complaints I have are:\n\n1. I wish riff repeater was slightly more controllable as to when it starts and stop instead of being such large sections.  There have been a couple times where I was trying to learn a tough little flourish that occurs at the end of an easy section, and had to play the easy section over and over to get to the short riff because i couldnt shorten the RR selection enough.  That said, I got really good at it :)\n\n2. The instructions for getting the Rocksmith 1 content should have been clearer.  I did finally get it to work, but I shouldn't have had to go to the forums for answers, that should have been a simple step by step process with rock solid documentation.\n\nOverall I give it a 9/10.  Great tool for learning, and even for those of us with lots of experience there is a lot of learning to do.  It still amazes me when you spend 10 minutes on it, and suddenly pick up a tricky section as they throw it at you seemingly out of the blue at times.","December 31, 2013","true","13.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However it is my first real attempt at learning to play guitar.  After 2 weeks of using Rocksmith 2014 I can say that I've seen a major improvement!\n\nRocksmith 2014 starts you out easy, playing maybe 1 out of 10 notes through easy passages, and maybe 1 out of 20 through the more challenging parts.  As you improve Rocksmith throws more at you, and if its too much at first it backs it down a notch.  After each time playing through a song the program will show you your longest streak and your accuracy, along with song mastery and a few exercises that Rocksmith 2014 believes will help you improve the next time.\n\nPros:\n1) Simple, effective and user friendly set up (note highway, similar to Guitar Hero)\n\n2) The riff repeater is very helpful allowing you to repeat a section over and over until you get it, and will let you increase or decrease difficulty (awesome for learning solos)\n\n3) 50+ songs ranging in style\n\nCon:\n\nThe in game tuner is off, and its finnicky.  On day two I broke my high e string because the in game tuner insisted I was flat and told me to tighten the string until it broke.\n\nAll in all Rocksmith 2014 is an excellent practice tool, and you will get what you put into it.

Rocksmith 2014 makes Rocksmith 1 look like an alpha. It's like they took all the small things that were bad in Rocksmith 1 (algorithm could ramp difficulty incorrectly, practice mode was outside of the song, "story mode" was dumb as all hell, visually sort of so-so, not very exciting) and irons them all out.\n\nYou can play all your Rocksmith 1 DLC on 2014. All Rocksmith 1 DLC is available on 2014, with some arrangement changes to take advantage of some of the different techniques in 2014.\n\nThe difficulty ramping algorithm is a hell of a lot better now, so it doesn't suddenly throw chords at you in the middle of nowhere like Rocksmith 1. You can hit the riff repeater INSIDE the song now to just practice a certain phrase, without having to go into a separate area. When you're done with it, you can hop back into the song where you left off. It's also got a breakdown of a song and the game detects areas you're struggling and suggests different lessons or games specific to the track you're working on.\n\nMissions guide you along to areas you need to work on, which gives you some direction if you're looking to improve. The game basically figures out which things you're good at at which you suck at, and recommends tracks that utilize those techniques to make you better.\n\nThe game looks better visually and the frets are labelled as well as the fingers, making it easier to use. Purely visual, but when you practice now, you're basically inside a concrete practice room but as you improve your phrases a sort of "portal" appears on the wall where the notes are coming from which slowly widens to reveal a stage with a crowd.

I have tried learning to play the guitar before and though it started sounding nice enough to make out what I was playing at some point, invariable I'd quit within a month or two. After my guitar had been gathering dust for a couple of years a friend of mine recommended Rocksmith and I decided to invest in learning this skill one final time. This time around I've been playing much longer than ever before, trying to put in an hour each day if I find the time. I can actually play along with some classics pretty nicely now, something I was never able to do before to this degree, not to mention I'm now mostly able to play without watching the frets all the time.\n\nPros:\nDoes a very decent job at recognizing what you play.\nYou can set it up to automatically increase the difficulty and/or speed.\nSmall mini games teach you essential skills and help you practice them in a much less boring way than if you would practice them normally.\nThe Guitar Hero-like interface helps making the learning experience feel more like a game.\nCons:\nThe songs in RS2014 are somewhat harder than the ones in the first Rocksmith. You'd need to splurge some more to get those songs by first buying the original software and then spending some more on the import tool required to get those songs into RS2014.\nSome of the DLC that you haven't bought yet clutters up your song list, obviously urging you to buy it.\nThe guitar tuner is a bit wacky. Sometimes the precision tuner tells you the string is tuned correctly, but the double-check it does afterwards will not pass. Getting past this point is difficult and skipping the tuning process because of it doesn't help either because the same string will give you trouble during the song causing you to "miss" notes.\n2 dollars per song (DLC) is quite a lot of money if you want to build a nice library.\nDespite my list of cons being longer than my list of pros I'm still very happy with what Rocksmith has done for me and I will definitely continue to use it to hone my new skills.","December 29, 2015","true","79.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Rocksmith 2014 makes Rocksmith 1 look like an alpha. It's like they took all the small things that were bad in Rocksmith 1 (algorithm could ramp difficulty incorrectly, practice mode was outside of the song, "story mode" was dumb as all hell, visually sort of so-so, not very exciting) and irons them all out.\n\nYou can play all your Rocksmith 1 DLC on 2014. All Rocksmith 1 DLC is available on 2014, with some arrangement changes to take advantage of some of the different techniques in 2014.\n\nThe difficulty ramping algorithm is a hell of a lot better now, so it doesn't suddenly throw chords at you in the middle of nowhere like Rocksmith 1. You can hit the riff repeater INSIDE the song now to just practice a certain phrase, without having to go into a separate area. When you're done with it, you can hop back into the song where you left off. It's also got a breakdown of a song and the game detects areas you're struggling and suggests different lessons or games specific to the track you're working on.\n\nMissions guide you along to areas you need to work on, which gives you some direction if you're looking to improve. The game basically figures out which things you're good at at which you suck at, and recommends tracks that utilize those techniques to make you better.\n\nThe game looks better visually and the frets are labelled as well as the fingers, making it easier to use. Purely visual, but when you practice now, you're basically inside a concrete practice room but as you improve your phrases a sort of "portal" appears on the wall where the notes are coming from which slowly widens to reveal a stage with a crowd. Nice effect--as you improve a song, more and more of the audience, lighting, and effects are revealed until you're basically on stage at 100%\n\nIf you never played Rocksmith 1 but want to learn to play--you won't develop this really deep understanding of musical theory or anything from it, but you'll know enough to be able to pick up a guitar and play some tracks, as well as casually jam with people (if you remember your chords).

It's basically Rock Band (or Guitar Hero) with an ACTUAL guitar! Your six strings are color coded so you can easily find the string to strum (for example, the red string is the thickest string on the guitar, yellow is next, blue after that and so on). Next is the fretboard in the game, it shows numbers on the interface (3, 5, 7, 9, 12 and the other dot places). It also comes with an in game tuner for many different setups (unlike the original 2). Also something I chose this game over the original was the official songs (songs that come with the game, not DLC), it has AWESOME tracks, not just stuff by bands that got famous by these games (with a few exceptions), it's got Bat Country by Avenged Sevenfold, Say It Ain't So by Weezer (side note, I've spent the most time here because it's good practice for chords), My Own Summer by Deftones and many more!\n\nThere is one BIG downside to this game though, the way the game's programmed, you need a pretty good guitar with brand new strings, and not too many pickups and stuff. I don't know why but, sometimes the game reads your tuning as right in the tuner then says you're tuning is completely off during a song. Here's a good example, you tune your guitar as close to the 0 mark as you can get (in this one, that's near impossible to do), then you strum the right note at the right time, and it says you either didn't hit it or you hit it late. All because of the way it's programmed. If you don't have a $5,000 guitar, I recommend you get the original Rocksmith as it isn't as picky with your tuning...","May 24","true","49.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","6"

I can fully recommend both for that reason alone with 2014 easily being the superior version.\n\nHaving spent close to 200 hours with the original Rocksmith I wasn't hesitant in pre-ordering the 2014 edition for almost the songs alone. While the original had some flaws, 2014 addresses all the major ones, improves the game in every way & adds some great new modes. I've seen some complaints on having to pay around $10 to import the songs from the original Rocksmith (the dlc from the first transfers for free), but I think it's understandable due to the licencing fees. Also it came as a welcome surprise that all the original songs have been redone, benefiting from the improved techniques such as improved bends, and have become more accurate to the original arrangement.\n\nIf you've ever wanted to learn guitar or bass or need the motivation to improve I'd suggest Rocksmith 2014 as an additional aid as well as being great fun once you've become comfortable with them.","November 27, 2013","true","298.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Defintly for novice guitarists like myself to lean the ropes.  However it is not perfect.\n\nThe note detection is hit and miss.\nHow the tracks are set up, slowly adds notes once you hit a track perfectly or removes them when you miss a fraction, is a decent idea. Once you put it into practice though it is psychologically frustrating.\n\nHere is why. Once you learn a riff on a lower dificulty you have to relearn that riff again when the difficulty ramps up. Subconsciously you are relearning a single song multiple times over and over again. Then muscle memory will not have a clear memory to focus on. Leading to frustration for guitarists. No matter who I talk to about Rocksmith is irritated with the software.\n\nYou can however max out the song and play at slower speeds then manually make them faster over time. This slightly less irritating because hitting/missing unkown chords or riffs will continue regardless. What would make it better is for the a training mode to stop a track until you hit the note or the chord perfectly then move to the next one to get a taste of the dish. Then move on to nonstop tracks.\n\nOccasionaly, on my rig anyway, the chord is very picky about how it is placed in the guitars output. Buzzing sounds cut off all outputs as well as the output cutting off alltogether.\n\nRocksmith provides a lot of information and is a decent escape for bordem.\nBut you could search for the same information online for free.","December 12, 2015","false","130.7"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","5"

Instead the drivers are reinstalled everytime you reinsert the USB cable. Sometimes the driver downloads as it's suppose to as "Rocksmith USB device" but more often than not it downloads "USB Audio Device" which will not work, or even worse just "hocksmit" which does not work.

Rocksmith gives you one of the best learning experience  i've ever played. For me learning a guitar was pretty hard, having to read everything from books & practice. But with rocksmith it teaches you everything you need to know, from bending to slides to pull off & such. With other games though it does have its problems.\n\nGood things:\n\nYou do actually learn how to play.\n\nEasy tutorials - The tutorials in the game teach you everything you need to know at a slow pace.\n\nAdvancing difficulty - As you play a song it will gradually get harder & harder the better you do & will get easier if your'e doing bad.\n\nSong list - There are quite alot of songs to pick from but at the same time, for an extra £7.99 you can import all of the first rocksmiths songs.\n\nBuilt in Tunner - Its nice to have a tunner built into the game but it has its problems.\n\nMini Games - There are quite alot of mini games to play which will improve your skills. There fun too.\n\nBad things:\n\nI haven't really come across that many bad things about thins game, but i have seen a few.\n\nTunner - The tunner in the game is a challenge, it will tell you what note to tune your string to but when you play it back the game says its wrong. An easy fix is to turn your speakers off when your'e tunning, it really helps.\n\nPrecision - The game will not give you a free pass, which sounds good but sometimes the game picks up notes i'm not even playing & bending has to be perfect or else the game won't allow it.\n\nMore modern music - My type of music might be different from others (Metal of course) but i wold like to see more up to date music. Dont get me wrong, some of the songs in game are fun to plat & listen too but i would like to see more modern music.\n\nThats all i can basically say about this game, it is so much fun & will get you playing a guitar in no time. It is definitionally worth the asking price & if your'e serious about wanting to play a guitar i would get it.","November 26, 2013","true","635.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

An AMAZING tool, but don't go in expecting this to be a game experience. If you've never played a guitar, your fingers will hurt. You will also learn to play things. If you do already play guitar and want something to motivate you to practise more or just learn some new songs in a fun way, it's great fun. The Guitarcade games are a really well-disguised drill program that actually makes you better at techniques in a fun way, and there are little tutorials for all kinds of things that you my have never tried before even if you are experienced. This game solved the problem I'd always had with tremolos (I was holding the pick wrong. Simple fix, but the tutorial videos showed me what's up) and taught me some new techs too. If you have an interest in guitar, enough that you've already bought the instrument but have no idea where to go next, this is a no brainer.","December 1, 2013","true","488.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The menus are snappy, and you can infinitely practice a song section however you like.    One of the reasons why I dropped off the first game was that it did a pour job of teaching you the chords for a song.  You couldn't practice chords easily, and as someone who knows nothing about playing the guitar, I was just completely lost and a bit frustrated.  It felt like I hit a ceiling and there didn't seem to be a way to improve.\n\nIn Rocksmith 2014, the adaptive teaching system in the game gives you a set of tasks for each song to help you incrementally learn how to play it in real life.  It tells you what sections you want to practice, what chords you should learn, and just feels more like a teaching tool and less like a game.  The greatest improvement is that the riff-repeater is much like Rockband's riff-repeater, just infinitely looping a section and letting you adjust speed and difficulty on the fly.  No more loading, no more "do it five times to beat your score" gimmicks, just the ability to practice how you want, whenever you want.\n\nYes, there are still goals and objectives, and the carrot on the stick is the various unlocks that the game will dole out to you as you meet these objectives, but if you're just here to learn how to play guitar (or more importantly, have fun playing some classic rocks songs), then Rocksmith 2014 is made for you.  I know I'm definitely looking forward to learning some of my favourite songs in the game.\n\nAs an aside, the cable itself should be easy to find, especially if you can find a bargain bin copy of Rocksmith for one of the consoles.  I'd also recommend waiting for a sale on the first game and purchasing the disc import tool to give you instant access to 50 or so more songs to play - considering the price of the DLC, that's a very cheap way to bulk up your song library.","December 2, 2013","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You learn the fundamentals the fun way, (something that can't be said about many instructional alternatives). And as for learning the songs, this Rocksmith surpasses the former by making sure you learn and recall sections by heart before you haphazardly continue, they even ocassionaly remove note annotations when they are certain you can play without further instruction (aka Master Mode).\nThe menu can be tricky at times and one might find that editing particular functions can take a little bit longer and can be a tad confusing, but that shouldn't be an issue for most users.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone, whether the person is already familiar with their instrument or simply starting out.","December 6, 2013","true","190.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also you can now use your computer as an amplafier and add any type of effect to make all kinds of different sounds.  As if all of these awsome features were not enough they have added the all new session mode making it easy to just jam out with a band that changes with you and pushes you to solo.

You learn the fundamentals the fun way, (something that can't be said about many instructional alternatives). And as for learning the songs, this Rocksmith surpasses the former by making sure you learn and recall sections by heart before you haphazardly continue, they even ocassionaly remove note annotations when they are certain you can play without further instruction (aka Master Mode).\nThe menu can be tricky at times and one might find that editing particular functions can take a little bit longer and can be a tad confusing, but that shouldn't be an issue for most users.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this to anyone, whether the person is already familiar with their instrument or simply starting out.","December 6, 2013","true","190.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The menus are snappy, and you can infinitely practice a song section however you like.    One of the reasons why I dropped off the first game was that it did a pour job of teaching you the chords for a song.  You couldn't practice chords easily, and as someone who knows nothing about playing the guitar, I was just completely lost and a bit frustrated.  It felt like I hit a ceiling and there didn't seem to be a way to improve.\n\nIn Rocksmith 2014, the adaptive teaching system in the game gives you a set of tasks for each song to help you incrementally learn how to play it in real life.  It tells you what sections you want to practice, what chords you should learn, and just feels more like a teaching tool and less like a game.  The greatest improvement is that the riff-repeater is much like Rockband's riff-repeater, just infinitely looping a section and letting you adjust speed and difficulty on the fly.  No more loading, no more "do it five times to beat your score" gimmicks, just the ability to practice how you want, whenever you want.\n\nYes, there are still goals and objectives, and the carrot on the stick is the various unlocks that the game will dole out to you as you meet these objectives, but if you're just here to learn how to play guitar (or more importantly, have fun playing some classic rocks songs), then Rocksmith 2014 is made for you.  I know I'm definitely looking forward to learning some of my favourite songs in the game.\n\nAs an aside, the cable itself should be easy to find, especially if you can find a bargain bin copy of Rocksmith for one of the consoles.  I'd also recommend waiting for a sale on the first game and purchasing the disc import tool to give you instant access to 50 or so more songs to play - considering the price of the DLC, that's a very cheap way to bulk up your song library.","December 2, 2013","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I love it to the max, The first day I got it I played it for 11 hours. Though I do not recommend  this to new players unless you are going to stick to the few really easy songs on it. I also think if you want to learn a song use tabs like http://www.songsterr.com/ . it is easy to remember then flashing notes coming at your screen. I think Rocksmith  is more for playing songs you have already learned, it is really fun. I don't play the arcade games much because I get enough practice with the fret board on my own, but some are cool like the zombie game thats like "The Typing Of The Dead" but with chords instead. There is few songs that I enjoy though, such as; The trooper - Iron Maiden, War Ensemble - Slayer, Heart Shaped Box - Nirvana, Pour Some Suger On Me - Def Leppard, Peace Of Mind - Boston, Knockin On Heavens door, Spirit Of The Radio - Rush, and Thuder Kiss '65 - White Zombie. there is also a lot of good DLC songs, like Iron Maiden songs, Megadeth songs, Pantera songs, etc. You also need a Rocksmith Real Tone Cable, which I have had mine from my Xbox Version. you can buy a Cable at a Gamestop/EB games I believe. Anyways, I think this is one of the greatest games I have ever played and I suggest getting it to the average guitar player, or skilled.","December 31, 2014","true","166.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is everything that Guitar Hero and Rock Band want to be, for those who can handle a real fretboard.  I do have just a few complaints... but I list them more as motivation for improvement (hopefully in patches, but at least in future versions)...\n\nA few interface navigation issues.  Generally "back" should return you to where you were.  That's not true 100% of the time.  Generally crossing between "Learn a Song" and "Score Attack" needs to have more attention devoted to it.  I think it works correctly if you access "Learn a Song" for a song from the Score Attack menu (IE, if I'm on "Some Song: Score Attack", select "Learn a Song", then use "Back", I'm at "Some Song: Score Attack"), but the inverse isn't true.  If I'm at "Some Song: Learn a Song", then select "Score Attack" and use "Back", I'm in the list of songs for Score Attack.\n\nFine-tuning could be a hair easier.  I noticed on some songs when I got into Drop-D on my bass that I needed to tune the open D down a hair for the first three frets to be closer... don't know why... but I was failing hard on the 2nd-4th frets of the low string until I did. It may be different in other modes, but at least in Score attack, once it decides your string is in tune, it moves on, and there is either no way, or no easy way to keep measuring the one string before moving on.\n\nLack of desktop UI optimization.  This is incredibly frustrating...  the game was obviously designed for a least-common-demoninator interface... so we have a UI that was meant for a simplistic game pad, even when using superior interface devices on a Windows or Mac PC. I think the best illustration is in sorting songs.  If you're on a device with a mouse (or touch for that matter), why not have drop-downs?  I tend to try to sort by tuning to see what to play next (I want to play them all, and don't want to retune between each song).  Tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, tab, "Crap, passed it", tab, tab, tab, tab, tab.....    WHY??  A search box would be great too...  we can certainly type a name if we're using console buttons remapped to a keyboard.  Oh... mission to do a particular song.... tab, tab, tab, tab, "crap, passed it", tab, tab, tab, tab, "Starts with 'B'? Great, I'm in the 'W's... ", up-arrow... hold.... hold.... hold...........    Search box...   click (search box entry), b, possibly a second letter in the title, click.  Done.   Even better.... if the mission is very specific, hyperlink the objective.  Actually, in most of the missions I can think of, you could give a button to go for it... or at least get closer (and that'd be even better for the consolers).  Next Mission: "Achieve 5% Mastery in Some Song", Press [whatever] to go to Learn a Song: Some Song.  Even with "play a new song" or "play x new songs", you could use that button to either randomly go to a new song, or open a list, filtered to unplayed songs.\n\nI could go one all day, but perhaps one more: Learn a Song, Riff Repeater, setting difficulty.  It'd be really helpul to have an easy way to tune the song's difficulty to matching the score attack levels (easy, medium, hard).  I figured out pretty quick that I need to try to get Platinum on Easy and Medium before using learn a song, because if I'm pretty good at the full studio arrangement, seeing the simpler arrangements screw me up.... but sometimes I'd like to use riff-repeater to nail the medium-level version (and on a few rare songs, the "easy" version).\n\nI've heard Zeppelin and Metallica are out because the record companies won't get on board. I'm guessing AC/DC is in the same boat. Here's some great DLC that may be easier to license:  Cake, lots of Cake...  SUPER bass lines, decent guitar riffs... I think that'd be fun stuff good starter pack may include "Hem of Your Garment" (awesome bass throughout, good rhythm through most of it... don't think there's a lead 6-string part in this one), "Sheep Go to Heaven" (something for everyone), and "Arco Arena" could be a really fun, short instrumental.  Ok... now here's something you're REALLY missing out on.  Music software for gamer geeks...    and NO JOCO?","May 10, 2014","true","528.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I probably will not learn how to play guitar through this program, I think it is a good starting place. I like the fact that over time the program increases in difficulty. On the other hand, I would rather control how fast the difficulty increases. I have had at least three rage quits where the difficulty increased insanely high. In my opinion, some of the beginning "easier" songs are a bit boring after a while. On the other hand, there are a few beginner songs that I do enjoy. I listen to music on the heavy metal end of the spectrum leaving me kind of bored in the beginning. There might be a way, I could not find it, to make the difficult songs easier for beginners. Also, I wish there were more songs for free, but they have to make money so, I will not count that against them. I do enjoy that I can pause a song and repeat a rift that I completely failed.\n\nPros:\n-Pleasent teaching tool\n-Increases difficulty the more you play\n-Good selection of songs (hurray, I could not find any country!)\n-Rift repeater\n-Can buy more songs are a somewhat decent price\n-Can skip making an account through UPlay (ew ew ew where did I put my hand sanitizer...)\n-Teaches lead, rhythm, and bass guitar\n\nCons:\n-Occasional insane difficulty increase\n-Beginning songs can become boring after a while because of difficulty\n-Requires a specific proprietary USB cable (There are some nice cheap cables on Amazon for less than $10 that work just as well)\n\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you could get this game for lower than $15, I would recommend it.","March 12, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're struggling with a solo or a verse or even the whole song it lowers the difficulty for you or you can choose how much you want the difficulty to be. The other reason that learning songs on Rocksmith is the fact that it feels like you are playing in a band with all the music while you play. The percentage at the end just makes you want to get to 100%.\nYes it does have some flaws like it doesnt always pick up notes unless the volume is at max (might just be my guitar) and the difficulty can go from easy to quite difficult on certain songs, but you can't do anything about that.\nBut overall I love this game and have learnt more in a month of playing this than i  have over the past 3 months of youtube and guitar tabs.

Many good ideas are implemented as practice games (in the style of classic arcade) to develop coordination and technique. While it is a much better game than the previous Rocksmith, it still leaves a lot to be desired in order to become an excellent practice helper and song tutor. Rocksmith 2014, while generally good, is currently just a good, not great, game for jamming on guitar and most likely improving one's guitar playing. However, it could become a great game with further development.\n\nRocksmith 2014 is good, but hopefully there are better things to come in a future release such as having the game automatically adjusting your E standard tuned guitar to sound like it's in alternate tunings rather than having to manually tune your guitar for dropped or open or raised tunings in songs, being able to play technique games in alternate tunings rather than just E standard, menu navigation by playing certain notes such as little or big E strings to navigate up and down, an option that allows us to listen to the songs like a jukebox without playing along on guitar would be much appreciated, and I could go on and on with more suggestions!). With all of the talented people that worked on or consulted for this game it's a shame that there is so much more that could be done that is simply lacking from Rocksmith 2014. Could the plan perhaps be to hold out on features thus ensuring the purchase of a future installment? I would love to have a better iteration of this game, but please provide more features that seem obvious as much-needed inclusions!\n\nRocksmith 2014 won't replace what you get in lessons from a great teacher. With the need for improvements and further development notwithstanding, this game is still worth picking up as it is the best thing available when it comes to a game that you can play with your own real guitar and most likely improving your guitar playing. It's mostly a good time (aside from frustrations encountered due to poorly thought-out features that need to be improved) especially considering that it will only set you back the cost of a couple lessons.","January 20, 2014","true","183.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does work, and quite well, however there are a few issues:\n\n1) There's really no incentive to practice chords outside of a song, nor does it do a good job of teaching said chords. True, there is a chord book that you can use, but I have found it to be of minimal use.\n\n2) The cost of song expansion packs is a little steep. But you will get bored with the standard song set rather quickly, so you'll need to buy more songs.\n\n3) As far as I can tell, there's no online play, like there was with Rockband or Guitar Hero. Totally different games, I know, but still.\n\nOverall, these few issues are miniscule to the positive aspects of the game. The learning curve can get a bit steep, but its not bad. Overall, I have found this more useful in teaching bass rather than guitar, but that might be due to my fat fingers, who knows. If you wanna learn how to play and don't wanna take a community class or hire a teacher, this is a great way to go.","June 24, 2014","true","567.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

I highly recommend this if you are into guitar or bass at all, beginner or advanced.\n\nThe good:\n* Session mode is a huge addition that lets you improvise over a customizable band that reacts to what you are playing. This alone is worth the purchase price.\n* The tracklist and DLC so far is great and if you own Rocksmith you can import the 50 songs from that for $10\n* Large video library with lessons working from the very basics to more advanced techniques\n* Master mode will now gradually fade out notes from sections you do well in rather than throwing the entire song at you with no notes.\n* Riff repeater makes it easy to stop in the middle of a song and practice a section at any diffulty or speed you want. This is a HUGE improvement.\n* The new score attack with leaderboards is a lot of fun once you have a song down pretty well\n* The interface is, for the most part, much better.\n\nThe bad:\n* The game seems much more forgiving on single notes now but can be very difficult to get chords to register completely throughout an entire song. Bends work fine on guitar but the game seems to have trouble recognizing them consistently on bass.\n* While the guitarcade games are better than the original's, they suffer from a lack of options and too much downtime after a loss to really be a great tool.\n* Still no way to just just study the tabs without playing the song\n* Career mode is gone and the game no longer plays back your performance after you've finished.","December 1, 2013","true","337.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you start doing well it will sometimes throw a curve your way but doesn't penalize you if you can't do it, it just learns your progress and works with it. However, you can dissect each track and play whichever part you want at any difficulty. There is plenty of challenges to do with the Guitarcade minigames, and each game are great for learning various exersizes, and session mode is an interesting jam session simulator that tries to play with what your playing.\n\nMy only complaints with the game is just how it sometimes doesn't hear the right notes, and impedes a lot of progress (especially in lessons). I think though if your guitar has pickups that picks up a lot of mids/highs and has a cleaner output, this won't be an issue. The session mode I havn't seen an ability to record what you and your "band" made, which is a bit upsetting.","January 18, 2014","true","114.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When you need to grind and learn a song that you could easily play prima vista on standard guitar tab, it takes away most of the fun, of which there definitely there would be a lot of. Other gripes include latency issues, though less bad as in the first game and some note detection troubles especially on lower chords.\n\nBeginners shouldn't be bothered as much by the tab problem (although why not just have the normal tab as option, as it is a beneficial thing to learn in itself?) and the session room can be fun for all levels.

Unlike the previous Rocksmith which had a game mode, this one does not, so its more of a learning tool than a game. It's a great way for beginners to learn guitar, if you are a intermediate or advance player not so much, altough you can still have lots of fun with it. I would love to see added a feature to allow you to control individual instrument tracks in 'Learn a Song' mode, or at least the ability to solo the guitar tracks, also the ability to control the master level of the song while playing because sometimes it is a little boring having to play the same song a few times in the lower easier levels in order to get to a level that will challenge you.","December 1, 2013","true","108.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you like playing the guitar and would like to learn how to play some popular songs this is the game for you. Playing an actual guitar can be intimidating for those without experience, but this game will adjust itself for people of all skill levels.\n\nHowever, even though the game has several new features that were added since the last instalment, I'm not sure they warrant an entirely new game with a higher price tag. Also, I would like to see more songs available for DLC and idealy at a lower price.","December 1, 2013","true","183.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I highly recommend this if you are into guitar or bass at all, beginner or advanced.\n\nThe good:\n* Session mode is a huge addition that lets you improvise over a customizable band that reacts to what you are playing. This alone is worth the purchase price.\n* The tracklist and DLC so far is great and if you own Rocksmith you can import the 50 songs from that for $10\n* Large video library with lessons working from the very basics to more advanced techniques\n* Master mode will now gradually fade out notes from sections you do well in rather than throwing the entire song at you with no notes.\n* Riff repeater makes it easy to stop in the middle of a song and practice a section at any diffulty or speed you want. This is a HUGE improvement.\n* The new score attack with leaderboards is a lot of fun once you have a song down pretty well\n* The interface is, for the most part, much better.\n\nThe bad:\n* The game seems much more forgiving on single notes now but can be very difficult to get chords to register completely throughout an entire song. Bends work fine on guitar but the game seems to have trouble recognizing them consistently on bass.\n* While the guitarcade games are better than the original's, they suffer from a lack of options and too much downtime after a loss to really be a great tool.\n* Still no way to just just study the tabs without playing the song\n* Career mode is gone and the game no longer plays back your performance after you've finished.","December 1, 2013","true","337.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I liked the way there was a story element where you'd arrange a set list, and then you had to practice those songs until you'd mastered them to then rock them in a performance. You'd get points and streaks, and it was all very competative.\n\nWell there's none of that anymore with RockSmith 2014, and I think that's sad. The catalog of DLC songs is now vast, covering classical through to spoof acts. Playing and practicing the songs is fin, don't get me wrong... but it just doesn't feel like a game anymore. There are arcade challenges, but it's really not the same thing.\n\nAll this said, I still can't put the gaem down. I've clocked up more hours playing this than I have romping though the entire Borderlands trilogy (1,2 and Pre-sequel) combined. It's definitly improved my playing ability and technique, but if you're already half proficient, some of the tutorials do feel like you're being taught to suck and egg.\n\nIf you're completely new to guitar... don't get this game. Buy a book or get a friend to show you the basics. If you've already been playing a month or so, this is proably not a bad investment. If you've been playing for more than 5 years, this is going to be too easy. In you're in that sweetspot in the middle, pick it up.\n\nOh, and I thought session mode was going to be awesome... it was a bit of a let down IMHO.","December 1, 2013","true","329.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While I probably will not learn how to play guitar through this program, I think it is a good starting place. I like the fact that over time the program increases in difficulty. On the other hand, I would rather control how fast the difficulty increases. I have had at least three rage quits where the difficulty increased insanely high. In my opinion, some of the beginning "easier" songs are a bit boring after a while. On the other hand, there are a few beginner songs that I do enjoy. I listen to music on the heavy metal end of the spectrum leaving me kind of bored in the beginning. There might be a way, I could not find it, to make the difficult songs easier for beginners. Also, I wish there were more songs for free, but they have to make money so, I will not count that against them. I do enjoy that I can pause a song and repeat a rift that I completely failed.\n\nPros:\n-Pleasent teaching tool\n-Increases difficulty the more you play\n-Good selection of songs (hurray, I could not find any country!)\n-Rift repeater\n-Can buy more songs are a somewhat decent price\n-Can skip making an account through UPlay (ew ew ew where did I put my hand sanitizer...)\n-Teaches lead, rhythm, and bass guitar\n\nCons:\n-Occasional insane difficulty increase\n-Beginning songs can become boring after a while because of difficulty\n-Requires a specific proprietary USB cable (There are some nice cheap cables on Amazon for less than $10 that work just as well)\n\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you could get this game for lower than $15, I would recommend it.","March 12, 2015","true","8.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Fire up the Duck shooting minigame for 10-20 minutes a day.\nWant to speed up your Tremolo? Jump into the Hurdles event!\nWant to polish up your chords a little? Storm the castle and kill zombies, or fly through space blasting ships into oblivion!\nBends? Temple of Bends will get you practicing your half-step and whole-step bends on a way you can see!\nWanna run some Scales? Scale Racer has you covered there as you weave through traffic in an addictive way to remember scale patterns!\n\nIt's not all rosey however!\n\nWhile this software can be a very, very useful tool, it gives no insight into "Music".\n\nThere is absolutely no theory to learn from here, if you want to know what makes a chord, a chord... Rocksmith isn't gonna help you there.\n\nWant to learn notation? there's none to be had here which I think is this softwares biggest crime.\n\nThis is for someone who owns/has owned a Guitar for a while, and is comfortable enough to use it, for the absolute beginner there are some pretty big pitfalls and chances to develop bad/hurtful habits if using RS and RS alone as a teaching aid.\n\nMy biggest gripe is it's community, the UBI forums are filled by 3-5 people farming post counts, being down right rude, and giving bad/lazy information to people asking for it.\n\nThis is a community of Gamers who own Guitars, not Guitarists who play Games.\n\nThe DLC can be a touchy subject.\n\nBe it via pricing differences between platforms/Regions being seemingly random. to DLC plain out not showing.\n\nYou will be also advertised original Rocksmith DLC inside the in-game store, (As it IS compatible with RS'14) yet Steam will not let you access it without owning the first game, this is apparently being looked at, but don't hold your breath it seems as they are focused only on the new consoles and their own store problems, The other formats don't even seem to be on the radar anymore.\n\nWhile I do recommend this product entirely, I do not recommend it as a Teaching aide, I recommend it as a Practice aide and urge anyone wanting it to check out reviews and videos from Users before running out to buy a new Guitar.","February 28, 2015","true","111.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you're struggling with a solo or a verse or even the whole song it lowers the difficulty for you or you can choose how much you want the difficulty to be. The other reason that learning songs on Rocksmith is the fact that it feels like you are playing in a band with all the music while you play. The percentage at the end just makes you want to get to 100%.\nYes it does have some flaws like it doesnt always pick up notes unless the volume is at max (might just be my guitar) and the difficulty can go from easy to quite difficult on certain songs, but you can't do anything about that.\nBut overall I love this game and have learnt more in a month of playing this than i  have over the past 3 months of youtube and guitar tabs.

If you're struggling with a solo or a verse or even the whole song it lowers the difficulty for you or you can choose how much you want the difficulty to be. The other reason that learning songs on Rocksmith is the fact that it feels like you are playing in a band with all the music while you play. The percentage at the end just makes you want to get to 100%.\nYes it does have some flaws like it doesnt always pick up notes unless the volume is at max (might just be my guitar) and the difficulty can go from easy to quite difficult on certain songs, but you can't do anything about that.\nBut overall I love this game and have learnt more in a month of playing this than i  have over the past 3 months of youtube and guitar tabs.

You still have to put in a ton of work to get good at playing the guitar there is no way around that, but it motivates you to do so and gives you most of the tools you need. It lacks rhythm exercises, so make sure to work on that on your own including counting and picking patterns. I always lack the motivation to practice, but since I really get into the game, I haven't put my guitar down since.

Even with a super fast pc, there is still lag, enough to throw a real guitarist off.  But by far the worst thing about this game is the horrid tab system it uses.  NO guitarist uses tab like this whether you reverse it or not it's still crap and too 'guitar hero'y.  If they woudl have just used standard tablature with a bouncing ball or highlighter it would have been infinitely better and easier to use.  The way it scrolls is a pain as well as it's hard to see what's coming.  Would be much easier to have a couple lines of music on screen at a time. I get the need to make it look like a game but that design choice makes it a poor music application and teaches bad habits as a guitar player.","January 10","false","4.7"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"
