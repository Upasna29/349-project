Simple early platformer with a few nice-for-the-time flourishes - overworld map linking levels together,  and tricky puzzles.  Extremely dated graphics and sound nowadays, obviously, but that's part of the charm - if you want to play one of these lo-fi platformers, this is the real deal.","May 9, 2015","true","7.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Takes a few hours to play through them all.\nOnly play this if you really have nothing better to do. Or just play the 4th chapter to see the ending.\n\nThe collision box of everything is a full square, even bullets and spikes.\nJumping has an unpredictable delay, and sometimes doesn't register at all.\nCharacter just flips direction when turning, making it hard to stay in one spot when sliding on ice.\nMost levels contain traps, prepare to re-do each level at least five times.","January 19","false","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Well Arctic Adventure might be the platform game you are looking for.  AA is a puzzle platformer from 1991 with all the good and bad that comes from being a classic PC Game.  One note is that so far as I can tell the gamepad config is not complete and you have to use the keyboard to fire your gun (at least with my 360 controller this happened).

Pixelated platformer. You can move, jump and shoot from your pistol. Very limited ammuniton, but that is not a bad thing, because you can jump over enemies.\n-Each level is a one screen level.\n-One pipe marks the start and one pipe marks the exit. The exit pipe is blocked by a bunch of blocks that need to be destroyed and your quest is to find the exact number of pickaxes need for these blocks.\n-There are also buttons that add or remove blocks from the level so if you dont know what to do, then look for a button.\n-Jump height is fixed, doesnt matter whether you hold or lightly tap the jump button.\n-Some blocks are breakable with your head.\n-Some blocks look like walls but contain gold.\n-Annoying blocks of ice(make you slide) and flying blocks are in this game too. Also spikes.\n\nChallenging platformer from the old days.","March 10","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
