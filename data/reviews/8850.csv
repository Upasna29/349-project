Yet, in retrospect having played Infinite, Bioshock 2 seems to be the one which will age most gracefully, and it has aged nicely thus far.\n\nBioshock 2 is a First-Person Shooter in the vein of the original Bioshock, where you take on the role of a Big Daddy in the underwater city of Rapture. Where the original Bioshock explores the themes of Libertarianism, Bioshock 2 deals with Communism, perhaps not quite as strongly. Combat has been vastly improved by allowing access to both plasmids and guns simultaneously (which was used in Bioshock Infinite), while still retaining the full allotment of interesting weaponry. Additionally, trap versions of basically every form of plasmid are available for use in a series of "protect the Little Sister" sequences spread throughout the game.\n\nBioshock 2 also handles the moral choice system much more eloquently than the first game, with some actual balance to the choices that need to be made - arguably the most successfully that I've found in any game.\n\nUltimately, the game absolutely is more Bioshock, and it perhaps took place a tad too close to the original which is why it had as hard a time it did at release. Additionally, there's multiplayer achievements, but I don't expect that there's any real multiplayer activity at this pont, so...buyer beware on that aspect.\n\nAll in all, it's a great time. and I highly recommend it. Also, I'd recommend picking up Minerva's Den: It's an excellent DLC which distills the formula to its core and is an all around enjoyable experience.","October 20, 2014","true","36.6"," 169 of 175 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","169","175","4","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/8850/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","BioShock unquestionably changed the world of first person shooters by setting a new bar for storytelling in video games. With an epic story that pitted sanity versus insanity, gamers played Jack, a plane crash survivor who stumbled upon the underwater city of Rapture. Your goal was not just freedom but also to bring down billionaire industrialist Andrew Ryan whose utopia dissolved into a freakish world of hellish experiments gone wild.\n\nIt was a surreal experience that pitted the gamer against an army of the strange, the wrong and totally chaotic. Unlike those first person shooters set on alien planets, the future or on the battle field, BioShock was set in 1958 which only enhanced the gameplay experience in this alternate reality through the creepy music and settings. Of course, the stylised graphics and music made this even more plausible. Add in elements from the survivor genre to top it off and BioShock successfully created a worldwide hit.\n\nAnd here we are again, 3 years later and the underwater city of Rapture still breathes but a huge twist has been thrown into the story, thanks to the gamer now playing a Big Daddy. For the uninitiated, Big Daddy's were the huge golem like creatures from the original game who protected the Little Sisters. However, unlike the other Big Daddy's from the previous title, your avatar has free will and let's just say that if anyone or anything gets in your way, the repercussions will be deadly.\n\nBefore starting your BioShock 2 experience, the viewer is treated to a very interesting cinematic that introduces you to the world of this bizarre universe. Although it begins in 1958 and without spoiling the story too much, you are separated from your Little Sister and you awake ten years later. When you finally do get control of your character, it's all a mystery as to who or what you are. However, just like the original, the story slowly comes together, piece by piece. If you want to get even more in-depth, diaries are littered throughout the gaming environment to enhance the story.\n\nAs you wake within the Adonis Luxury Resort of Rapture City, you learn that this area was also used for genetic enhancements and so your journey begins of discovery and retribution. One of the main themes in the game is that girls are being kidnapped from islands around Rapture city in order to become Little Sisters for these twisted experiments. For this unnamed Big Daddy, you eventually have contact with Eleanor Lamb, the Little Sister you were once linked with. Unfortunately for her, her mother Sofia Lamb refuses to abide by your wishes and was the person responsible for your vile imprisonment. Needless to say, there are plenty of your in-your-face moments to the story of BioShock.\n\nTo compliment the story and those wow moments is the amazing level design, especially the underwater areas. The game itself is a first person shooter, however it has elements of RPG and the survival genre to stir things up. Unreal Technology powers the gaming interface as you tackle the denizens of Rapture City from those gone mad on ADAM, the slicers and your gender twisted sisters which all produce a memorable and decent gaming experience.\n\nIn terms of completion, BioShock 2 takes around 14-15 hours, give or take and has three alternate endings available to the player. For replay value, as the gameplay is so sturdy and the storyline so compelling, most gamers can easily get another play out of the game and go down another path to get that different ending. We've only completed BioShock 2 as a "good" Big Daddy, so we're eager to check out some of the other paths available for our character.\n\nSpeaking of Big Daddy! The control system of BioShock 2 has been well mapped and gamers of all different levels of experience will easily be able to control all facets of Big Daddy, even its deadly drill connected to its arm. If you have played the original, it does take a small amount of time getting use to this monstrous creature as opposed to a human but best of all, Big Daddy has access to some powerful heavy artillery such as Gatling guns and the like. When it comes to combat, the player has options of melee, weapons or genetic powers. With that said, the game is quite violent at times, especially when you're using your drill to disembowel your enemies.\n\nBig Daddy's were quite powerful in the original game and to make things fair to your enemies, they have received a slight power make-over. As you fight Splicer's or Big Sisters, it's great how they use the environment to their advantage such as cover and even health stations to replenish their health. Depending on your difficulty setting, the AI can be quite vicious towards the player and does make the game that extra bit more challenging. I played on a medium setting and did get my butt handed to me on more than one occasion but that's where upgrades, new weapons and new powers come into play.\n\nWhen battling enemies, it's quite surreal seeing the enemies fight as they do mimic real-world players quite well. But sometimes you need to fight fire with fire and our favourite Big Daddy has a few of his own powers such as Telekinesis 3 which allows for almost Star Wars based powers as you throw items and even smaller critters around the screen. BioShock 2 supports dual weapons which is generally unleashed when your fighting one of the myriad of bosses but what I like about BioShock 2 is using the environment to your advantage such as flammable pipes, BOOM, or unleashing deadly electrical EVE into the water to dispose your enemies.\n\nIn relation to bosses, they are quite powerful and if you do manage to die which you will, you will reappear in a rejuvenation chamber to fight again. My favourite battles in BioShock 2 are definitely the Big Sisters that pierce the sound barrier upon their arrival who have the force of a Big Daddy but unfortunately for you, the abilities of the Spider Slicers "speed" which will be frustratingly challenging at times but well worth the victory. Of course, not all BioShock is about fighting and you need to hack doors for entry, vending machines for supplies and even bots to fight at your side.\n\nADAM is used to upgrade your powers and abilities and the player uses Little Sisters to harvest this powerful genetic material. Of course to get a Little Sister, the player must first dispatch the Big Daddy that is protecting them. Once a Little Sister is yours, you can them use them to draw ADAM from corpses. This brings another strategy into the game through the use turrets and traps because once the Little Sisters start to harvest, other enemies are alerted, so you need to defend them quite well. As EVE played a huge role in the previous game which allowed you to use your powers, this also needs to be collected and replenished in BioShock 2. Fortunately, there are plenty of EVE hypos littered through the environments and some foods that can replenish it.\n\nWhen it comes to graphics, BioShock 2 is oozing with eye candy and looks amazing on high definition. The level design is brilliant that is complimented with some great lighting and special effects, especially the water. The characters are well animated and contain some great texture details, making it easy to be absorbed into the story of this "nameless" Big Daddy. The soundtrack is fitting and has a retro 1940's feel to it as is the voice acting, especially from our villain who is as mad as a hatter.\n\nFrom the very first moments, BioShock 2 holds an iron grip over you throughout the entire experience as you're given a violent tour of the legacy of Andrew Ryan's Rapture and the repercussions of his troubled dream. Some may say, it's the same as the previous game but I digress, it's a whole new chapter to this amazing underwater universe and if you don't believe me - buy it and you'll find out.","June 30, 2014","true","123.4"," 140 of 148 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","140","148","0","5"

It is very, very similar to the first; so expect it to play like a refined continuation rather than an entirely new game. But it does offer a more intimate perspective on the underwater dystopia, as the player will take on the role of a unique Big Daddy this time around and will be much more connected to the city. Most of the features are extremely similar to their counterparts in the original game; however there was definitely fine-tuning applied to some aspects. Perhaps most prominently, the combat and overall gameplay is significantly more exciting this time around. Overall, it is a great game that was mostly successful in living up to the high standard set by the first game.\n\nNow, it is essentially a direct sequel. Having played both games, I would suggest that you attempt to play the first one before this, if you can afford the time and money. Although, it isn’t entirely necessary and you could opt to read a synopsis rather than play through the entire first game. But I would suggest you at least do that to get a little background information. Doing so will provide you the opportunity to fully enjoy the subtle nuances throughout the game.\n\nAs for the specifics, Bioshock 2 is a fundamentally well-crafted game for all the same reasons the original was. At the forefront, there is once again an exceptionally intriguing atmosphere and a wondrous gameworld design. The city of Rapture continues to fascinate. Throughout your adventure, you will probably notice that all of the subtle niceties and ancillary details add up to create a very immersive and pleasurable experience. I personally feel the ambiance of the gameworld is best quality of this game and holds true to the brand.\n\nThe multidirectional storytelling that was expertly executed in the first game also returns in this sequel. The main storyline will unfold as you progress through the campaign, but you also can learn a great deal about the backstory and lore if you explore and if you seek out the collectibles. A lot is left up to the player to determine how much he/she wants to learn about the lore. The narrative elements are mostly well written and enticing; and the foundation of it all is the superbly idiosyncratic NPCs. It all comes together quite nicely. All of that said, the narrative elements as a whole may feel a little less interesting in Bioshock 2 than they were in the first— perhaps due to the unavoidable loss of novelty of core concepts that is intrinsic to all sequels.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it is significantly more exciting in Bioshock 2 than in the original.  There were nice refinements to the combat system, and the fact you now can maul people with the patented Big Daddy Drill is an added bonus. But also the actual fight sequences are better designed, and the layout of the combat zones provides more opportunities for creativity and hazard-kills. And new gameplay systems like the harvesting of ADAM from dead splicers really brings the high-action combat element of the game to the forefront of the overall experience much more than in the first installment.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode and although it has the potential to be quite fun, it suffers from a low population and not-so-friendly community of regulars. If you have the patience to deal with the wait times and inevitable toxic matches, you will occasionally find yourself in some games that can be pretty enjoyable. But I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer adding too much value to the game; the focus is definitely on the campaign.\n\nIn summary, I would say that Bioshock 2 is a very good game, although perhaps not quite as masterful as the original. It is strongly tied to its predecessor, and so it would probably be best to play both if you want to get the full experience. But either way, most established FPS/RPG gamers should be fully able to enjoy this game, especially fans of strong narratives and intriguing atmospheres.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","March 18","true","40.4"," 110 of 116 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","110","116","7","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/8850/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Bioshock 2 was set up almost from the onset to be a colossal failure. It was to follow one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time, by a different developer, with the inclusion of a seemingly tacked on multiplayer mode to a series that had absolutely no need for one. It had every possibility to be a disaster, which makes it almost shocking that it arrived in a state that was not only comparable to the original game, but improved and expanded on it as well in ways that would be hard to go back from. It’s the sequel I never expected; maybe nobody did.\n\nAnd important distinction to make before discussing Bioshock 2’s narrative, is that the first game was first and foremost the story of the city of Rapture and its fall into madness through its own attempts to create a lawless utopia. In comparison, 2 is almost entirely focused around a very small cast of key characters; their relationships to each other, conflicting ideals, and eventual goals which clash with each other and create this very personal, self contained narrative, within which Rapture is merely a setting instead of the star.\n\nIn some ways this is a good thing. By taking the focus off of Rapture and onto a new, very small collection of characters, developer 2K Marin is able to craft a more personal narrative, spending more time developing the characters that matter and the relationships between them. In other ways, it makes the time not spent directly advancing the plot far less impactful and memorable than they may otherwise have been. Characters outside the very core plot are introduced and then discarded in ways that feel contrived and unmemorable, moving you along but never leaving much of an impact outside of your immediate encounters with them. This also contributes to Rapture being a much less interesting, tangible place to explore, feeling stale and lifeless when at one point it was remarkably well crafted and intriguing.\n\nOn the whole, the narrative is rather significantly less mentally stimulating, disregard the deeper themes of ideology, morality, and freedom that gave the original such an astounding sense of scope and inspired so much discussion about the different ideas laced within the game. Bioshock 2 tries to mimic what Irrational Games did so deftly, but it comes out as something superfluously intelligent; tossing about grand ideas in the background of a fairly simple plot that never attempts more than it can feasibly accomplish. Simplicity isn’t a bad thing by nature, as the story is still engaging and arguably easier to follow, but I rather missed the more sophisticated philosophical questions posed by the original that was so substantially more contemplative and inspired.\n\nThe change to a strictly linear world design was also rather disappointing to me, as though there are logical narrative reasons you wouldn’t be able to return to locations after you went through them, it’s yet another thing taken away from the original that causes Rapture to feel like a rather hollow environment. It’s still full of the same distinctive artwork, excellent sense of place, and fitting music, but it feels so soulless compared to what it once was that it makes returning to Rapture again almost dull at times. There are things later on which actually add interesting, fundamental aspects to the city’s lore, but by that point it’s almost too late and the moment will likely be lost or overlooked by most.\n\nWhether the changes are improvements or make up for what was lost is debatable, though by and large the plot failed to leave the impression the original did, despite being well written and interesting in its own right. Perhaps its the issue of being in the shadow of such a monumental achievement that was Bioshock, that anything to come after that isn’t as incredibly feels significantly more of a disappointment that it otherwise would. Had 2 been released as in a vacuum I may have been more receptive to what it was attempting to do, but with the weight of its predecessor on its shoulders there was just - something - missing to draw me in quite the same way as I was to the original.\n\nWhere 2 far surpasses the original though is through the numerous refinements and additions it makes to the mechanics, turning Bioshock from a brilliantly deep and satisfying shooter, into a smoother, even deeper shooter that streamlines and polishes off the few rough edges of the original. The core of the combat is largely unchanged, utilizing a mixture of firearms and plasmids (essentially superpowers) to take down a variety of different splicers (the enemies of the game), but the introduction of dual wielding, the ability to instantly switch ammo types, a collection of interesting new weapons, a significantly faster and less cumbersome hacking system,  and a scaled back but even more customizable tonic (passive upgrades) system do a lot to make Bioshock 2 a much faster and enjoyable experience.\n\nThey’re small changes for the most part to be sure, but collectively add up to a much tighter shooting experience that makes it hard for me to imagine returning to the comparatively clunky original. Encounters with the most prominent new enemy, Big Sisters, is another brilliant twist on something the original began (in this instance the Big Daddy fights, which also return), as quicker, more capable and powerful enemies that present a large challenge and require you change your tactics as they are far more versatile and aggressive than their older counterparts.\n\nThese improvements make Bioshock 2 one of the most enjoyable and dynamic shooters I’ve ever played. Where it falters in its storytelling and world building, it makes up for with the sheer entertainment to be found in its combat, which only grows as the game goes on. It might not wholly surpass the original, but it surely approaches it in a lot of ways, which is something I scarcely imagined there was any possibility it could. In some ways it feels more akin to an update than an entire new experience, but when that update is so fun and smartly designed I can't complain.\n\nOn multiplayer…\nSurprising though it may be, 2K has fitted a multiplayer mode within Bioshock 2, and even more unexpectedly it’s not terrible! More than that, it’s actually a rather enjoyable mode that while totally derivative of every other first-person multiplayer shooter in terms of modes, progression, and character customization, it transposes the campaigns fantastic shooting into a multiplayer mode almost entirely intact. Your weapons and abilities might be slightly neutered, but the combat is so strong at its core that I found myself spending a surprising amount of time with the mode and enjoying every moment of it. Bioshock as a shooter is almost completely unreplicated in any other game, so having that in a multiplayer mode that even in every other aspect is fairly uninteresting is rather compelling, and most certainly worth checking out despite its dubious inclusion.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","October 23, 2014","true","13.2"," 94 of 105 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","94","105","5","2"

There are different endings you can achieve depending on how you play the campaign.  Also, the storyline (which will not be spoiled) is the 'at the end of your seat' game play we all enjoy.  The map tends to be large which gives you countless options on new places to explore.  Bioshock 2 is a wonderfully gripping sequal.\n\nThe first detail I would like to talk about is the replay value.  If you have read some of my other reviews, then you would know I talk about this a lot.  Replay value, to me, really makes a game worth your money.  As you may know, Bioshock is known to have different endings which rely on choices you make in the game.  There are multiple decisions you need to make throughout the game.  Some of those decisions are more difficult than the others.  To really get your money's worth out of this game, you should play to get every ending.  This will require many hours of game play, but each time you play it will seem like a brand new game.  There is also another game mode you can play called the 'Protector Trials'.  I am going to put this the best way I can.  Its hard.\n\nAnother point I would like to make on Bioshock 2 is the storyline.  Bioshock 2 is considered a "weak" sequel to many people.  Although it is not as good as the first, it was a necessary sequal to the series.  Bioshock 2 focuses on the desperate power grab for the keys to Rapture.  I don't really want to spoil anything so I will leave it at that.\n\nFinally, I would like to address the map.  You can expect as much exploration in Bioshock 2 as the first Bioshock (a lot).  There are many secondary objectives and secret rooms just waiting to be found.  You can almost here their faint sceams.. "Find me.  Please... find me."  This is another reason why I think it has great replay value.  By exploring the map to the fullest, you will be greatly rewarded in more ways than one.  One thing that you should not expect to change in this game is potential exploration.  The map is a maze and you are the mouse.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable with countless hours of possible game play.  Although it may not be as good as the first, it is still a clear Bioshock game.  There is still a 'horror' factor involved with the murderous splicers (as in the first game).  This game is definitely worth the time and money as long as you pay attention and find the cules.  I hope this review helped anyone thinking about buying this game.  If this did not help, then let me know by posting a comment.\n\nI made the overall review a bit short to help people out with the common problem of crashing.  To “fix” the game crashing and you losing your progress, save the game every couple of minutes.  The beginning is the main place the game will crash.  Once you get about 15 minutes into the game, the crashing should not be a problem.  If you need more help on how to fix it, then post a comment and I will do my best to help you out.","August 13, 2015","true","34.8"," 74 of 83 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","74","83","7","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/giantcommunistrobot/recommended/8850/","giantcommunistrobot","Carlos Danger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/giantcommunistrobot/","108 products in account","Bioshock 2 is viewed as the black sheep of the "Shock" franchise, created as a cheap cash-in sequel by a different development team that crafted the first Bioshock.  But beyond the initial impressions from fans and critics lies a very competent game, that in some spots actually outshines the original.\n\nGood Stuff:-The story is just as good, if not better, than the original.  Most people disliked the story because it didn't add much depth to the mythos of Rapture, but the story in Bioshock 2 is much more personal and is more about the citizens of Rapture than the city itself.\n-The gameplay is vastly improved.  Plasmids and Guns are duel wielded, making combining them in combat much easier.\n-Mechanics are streamlined, not simplified.  Gene tonics no longer have a type and can just be equipped, assuming you have the slots.  Hacking is now done in real time on a simplified  mini-game.  Even the research mechanic is reworked to use a video-camera that gives you more research points depending on how well you combo your plasmids/weapons.  There are also new weapons and plasmids that are fun to use and don't feel gimmicky.\n-The art design is top notch.  The level designers have fun showing what rapture would look like with 10 more years of rust and decay.\n-More moral decisions beyond "Save/Kill Little Sister".  The game also uses your decisions to inform the last act of the game and the ending.\n-Final "boss" fight is much better than the one in the first game.\n\nBad Stuff:-The first hour of the game stinks. Period.  After you get into the first real level, the game begins to open up and let you start having fun.\n-Some of the new characters have to be hand waved into existence, especially since they were supposed to be around before the first game but are clearly never mentioned in the first game.\n-Levels are much more linear and not as large as in the first game. There are few sidepaths, but mostly you'll be running from point A to B without backtracking.\n-There are a few new enemies but I would have liked more enemy variety.\n-You can use little sisters to gather Adam, but you have to protect them as they do it.  Most people hated the escort mission from the first game, so it's something to be aware of.   I personally enjoyed this part of the game due to the multitude of alternate amunition that makes setting up traps fun.\n-It's clear that there were some significant rewrites late in development, some characters introduced at the start of the game are simply left out of the rest of the game's plot.\n\nUgly Stuff:-The FoV is very low and requires ini-rebinding to reset it every time you launch the game.  The problem is going into ironsights also resets the FoV, making you have to press your bound key to reset your FoV every time.\n-Occasional issues with audio cutting out if there were too many sounds are playing at once.\n\nVerdict:Ignore people saying the game is a cheap cash in: the gameplay is better and arguably so is the story.  Although there are fewer levels than in the original, the game actually took me more hours to beat than the first game: around 14 hours.  It’s also interesting that a lot of the story beats and themes end up being used in Bioshock Infinite (although I’m sure Ken Levine hates to admit it).\n\nMinerva's Den is also an excellent add-on to the base game, and lasts around 3 hours.  I'd recommend playing through Bioshock 2 on hard mode if you've played many shooters before, the difficulty curve stays pretty good throughout the entire base game.  Minerva's Den is a bit harder on the same difficulty however, so keep that in mind.","August 22, 2015","true","34.0"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","49","51","0","2"

Not exactly a surprise given the content of other available reviews on Steam, but why is it good seems the more important thing, something I'll try to address here.  I'm going to tell you why I think BioShock 2 is a worthy successor in the series.\n\nFirst things first, to get right down to brass tacks BioShock 2 is a sequel, it is mostly more of the same gameplay (with a few twists) and the few innovations don't exactly break the bank in the inventiveness department.  A few new weapons and interesting plasmid variations and a small smattering of new enemy types don't do much to dispel the notion that the combat is totally more BiShock.  But that's not what makes a BioShock game, not really.  Sure, the combat has to be engaging enough to drive the narrative forward, but in this game it does that just enough.  No, much like the first, the true draw is the dark and twisted story, the narrative tapestry that shows the dark and twisted nature of those living in Rapture.\n\nThis game has you playing as a Big Daddy, the stalwart if myopic defenders of the Little Sisters.  In particular, you play a “prototype”, a nameless everyman changed into a monster but also a kind of father, and it is the theme of fatherhood that, like the first game, shares the roost with a political ideology to form the basis of the disastrous tale of the fall of Rapture.  Where the first game gazed on what genetics truly determine, on the pure unbridled force of Libertarianism and Capitalism, this game focuses on what it means to be a parent, and the equal sociopolitical dangers of a Communistic ideal that crosses the line into religious fervor.  It is the other side of the coin to Andrew Ryan's Rapture ideal of the individual's power in Rapture, the ideal of not just the social as one entity in a metaphorical manner, but what might happen if science could allow us all to actually become one.  And just as in the first game, the dangers of extremist politics show how such ideas can rip a society, and in particular a family apart.\n\nThis is the crux of the story: as the first game contained two father figures for the original protagonist, the Big Daddy is one of two parent figures presented in the game. Unlike before where you were being acted upon as a child with two parental figures, now you are one of the agents of change, and your actions effect the story in a more noticeable (if still superficial) manner.\n\nIt also drips the kind of scary, jarring atmosphere that is at once engaging to behold and terrifying to think about, the constructive and destructive nature of humankind.  Water drips, walls crack, but unlike before the underwater world outside Rapture is at least nominally explored, and it is beautiful, but sadly littered with the detritus of the once grand city.  The decay of the amazing city of Rapture is at once enthralling and disturbing, an emotional range that was demonstrated in BioShock, and is absolutely in full effect here.\n\nTo add to the positives Minerva's Den, a small DLC adventure contained within this game, is a wonderful look at how every last person in Rapture was hurt, changed, damaged by the vision of Andrew Ryan.  Rapture is a crucible and all it seems to produce is tragedy, and each game with it as it's setting allows us to see something of ourselves in it's tragedy.\n\nWith arresting visuals, a story just as dark as it's sibling, and the upgraded combat engine, this game is well worth the time.  It is the other side of the coin, the “2” in this case being a quite literal extension of the first, and that is a very good thing indeed.","November 23, 2014","true","27.4"," 50 of 55 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","50","55","3","0"

When that dictator decided you've been Wall-Flowering for too long, she has a bunch of her goons hypnotize you, before she makes you shoot yourself in the head, in front of said coma stopping little girl.\n\nIt's a pretty cheerful game.\n\nYou wake up for unknown reasons 10 years later, and the underwater city is in a point of decay. bits of ceiling are missing and rooms are flooding.

The political background is a little less clear (in my opinion), but the main storyline still compelling and tragic.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, elements like Gathering (especially the Protector Trials DLC) encourage you make use of traps and plasmids that you could largely ignore in Bioshock 1. On the other hand, this forced flexibility means you can't always rely on your favourite loadout for the most difficult set pieces in the game.\n\nMultiplayer is an exercise in futility. Assuming you're lucky enough to even find a game with enough players, a single griefer can wreck your whole experience. If you're trying to get all the achievements, take my advice and just play enough public games to have finished on every map (and won the DLC ones) and save a Little Sister, and then boost yourself to Level 50 on a private ADAM Grab map.\n\nSince the migration to Steam, game crashing is a real problem. There are things you can do to mitigate it (like upgrading your hardware), but save early, save often, save anyway. And if you do crash, go back TWO saves as there's a good chance the last one was corrupted.

You always save me from the monsters."\n\nBioshock 2 is the right choice for you if you like the first Bioshock.. If you wish it would never end.. If you really want to continue.. The gameplay doesn't change that much. Hacking system is now much faster but also harder because the game doesn't stop while you are hacking as it was before. But! In Bioshock 2 you don't have to switch between weapons and plasmids. You can have equipped both at the same time, which is probably the best gameplay change they made.\n\nGet used to the slow movement because you can't sprint anymore. Maybe it will make you feel little bit better if I tell you that you will be compensated somehow.. You will be able to walk on the bottom of the sea! ;)\n\nAtmosphere is great, filled with scary moments. Music makes them even scarier. It increases the tension. It makes you lookout for what is coming. It makes you so stressed that every single after death movement of a body will make your heart beat faster!\n\nDealing with little sisters can take much longer here, especially if you are interested in more ADAM. You can use every little sister for gathering more ADAM for you before you save(harvest) her. She will show you the way to the right body. You must protect her as she gathers. ADAM guaranteed. Meeting with big sisters also guaranteed. But that won't be that pleasant.. They scream too much for my taste.. ;)\n\nThe story is great.

Bioshock 2 tells the untold story of Subject Delta, the Big Daddy who broke free, the Big Daddy that everyone has turned against, and his relationship with a specific little sister of Rapture, Eleanor. 2K Games has designed a game that expands Bioshock's mythology, but doesn’t lose any of the mystery. A game that introduces fascinating new settings and characters, but doesn’t forget or neglect those previously established. A game that gives the player devastating new power, but balances that with devastating new fear. A game that takes chances and makes changes, but almost always for the better. Playing as a big daddy, Bioshock brings destructive and fast paced arcade combat with the help of creative plasmids, setting alight, lifting trash cans and hypnotizing every single big daddy you come across. But in this mysterious dystopia, exploration is key feature to the immersion and overall enjoyment of this title, whether it is the hunting of little sisters, being hunted by big sisters or the spamming of the 'search' button. Much like its predecessor, BioShock 2 is slower and more methodical than your average shooter, but combat feels much more natural and effective than it ever did before. But I never said it would be easy.......nononononono. Being a Big Daddy sure does make you a badass but at the same time a vulnerable slow target that is very well suited to the games strengths. Rapture is a dark, dismal world that envelopes you with a blanket of isolation, excellent art direction, a great soundtrack, and a fantastic voice cast all team up with a powerful story to create an atmosphere so thick and intense that it is at times downright chilling.","January 7, 2014","true","9.1"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","38","43","0","0"

The plot is compelling: an equal quality in the narrative will find it very difficult in another first-person shooter and the progress in the adventure can stimulate the player's attention by offering something new, it's a weapon, a plasmid or unusual setting particularly well. But problems remain: the game does not excel technically and many of the additions in the gameplay, as the underwater sections, leave the time they find.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8850/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nBioShock 2 is a First Person Shooter sequel to BioShock, the second game was released  3 years after the original (Release date: Feb 9,  2010). The game feels very much like you've returned to the city "Rapture" for more game play, however events are taking place about 10 years after those that transpired in BioShock 1.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Welcome back to Rapture, please keep your arms, legs, and morality inside your big daddy suit the whole time and enjoy the ride! Jesting aside, this game is dark and twisted... which is what most people seem to love about it.\nIn this game you play as a "Big Daddy" (Basically the guy you see on the cover art, big armored behemoths) named Delta who is searching for his "little sister" (those little girls with the red demon eyes) named Eleanor.\nJust like in the last game as you play you unlock new abilities, weapons, upgrades for your weapons, and ("force skills that require that blue stuff" Sorry, I can't help myself) Plasmids that require EVE to use. The game is very linear with no going backwards through levels, the game is rather challenging (unless you relish huge challenges, in that case this game is probably too passive for you. Basically the difference in difficulty is just how hard your enemies hit, not AI difficulty etc.)\n\nGame Play: Controls for this game are standard, the big difference between 1 and 2 is that you can keep more passive abilities called "Gene Tonics" active. There are a couple new weapons and a handful of new Gene Tonics.\nThe starting weapons are the same ones you had in BioShock1, I don't want to spoil any of the next weapons just know they're fun, but I tend to find myself sticking with the bread and butter weapons. There are new secondary ammo types, for several of the weapons. I won't lie, I really like setting traps.\nIt should be noted that I felt like I was playing in the exact same city, graphic-wise the whole city feels exactly the same with small changes. I don't like to talk about graphics in video games but for me this actually did feel like a continuation of the first BioShock Game.\n\nAchievements: There are three types of achievement categories in this game: single player main story, Multiplayer competitive, and DLC. At this time I'm still working on many of the achievements (12/17/14) I have a majority of the single player achievements, nothing unusual to report on these achievements. The multiplayer ones require playing until max online level, so that will be a bit of a grind, it is also oftentimes difficult to find people to play with (depends on the time of day). Lastly DLC achievements, which I have always felt is a cheap way to get more life out of a game. (Blame the sims3 and EA, okay? That's why I'm so cynical about paying for DLC. haha)\n\nPrice:  BioShock 2 is priced at $19.99, I acquired my copy from a Humble Bundle, so as usual I recommend getting the game on a steam sale or in a humble bundle. Since this is an old game, if you don't already own it I recommend waiting for a 75% off or better sale.\nAs far as quality is concerned, I have 14 hours in this game and about half of the achievements, I think it's close to a good buy if you're just playing through the game once, if you're going to play on a higher difficulty, or through the game multiple times this game is a very good quality.\n\nConclusion: Story = Awesome. Game Play = Effortless, natural and fluid to play. Achievements = Meh...could be better. Price = Fair. This game tends to appeal to people who like First person shooters and story games, with the addition of multiplayer it could appeal to the competitive crowd but there aren't nearly as many people actively playing.\nI recommend this game for people who like darker stories, and tend to enjoy first person shooters, regardless of their difficulty. Rapture will warp your perceptions of "right and wrong"; as always, I've been impressed by the story.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update April 10, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock\nHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock Infinite","December 17, 2014","true","14.7"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","19","23","4","6"

There are fewer stand-out moments like these in Bioshock 2, but the moments that do stick with you are so well conceived and unbelievably well-executed, that they surpass those of the original\n\nThe biggest change made to Bioshock 2's gameplay comes from the fact that this time around you're playing as a Big Daddy, but not just any Big Daddy, you play as the first Big Daddy, a prototype called 'Subject Delta'.\n\nOverall: If you are a fan of Bioshock you can not miss Bioshock 2.

Hacking is finally fun, even if a little easier. Exploring rich philosophies and thoughtful characters and their visions, motives, fates is the game's main driving force, because the gameplay becomes boring after first two hours, because you are swimming in ammunition (just like in the first game with the exception that here it comes too early to be forgivable) and new genetic modifications that are inspired and original though absolutely useless cannon fodder from the gameplay view. Again the same technical problems as the first one, only a little worse. The story, the world and the characters are very well done and that's what BioShock is really about. Lack of Ken Levine here, will surely be compensated by Infinite, that will maybe even surpass the original.","July 28, 2011","true","67.5"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

To me this is centred on the main characters' unbreakable bond to his 'little sister' Eleanor, for which he would do anything to find and protect. There is also a sorrow and sadness to Rapture, the underwater city the game is set in. The ruined state of the city is captured in superb detail, and the glimpses throughout the many windows of the ocean add to this atmosphere. The diaries of some of the characters help to pull you even more into this immersive world.\nIn Bioshock 2, the enemies were a lot more varied, in both their model and in how they could attack you. Also you could choose who lives and dies out of characters other than little sisters, giving you a greater feeling of involvement in the story and its progression.\nThe music in Bioshock 2 cannot be overlooked either, and is used to great effect in places to give the 'retro' feel to Rapture. The sorrowful sounding string-quartet in the background during some scenes turns them into truly breathtakingly sad moments.\nNow add to all of this the gameplay, which is seamless and natural, complimenting rather than obscuring the storyline and mood of Rapture.\n","May 14","true","10.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","0"

Not very often does a sequal come by that impresses and wins over an original games audience. Lets face it, Bioshock 2 is a cash in on the success of Bioshock. Despite this, it does not fail as game, nor as a sequel.\n\nThe overall gameplay of this game is far superier to that of the original. The weapon variety maybe not as diverse, and the weapon designs do not change drastically like the original, but still good weapons nonetheless. I mean, what other game can you play as zeus in a metal diving suit, with a gatling gun? In addition to this, the balence is better, the research process is better thought out, plasmids are not stupidly OP anymore, and you can actually get some neat tonics and upgrades to your Big Daddy. The little sister and escort sections are not tedious anymore either, they offer a nice break from the monotony of the main story. This is broken up with some nice tea parties with  former co-workers of yours, and some swims in the community fish tank. The games pacing is fluid from beginning to end, and does not chug at any point, unlike the original.\n\nOriginally, my main criticism of Bioshock 2, is that it did not have that "AHA" moment the original had. Well lets just say that the DLC Mirvenas Den solves that problem. Everything I thought Bioshock 2 was lacking, that DLC contained. What it did, is offered that "AHA" moment that made the original so good. At first, I thought the DLC ending would be generic and terrible, only to find out the big plot twist at the end. This twist, along with the ending area/cutscene, offers a conclusive end to the rapture experiance. It finally wraps up the city in a satisfying way, something, neither game alone could do.\n\nIn short, this game improves upon even facet of the original, maybe not to a shine, but certainly to some degree, and offers a conclusive ending to the original Bioshock series/Rapture. Giving this God-Forsaken underwater dystopia, finally a sense of peace.","March 20, 2014","true","25.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ozziearcane/recommended/8850/","ozziearcane","Ozzie Arcane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ozziearcane/","420 products in account","I previously did a written review on Bioshock 1 in 2012 which can be found at...\nhttp://planetarcane.blogspot.com/2012/11/backlogged-gaming-bioshock.html\n\nThat might help explain some of my thoughts on the basic premise before talking about Bioshock 2 itself. Now I know this game got a lot of flack when it came out. Both over the fact that it had multiplayer and that many felt it didn't live up to the previous game.\n\nI actually have to say I disagree on the second point. I enjoyed the story MORE in Bioshock 2 then I did in Bioshock. At a first glance the idea of playing as a Bid Daddy, these hulking monsters seems a tad absurd. But when you stop to think about it, they're not really monsters. They used to be human. Made all the more clear and horrifying in that opening cutscene where the Antagonist mind controls Delta before making him remove his helmet and shoot himself in the head all while we watch the event through his eyes. No I don't consider that a spoiler, it is literally the first scene in the game.\n\nThe first game makes you stop and think about actions in games. How we just do what the game tells us. Bioshock 2 takes a pair we basically just saw as objects in the game previously A Big Daddy and his Little Sister, then put us in the shoes of the Big Daddy. But not just any Big Daddy, one who has had his Little Sister taken from him. His entire reason for living, not to mention being separated basically puts his life on a timer.\n\nAnd while I won't spoil it, the ending did bring me to tears. I can't deny that. But much like the first game IMO this one also suffers greatly from all the space in between the major story sections. After the opening, there isn't much that happens that is very memorable until close to the end of the game.\n\nI also found it weird that despite the situation your character is in, the game still expects you to kill other Big Daddies and take their Little Sisters for you own in order to make yourself stronger. Seems a bit contradictary to the main story.\n\nI can't actually comment on the multiplayer aspect of the game, not for lack of trying. I literally could not get a match started, there doesn't seem to be much of anyone playing online anymore.\n\nOverall I'd say it's an average game with an above average story. If you liked the first game and avoided this one because of reviews, you might want to reconsider IMO.","October 2, 2014","true","17.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","2"

I personaly started out not being able to get into the game and could only get myself to play 23 hours at a time (also do to the crashes this game is known for) but then at some point I was hooked and could'nt put it down. The story picks up around the middle and becomes extremely challenging and a lot of fun with coloful characters to fight and get help from and playing as a Big Daddy made a hige difference in the play style of the game. The game looks beautiful just like the first and lets you explore a much different side of Rapture and they also added a bit of religious undertones to the game which I think were an amazing addition because it added to the story a lot without making something a huge part that you were confused if you missed.\nThe only negative to this game is that on PC it crashes a lot and will induce a ton of rage but other than that perfection again.\n10/10","January 3, 2015","true","34.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbuttman/recommended/8850/","thisisbuttman","Buttman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbuttman/","480 products in account","BioShock 2, the very definition of a misunderstood sequel!\n\nAnd so here I was, about 4 years after I played the original BioShock for the first time (the one on steam was the second) and was left amazed by the marvellously haunting underwater world and history of Rapture, the time had come to see how the story moved on.\n\nTruth be told, I am by nature negatively biased towards sequels of great games, since the result rarely is on par with the originals.\nAt the same time, from online reviews and friends opinions I was expecting a generally mediοcre sequel, not really bad, but a lot inferior.\n\nWhat I got instead was a great game that was a lot reminiscent of its predecessor and that at the same time managed to put it's own touch and distinguish itself from it!\n\nThe game is vastly big, since, except from its main single player story, which is already long enough to be comparable to the first one's, it also includes a multiplayer campaign, plus two more DLCs, so let me analyze them one by one!\n\n- The single player campaign, for starters: you start out as a Big Daddy (an older model of it actually), with it's two trademark weapons (the drill and the rivet gun) and the ability to escort Little Sisters at their ADAM gatherings, which I found to be a really nice idea to stand out from the first game, since it gave you the opportunity to see the world from a different perspective.\n\nThe story is a bit confusing at first, you don't know who you are and what you are doing and I'll admit that, while I initially liked that, as the game progressed on this "amnesia" of sorts got a bit tiresome, since it prevented you from enjoying the story and its (small) twists.\n\nThe first game was ahead in that aspect, since it made you start out pretty much confident about who you were and what you were doing, only to destroy that all at its half, with an amazing twist, one of the best of its kind. However the remaining half of the original BioShock wasn't as thrilling as the first one, though it definitely wasn't bad, just decent.\n\nNow, BioShock 2 took another route, to the end of the game you get to know very few things about the protagonist, as, little by little, you learn something more, all until the final levels, where the big twist kicks in and you find all the truth about yourself! The twist was, maybe, just a little inferior from the one of the first game, but it was still very good.\n\nContinuing on, aside from the story, the game made some great additions in the gameplay, that improved a lot the old one. For starters, the weapons/plasmids system was positively changed a bit, making them easier to handle, while at the same time new weapons and plasmids were added, greatly differentiating themselves from the older ones.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, when I first played Dishonored (another great game) I remember describing it as a "stealth based BioShock", well... upon playing BioShock 2 I found even more similarities to Dishonored than the first game and not just in gameplay, but storywise too (ie, in Dishonored you have to save a little girl named Emily and in BioShock 2 one named Eleanor). After all, Arkane Studios was involved in the making of both games, so that probably played its part. However, there too, Dishonored took it's own distinctive path, so I wouldn't call it a ripoff, in fact it even improved on many of these similarities that I noticed between said games (like a fast teleporting plasmid present in BioShock 2's multiplayer, named Aerodash, which was a lot similar to the vastly superior Blink ability in Dishonored... and how much I missed that ability in BioShock 2... ).\n\nMoving on, aside from the improved weapon and plasmid mechanics and some new splicers, BioShock 2 introduced an amazing foe: the Big Sister, who essentially was an evolution of the Big Daddy! I found them great for a change in the game's world, since they were really tough to beat and getting ready to "greet" them was scary enough, sometimes (I even remember getting ready to fight one and getting my ♥♥♥ kicked, only to be saved by, not one, but two cluelessly walking Big Daddies, that, upon being caught in the Big Sister's attacks, started attacking her as well, saving my lucky self!).\n\nAnother big change in the gameplay was the ability to "wirelessly" hack machines, a change which I ended up really appreciating, despite the hack being done in real time, with enemies potentially attacking you.\n\nThe graphics and soundtrack were, more or less, similar to the first's, with the former being slighly improved, but nothing too great. In itself that was a good thing, since it made the game stay closer to its predecessor.\nThe game's levels dimensions were also changed, since the first game had many levels split in two parts (maybe because of limitations PCs had at that time), while BioShock 2 had 9 huge levels, which I mistakenly thought to be few at first, though being slightly smaller in total.\n\nLastly, the game's main antagonist wasn't as thrilling as the two ones of the original BioShock, but she was good enough.\nThankfully the final levels, upon learning your true identity and onwards, were quite good and action packed, so much that they even provided you with a great ally, which I won't spoil and I'll let you discover for yourself (for a single level you also got to play as a Little Sister, which was cool)!\nThe ending was, once again, faithful to the original, where some of your choices in the game affected its outcome (much like in Dishonored, too).\n\n- Changing subject, I'll now go to the multiplayer campaign: overall, I didn't feel satisfied by it and that being because the game had some, difficult enough, multiplayer achievements, while at the same time it was not optimized well enough, resulting in a lot of lag (myself aside, I found others having the same problem too) and in almost empty lobbies, making the achievement hunt quite frustrating.\n\nHowever, that said, the multiplayer part was not all bad, it's gameplay was in fact quite good and balanced (though not entertaining enough) and it took part in a period before the events of the first BioShock, during Rapture's civil war, making it a bit more interesting.\n\n- And to the final part, we get to the game's two DLCs: the Protector Trials and Minerva's Den.\n\nThe first one was not much related to the main story, but not totally unrelated too.\nOnce again reminding me of Dishonored's first DLC (Dunwall City Trials), it comprised of many challenges were you once again assumed the role of a Big Daddy and had to protect a Little Sister during her ADAM gatherings, but with a specific set of weapons and plasmids each time, making the whole thing fun enough, while mixing just a bit of story in it and awarding you with some extra art and trailers of BioShock 2, for every succesful gathering you made.\n\nThe second DLC was, instead, a continuation of the story and ended up being really good and long just enough to keep your interest on. You once again took the role of a Big Daddy with a mysterious story on its back, immersing yourself in the game's levels to find it out, all of this happening in another, unexplored, part of Rapture, with new weapons and enemies mixed in (the Ion Laser gun being its coolest addition).\nThe DLC's ending was good enough, with the final twist being slightly more predictable than the main game's, but not too much, while at the same time providing a good closure to the world of Rapture.\n\nAll in all, I found BioShock 2 to be a fantastic game and only slightly inferior to the original, most of it being due to the fact that you were already introduced and familiar to the world of Rapture from the latter. Hopefully the third game, BioShock Infinite, will manage to reignite the marvel of discovering a hidden city, this time in the sky (can't wait to play it as well)!\n\nBut don't let that frighten you, since you are once again in for a Shock, so... would you kindly play BioShock 2?","April 13","true","114.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

Mechanicly, it's equally as impressive (and in some parts, more so) than its predecessor. Of course after having played the first (and the first being one of my favorite games, period), the mystique of Rapture is worn just a bit, however that doesn't make it any less of an awe inspiring enviroment. The story, whilst lacking a "game about games" meta narrative (at least, from what I could pick up), is still well written and superbly delivered. The game is also as good looking as the first. The visuals as well as the haunting orchestral score create a tense and decrepit atmosphere that completely absorbed me, just as the first game did.

It's all in there.\nThe main differences being first off how this\ninstallment is not as free roaming as the first\ngame was, where you could move between the areas.\nIn this sequel, you have to make sure you've done\nall you want to do in a level before you move on,\nbecause there is no chance going back once you do.\nThen you have the so called Big Sisters, a new\nenemy that will make Big Daddies seem like a 90\nyear old, compared to Bruce Lee.\nNot only are you merely playing as a Big Daddy,\nyou can also do his main-duty of adopting Little\nSisters and protecting them, while they collect\nADAM from corpses to give you more.\n\n\nControls:\n\nNot much to say, the controls are fluent.\nI can't see anything amiss in them, there are\nslightly more features than in the first game.\n\n\nMusic:\n\nIt's music includes old real life classics, a new\ncollection of course, mostly in the Jazz genre.\nYou can tell from the background music when a\ntough enemy is on the way, it gets dramatic.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are done exactly in the same delicate\nway like in the first game, having great water and\nfire effects.\n\n\nStory:\n\nTakes place 10 years after the first game, which\nshould then be 1969. You are a Delta model of a\nBig Daddy, having been shot dead, but resurrected\nand stored within a Vita Chamber by your own\nLittle Sister, this back in 1959.\nThe 10 years pass, and you awake with your goal\nof reunite with your, now grown up, Little Sister.\n\n\nBug and Drawback Listing:\n\n*Random crashing, which is the most common issue\nyou may experience when playing. It may differ\non exactly how it happens, depending on who you\nask. For me, the game just shut down without any\ninformation at all, close to 20 times in total\nduring my whole playthrough.\n\n*Hits on enemies just refuse to register alot\nof times while in battle. This occurs often if\nthe enemy is doing some kind of animation while\nyou hit it, and is therefor seen mainly on Houdini\nSplicers and Alpha Series, as they are using alot\nof graphical effects. But sometimes even a slow\nwalking Ledhead Splicer at distance, can somehow\nbe invulnerable, the shots will just go through\nwhilst leaving its impact on the wall behind.\nThis leaves little to no use for the improved\nzoom upgrade to the speargun for example.\nIt feels like the game design was primarly aimed\nfor the player going for the drill and plasmids.\nWhile the gun selection is showing a great mix,\nthe hit registration sometimes drags it down.\n\n*Enemies can suddenly spawn out of thin air.\nThis causes a problem if you have cleared a room\nand are setting up traps for a planned battle.\nSuddenly random enemies can spawn behind your\nback and trigger your traps that you have put time\nand effort on for a upcoming fight.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm afraid I can't recommend this specific port\nversion of the game.\nBy purchasing this, you are putting it all up to\nchance.

Some time after it came out, I saw it was getting spit on and dismissed, but I didn't really pay attention to that, as I assumed it was the all too well known kneejerk reaction of the smug fanboy portion of the players.\nI got it and went in unbiased. I don't want to compare it to the others in terms of which I think is best, because I love them all separately and as a whole, but it does quite a few things better than the other two titles. What I can say is, I think 2 had the best combat out of the games, because there were so many possibilities, especially with the dual-wielding and the plasmid trap combos. That's not to say I think the combat in 1 or Infinite wasn't good; in fact, I liked it in both games, although less in Infinite. Of course, the latter had a variety of Vigor and weapon combos as well, but not nearly as big as 2.\nBioShock 2 also improved on many mechanics like the Camera, plasmid use, hacking, Little Sister interactions, upgrading, as well as things like the visuals and more. However, what I most love about it is the bond I felt with Eleanor and how my actions actually changed her character and demeanor. I really wanted to help her, I wanted her to be safe. And seeing the statues of me rescuing the NPCs through the Little Sister's eyes really made me emotional, as did the whole Little Sister adoption and subsequent saving mechanics. It was so touching to see how playing a merciful, forgiving Delta changed how the NPCs reacted to you and pretty much established you as the most human character in the game, even though you were, as Sinclaire roughly put it, a "tin man". And who can forget the Big Sister fights? They were the ultimate test for your skills, weapons, plasmids. And the ending monologue Eleanor does for the best ending, as well as that pan of Rapture with the main theme of the first game and her saying, "And then, Father, the Rapture dream was over." Man. That was one of the several moments in the game where I teared up and felt introspective about the whole (at the time) BioShock world.\n"The Ocean On His Shoulders". How fitting indeed.\nI really like Lamb as a villain as well, because she was so different, yet almost as well-designed as Andrew Ryan in some aspects.\nI was invested all the way throughout BioShock 2, as I was with 1 and Infinite. I went in without prejudice and I got one hell of a good game out of it, so I can strongly recommend it.","February 26, 2014","true","66.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is a great and unique game that actually made me fall in love with Rapture. Some minor spoilers ahead.\n\nThe level design is superb. Set ~10 years after the end of BioShock, this game features Rapture that now truly became a sunken Babylon, beautiful and forlorn, mysterious and sad. The small underwater parts are a nice touch, I've always wanted to be able to travel the ocean floor! And the part where you are seeing Rapture through the eyes of the Little Sister is also perfect and very creepy, and it adds to the story a lot.\nAnd the story itself fits the setting perfectly, and is as interesting and rich as the BioShock's one, or even more so (it's hard to judge but BioShock2 had larger impact on me personally). There are more moral choices you make through the game (a man chooses! *wink wink*), and it helps you to immerse into the narrative, and the narrative reacts to these choices (frankly, hearing Sinclair say 'so a tin man had a heart of gold' made me tear a little). The music and voices are very good too.\n\nGameplay is simply the best throughout the series. You have 8 different weapons/gadgets and 11 plasmids in 8 possible slots, and you can combine some of them (trap+elemental plasmids), and you also use security devices (dear flying bots, Alexander and Diego and Sean and Thoroughfare and Diana and the others I remember each and everyone of you you were my FRIENDS thank you oh I'm gonna cry now), and there are some physical upgrades of various types, and the fully upgraded plasmids felt POWERFUL. The controls and the map demand some getting used to but are handy overall (I hated plasmid/weapon change in BioShock and, though it is perfectly reasonable, having only 2 weapons and a few physical enhancements in Infinite seemed rather restrictive, also, having NO MAP was a nightmare). Some say that guarding Little Sisters while they gather ADAM seems repetitive but I actually liked this kind of challenge - it was fun (with a right touch of nervousness) to prepare the location for the splicers attack using traps and other countermeasures.\n\nOverall, I loved the bathysphere atmosphere of the game a lot. There are fewer outright scary moments than in BioShock, but the place itself seems... haunted. Dark, and lonely, and dying, and mutating. Babylon turning into Leviathan.\nCan you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?\nCan you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?\nWill he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?\n\nPlay it. Obey. OBEEEEY! Ahem. No, really, try it. Open the seashell and swallow the pearl.

The singleplayer was great and I\'d definitely give it a shot if you haven\'t played it yet. It\'s pretty much like the first game, but with improved gameplay. The Multiplayer is gay though. Here\'s why.\n\nFirst of all, it is one of the most unbalanced multiplayer games of all time. New players aren\'t going to stand a chance because they don\'t know how the game works and all the cheap tatics the experienced players use, and they don\'t have good equipment. It\'s completely unfair. The best weapons I would recommend from my experience are the grenade launcher with any upgrade, except homing grenades, the elephant gun with the quad barrel upgrade for headshots, the crossbow with the rate of fire upgrade, or you could use any other upgrade for headshots. I\'d recommend the pistol with any upgrade if you have good aim. You also can\'t go wrong with the shotty. My favorite plasmids are electrobolt to stun opponents(works great with headshots), Aero Dash to get around faster and to confuse your opponents. Dash can also get you out of electro-stuns, fire,bees and away from turrets. Telekinesis is probably the best plasmid. It can catch grenades and arrows, freeze players for a second and make insta-kills with it. Winter Blast is good too because it can slow players so you can get some good shots on them. Incinerate also works great with the grenade launcher. The gene tonics I always use are eve saver, fast feet and head hunter. I wouldn\'t use head hunter if you\'re not planning to make headshots with the grenade launcher or crossbow. Practice and experimenting with new loadouts and seeing which ones you like best will make you a good player. If you have the patience to play until you unlock all these things then my hat\'s off to you. But really, the unlocking system this game uses makes it hard for new players to enjoy and keep playing this game.\n\nThe other huge problem with this game is all the bugs, glitches and the overall way it is set up. The game suffers from neglect by its developers. The game often lags and crashes due to the player-to-player hosting it uses. There\'s nothing you can do about a bad host or a rage quitter other than ask them to rejoin or wait for them to leave or just start a new lobby if you can get enough players. The game also doesn\'t have any type of protection against cheaters, spammers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Unfortunately, there are lots of those players, so all you can really do to avoid playing with them is wait for them to leave or start a private game and hope they won\'t find a way in. It doesn\'t even have a mute option. By the way, if you\'re using a microphone and it\'s making noise in the game, please turn it it down. You can do this by going to Steam Settings, voice, and turn the slider all the way to the left. Please, nobody wants to have to listen to your ♥♥♥♥ while they\'re playing.\n\n\nIt\'s an old game. The devs didn\'t put a lot of work into it.  It\'s small and needs more guns and new things, but most of all, it needs A LOT of work. Hopefully one day 2K or someone will remember this game and fix it, but that\'s probably never going to happen. I\'d try this game if you want something different.\n\n","May 31","true","911.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","3"

The game is too prone to crashing, and when that happens, a Vita-Chamber won't save you. The first time I played it I could put with all of this, but a replay is not worth the issues.

The game itself is good. It may be the weakest installment in the Bioshock franchise to date, but the weakest installment of an amazing series is still pretty great. The reason I decided to say "no" is because of the amount of crap I had to go through just to get the game to play. I have about 16 hours of playtime logged, and I'm willing to bet a good half of it was spent troubleshooting, checking to see if various fixes worked, replaying segments and sometimes entire levels... it got old, fast. For a game that's been out for so long to not have a single fix for everything is pretty inexcusable, especially one that you're expected to pay for. I ended up looking up various guides on Steam and 2K's support forum to get the game to work, uninstalling and reinstalling the game twice, uninstalling and reinstalling programs on my computer, tinkering with files, settings, and compatibility modes, even editing the .ini file itself. The most prominent issues I had were it constantly crashing shortly after starting the game (just when you get the rivet gun), on the loading screen to Siren Alley, the loading screen for Fontaine Futuristics, and near the end of the Fontaine Futuristics level. All of these required multiple attempts on my part to fix and finally finish.\n\nOn the other hand, my closest friend also has the Steam version of this game and reports not having the same problems. But for any game to give anyone this much problem, I wouldn't recommend spending your money on a roll of the dice to see whether or not it'll work (for the record, I had no problems with the original Bioshock, so don't assume that just because you played through that with no problems, you won't encounter issues here). It's truly upsetting that what could, and should, have been a pleasant, fun gaming experience turned into a frustrating nightmare, and as soon as I got to the ending, I uninstalled and washed my hands of it. Multiplayer? Other endings? Achievements? Forget about it, not worth the grief.\n\nIf you do decide to give it a shot (in which case I recommend a console version), here's what I thought, issues getting the game to run aside: like I said, it may be the weakest link in Bioshock's Great Chain, but that doesn't mean it's a total waste of time. A lot of the gameplay was simplified from the first game (such as hacking, researching, even the Tonics all being in one area instead of being in four categories with different slots you need to open), some undoubtedly for the better (it's telling hacking and researching didn't appear in Infinite) and some for the worst. There is the mechanic of carrying around Little Sisters and guarding them as they gather, akin to the ending of the first game only much faster and less frustrating (with tonics to maximize ADAM and speed up the process becoming available fairly early). However, there's up to three Little Sisters per level, and each one can gather up to twice. It's really up to you how you decides to handle them, as in the original, but the fact remains you're still going to have to throw down with a Big Daddy and you're still going to have to deal with them somehow if you want ADAM.\n\nThe main point that this game got a lot of flack for was the story. The game was, admittedly, a cash grab/attempt to keep the Bioshock name alive while Ken Levine and Take-Two/Irrational were working on Infinite, farmed out to 2K Marin. I, personally, think they did a decent enough job with what they had. The story lacked the symbolism and social commentary that made the first one so powerful, and a lot of the mystique and creepiness that Rapture had during the first outing is absent here. I won't even claim the story made total sense in the end (you pretty much need all the supplemental materials, including the dubiously canon novel Bioshock: Rapture by John Shirley, which did have input from Ken Levine, to make it close to solid). And, to quote the venerable Yahtzee, the original Bioshock's story didn't really need a direct sequel. But I wouldn't say the whole thing is a wash, either. For one thing, there's at least two moments in this game (I won't give spoilers) that I personally felt were some of the most powerful in the entire series to date.\n\nIt really seems like when they were at the drawing board, whether intentionally or not, 2K Marin got it in their head that in making a game that wasn't basically an exact rehash of the first, they needed to make it as different as possible, and ended up creating the original on Opposite Day. WHAT FOLLOWS ARE SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST GAME!\n\nWhereas in Bioshock, you play a man that starts out with nothing and gradually finds his purpose throughout the game, in Biooshock 2, the main character has lost everything, including his identity (he's a Big Daddy), and is on a desperate journey, whether out of compulsion or genuine concern, to reclaim the one thing he had left. Whereas Andrew Ryan was a staunch objectivist who constantly extolled the value of looking out for yourself and acting in your own self-interest, the main villain of this game, Sofia Lamb, is a collectivist, with a cult built around being utterly selfless and willing to lay down your life if it would better serve mankind as a whole. Throughout the first game, you're guided by a man who seems kind, helpful, and sincere, but ultimately betrays you and reveals you were an unwitting pawn in his grand plan all along. In Bioshock 2, you're largely guided by a man who is a confessed and mostly unrepentant sleezeball, who makes no secret of the fact that he's mostly using you as a means to get him out of Rapture as well so he can profit off of the technology there. As he knows his plans hinge on you achieving your goal, he's willing to play ball. And let me add that 2K Marin deserves some major props for making a character that is so slimy, yet ultimately charming and likable.\n\nAll in all, it's a fun game. You won't miss anything for skipping it, especially now that Infinite is out, and I personally wouldn't blame you if you decided to give it a pass and not bother with this slightly subpar installment in the franchise. But with 2K Marin now in charge of the franchise as a whole, it might be worth it if you're a fan of the series just to see how they've handled it in the past. Just, for the love of little yellow duckies, play it on a console and don't waste your time, money, and possibly hours of frustration trying to play the Steam version.","June 9, 2014","false","54.6"," 39 of 71 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","39","71","0","0"

I know a lot of the original Bioshock fans sulked it a bit for not being written by Levine and made by Irrational. But frankly, this sequel is very good on many points. First, and that's only my opinion, I find it way more "cinematographic" than the first one, so in a way, a bit more immersive, although the first really was a champion in that domain. It's also, still in my opinion, a bit more touching and stronger, in a matter of story and characters. Now for the gameplay, it's very similar to the first, exept for the glorious, simultaneous use of the weaponry (both Plasmids and weapons can be use at the same time).\nWhat else to say? You play as a Big Daddy so, by itself, this is a nice touch. :3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLe premier était déjà une expérience forte; mais je pense pouvoir m'avancer en disant que ce second opus mérite plus d'attention. Je sais que de nombreux fans du premier l'ont un peu boudé pour la simple raison qu'il n'était pas signé Levine et Irrational. Mais en toute franchise, cette suite est excellente sur tant de points.

I know a lot of the original Bioshock fans sulked it a bit for not being written by Levine and made by Irrational. But frankly, this sequel is very good on many points. First, and that's only my opinion, I find it way more "cinematographic" than the first one, so in a way, a bit more immersive, although the first really was a champion in that domain. It's also, still in my opinion, a bit more touching and stronger, in a matter of story and characters. Now for the gameplay, it's very similar to the first, exept for the glorious, simultaneous use of the weaponry (both Plasmids and weapons can be use at the same time).\nWhat else to say? You play as a Big Daddy so, by itself, this is a nice touch. :3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLe premier était déjà une expérience forte; mais je pense pouvoir m'avancer en disant que ce second opus mérite plus d'attention.

BioShock 2... The premise is the same as in the original-Rapture, the underwater 'utopia' turned into hell when things go south. This time, I realised the character plays a big daddy (which is a pain and difficult to handle in the original) which goes by the name 'Subject Delta'. The gameplay in this one was almost the same with the original, with some extra new features like 'rescuing' little sisters from other daddies and to choose whether to gather adam, save or harvest them. In a way, the choices that you made (as well as killing other characters) will affect the decision at the end.\n\nThe graphics is awesome as always along with great music. With some scenes where you get to go outside and stroll around underwater, the details (and items hiding there) are great.\n\nAs the game progresses, you are helped with a few characters along the way (e,g, Sinclair and Eleanor). You are also helped with the usual upgrades throughout the game and what surprises me is that the number of secondary plasmids are heaps more than the original! Combined with some new weapons, different hack systems, defensive games (while little sisters gathering adam-be quick little one! I'm already using plasmids to make you gather more and work faster!), great audio logs, and nonetheless great story.\n\nWell.. for the verdict...\nScore: 9.2/10\nWhile the fighting system had improved by leaps, it felt slightly... off. I couldn't explain exactly what, but I guess it was because of the high expectations of the original. I was expecting a bigger twist, and something that the original lack, satisfying finale.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game to play and a very good sequel try, knowing that numerous games failed to deliver on their sequel.","March 9, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/8850/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","To help put things in perspective, know that I first had completed Bioshock 1 and Infinite in my gaming lifetime. An odd order, yes. But it did help put things in perspective, both the evolution of the series as well as the reviews associated with it.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Bioshock 2 is a straight upgrade from 1. The looting and exploration is just as enjoyable as it was before, and bullet stock micromanagers will have a moderately satisfying day. The game isn't too hard, even on the highest difficulty. It may be rough to start out, as you don't have the Plasmids and Tonics yet that befit your playstyle. But as time passes on, you will be able to gather your bearings. As long as you somewhat try to use your ammo sparingly or at least wisely, you will have maximum ammo on most of your weapons, and your wallet will be full as well.\nA feature I've always liked, as money in this game isn't as much a currency as it is a resource which you can hold only a limited amount of. I've always admired how Bioshock's "Money" dynamic made it stand apart from many other shooters and RPG's and what not.\n\nWhen keeping visual design in mind, changing from a 'human splicer' in the predecessor to an 'alpha version Big Daddy' brings a visual change that really helps you immerse in the role. All the former weapons are present, but in bulky versions befitting what you are. The revolver is replaced with a Rivet Gun, but still fires just like it, the pump shotgun with a double barrel one and the crossbow with a spear launcher. It's a detail, but an important one.\n\nAs a Big Daddy, you are still tasked to defeat other Big Daddy's to lay claim on their LIttle Sister. With the new weaponry and evolved plasmids, this task has become much more interesting. Setting up traps and following your plan like a script will help you get some proper first blood damage in, and then you can finish off the bugger with your weaponry. A task that is still quite intimidating, as the melee Daddies still know how to quickly close in on you, and the ranged ones carry some very hefty firepower. Even as a Big Daddy yourself, you'll need to Tonic up before you can take a prolonged beating. Wits are still very much required.\n\nAnd these wits will serve you well, as now you can fullfill your role as Big Daddy when finally claiming a big sister. Beyond the options you had in the first game, you can also have the Little Sister harvest ADAM from specific corpses. Each little sister can only harvest twice, and there's always more corpses than can be used. So exploration for more ideal locations does pay off.\nWhich is where your trap laying skills yet again prove handy. Instead of taking on a mobile Big Daddy, you now need to strategically defend a stationary target while she drains adam. The act of draining seems to always attract a big crowd of Splicers. And it needs no explaining that the Splicer AI is well capable of ambushing you now if you think of cheesing it out.\n\nNot to mention the Big Sisters, who always come for you when all the Little Sisters in the level have been dealt with. They are pretty much twice as strong as a Big Daddy, much more agile and beat your face hard with an array of Plasmid skills. Being unprepared generally leaves you dead and beaten.\n\nBut worry not, because you've got a new wide array of new and/or improved Plasmids to help you defend. Whirlwind Trap alone is a poster boy of this, as you can now imbue Level 2 traps with any other Plasmid skill you have, adding a unique feature to the trap. Ranging from Shock and Fire, to Hypnotise traps. The latter is especially handy to place with a Little Sister, in case a Splicer reaches her. Send that f*cker right back to fight his friends, or into another trap.\n\nPretty much all Plasmids gain unique features with every level. But the Tonics get very interesting as well. Basic ones as Boozehound are now accompanied with reducing Eve usage, and there even is a Tonic in the late game where you can drastically reduce your Eve usage in return for only using your Drill (your new Melee weapon). I have tried the Melee build, using damage reduction and melee damage increase, and I can guarantee you that it's quite viable. Doing a Drill Charge (a skill the storyline will teach you) is very satisfying and lethal, although quite taxing on your Drill Fuel.\n\nSpeaking of the Story...It's a mixed feeling. Of course it's not as impressive as the first one was. That said, it would take exceptional work to make that even possible. The story isn't bad, and certainly gives you enough encouragement to go on, it's just not as good...\n\nWhich does explain why Infinite tried so hard to focus on it's story counterpart, sadly leaving behind some of the features we had loved the first two for.\n\nIf you liked Bioshock 1 and want more of it, this game is absolutely worth it. If you think Infinite couldn't get any better... well, maybe you'll like it less, but it might still be worth it to put some context to some of the Infinite DLC.\n\nAll in all I would say it's been a worthy successor, filling that Bioshock hunger I was having.","July 13, 2014","true","30.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

That's probably what you know about this game. Well, I for one say Bioshock 2 is great, worth playing and shouldn't be skipped. It feels more like a side story that takes place after than a true sequel but Bioshock 2, and its DLC Minverva's Den, has a enjoyable story on its own rights with a better implementation of morality and multiple endings than the first. It's also the only Bioshock game I found to be balanced and enjoyable to play during the entire run.

Chemthrower now merged with ADAM, and hacking now is remote (which VERY ease whole gameplay,thanks autohacking darts). For every harvested\collected little sister, you somehow get present as was in the first part but also frustrating bossfight with big sister, its the worst part of this game from my opinion. Gameplay now is linear train ride, you cannot come back to previous locations. Talking about locations only last one (Persephone) is greatest map in whole game. Multiplayer is dead, maybe because its boring. I would not advise not recommend this game, even with multiple ending it got low replayability. Buy it on sale.\nOh and one thing, inside there is two DLC's: Protector Trials and Minerva's Den. First one is boring escort the sister get the points, cant say more.\nWhat about The Minerva's Den.

The A.I. is as always an enjoyable treat to encounter though the creepy & horror filled vibe that the first held us to seems not present here.However the story of the character you're playing contains the majority of the horror. I won't spoil but you really feel for the guy but not attached to him.\n\nWeapon variety is the same as in Bioshock 1 along side the 3 ammo types per weapon/tool. New though is a hacking tool which lets you remotely hack from a distance,very handy and needed in some situations.New plasmids and tonics make a debut as well increasing the variety without detracting ones from the 1st game.\n\nThere are new variety of Big Daddies this time around along side the old ones of Bioshock 1.New splicers and turrent turrent types make a debut. The enivornments are familiar to Bioshock 1, but not as horrific as it. Quite a few pieces of background info regarding the 1st games characters are found throughout the game shedding more light to the behind the scenes of what happened. The game has a lot going for it, its just many story telling elements were a miss unlike in the first game.If you are a Bioshock fan its worth playing,just I doubt you will make a return to Bioshock 2 unlike 1.\n\nLike it or not, its a part of the franchise but story wise skippable in relation to the bigger story of the trilogy.This game is more a "day in the life of a rapture citizen" type of thing.Just you are a V.I.P.\n\nTech Issues\nThere are some steps you may or may not need to go through before you can enjoy the game as much as possible.I have a Nvidia 450 GTS 1gb vram with its latest drivers and a AMD Phenom II X4 920 2.80 ghz on Win7 64 Pro  and even after doing the crashing tutorial I got crashes periodically. I had the game on Win Vista compatibilty mode with admin privilages turn on.","July 23, 2014","true","36.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

For the rest of you, go play the original Bioshock first; if you don't you will be more than a little confused.\nA little background first: both games take place in a city called Rapture located on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. It was created as a utopia where you could choose your own destiny without the interference of governments or organized religion. As you can imagine this didn't last, and by the time you show up in the first game Rapture has deteriorated into a big free-for-all. The man who created Rapture, Andrew Ryan, serves as the main antagonist in the first game.\n\nThe second game takes place eight years after the first one, which is surprising because I can't believe that the city continued to function for that long. You play as a Big Daddy who has been gone from Rapture for ten years.\n\nThe city is now under the control of a psychiatrist named Sofia Lamb, and you have plenty of reasons to hate her. In direct contrast to Ryan's exaltation of the individual, Lamb is all about everyone working together. I find it interesting that all of these people who came to Rapture specifically for self-determination are suddenly working for Lamb.\n\nIn Bioshock the end cutscene depended on what you did to the Little Sisters you found: did you save them or harvest them? In Bioshock 2 there was more to it. In addition to the Little Sisters, there were several characters who you could decide to spare or kill; different situations surround each choice. I have heard that there are something like 12 different endings to the game depending on what you decide to do. This is one of the significant things that they improved over the original game in my opinion.\n\nOther than that though I felt that the story wasn't quite as good as the original. While it wasn't too difficult to understand where Andrew Ryan was coming from when he went on his rants, I really couldn't understand the reasoning behind Sofia Lamb's plan to create a perfect society. Speaking of Ryan, many of the characters and recordings talked about him and their opinions of how he ran things; clearly Rapture was still living in his shadow 8 years later. I felt like Bioshock 2 was similarly living in its predecessor's shadow, especially because the creative minds behind the first game (read: Ken Levine) weren't directly involved in the second.\n\nThe area that Bioshock 2 made huge improvements in was the gameplay. In the original game you had to switch between your weapon and plasmid, but in the second you always had both available to you. This alone made battles much more fast-paced and hectic. There was also more variety in enemy types; the splicers are a lot more deformed, presumable due to the extra years since the first game, and there are now brute splicers. They aren't quite as tough as Big Daddies but they fill in the gap between weak foes and really tough ones. The scariest enemy that they added was the Big Sister. They come after you sometimes after you have rescued a Little Sister, and they are tough. They use plasmids and melee attacks, and they are extremely nimble. I couldn't get a screenshot of them while they were alive because I was too busy trying to shoot them, but here is a dead one.\n\nThere were new weapons as well: the metal pipe you wielded in the original game is replaced by the Big Daddy's Drill, and I took malicious pleasure in pinning enemies to walls from afar with the new spear gun.\n\nraphically Bioshock 2 is beautiful. The environment was almost identical to the original, but you can immediately tell the difference when you look at character models from the two games.","January 3, 2013","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But it's rebindable so you can put your right mouse to zoom in which previously was for your plasmids which in your screen is the left hand so you are shooting plasmids in your right mouse? Wtf and also the game has a mechanic which I don't know why when you have a lot of ammo the game automatically changes from time to time to your other ammo and I got parts in the game where I was shooting with the rivet gun or spear gun trap rivets into bigsister face which she really enjoyed because it did crap damage.\nIn the end though with these 3 negative problems which were persistent to say the least I enjoyed the game a lot and if it was not for that I would be bashing this game but it was good and I recommend it, can't compare it to infinite though because it's the next on bioshock series that I'm going to play.","January 6, 2015","true","25.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Building upon the fantastic gameplay and setting introduced in the original game, Bioshock 2 does an admirable job of continuing the story. The main knock against this game is that it isn't as revolutionary as the original. We've already seen most of what it has to offer, so there are no major revelations here. That said, sometimes there isn't anything wrong with "more of the same", especially if that "same" is as engrossing and polished as this. Rapture is just as cool as ever, and the gameplay is just as fun. If you loved the original, there is no reason not to give Bioshock 2 a few hours of your time as well.","October 8, 2011","true","23.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although, some things are confusing, e.g., only after watching an explanation on YouTube, did I understand that Bioshock 2 protagonist is not the same as in Bioshock.\n\nThey simplified the hacking system, made it more faster. The hacking in the first part was overkill.\n\nThe enemies are basically the same, only brute splicers and big sisters are introduced. And it's fine with me. What else to think of, if it's the same environment with the same inhabitants?\n\nIn overall, I can say that Bioshock 2 doesn't offer nothing radically new, it feels more like a remake – the way the Bioshock should have been made.\n\nBioshock 2 offers a smooth RPG-FPS experience with an interesting story. It feels somewhat repetitive, as I approach each level in the same way and all the levels feel the same, too, although the difficulty is gradually increasing. At times I felt almost bored, but the last 2 levels compensate for that, as the story gets really interesting. And the ending is really, really cool. As in the first part, it is determined by your moral choices during the game.\n\nMy overall rating is 7/10.\n\nIt's a good game, but I wouldn't recommend to play it right after you have finished the first part, as they are very similar and you might get fed up with the Rapture environment.\n\nIt's also quite short (less than 14 hours to complete the story), but, I guess, if it was longer, it might have been overkill.\n\nThe game also has extra missions (to defend little sisters in different levels), which I personally didn't find interesting to try, and MP, which also offers some co-op challenges, however it is almost dead and it's hard to find at least 4 players to fill the arena.\n\nThe Minerva Den DLC: a nice addition to the core game. 7/10. Reveals the true identity of the protagonist.","April 30, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/recommended/8850/","nullpointerx","nullPointer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/","467 products in account","If popular opinion is to be believed, Bioshock 2 is a game that suffers under the shadow of the remarkable first game in the series, which is mostly regarded as being the better of the two journeys into the depths of Rapture (that is, if one can actually classify separate journeys into the depths of madness and depravity as being somehow being “better” than one another).  Some of this opinion is warranted, but in other crucial ways this game actually manages to outshine its older sibling.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about story and setting, as I feel that these two elements define the heart of the Bioshock experience.  Much like its antagonist, the first game was responsible for creating Rapture, the ugly, decrepit, and rusted out undersea dystopia.  In Bioshock 2 well you’ll sure see more … of the same.  The trouble with a setting like Rapture really is that it’s a bit self-contained, both literally and figuratively.  It’s wonderfully detailed, and there are hundreds of stories to be told (as evidenced by the many audio diaries that reappear in this game), but it’s still a microcosm.  So Bioshock 2 returns you to the same old Rapture you've seen before, to visit the same old menagerie of drug addled psychos you've set on fire before.  In a lesser setting this might prove to be an issue, but that’s just it; the world of Rapture has enough texture and atmosphere that it can still stand strong even if you do have some sense of déjà vu upon your return.  The weight of dread, hopelessness, and despair bears down on you every bit as much as the weight of the ocean around you, which in turn allows you to once again soak in the experience of Rapture.\n\nIn terms of story, your reaction may depend on how you feel about canon and its role in a larger story arc.  Indeed there are some potential issues here in terms of overall canon.  It takes some firm suspension of disbelief to swallow the premise that the Rapture we saw in the first game survived another 10 minutes after our first departure, much less another 8 years.  The character of Sofia Lamb is bolted on to the canon in such a way that it begs the question, if Lamb was such a prominent figure in Rapture, why did we not hear of her in the first game?  How are there still splicers down here, being that they seem to be a pretty nonfunctional self-destructive lot, and I can’t imagine that they’d be capable of reproduction (nor would I want to … ewww).  So yes, there may be some issues with Bioshock 2 in terms of the overall canon of the series, but here’s the clincher, and a statement which may net me some detractors.  If you can look past the minor issues above, the story in Bioshock 2 is actually better than the first game.  Sorry Ken Levine, but the boys at 2K Marin may have managed to top the amazing story set forth in the original Bioshock.  In the first Bioshock, one of the major premises of the game revolves around the question of, “Why am I doing this?”  (And I’m hoping at least someone answered, “A man chooses, a slave obeys”).  The original Bioshock is brilliant science fiction populated by a colorful rotating sideshow of psychotic freaks.  But it missed a bit of the human element.  In Bioshock2 you know immediately who you are (in a basic sense), what you must do, and crucially why you must do it.  This opens up the opportunity for a more humanist approach to Rapture, being that the resolution of this tension allows for huge opportunities in characterization.  And Bioshock 2 seizes upon that opportunity in spades.  In the first game I was purely vested in the mystery itself which was great, but in this game I was actually attached to the characters as well.  This manages to add some emotional heft to the story which I felt was missing a bit in the first game.  (In truth this is probably helped by the fact that I myself am a parent, and the central themes of Bioshock 2 revolve heavily around what it means to be a parent … err … Daddy)\n\nSo how’s the gameplay?  Well a lot like the first game, the difficulty curve here is a bit frontloaded.  As you gain plasmids, tonics, and weapons upgrades the game becomes significantly easier.  In some ways this is a bit unfortunate at least insofar as it would have been nice to feel that rush of badassery immediately upon stepping into the brass boots of a Big Daddy.  As it is you start off a bit weak and underpowered, slowly growing into your role as a walking fortress.  And that’s fine really.  It wouldn’t be super-fun or challenging if you started out as the biggest badass in Rapture.  Just as in the first game, Bioshock 2 really finds its groove when you start gaining power-ups to assist you in your endeavor, and it’s at this point that the gameplay absolutely shines.

In Bioshock 2 your experience is firmly divided into a level-based structure.  There are plot devices in place to help make some sense out of this particular element, but it warrants a mention.  To say that the game plays on rails is an understatement, being that your conveyance between levels for half the game is in fact a train.  It’s a minor thing, but I certainly would have loved to have the ability to return to previous levels for more in-depth exploration.  Oddly I also found some issue with repetitive tasks in the game, which I feel is also partly related to its strictly structured levels.  The way in which you’re tasked with the repetitive task(s) of rescuing a Little Sister, gathering Adam, dealing with the Little Sister, fighting Big Sister, wash, rinse, repeat … starts to feel a bit grind-y by the end of it.  It also impacts the pacing of the story a bit.  I think an open world setting might have relieved this issue somewhat in that it would have been nice to set my own agenda for handling the Little/Big sisters rather than being forced to handle everything in a level before moving onto the next without hope for return.  Once again this is a small issue in the grand scheme of things, but one that definitely became noticeable to me.

I don't feel bored playing it like I did with the first Bioshock. I like the story of being a Big Daddy, the story is very interesting and gameplay has improved you can now use both a plasmid and weapon at once, it makes things quicker instead of feeling so sluggish like the first Bioshock was so slow having to switch between a plasmid and a weapon.\n\nAnd I like that hacking seems better and you can now hack cameras as well instead of just destroy them.\n\nI reccomend having several saves as saving can be glitchy. I saved my game and it crashed in the process deleting the save that I was saving over, I previously had 4 saves and now had 3, so it must of deleted the save which caused it to crash or the crashing caused it to delete?? Iam not sure.\nIt's a joy to be able to alt tab out of game without getting a black screen of death.\n\nWhen you open a map, you can't close it again by pressing the map key, but by clicking on a button at the bottom of the screen that says close or by pressing B on a XBox controller with no way to remap the key for PC controls. Controller exclusive controls on a PC game is annoying.\n\nI like this game much more than the first Bioshock, Iam enjoying it and rate it 7/10","September 8, 2015","true","43.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/recommended/8850/","nullpointerx","nullPointer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/","467 products in account","If popular opinion is to be believed, Bioshock 2 is a game that suffers under the shadow of the remarkable first game in the series, which is mostly regarded as being the better of the two journeys into the depths of Rapture (that is, if one can actually classify separate journeys into the depths of madness and depravity as being somehow being “better” than one another).  Some of this opinion is warranted, but in other crucial ways this game actually manages to outshine its older sibling.\n\nLet’s talk a bit about story and setting, as I feel that these two elements define the heart of the Bioshock experience.  Much like its antagonist, the first game was responsible for creating Rapture, the ugly, decrepit, and rusted out undersea dystopia.  In Bioshock 2 well you’ll sure see more … of the same.  The trouble with a setting like Rapture really is that it’s a bit self-contained, both literally and figuratively.  It’s wonderfully detailed, and there are hundreds of stories to be told (as evidenced by the many audio diaries that reappear in this game), but it’s still a microcosm.  So Bioshock 2 returns you to the same old Rapture you've seen before, to visit the same old menagerie of drug addled psychos you've set on fire before.  In a lesser setting this might prove to be an issue, but that’s just it; the world of Rapture has enough texture and atmosphere that it can still stand strong even if you do have some sense of déjà vu upon your return.  The weight of dread, hopelessness, and despair bears down on you every bit as much as the weight of the ocean around you, which in turn allows you to once again soak in the experience of Rapture.\n\nIn terms of story, your reaction may depend on how you feel about canon and its role in a larger story arc.  Indeed there are some potential issues here in terms of overall canon.  It takes some firm suspension of disbelief to swallow the premise that the Rapture we saw in the first game survived another 10 minutes after our first departure, much less another 8 years.  The character of Sofia Lamb is bolted on to the canon in such a way that it begs the question, if Lamb was such a prominent figure in Rapture, why did we not hear of her in the first game?  How are there still splicers down here, being that they seem to be a pretty nonfunctional self-destructive lot, and I can’t imagine that they’d be capable of reproduction (nor would I want to … ewww).  So yes, there may be some issues with Bioshock 2 in terms of the overall canon of the series, but here’s the clincher, and a statement which may net me some detractors.  If you can look past the minor issues above, the story in Bioshock 2 is actually better than the first game.  Sorry Ken Levine, but the boys at 2K Marin may have managed to top the amazing story set forth in the original Bioshock.  In the first Bioshock, one of the major premises of the game revolves around the question of, “Why am I doing this?”  (And I’m hoping at least someone answered, “A man chooses, a slave obeys”).  The original Bioshock is brilliant science fiction populated by a colorful rotating sideshow of psychotic freaks.  But it missed a bit of the human element.  In Bioshock2 you know immediately who you are (in a basic sense), what you must do, and crucially why you must do it.  This opens up the opportunity for a more humanist approach to Rapture, being that the resolution of this tension allows for huge opportunities in characterization.  And Bioshock 2 seizes upon that opportunity in spades.  In the first game I was purely vested in the mystery itself which was great, but in this game I was actually attached to the characters as well.  This manages to add some emotional heft to the story which I felt was missing a bit in the first game.  (In truth this is probably helped by the fact that I myself am a parent, and the central themes of Bioshock 2 revolve heavily around what it means to be a parent … err … Daddy)\n\nSo how’s the gameplay?  Well a lot like the first game, the difficulty curve here is a bit frontloaded.  As you gain plasmids, tonics, and weapons upgrades the game becomes significantly easier.  In some ways this is a bit unfortunate at least insofar as it would have been nice to feel that rush of badassery immediately upon stepping into the brass boots of a Big Daddy.  As it is you start off a bit weak and underpowered, slowly growing into your role as a walking fortress.  And that’s fine really.  It wouldn’t be super-fun or challenging if you started out as the biggest badass in Rapture.  Just as in the first game, Bioshock 2 really finds its groove when you start gaining power-ups to assist you in your endeavor, and it’s at this point that the gameplay absolutely shines.  It’s still an absolute blast to figure out interesting and advantageous combinations of plasmids, tonics, and weapon upgrades in order to rain death upon the doomed denizens of Rapture.\n\nThere was one element of the first game that I did miss in Bioshock 2 which was the open world component.

It's almost like a ridiculously well-produced fan game or total conversion mod.\n\nAccept the game for what it is, and Bioshock 2 actually becomes a rather lighthearted experience.

It continues the story of the underwater city of Rapture.\n\nSeveral years after the events of the first game, a prototype Big Daddy called Subject Delta is brought back to life in order to find and rescue Eleanor, a Little Sister whom he is bonded with, from the hands of the Rapture's new leader, Sofia Lamb. Sofia is a psychiatrist who believes that only by sacrificing our egos can we make the Earth a good place to live. That is a polar opposite of what Andrew Ryan stood for. Like in the predecessor, there are many voice recordings to be found. Moreover, the gloomy atmosphere of the desolated Rapture combined with the colourful water depths compliments the game perfectly.\n\nThe gameplay has not changed much – the goal is to complete the given tasks and harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters. There are more enemies and they are a bit more challenging. Feminists have finally been heard and Now there is a female counterpart to the Big Daddies – the Big Mommas Sisters (as if the female leader was not enough...). Moreover, a new mechanic has been added – being a Big Daddy, the player can choose to "adopt" a Little Sister and make her gather ADAM from corpses. The procedure is similar to the good ol' King of the Hill mode – the player has to protect the child while she is harvesting the precious substance. However, it can get old pretty fast.\n\nSpeaking of additions to the game, there are new weapons and plasmids. For instance, there is a spear gun which I have grown to love (probably more than I should...). In terms of new plasmids, Scout comes to mind. This power lets you deploy a ghost projection that can use plasmids or hack devices. Bioshock 2 supports a variety of playstyles which adds to the replay value. There also is a multiplayer mode.\n\nTo conclude, Bioshock 2 is a worthy sequel to the original. The combination of the fascinating story, great graphics, and a variety of choices makes it a marvellous title. A 9/10.\n\nP.S.

And at the end of Minerva's Den when you see that color monitor you cannot help but feel that it doesn't belong there, that it cannot be 'in' Rapture, it must be there from somewhere else, from another world, like a seed of a new world that sprouts in dying Rapture, maybe, and you get the feeling that not only the ocean is finding its way into the ruined city, but another - more colorful - world is also leaking through the cracks in Rapture's broken reality and this could be, in retrospect, the moment that Bioshock's universe opens up to the Multiverse that will take the stage in Infinite.","January 2, 2014","true","60.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/8850/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","This game picks up sorta how the first Bioshock left off, you play as a Big Daddy, all big, all oafy and loud.  For fun make sure to play the game on the Hardest Difficulty, anything less and its just too easy.  This game is much shorter than the original but the pace feels good, it never drags, so dont let the length fool you.  The games mechanics are not as fun as the original.  Playing up until Dionysus Park a player can survive if they use resources carefully practicing ammo conservation, but on the Dionysus park level it all falls apart.  Enemies respawn real, real, fast.  Often times an enemy is killed then you walk around the corner and the same enemy respawns so fast and is shooting you in the back.  This is a HUGE problem because enemies dont always carry money to buy more ammo or supplies.\n\nThe lack of ammo or money to buy things is where the game breaks down due to this.  This broken gameplay of the weapons running out of ammo way to fast is compensated for by placing vending machines every 15 feet it feels like.  This could have been done less if either ammo was cheaper, or players could carry more ammo.  Being a big Daddy should be all about using the drill, but the drill requires fuel, fuel that evaporates way to fast even after upgrades making those vending machines every 10 feet useful.  The gameplay feels broken spending the whole game going to vending machines, the fuel should have lasted longer or there shoulda been an infinite fuel upgrade for the drill since its kind of the trademark big daddy weapon.  Hypnotize 3 is kinda useless, it lets you hypnotize big daddies which lasts for about ten seconds and worse if they throw a turret hypnotized or not it attacks you.  A good story and a fun game, def a must for bioshock fans.  Kinda thought this would suck and its nice that it isnt too bad.\n\nRating:  7/10  Value:  $7.99","July 22, 2014","true","26.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

The game's story was kinda blah, and well felt in it's own way too similar to the first. Unlike some I thought it was cool that it was in Rapture again, but they did not have to have the story completly the same.\n\nIn Bioshock 2 the game is much different. In Bioshock 2 you are a Big Daddy. Instead of tommy guns, pistols etc. for weapons, you get Big Daddy weapons. This may sound cool, but it is not as exciting as it sounds. The game is in many ways babified, in they simplified things that did not need it. The hacking was simplified so easy a child could do it, and they give guides for things like the eve system that were straightforward to begin with. The game in general also feels more simplistic than the first Bioshock.\n\nThe Multi-player was really blah and I think they could have made a better single-player if they spent more resources on the single-player instead.\n\nI originally owned Bioshock 2 on the Xbox 360 and got it in a 3 pack on steam for PC. On the Xbox 360 the game was stable, on the PC you have to turn off advanced graphics features offered by DirectX 10 to prevent it from constantly crashing, which is pathetic. I guess I would be mad if I did not get it almost free.\n\nI highly recommend getting Bioshock 1 if you have not played it, I only recommend 2 if you want to see what the story is like. I warn you, you will probably be disappointed. The only reason I am playing through it again is to get the steam achievements.","January 24, 2014","false","12.7"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The city is more amazing than it was in the first game, characters better fleshed out, story more focused and generally everything feels significantly improved. While during the first game I spent the first hours just understanding what the hell the setting was about, this time Rapture felt like bleak home and I could appreciate everything from the beginning without that slow learning curve. Obviously, much of the mystery is diminished since it's not the first time. But you're compensated with better mechanics, stunning environments and a deeper story.\n\nTonics and Plasmids are still a great joy, improving the FPS with light RPG elements of character customization. The variety of active and passive abilities allows you to choose between an impressive range of playstyles. Sneak? Melee? Guns ablazing? Setting traps? Hypnotizing enemies to fight by your side? Use machines to wreak havoc? You name it, you have it. Combined with an unparalled atmosphere and unique setting, using the foundations of the first masterpiece and building upon them, BioShock is 20-some hours of pure fun of the best kind in computer games.\n\nI recommend playing the first before the second. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time enjoying the most of the plot. You'll miss out on a lot of characters and spend too long trying to fill in the gaps by what you understand from the events. And this is a game you want to delve into the plot. If just for Rapture, its history and its imaginative premise.","August 4, 2014","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For this was the first and almost only reason I picked up this game, but I was suprised on how much more this game has to offer then the obvious "you are a big daddy so here are bigger guns to shoot stuff with".\n\nTake the Story for instance, the Bioshock series set this "reference point" for having a good story line. Always with some unexpencted story twist at the end (even though this game doesn't have that as much as infinite or the first one). Without any spoilers I can only say its good, but nothing like infinite.\n\nGameplay whise I wasn't all to suprised, like I said before its basically the gameplay of Bioshock 1 with bigger guns. But that doesn't mean its bad, infact, the gameplay and movement is super solid and extremely satisfying. You can combine plasmids, guns and genetonics to perfect your "build".\n\nThe enemies have a good variety, not just the typical splicer, all the different enemy types make up for changing gameplay. But later on in the game the variety of splicers become boring, late game you are so powerful that you cut through everyone in seconds, even big daddies and sisters. And the only way the game compensates for that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out a bazillion enemies at you, so late game becomes more or less a grind and the variety stops.\n\nAll and all, its a good game. Super solid gameplay, storywise lacking a bit for a bioshock game. And the variety in builds you can do, make me come back to this game constantly.\n\nP.S first serious review here, you can comment "omg it zucks ur bad" or actually give some feedback.\nP.P.S or just comment whatever about this review","July 18, 2014","true","20.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/8850/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","A wonderful sequel to the first BioShock but this time developed by 2K. BioShock 2 does not really offer anything new; it just improves upon the first game. It is an interesting concept to put the player into the shoes of a Big Daddy - it should be mentioned that it is an alpha version, though, so it's not like you are an all powerful being incapable of dying.\n\nStill, it is a nice touch as you can finally use a Big Daddy's drill and while in the prequel you just killed these monstrous creatures to get hold of the little girls now you have to protect the children while they harvest ADAM from the fallen citizens of Rapture. Again, these encounters are optional but well worth the trouble. And once you completed all harvests the Big Sister appears. This is an addition to the boss battles and while the Big Daddies are slow their sisters are much faster so you need to use different tactics.\n\nOther than the harvest part the gameplay remains similar. You keep progressing further and while the game is linear you should look behind every door and open every box to find loot and the good-old audio diaries that further explain the background. Morality choices return but with greater impact and this time you have 3 endings available. Hacking can be done from the distance by shooting darts into the target objects and instead of taking pictures you have a camera that can record your battles with your foes. Again, recording here results in bonuses against the various types of enemies.\n\nMany plasmid types return but there are new additions to an already varied rooster and levelling up them offers better bonuses. We now have multiplayer but personally I found it just average - I guess this was the usual attempt to lengthen the game's replayability but the single player offers at least 3 playthroughs so I believe it was unnecessary. I do not think anybody plays multiplayer anymore, either.\n\nThis is the first BioShock that comes with a DLC. On Steam the DLC is part of the game and it should be mentioned that they got rid of GFWL (good riddance!) so we should not bother with this, thank god. Minerva's Den offers us a completely new plot - again, we play as an Alpha Series Big Daddy - and we get a deeper insight into the city's inner workings.\n\nBioShock 2 is an example of what a true sequel should be. It improves upon an already very good BioShock 1, thus, it feels like as if we continued the story where we left off and did not stop playing BioShock.","January 18, 2014","true","16.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is BioShock 2 at its center. After a brief, violent glimpse into Rapture before its fall from capitalist glory, players are sunk into the boots of Subject Delta, a big daddy with a bone to pick with the leader of Rapture's newly-mended society, the Rapture Family. The gameplay still has that zap-and-whack feel that gave the first BioShock's combat so much appeal. The blood on the walls and viewable acts of brutality also remind the player where they are: Rapture.\n\nIn Delta's hunt for his Little Sister, he'll run into some familiar faces, and new ones. Tenenbaum has returned to this leaky ship, Ryan's posthumous voice is audible via recordings, and even Dr. Suchong and his grisly fate come to light. A whole host of new characters awaits Delta here, each of them interesting and memorable. Seldom are new Plasmids, but old weapons have been repurposed (and in some cases, replaced) for use by the protagonist Big Daddy. Deliberating over a Little Sister's fate is just as agonizing as before (even moreso, considering the player's role as a Protector), and pulling off a perfect plasmid-weapon combo is still a very, very satisfying experience. If you liked BioShock 1, you'll find nothing wrong with BioShock 2.\n\nNever before has bashing a Splicer's head in been so fun.","June 21, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Indeed it enables us to see how they endure the test of time. And only true jewels can stand it. What about Bioshock II ? As I had been blown away after playing the first opus, I expected a lot from this sequel. And so did many Bioshock fans. Here's my review :\n\n(See rating at the end of the review)\n\n____________________________\n\nGAMEPLAY: Quite similar to what we experienced in the first game. The gameplay is really focused on immersive and explosive fighting sequences. The difference with the first opus is that there's no real final boss but very often the player is opposing big waves of ennemies. Hopefully it is possible to prepare your defense by setting traps and mines, hacking security cameras and turrets. But if you want to collect all the Adam, these defensive fights become too repetitive. On a more positive note, some new weapons add more fun to the gameplay. I really enjoyed playing with the drill and the spear gun. Moreover, it's really interesting to combine different weapon's and plasmid's attacks. I liked the fact, that as a Big Daddy you really feel the strength and the weight of your character. There are also different levels of difficulty that you may choose depending on your experience in FPS games. So don't worry if you're not used to this type of game. I'm not, but I still truly enjoyed playing it.\n\nVISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: That's why so many people love the Bioshock saga : a deep immersion into an equally beautiful and horrific world. Of course, I already knew how Rapture looked like but I was still surprised by the beauty of the scenery. And even if the game engine is getting older, the esthetic of this chaotic city is still mind-blowing. The new developers have even got further with more cutscenes and submarine exploration that offers quiet and contemplative moments between the fighting sequences. I also have to praise the soundtrack, the voice-acting and the sound effects that are even better than in the first Bioshock.\n\nSTORY: In this sequel, which occurs ten years after the events of the first game, we play in this sequel a reborn Big Daddy who's trying to get back to his little sister. Our quest offers us the possibility to explore many new places and to meet new cheracters. The most interesting ones are the utopist Sofia Lamb and the opportunist Sinclair who take the roles of Ryan and Atlas in the antagonist-protagonist pattern. Because we are more familiar with Rapture and it's doom, we are less surprised by the wickedness of its inhabitants but there are still some strong revelations. Many elements of the story are smartly scattered in the Audio Diaries that the player finds on its way. And as we move towards the end of the game, the story becomes more and more intense. To me, three of the four different endings are a bit overdramatic but they still have a great theatrical effect.\n\nLENGTH: It takes around 10 hours to finish the game. More than that if you don't use the quest arrow. There's four different endings that you can experience depending of your choices, but because the game is very scripted I wouldn't do it all over again.\n\n____________________________\n\n\nGameplay        4.5/6                Visuals, music and atmosphere        6/6                Story        4/6                Length        2/2                -        -                Global Rating        16.5/20\nEven if we are familiar with Rapture, it is still a great pleasure to explore this submarine terrifying world. Bioshock II is not disappointing at all in terms of visual design and atmosphere. However, this sequel is bit more focused on action than on the story. As a result, the gameplay is more entertaining but the story lacks originality.","March 28, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The city is more amazing than it was in the first game, characters better fleshed out, story more focused and generally everything feels significantly improved. While during the first game I spent the first hours just understanding what the hell the setting was about, this time Rapture felt like bleak home and I could appreciate everything from the beginning without that slow learning curve. Obviously, much of the mystery is diminished since it's not the first time. But you're compensated with better mechanics, stunning environments and a deeper story.\n\nTonics and Plasmids are still a great joy, improving the FPS with light RPG elements of character customization. The variety of active and passive abilities allows you to choose between an impressive range of playstyles. Sneak? Melee? Guns ablazing? Setting traps? Hypnotizing enemies to fight by your side? Use machines to wreak havoc? You name it, you have it. Combined with an unparalled atmosphere and unique setting, using the foundations of the first masterpiece and building upon them, BioShock is 20-some hours of pure fun of the best kind in computer games.\n\nI recommend playing the first before the second. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time enjoying the most of the plot. You'll miss out on a lot of characters and spend too long trying to fill in the gaps by what you understand from the events. And this is a game you want to delve into the plot. If just for Rapture, its history and its imaginative premise.","August 4, 2014","true","27.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bioshock 2 had some really awesome features but it fell short of one critical item. Story. It's story was not the best. It had its moments but it was not impressive. The graphics were definently improved. Gameplay was great but it had weak spots, Because you play as a Big Daddy, You gain access to a very powerful arsenal. Having that makes it seem to easy at times but also very satisfying. You also are able to still harvest/ rescue little sisters. When rescued you have the option to "adopt" them. This was a very neat feature because it allowed for more adam to be collected and a side event where you guarded her while she harvested. It made the player feel more attached or closer to the little sister. Bioshock 2 also added a new boss "The Big Sister". She was a very nimble close range character. She was able to collect adam and she could appear at random times. *minor spoiler alert* [/spoiler] The Big Sister was created to keep the little sister away from the big daddys, this was interesting because it gave the player a real reason to really kill her besides "shes hurting me I'll just hurt her back" [/spoiler] They also added new big daddys. All in all this was a good title for the gameplay but the story was definently not as good as the first or infinite. It's definently worth the 19.99 price tag it has.","January 22, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Indeed it enables us to see how they endure the test of time. And only true jewels can stand it. What about Bioshock II ? As I had been blown away after playing the first opus, I expected a lot from this sequel. And so did many Bioshock fans. Here's my review :\n\n(See rating at the end of the review)\n\n____________________________\n\nGAMEPLAY: Quite similar to what we experienced in the first game. The gameplay is really focused on immersive and explosive fighting sequences. The difference with the first opus is that there's no real final boss but very often the player is opposing big waves of ennemies. Hopefully it is possible to prepare your defense by setting traps and mines, hacking security cameras and turrets. But if you want to collect all the Adam, these defensive fights become too repetitive. On a more positive note, some new weapons add more fun to the gameplay. I really enjoyed playing with the drill and the spear gun. Moreover, it's really interesting to combine different weapon's and plasmid's attacks. I liked the fact, that as a Big Daddy you really feel the strength and the weight of your character. There are also different levels of difficulty that you may choose depending on your experience in FPS games. So don't worry if you're not used to this type of game. I'm not, but I still truly enjoyed playing it.\n\nVISUALS, MUSIC & ATMOSPHERE: That's why so many people love the Bioshock saga : a deep immersion into an equally beautiful and horrific world. Of course, I already knew how Rapture looked like but I was still surprised by the beauty of the scenery. And even if the game engine is getting older, the esthetic of this chaotic city is still mind-blowing. The new developers have even got further with more cutscenes and submarine exploration that offers quiet and contemplative moments between the fighting sequences. I also have to praise the soundtrack, the voice-acting and the sound effects that are even better than in the first Bioshock.\n\nSTORY: In this sequel, which occurs ten years after the events of the first game, we play in this sequel a reborn Big Daddy who's trying to get back to his little sister. Our quest offers us the possibility to explore many new places and to meet new cheracters. The most interesting ones are the utopist Sofia Lamb and the opportunist Sinclair who take the roles of Ryan and Atlas in the antagonist-protagonist pattern. Because we are more familiar with Rapture and it's doom, we are less surprised by the wickedness of its inhabitants but there are still some strong revelations. Many elements of the story are smartly scattered in the Audio Diaries that the player finds on its way. And as we move towards the end of the game, the story becomes more and more intense. To me, three of the four different endings are a bit overdramatic but they still have a great theatrical effect.\n\nLENGTH: It takes around 10 hours to finish the game. More than that if you don't use the quest arrow. There's four different endings that you can experience depending of your choices, but because the game is very scripted I wouldn't do it all over again.\n\n____________________________\n\n\nGameplay        4.5/6                Visuals, music and atmosphere        6/6                Story        4/6                Length        2/2                -        -                Global Rating        16.5/20\nEven if we are familiar with Rapture, it is still a great pleasure to explore this submarine terrifying world. Bioshock II is not disappointing at all in terms of visual design and atmosphere. However, this sequel is bit more focused on action than on the story. As a result, the gameplay is more entertaining but the story lacks originality.","March 28, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The narrative is more set in stone but  i feel this helps the game convey its story much better than the original (barring the obvious plot 'choices'). Still a bit too easy so hard difficulity is again recommended.\n\nTo most a step back compared to the original but with the release of Bioshock infinite i feel this title was unfairly judged and is atleast equal if not slightly better than Infinite due to having far less handholding and and far more interesting characters (barring infinites shocker ending i suppose).Rapture just makes for a much more engaging setting than minor alterations of New Columbia ever will be.\n\nBonus ; The minerva's den dlc delivers another 4-5 hours of excellent (standalone) campaign.","April 2, 2013","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one fills in a few details about Rapture story-wise, but falls flat in most other respects.\n\nIt should be noted that if (like me) you bought a retail copy of the game, it's worth registering on steam to gain free access to the Minerva's Den DLC, as well as enjoying a non-GFWL experience.\n\nAlso, for your sanity, run the game with the "-dx9" flag set (right-click on game in library > set launch options), or you will probably experience constant crashes to desktop, especially so in the DLC.","May 24, 2015","true","13.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is amazing, graphics are good ('specially compared to the first Bioshock!), controls and combat are pristine.\n\nMultiplayer is still somewhat alive! There seems to be quite a few people who play every day, and there are times of day when you'll get to try it out; around 6pm or later. It was always my favorite FPS multiplayer, but the xbox Bioshock 2 community died out a long time ago so it's nice to see people still play it on the PC. What's cool about the pvp is that you can type to people while you kill 'em, so there's a good, nice, hopeful community playing the game, we hope the community grows but it's definitely an older game. I've been playing multiplayer every day for the past week or so, and I rarely have to sit and wait for a game.\n\nThe PvP is awesome. Out of all the shooters I've played, it's my favorite. Everyone has a pretty good amount of health so it's not just 1shot vs 1shot hiding around a corner camping; it's different. I mean, there's still 1shot combos and stuff but not everyone has perfected that so it's pretty fair. Wielding plasmids and shooting lightning bolts and crossbows, and turning invisible are the coolest things ever.\n\nIt was difficult to set the controls for an Xbox controller, if anyone has any questions (how to edit the sensitivity of an xbox controller for multiplayer) just message me.\n\nEdit: the PvP community isn't as good as I thought lmao, I keep trying to play; I try once every few weeks, but everyone's adopted the Grenade Launcher strategy; it's a 1shot kill basically, it's overpowered and everyone kind of hates it. I haven't been able to progress much in PvP. I really miss the old xbox days when there were a lot of people playing every day. Now all I see are the same people using the same 1shot strategies over and over. Stun + crossbow = instant 1shot. grenade launcher = stun/disorient/1shot/range, and if you suicide yourself with the grenade launcher, the other team doesn't get a kill, and there's no penalty. You can stand outside a room and fling grenades into the room and get multiple kills without even aiming or trying. That's what PvP is right now basically, I wish there was a game mode that doubled the health of players, just so it isn't 1shots, but requires slightly more strategy than Electro Bolt / Crossbow, which barely requires aiming skill","September 30, 2015","true","47.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bioshock 2 had some really awesome features but it fell short of one critical item. Story. It's story was not the best. It had its moments but it was not impressive. The graphics were definently improved. Gameplay was great but it had weak spots, Because you play as a Big Daddy, You gain access to a very powerful arsenal. Having that makes it seem to easy at times but also very satisfying. You also are able to still harvest/ rescue little sisters. When rescued you have the option to "adopt" them. This was a very neat feature because it allowed for more adam to be collected and a side event where you guarded her while she harvested. It made the player feel more attached or closer to the little sister. Bioshock 2 also added a new boss "The Big Sister". She was a very nimble close range character. She was able to collect adam and she could appear at random times. *minor spoiler alert* [/spoiler] The Big Sister was created to keep the little sister away from the big daddys, this was interesting because it gave the player a real reason to really kill her besides "shes hurting me I'll just hurt her back" [/spoiler] They also added new big daddys. All in all this was a good title for the gameplay but the story was definently not as good as the first or infinite.

This review is not so much a reflection of what how the game function but more about what it provides for the gamer. Bioshock 2, is indoubtly one of a prime classics in our gaming generation of today, if you haven't picked it up yet I highly reccommend doing so. No spoilers here but, the game takes you on a journey and a mystery as you find yourslef constantly asking questions what happened to the rapture? why have the people gone mad? why, when, what, how? I'm writing from a perspective that seeks a game to be more of a game, rather an interactive, immersive narrative. Do graphics still matter to this day an age, some would argue however, none would say this is a shallow experience but rather it is a deep and enriching piece of art.

I have heard from a lot of people that this is their least favorite of the franchise, but I would honestly say it is probably my favorite. It combines all the good gameplay elements from the other two games and adds a little extra strategy with the Little Sisters and such. I don't know, it felt much more action packed than the first one because you could dual wield plasmids and guns, but it also felt more strategic unlike Infinite wear you can only carry two guns at a time and from what I remember, no ammo differences. Plus there aren't gene tonics to customize your character in Infinite. Anyway, I thought this was a marvellous game. I love the Rapture setting and the quality game mechanics. The story was good and felt a lot more emotional than the first one. I have yet to play Minerva's Den or the online mode(both of which I plan to get to).\n\nPros:\nGood visuals\nExciting fun gameplay\nStrategic shooter\nHeartfelt story\nWell optimized\n\nCons:\nScrolling through weapons goes the wrong way when you use your mouse wheel. Ended up using number buttons\nHaving Big Daddy mask was obnoxious, but you can turn that off\nWish it would auto-save a bit more often\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a perfect 10/10. I'm honest, it is one of the best games I have ever played. A 10/10 is saying a lot from me. I would HIGHLY suggest it to anyone remotely interested in a FPS game to play through. It is totally worth the $20 and you can even often get it for less.","March 13","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First of all, in Bioshock 2, you play as a Big Daddy. I'm not going to say too much more about the story as it would lead to spoilers, but the story is quite compelling to follow. In terms of pure enjoyment, Bioshock 2 was just slightly less enjoyable than Bioshock 1 because being a Big Daddy was kind of annoying when you hear a grunting noise every few seconds and when you jump and land.\n\nMy one problem with Bioshock 2 was that it started crashing a lot as I got further and further into the game. I got into the habit of quicksaving every minute or so in order to not lose progress so it was still bearable. But aside from the crashing, Bioshock 2 is a VERY fun game to play and is just and incredible continuation of Bioshock 1 in another area of Rapture. I know this review is pretty disorganized and jumbled, but if you are to take anything out of this, Bioshock 2 is worth playing.\n\nRating: 9.1/10\nRecommend Price: Any Price because it is that good","April 13","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stechyo/recommended/8850/","stechyo","darthaegis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stechyo/","140 products in account","The "best"/least mediocre Bioshock game. I actually kinda liked this one.\n\nThe story and themes try to copy Bioshock 1 but it kind of ends up being a blander copy in that regard. But screw that! It actually manages to be fun throughout the whole game (unlike Bioshock) and the story isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ multi-dimension quantum magic pretentious hipster drivel (unlike Infinite). Basically, you're one of the first Big Daddies, and part of Rapture's Splicers have turned, in the 8 years since the first game, into a "Family" led by Female Andrew Ryan with a different philosophy, aka, Sofia Lamb. Your daughter is being controlled by her to be the Ultimate Citizen, and you want to get her back, as a Big Daddy would. There are twice as much endings this time (I didn't check the differences between them because I can't be arsed to), and the difference between these, besides harvesting or rescuing Little SIsters, is that they also depend on certain characters that you save. Or not. Bascially, instead of having 1 choice, you have 4.\n\nGunplay is sort of between Bioshock (mediocre) and Infinite (less mediocre), and though it is slightly more linear than Bioshock at times, it doesn't waste hours of your time with backtracking (hence the shorter gameplay time even though I explored through most nooks and crannies) and the guns are slightly more original than Infinite's: Instead of the WW1 weaponry, you have the Big Daddy's Rivet Gun, a sort of minigun instead of that ♥♥♥♥ Tommy Gun from BS1, a harpoon launcher, a one-handed shotgun and Bioshock1's grenade launcher. You can also dual-wield plasmids, and the upgrades for both plasmids and weaponry are also more original than the 2 other Bioshcok games. Compared to both Ken Levine's Bioshocks, the game also has a lot less full of HP-bloated bullet sponges (though it gets more offensive in this regard towards the last 2 or 3 levels).\n\nBioshock's Little SIster gameplay of harvesting or rescuing Little Sisters after fighting disgustingly HP-bloated enemies turns into adopting or harvesting. If you adopt them (You're a Big Daddy in this game, forgot to mention that) You can reenact the worst level of the first game where you go around letting them harvest ADAM (the magical space-slug chemical that allows you to upgrade your magic powers aka Plasmids) while playing tower defense.You only have to do this once though (for tutorial purposes *sigh*) and in later times you can just send them to the nearest vent and rescue or harvest them. The Big Daddies are not bullet sponges anymore because you have more powerful weaponry (now, there are Brute Splicers for whatever reason, which take up the seat of annoying bullet sponge that charges at you.) To keep a certain amount of dificulty in harvesting/rescuing Little Sisters (even though all difficulty in the Bioshock games is fake because you can just respawn with almost zero cost near where you "died"), at the end of the level, come Big Sisters to get the ADAM you got back. They are sort of a combination of Big Daddies (the charge at you) and Houdini and Spider Splicers (they jump around, and throw fireballs and whatever objects are in the vicinity, at you.) They are not complete bullet sponges, and are fairly fun to fight against.\n\nOverall, it's not really a great game, but it sure as hell is better than ♥♥♥♥ing Infinite. And the first game as well.","February 11","true","11.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/8850/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","TLDR: An enjoyable follow-up to the first game continues the story of Rapture with a new protagonist, a new conflicted (kind of) big boss and more gene splicing action. This time around you have some moral decision making to do, and your actions affect the game’s ending.\n\nIf you’ve played the first Bioshock game, you’ll remember that in the mid 1900’s the world’s top minds secretly worked together to build the underwater city of Rapture, and created what they thought was the ultimate utopia, free of government and religion. Instead they were ruled by the free market and meritocracy, so everyone makes money based on being good at something. In Bioshock 2, you learn that the pressures of this “perfect world” started to get to the citizens (especially the poor), and a psychiatrist was brought in to help people deal with the stresses of pure competition. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist Sofia Lamb had her own agenda, and saw the opportunity to create a true Utopia in Rapture through the use of Adam.\n\nAdam is a genetic material that can be used to create “plasmids” for artificial evolution through gene splicing. It doesn’t just give people super powers though, apparently it can be used to transfer the memories of the users to certain prepared users (Little Sisters). Little Sisters are orphaned girls who have been kidnapped and turned into walking “Adam factories” who can later be harvested for their gooey Adam. The Little Sisters are guarded by Big Daddies, brainwashed people in armored diving gear who are psychically linked to their Little Sisters and guard them from any threat.\n\nIn Bioshock 2, you play a Big Daddy, though the gameplay is nearly the same as in the first game (where you were a human). It’s still a First Person Shooter and the weapons are mostly the same as well. There’s been a refinement to the plasmid system where you’re basically dual wielding now (plasmid in one hand and gun in the other). In the first game you had to switch between gun and plasmid. A big change is that because you’re a Big Daddy, you do a bunch of mini escort missions where you guard Little Sisters as they gather their Adam. Just like in the first game, you have a huge variety of weapon ammo types and plasmid types to help you survive, though you might notice that the game is more difficult this time around. It seems like you take more damage in Bioshock 2 than in the first game.\n\nPros:\n+The story is good though it’s a little difficult to figure out what the deal is with Sofia Lamb. How did she turn into such a ♥♥♥♥♥?\n+The game takes what is good about the first game and adds to it. I kind of liked the hacking mini game in the first game better though. There are more weapon types, more plasmids, and more enemies. The mini bosses in the first game were the Big Daddies, who are back, but now you have the Big Sisters to deal with as well and they’re twice as powerful.\n+The game has 6 different endings depending on the moral choices you make throughout, but they’re actually very close to each other. I’ve probably only seen 3 of them because I usually play games as a “good person” and had to go out of my way to make evil decisions.\n\nCons:\n-People have told me that Bioshock 2 is the weakest in the Bioshock series and I can see their point. There really isn’t much more innovation and it’s kind of like a continuation of the first game in terms of technical improvement. Like with Saints Row 4, where people said it was almost a really long DLC for Saints Row 3.\n-There were some technical issues for me related to graphics. It seems to be a common occurrence based on what I found when googling for solutions. To keep the game from crashing, I had to change the display to Direct X 9.\n\nOverall, if you liked the first Bioshock, you’ll probably like Bioshock 2, though maybe not quite as much. The game takes about 10 hours to beat and is more than worth your time.  8.5/10\n","June 15, 2015","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Splendid idea of underwater city Rapture built with vision of free mind for artist/scientists and other types of creative people that might get limited by their surroundings in world, but not in Rapture.\n\nAs all previous utopistic societies that went straight into hell - new genetic improvements so called plasmids enhances your physical/psychical abilities in cost of ruining your body and mind (as drugs). But as every addict - you want more... but supplies are limited, so you start thinking about taking some from the others. In Rapture there were two major fractions - people listening to Andrew Ryan (man who built this "paradise") and Frank Fontaine(Ryans rival). After civil war, city was in ruins and people who survived this became weak-minded mutants (splicers) demanding ADAM (genetic material for plasmids).\n\nIn Bioshock 2 not much really changes from that - except city is more ruined and remaining splicers are uglier and desperate more than ever. Story of Bioshock 2 happens many years after first Bioshock. Power vacuum was filled with new visionary - Sophia Lamb.\n\nYou play as Big Daddy (subject Delta) whom was taken a little sister (Eleanor) years ago. You wake up revived by vita chamber years after death. And because you are genetically bounded with your little sister, you must find it or you'll die.\nYour journey begins here...\n\nI must say I enjoyed discovering new locations, newly refined plasmids, improved combat system (now you can hold plasmid and gun simultanously) and mainly fact being a big daddy, that giant monster in metal diving suit wearing drill, rivet gun and all...\n\nUnlike first Bioshock, this one experiments with multiplayer and I must say it ended half-way to success. It have same atmosphere as Bioshock 1, game modes are fun, gameplay is challenging and entertaining same time, you have a lot of singleplayer elements here (hacking turrets, vending machines etc.), but lack of dedicated servers is biggest problem here and no matter how good gameplay you can offer, absention of dedicated erver bound with horribly coded network code ruins everything.\n\nAnd I don't even mention GFWL and so called "DLCs" with overpowered third gun upgrades, new maps that you could play only if everyone owned that DLC (almost imposible) - I had to struggle with that until I stopped play it from frustration. Finally after some time GFWL closed (hurray for that) Bioshock was moved to Steam platform with all multiplayer expansions for free to all! So I could finally play some nice multiplayer... until people stopped play it so much, well at least I had some quality games before that.\n\nIt's a must have for every Bioshock 1 fan, but I would recomment it for people who likes interesting FPS shooters with some STORY (not pointing at any bad-story games (lies... lies..))\n\nOne of the best games I ever played and that is a truth.\n","August 12, 2014","true","80.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This was a fun play. For those who have played Bioshock, this is a no brainer. You need to get it. Here are some things to keep in mind. There is not a lot of new groundbreaking material, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. When the first game got so many elements right, this game just transferred those elements to this game. Atmosphere, combat, and finding upgrades and shinies are just as fun and interesting as the first game. Plus, you get to be a Big Daddy. Thats just awesome. The only slight downer is the story. It is not a bad story at all, but it does not contain the massive twist that the first game had. Instead, the reveal in this game just answers questions you may have had during the game. There are a variety of endings depending on how merciful or cold-hearted you are.

Instead it trades some novelty for an amazing thematic strength and even better gameplay than the first.\n\nThe biggest thing the Bioshock 2 developers deserve a lot of credit for is really investing themselves into the core concept of the game. The idea was that this time you are the Big Daddy. They could have just half-♥♥♥♥♥ the idea, and just made it Bioshock 1 with more clanking noises and a drill-arm. Instead they really went all-out with the concept. The game somewhat gently steers you into really behaving like a Big Daddy does from beginning to end, but in such a way that you may not really realize until you've already been doing it for three or four hours first.\n\nIt's pretty brilliantly done, at least I thought so. I've never seen a developer aim for a particular feeling from the gameplay itself and succeed so perfectly.","July 14, 2012","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It allows iron sights, which is awesome, and quick plasmid usage. The way this works it you have a weapon on your main hand and plasmid on your off hand at the same time. The variety of plasmids is also cool. The customization of BioShock games never cease to amaze me. Whether you want to be big badass Delta with a drill and offensive plasmids, or take a more subtle approach with the spear gun and stealthy plasmids, Bioshock 2 can provide such an experience.\n\nHacking and Research: This game decided to simplify hacking. Instead of having to play a puzzle minigame like in BioShock, you now need to land the hack needle on green or blue zones, green successfuly completeing hack while blue doing the same plus giving a free item. The Research system was overhauled. Instead of taking pictures of the target to gain research, now you have to video tape them. To get the best possible research, one must kill the target using a mixture of weapons, plasmids, npcs or security bots.\n\nStory and Atmosphere:	 I don't understand why people don't like the story of BioShock 2. Though it doesnt follow Jacks life, which was clearly ended at the end of BioShock, its still pretty interesting.  The adventure of Delta and Sinclair on their way to save Eleanor was a great idea. They made sure to make you sad when you had to put down Sinclair. Also the endings are either sad of bad, there is no real happy one.  BioShock 2 does a great job in keeping the experience atmospheric, just like in the first game.\n\nOverall:	 This game is better than the first one. If you like any of the above features, its a must have.\n10/10 would take fall damage to see Delta make a mini earthquake.","December 13, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And though I'm going to recommend this title, I want to caveat the fact that it is by far, the worst in the franchise. It's well worth picking up on sale due to the fact that its story line reflects on the other two titles, but not worth it's asking price. Lets get into why....\n\nI was warned by a friend that this game was sub par to the original BioShock, but at first blush I was confused as to why. It looked like a vast improvement, with brushed up graphics, new weapons, new enemies, and the ability to play as a Big Daddy. All things that should have made this a block buster game, but are handled so poorly that in the end it actually leaves you very disappointed.\n\nWhere to start..... The brushed up graphics at first seem to be a big improvement over the original. They fix one of my gripes about the first game with plenty of new Splicers, each with different voices and outfits, they even added new types of Big Daddy. The problem with this is that you eventually notice that what they've done is remove the glassy, 40s stylized look from the first game, and made everyone look more "realistic". This is a huge disappointment, as it damages the mood the first game set and the surreal look, setting Rapture as far away from ordinary as a city at the bottom of the sea should be. And though they did an alright job making the Splicer's look deformed, it's not the same feeling from the first game where things were bulbous and misshaped or looked out of a 40s pulp comic. The Big Daddy suffers from this problem too as they even out its proportions and turn the Little Sisters into just normal girls with headlamps for eyes.\n\nWeapons are improved from the first game, with things like a rivet gun, .50 Cal, drill, things a Bid Daddy would carry. However, these guns seem to pack less than the punch you would expect. Splicers are brutal and manage to eat tons of rounds with only hits to the head seeming to do anything. Rather than hacking like the first game, they give you a wrist mounted tool, that fires remote "tubes" that allow you to hack from a distance. This sounds amazing till you discover they nerfed the hacking  from the tube puzzle, to a Pre-Skool metronome color match game. This does nothing to solve my gripe from the first game, where hacking stops being a challenge and becomes a chore that you dread. And to remove ANY challenge from this process is worst of all, patronizing the player and making it more busywork. Ammo is dropped in a frustratingly random way, always seeming to give you rounds for every gun but the one you need, and the first half of the game is so stingy with drops that you will run into the red if not out of almost every round by the time they toss you up against your first boss. Money is also unbalanced, leaving you dry when you most need it, and like BioShock, the limited wallet space is so annoying that it makes you want to punch a kitten in the neck. Also, the game seems to throw a lot of "junk" at you in boxes and dead splicers, that seem to do nothing! In the first game, drinks, smoking, and eating would give you bonus and detraction in stats depending. But in this game, you get swamped with odd food items, tons of drinks, and random objects that flash by you so quickly that you really have no idea what they do or what they're for. You find yourself slamming the "loot all" button and pray that it's doing something beneficial.\n\nNext, is the fact that you're playing as an original design Big Daddy, or Delta series. Naturally, this unique and should be an enjoyable adventure, but sadly it isn't. And why? Because for some reason I can't seem to figure out, you are as weak as wet toilet paper. Yes, the massive Big Daddy from BioShock, that can kill you in one shoulder charge, is reduced to something a Splicer can kill with some errant gun fire. And don't give me the excuse that it's because he's and older model, as the game shows in the open that he can crush Splicers with hardly a thought, but once the game starts, all that power is gone. In fact, it feels like you have LESS health than the protagonist from the first game! This is utterly insane. As a Big Daddy, I should be able to swat Splicers like flies, and of course, the other Big Daddy have no problems doing this, yet even though Delta uses Plasmids as well as eight unique weapons, he's still weaker than just about everything. And this really blows, because they could have pulled a huge contrast to the survival aspect from the first game, by utilizing the massive size and armor of the Big Daddy to wade through huge amounts of smaller enemies and larger, more brutal "boss" situations. That's not to say it's all bad, as you can "adopt" Little Sister's from fallen Big Daddy and protect them as they collect ADAM from bodies littered around Rapture. This is rather enjoyable, and creepy as the Little Sister's vocalizations are just bizarre.\n\nAnother glaring problem with this game is the plot.... The story line to this game, in a word, stinks.... except in winter, when it stinks on ice... It makes little sense, and doesn't do a damn thing to try and sell it to you. The concept is beyond weak, where a character magically shows up to take over after Ryan and Fontaine are dead, and SUPRISE, is an integral part of Rapture though no one deemed her important enough to mention in the first game. And believe me, this woman is so utterly annoying that you'll want to drip poison into your own ear, rather than have to listen to a single word Sofia Lamb has to say. If the first game was trying to covertly extol the Communist agenda (which it didn't), Lamb picks no bones about being a tree hugging, collectivist, self serving, commie pinko ♥♥♥♥♥. This woman is the thing that never shuts up, and she verbally assaults you non stop through the ENTIRE GAME. And truly this is a major problem, because again, all the updates in the graphics department can't save a game with faulty plot. Another huge problem is, after making Delta out to be some long lost dare devil that stumbled onto Rapture they simply drop any explanation of his back story, and even worse, kills him at the end for NO APPARENT REASON! Can you say poor plot device?! Somehow I feel if they hadn't wasted time building a crappy PVP Multi-player mode where adolescent boys can cross ♥♥♥♥♥ and brag about how many kills they have, we would have had a more rich single player story.\n\nWith all that said, there are some very good points about this game that in a way save it. Again, despite the realistic graphics, Bioshock 2 still manages to build a fantastic mood, with some of the visuals giving me chills. There is a large glass window that overlooks the ruins of Rapture that simply made my blood cold, as well as a fantastic scene of a "Rosie" Big Daddy doing something other escorting a Little Sister. There was also a great section where you got to see out of a Little Sister's eyes, where Rapture appears to still be a heavenly place filled with satin drapes, pillows, and rose petals. Sadly, this is mismanaged as well, seeing as the scene is short and serves no more purpose than to be a gimmick to extend the ending. They also do a great job on making you feel Delta's weight, as the floors creek, jumping is limited, and movement slow and methodical. Plasmids are improved and bugs fixed, but again it seems you use the stun ability of the Electric Plasmid more than any other. Voice acting is again is phenomenal despite Lamb, though the mapping suffered because the game is formatted for console rather than PC.\n\nTo summarize, the game has many faults and at times feels unworthy of being the successor to the original, but still manages to be a good play at the right price. However, if 2K ever decides to pull a mulligan, this game deserves it far more than the original.","September 13, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are really into diving for  30 seconds max in between shootouts, you might really like this game too. Although it might not seem that way, the game has really good pacing and never have I felt bored playing the game, although it can be tiring to fight a big sister with as much health as a ♥♥♥♥ing level 90 tank in WoW. Most of that comes from the weaponry; as I previously mentioned, you get to shove your typical Big-Daddy-Drill into any splicers bumhole, and there are a couple really powerfully handled, awesome weapons to be found and upgraded.

Compared to Bioshock 1, the weapons are  better and most importantly now we don't have to switch between weapon and plasmid.\n\nFor the story line, Bioshock 1 is I think better. This game lacks of twist like Bioshock 1 and the creepy mysterious feeling of Underwater world is not as intriguing as the first one because I already familiarize with its environment. The enemies are, in my opinion,  somehow weaker.\n\nBut overall the game is good. Worth to buy.","December 4, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead it trades some novelty for an amazing thematic strength and even better gameplay than the first.\n\nThe biggest thing the Bioshock 2 developers deserve a lot of credit for is really investing themselves into the core concept of the game. The idea was that this time you are the Big Daddy. They could have just half-♥♥♥♥♥ the idea, and just made it Bioshock 1 with more clanking noises and a drill-arm. Instead they really went all-out with the concept. The game somewhat gently steers you into really behaving like a Big Daddy does from beginning to end, but in such a way that you may not really realize until you've already been doing it for three or four hours first.\n\nIt's pretty brilliantly done, at least I thought so. I've never seen a developer aim for a particular feeling from the gameplay itself and succeed so perfectly.","July 14, 2012","true","44.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It allows iron sights, which is awesome, and quick plasmid usage. The way this works it you have a weapon on your main hand and plasmid on your off hand at the same time. The variety of plasmids is also cool. The customization of BioShock games never cease to amaze me. Whether you want to be big badass Delta with a drill and offensive plasmids, or take a more subtle approach with the spear gun and stealthy plasmids, Bioshock 2 can provide such an experience.\n\nHacking and Research: This game decided to simplify hacking. Instead of having to play a puzzle minigame like in BioShock, you now need to land the hack needle on green or blue zones, green successfuly completeing hack while blue doing the same plus giving a free item. The Research system was overhauled. Instead of taking pictures of the target to gain research, now you have to video tape them. To get the best possible research, one must kill the target using a mixture of weapons, plasmids, npcs or security bots.\n\nStory and Atmosphere:	 I don't understand why people don't like the story of BioShock 2. Though it doesnt follow Jacks life, which was clearly ended at the end of BioShock, its still pretty interesting.  The adventure of Delta and Sinclair on their way to save Eleanor was a great idea. They made sure to make you sad when you had to put down Sinclair. Also the endings are either sad of bad, there is no real happy one.  BioShock 2 does a great job in keeping the experience atmospheric, just like in the first game.\n\nOverall:	 This game is better than the first one. If you like any of the above features, its a must have.\n10/10 would take fall damage to see Delta make a mini earthquake.","December 13, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However it was more action pushed rather than its predecessor which was more close combat and horror.\nOver all i was impressed. The ending and the lead up to the end was great.\n\nHOWEVER... the multiplayer is completely dead. this was extremely dissapointing. No matter what you do. you will be sitting in a empty server for 30+ minutes and no one will ever join. And lets say they did "Which they didn't" you will need at least 10 people each game type at least. for most of the gametypes.\n\nbasically I was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing disapointed. the multiplayer was simply looking really sweet. and its kinda dishearting that a AAA game like this could not have mutiplayer servers. basically its set up like PVP so you cannot serach or find in a list you just click a button and hope someone joins.\n\nCheers,","April 3, 2012","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm gonna be honest and straightforward with you: it isn't as good as the first. However, I still think it's better than Infinite.\n\nThe combat system has been much improved from the first game, especially the plasmids. The endings are more varied and interesting, and less cookie-cutter than the "hurr durr ur evil u bomb da world; ur good u raise da gurlz to happy grownups" of the original. The main drawbacks to the game are its shorter length, simpler story, less interesting villains and side characters, ADAM harvesting system designed purely to make the game seem longer, and the thoroughly usless multiplayer that's more empty than your wallet after a Steam sale.\n\nEven with all of these issues, however, I still consider it a worthy installation in the franchise. Would I pay a full $20? Probably not, but then again I'm the kind of guy who doesn't buy a game unless it's 75% off, no matter how good. But if it's one of those $5 specials, and if you consider yourself a fan of BioShock, then there's no reason not to pick this one up.","December 28, 2013","true","101.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not that Bioshock 2 sucks. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game. What it lacks most though, are improvements. Much of the game felt like an addon to the first Bioshock. There are new areas to explore and new weapons, but that's all that's new. You do get to dual wield plasmids and weapons, but as exciting as that sounds, it's not much of a departure from the first game. Fortunately, the strength of the original's story still resonates in its sequel. The plot is still captivating and there are still the twist and turns we've come to love as a fan of Bioshock. As for the multiplayer, all I have to say is that it sucks.\n\nGrade: B","January 8, 2011","true","33.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as Delta one of the first big daddies who must get back to his little sister Elenore or die, but Sofia Lamb is the "queen" of Rapture now and you must fight her to get to your goal. Now Lamb isn't as a powerful character as Ryan was but she still is very instresting none the less. She has always fought Ryan even before the 1959 New Year's Eve riots but since Ryan is dead she has taken supreme control of the city with the family or the still very insane Splicers that follower her. Story wise is is pretty straght forward with the same well down vocie acting and diolog, but the story's giant plot twist that the Shock seires has become known for isnt that great. Plus the story was a little contrived, but does this make it a bad game.....no of course not. 2K Marin did a fine job and with the help of Ken Levine they made the game feel like a Shock rather then just run like a Shock game, yet the best thing of Bioshock 2 has to be the combat. Probably the best in any of the three Bioshocks massive improvements made fighting feel very smooth and more importently, fun. Just like Bioshock 1 improved the combat and gameplay machanics of System Shock 2 Marin has done the same to Bioshock 1. From the new trap ammo that allows you to lay traps for the fun ADAM gathering sequences in which you protect your little sister to get some sweet ADAM to the new weapons which look very cool 2k Marin has down a great job at making Bioshock 2 very VERY fun. None the less there are still some issues like the weaker story and some other things like the segments were yourun around with a flash light so it makes the game very spoopy, this really cheeses out the horror bit of Bioshcok 2 and seems to take the easy way out. Sure the game has its low bits but it has its high, Bioshock 2 may not be a bigger and better game os Bioshock 1 but it see,s to fall right next to it. Bioshock 2 isnt a bad game it's just different and different is good like this game is.","March 20, 2015","true","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are really into diving for  30 seconds max in between shootouts, you might really like this game too. Although it might not seem that way, the game has really good pacing and never have I felt bored playing the game, although it can be tiring to fight a big sister with as much health as a ♥♥♥♥ing level 90 tank in WoW. Most of that comes from the weaponry; as I previously mentioned, you get to shove your typical Big-Daddy-Drill into any splicers bumhole, and there are a couple really powerfully handled, awesome weapons to be found and upgraded. You feel actuallystrong in the game, not just like some flexed up Bodybuilder with double the ♥♥♥♥ that his mother possessed. But just like that particular roid-rage Arnold-Cutout, Bioshock 2 has one great weakness: The Glory of his predecessor. You can't top Arnold. He is just too glorious.\n\nWould I recommend?

And though I'm going to recommend this title, I want to caveat the fact that it is by far, the worst in the franchise. It's well worth picking up on sale due to the fact that its story line reflects on the other two titles, but not worth it's asking price. Lets get into why....\n\nI was warned by a friend that this game was sub par to the original BioShock, but at first blush I was confused as to why. It looked like a vast improvement, with brushed up graphics, new weapons, new enemies, and the ability to play as a Big Daddy. All things that should have made this a block buster game, but are handled so poorly that in the end it actually leaves you very disappointed.\n\nWhere to start..... The brushed up graphics at first seem to be a big improvement over the original. They fix one of my gripes about the first game with plenty of new Splicers, each with different voices and outfits, they even added new types of Big Daddy. The problem with this is that you eventually notice that what they've done is remove the glassy, 40s stylized look from the first game, and made everyone look more "realistic". This is a huge disappointment, as it damages the mood the first game set and the surreal look, setting Rapture as far away from ordinary as a city at the bottom of the sea should be. And though they did an alright job making the Splicer's look deformed, it's not the same feeling from the first game where things were bulbous and misshaped or looked out of a 40s pulp comic. The Big Daddy suffers from this problem too as they even out its proportions and turn the Little Sisters into just normal girls with headlamps for eyes.\n\nWeapons are improved from the first game, with things like a rivet gun, .50 Cal, drill, things a Bid Daddy would carry. However, these guns seem to pack less than the punch you would expect. Splicers are brutal and manage to eat tons of rounds with only hits to the head seeming to do anything. Rather than hacking like the first game, they give you a wrist mounted tool, that fires remote "tubes" that allow you to hack from a distance. This sounds amazing till you discover they nerfed the hacking  from the tube puzzle, to a Pre-Skool metronome color match game. This does nothing to solve my gripe from the first game, where hacking stops being a challenge and becomes a chore that you dread. And to remove ANY challenge from this process is worst of all, patronizing the player and making it more busywork. Ammo is dropped in a frustratingly random way, always seeming to give you rounds for every gun but the one you need, and the first half of the game is so stingy with drops that you will run into the red if not out of almost every round by the time they toss you up against your first boss. Money is also unbalanced, leaving you dry when you most need it, and like BioShock, the limited wallet space is so annoying that it makes you want to punch a kitten in the neck. Also, the game seems to throw a lot of "junk" at you in boxes and dead splicers, that seem to do nothing! In the first game, drinks, smoking, and eating would give you bonus and detraction in stats depending. But in this game, you get swamped with odd food items, tons of drinks, and random objects that flash by you so quickly that you really have no idea what they do or what they're for. You find yourself slamming the "loot all" button and pray that it's doing something beneficial.\n\nNext, is the fact that you're playing as an original design Big Daddy, or Delta series. Naturally, this unique and should be an enjoyable adventure, but sadly it isn't. And why? Because for some reason I can't seem to figure out, you are as weak as wet toilet paper. Yes, the massive Big Daddy from BioShock, that can kill you in one shoulder charge, is reduced to something a Splicer can kill with some errant gun fire. And don't give me the excuse that it's because he's and older model, as the game shows in the open that he can crush Splicers with hardly a thought, but once the game starts, all that power is gone. In fact, it feels like you have LESS health than the protagonist from the first game! This is utterly insane. As a Big Daddy, I should be able to swat Splicers like flies, and of course, the other Big Daddy have no problems doing this, yet even though Delta uses Plasmids as well as eight unique weapons, he's still weaker than just about everything. And this really blows, because they could have pulled a huge contrast to the survival aspect from the first game, by utilizing the massive size and armor of the Big Daddy to wade through huge amounts of smaller enemies and larger, more brutal "boss" situations. That's not to say it's all bad, as you can "adopt" Little Sister's from fallen Big Daddy and protect them as they collect ADAM from bodies littered around Rapture. This is rather enjoyable, and creepy as the Little Sister's vocalizations are just bizarre.\n\nAnother glaring problem with this game is the plot.... The story line to this game, in a word, stinks.... except in winter, when it stinks on ice... It makes little sense, and doesn't do a damn thing to try and sell it to you. The concept is beyond weak, where a character magically shows up to take over after Ryan and Fontaine are dead, and SUPRISE, is an integral part of Rapture though no one deemed her important enough to mention in the first game. And believe me, this woman is so utterly annoying that you'll want to drip poison into your own ear, rather than have to listen to a single word Sofia Lamb has to say. If the first game was trying to covertly extol the Communist agenda (which it didn't), Lamb picks no bones about being a tree hugging, collectivist, self serving, commie pinko ♥♥♥♥♥. This woman is the thing that never shuts up, and she verbally assaults you non stop through the ENTIRE GAME. And truly this is a major problem, because again, all the updates in the graphics department can't save a game with faulty plot. Another huge problem is, after making Delta out to be some long lost dare devil that stumbled onto Rapture they simply drop any explanation of his back story, and even worse, kills him at the end for NO APPARENT REASON! Can you say poor plot device?! Somehow I feel if they hadn't wasted time building a crappy PVP Multi-player mode where adolescent boys can cross ♥♥♥♥♥ and brag about how many kills they have, we would have had a more rich single player story.\n\nWith all that said, there are some very good points about this game that in a way save it. Again, despite the realistic graphics, Bioshock 2 still manages to build a fantastic mood, with some of the visuals giving me chills. There is a large glass window that overlooks the ruins of Rapture that simply made my blood cold, as well as a fantastic scene of a "Rosie" Big Daddy doing something other escorting a Little Sister. There was also a great section where you got to see out of a Little Sister's eyes, where Rapture appears to still be a heavenly place filled with satin drapes, pillows, and rose petals. Sadly, this is mismanaged as well, seeing as the scene is short and serves no more purpose than to be a gimmick to extend the ending. They also do a great job on making you feel Delta's weight, as the floors creek, jumping is limited, and movement slow and methodical. Plasmids are improved and bugs fixed, but again it seems you use the stun ability of the Electric Plasmid more than any other. Voice acting is again is phenomenal despite Lamb, though the mapping suffered because the game is formatted for console rather than PC.\n\nTo summarize, the game has many faults and at times feels unworthy of being the successor to the original, but still manages to be a good play at the right price. However, if 2K ever decides to pull a mulligan, this game deserves it far more than the original.","September 13, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played the first Bioshock game years ago on the Xbox 360 and so had explored Rapture before; but I didn't really know what to expect upon coming back to the franchise. The storyline is very compelleing, though finding most of the audio recorders is crucial to understanding all of the plot and setting, in my opinion. The combat feels much more involved and chaotic than Bioshock, with so many different weapons and abilities to choose from; you really would need a few playthroughs to be able to use them and/or upgrade them all. The plasmids (abilities) of this game are by far the gem of the game and much fun can be had from using different combinations.\n\nHowever, there are some bad points to this PC port of the game regarding the technical aspect of it; the most frustrating being 'failed to load save game file' and random crashes to desktop.

You play as Delta one of the first big daddies who must get back to his little sister Elenore or die, but Sofia Lamb is the "queen" of Rapture now and you must fight her to get to your goal. Now Lamb isn't as a powerful character as Ryan was but she still is very instresting none the less. She has always fought Ryan even before the 1959 New Year's Eve riots but since Ryan is dead she has taken supreme control of the city with the family or the still very insane Splicers that follower her. Story wise is is pretty straght forward with the same well down vocie acting and diolog, but the story's giant plot twist that the Shock seires has become known for isnt that great. Plus the story was a little contrived, but does this make it a bad game.....no of course not. 2K Marin did a fine job and with the help of Ken Levine they made the game feel like a Shock rather then just run like a Shock game, yet the best thing of Bioshock 2 has to be the combat. Probably the best in any of the three Bioshocks massive improvements made fighting feel very smooth and more importently, fun. Just like Bioshock 1 improved the combat and gameplay machanics of System Shock 2 Marin has done the same to Bioshock 1. From the new trap ammo that allows you to lay traps for the fun ADAM gathering sequences in which you protect your little sister to get some sweet ADAM to the new weapons which look very cool 2k Marin has down a great job at making Bioshock 2 very VERY fun. None the less there are still some issues like the weaker story and some other things like the segments were yourun around with a flash light so it makes the game very spoopy, this really cheeses out the horror bit of Bioshcok 2 and seems to take the easy way out. Sure the game has its low bits but it has its high, Bioshock 2 may not be a bigger and better game os Bioshock 1 but it see,s to fall right next to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/8850/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Bioshock 2 is a sequel to the original game and was developed by 2K Marin. The game, taking place roughly seven years after Bioshock, follows the story of Subject Delta, an early prototype Big Daddy, as he tries to reunites himself with his original Little Sister while trying to survive the danger of a derelict Rapture, now under the command of a psychiatrist, Sophia Lamb, with total opposite philosophical views from Andrew Ryan.\nAs far as gameplay goes, Bioshock 2 doesn't introduce anything exactly breathtaking over the first game's formula, only tweaking some elements and adding some novelities along the line. The biggest difference between the first and the second game is that now you can fire plasmids and weapons at the same time, hack security machines and other mechanism remotely thanks to a dedicated tool, several enemies from the original game are now more dangerous one way or the other and you'll have to face far more kinds of elite enemies (and not all of them are Big Daddies). As far as general difficulty goes Bioshock 2 manages to be a mixed bag: while the opposition you will encounter is far more deadly than the one in the first game, you are given plenty of new plasmids, tonics and weapons to compensate, and, much like the other games in the series, Bioshock 2 actually becomes easier as you progress into it.\nThe story of Bioshock 2 was recived in a variety of ways. The main plot is, at its core, a self-insert fic which tries to expand the characters and the story of the first game while introducing some new elements that however do tend to make little sense at times (the biggest problem here being that we are introduced to new characters and events that were supposedly of major importance in Rapture's history, and therefore should had been mentioned in the original Bioshock too). There is also some consent that the plot of the original game didn't need an expansion whatsoever. Still, Bioshock 2 manages to tell a fairly good story on its own thanks to a cast of (mostly) interesting and emotional characters. The game also features a rudimentary moral system: depending of few decisions you are called to make regarding the Little Sisters and some major NPCs, you can get a different ending.\nBioshock 2 also features a multiplayer mode, dubbed "The Fall of Rapture". However, as I'm writing this review, this mode has been pretty much abbandoned and it's downright impossible to meet other players, let alone start any match. It's worth mentioning that Bioshock 2 multiplayer wasn't exactly that well recived though.\nAs it stands, Bioshock 2 feels pretty much like an expansion pack for the original Bioshock instead of a deep, epic and completely overhauled sequel. If you can get over this fact, however, you will find that the game is genuinely enjoyable on many levels","October 3, 2013","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the storyline makes sense if you haven't played the first, it will be a complete picture if you play the first.\n\nMore dystopia, more splicers, new baddies and a few different game mechanics.\nThis game carries on from Bioshock and does a nice job of it. Starting from about the time Fontane was rising in power and Ryan in dismay, a new "leader" emerges. Dr. Lamb is quite the accomplished Psychiatrist. Her daughter, Eleanor is to be "the one" uniting force in this "utopia".\n\nYou can kind of see where this is going, of course. Ryan had similar visions, albeit without a child as the visionary.\n\nYou play a Big Daddy. Yes, those "disgusting and ugly brutes" as Tenenbaum would say.\n\nYou are the hero but without spoiling too much more, it gets interesting. 2K did a great job in the latter stages of the story telling process and having Eleanor as a guide worked well.\n\nIf you played the first one, you will notice some game mechanic changes.\nKeybinds may be wonky to start with but you will explode a rocket at your feet prematurely and accidentally. Well, at least I did.\nI found the keybinds didn't translate well from the first to the second game so, a little time mapping your keybinds from the first may fix all of that.\n\nThe research is still there and is a little easier to manage. No longer do you have to switch your weapon from the camera, but now its a video. The more interesting it is, the more research points. There are 4 research stages. As soon as you get the camera, roll that video on everything you see. It helps later on.\n\nHacking is no longer out of the live game environs so, take cover while hacking.\n\nApart from that, have fun slaying the baddies and stay alive out there.\n","May 4, 2015","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't have _quite_ as much impact as the former, largely due to the change of protagonist.\n\nAs Jack, even spliced up, you felt small.  Human.  Vulnerable.  There was a mile of freezing seawater between you and escape, and the lunatics had free run of the asylum... and drowning was something you would have no problem doing.  As Subject Delta (or, in Minerva's Den, Subject Sigma), you feel like a Big Daddy.  A little ponderous, but armoured, tough, and more than capable of beating a few splicers to death.\n\nThe story isn't quite as brilliant either - in the first game, Rapture was new (to you), and everything was exploration of Andrew Ryan's ruined dream.  Well, in 2, Rapture is just as pretty, just as fascinating... but not quite as new.  There's a certain sense of familiarity for those who've played through the first game and spent quite a few hours in the slowly decaying city.  It's worth noting that as with the first game, the art assets for Bioshock 2 are stunning.  Post-apocalyptic art deco and water effects make for a feast for the eyes.\n\nSome of the new Plasmids (plus the ability to use guns and plasmids at the same time) make for some real fun, mechanically, and even if you're feeling like a nice, tough Big Daddy, the Splicers haven't been sitting still either.  There are some real challenges at the higher difficulty levels.\n\nOverall, if you don't have it, but have played Bioshock, get this game, and play it.  If you don't have it, and _haven't_ played Bioshock, get Bioshock.  Then get this game and play it. :)","June 14, 2014","true","35.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Years later when I grabbed the aging title in the steam sales, I got a lot of "omg you're playing that?" remarks.  These comments were taken with a grain of salt, particularly given that some of the naysayers had never played the game. Nevertheless they weren't exactly wrong.\n\nAs it turned out, it's not actually a bad game. It's just not as good as Bioshock1, and if I had bought it full price I'd have been far less pleased.\n\nThere's no real innovation and frankly being a big slow clumpy metal man is a bit of a drag after having played the original mostly with stealth and traps. Yes, there are clyclone traps, but these were not all that useable in the end.\n\nThroughout the game II found myself constantly having to pop health packs, switch weapons who’s ammo capacity was abysmal, and avoiding enemy fire with line of sight. This rendered the "gimmik" of Project Delta, the main protagonist, rather unusable. What's the point of having a nifty giant drill attack if using it will put you in close quarters out in the open losing a good chunk of your health, and the "ammo" runs out quicker than you can say “this all looks the same.”\n\nThere are a shockingly low number of enemy unit types. Sure,  there are a few minor variations on the models, but the actual types? Very few. There's little in the way of environment either, with many assets seemingly plucked straight from the original and no real care having gone into differentiating the new parts of rapture you’re visiting from those you entered in BS1. All in all, the story is decent, and the voice overs very good. What lets the game down is the game design Not nearly enough thought was put into "is this actually FUN."\n\nBy the end, I was simply glad the whole thing was over (it's quite long if you explore) and I could move on to biosock infinite, so I made no moves towards the DLC, or multiplayer.\n\nIf you can get the game for less than 5 euro, it’s worth it if you liked bioshock 1. Turn the difficulty down to easy, and just mindlessly blast your way through while following the story.","January 19, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than that, the story can sometimes grab you in even when it seems to be dying. The dual wield really aimed my score to this game high, because if it wasn't for that, I'd be complaining so much in the game and probably just quit. I personally finished all of the Bioshock games (on my ps3) and I'm not disappointed in this game, it has it's moments.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/recommended/8850/","emnii","emnii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/","1171 products in account","Did you like Bioshock? Then you'll like Bioshock 2! They're really rather similar. The biggest difference is that since you are playing as one of the first Big Daddies, instead of your options being "rescue" or "harvest" little sisters, your options are now "adopt" or "harvest", with adoption requiring you to either drop off the little sister at a port hole for a small amount of ADAM or you set them down near a corpse and defend them from splicers while they gather ADAM for you. I'm a nice guy with a thirst for ADAM so I saved all the little sisters and gathered all the ADAM that I could, so I spent a lot of time fighting off splicers.\n\nI played on medium difficulty, and maybe I'm spoiled from recently replaying Bioshock on easy, but Bioshock 2 seems significantly more difficult. You can't carry as many health kits as you could in the first game, and I seem to remember the first one auto-using health kits when your health bottomed out until you ran out of kits. No such luck this time. The tradeoff they made here is that every weapon can be used for a melee attack, rather than having to switch to the melee weapon, which in this game is a massive drill.\n\nNow in Bioshock, the melee weapon was traditional Irrational Games wrench. With the electric jolt plasmid (the first plasmid in the game), and the wrench (the first weapon in the game), you could almost beat it without picking up a single other weapon. It was a super effective combo that only got better with support tonics. You have no such luck in Bioshock 2. In fact, as massive drills go, it takes a couple support tonics to make it feel like it's doing some real damage. It's kind of a bummer.\n\nThe plasmids got a healthy balancing. Winter blast is far more useful than I remember it being in the first game, and even insect swarm is more fun! I didn't really use some of the less hands-on plasmids, like decoy, or scout, or hypnotize. You get the same eight slots for them as in the first game. The tonics are better handled this time too, with no distinction being made between them. You just get a number of slots and you can fill them with whatever tonics you like without regard for their purpose. A lot of them return from the first game, with a handful of new ones suited for the changes in weaponry. Wrench lurker became drill lurker, and what not.\n\nThere's another for getting all of the weapon upgrades, and towards the end I was beginning to get nervous because I had a lot of upgrades unfulfilled but I found them all regardless. Apparently you won't get every weapon up to full upgrades by the end of the game, so you should be choosy with what weapons you want to use. The game has a nasty habit of giving you a new weapon right after you've come across an upgrade station, and that kind of sucks because you can't un-upgrade a weapon and then use that upgrade station on the new gun.\n\nHacking has changed for the better, unless you've got slow reflexes. Instead of being a game of pipe-dream, it's a simple needle that goes back and forth and you just need to hit the A button when it's over a green section. Sometimes you need to hit a number of green slots to succeed, and if you hit a red slot you set off the security systems, and if you hit a white slot you take damage. It's easier and faster than the first game, and from the start you're given a tool to hack machines from a distance, which replaces the need from the first game to shock them with electric jolt and then run up and hack them.\n\nIf you've liked Bioshock, this one's a no-brainer. It's more of the first game, but better, with only a little cognitive dissonance from making a sequel to a game that wasn't made to have a sequel. If you didn't like Bioshock, you probably won't like Bioshock 2. It doesn't change enough from the original formula to make it a different game. If you never played the first game, I'd recommend going through it before hopping on Bioshock 2. It's a fantastic game, it's cheap, and Bioshock 2 basically assumes you played the first game and doesn't make an effort to explain the world of Rapture again.","November 25, 2013","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/8850/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on March 16, 2010\n\nBioshock 2 is the full fledged sequel to Bioshock, although at times it feels more like an expansion pack to the original...\n\nGameplay-\nThe gameplay of Bioshock 2 is largely an improvement over the original, with the player taking on the role of a Big Daddy prototype instead of Jack. Prototype is the operative word here, however, as with the exception of having a drill and clunky sound effects when moving or jumping, you never really feel like a big daddy. Splicers can often cause you large amounts of damage with small arms or melee weapons in only a few hits, which is very similar to the first game. I understand why this choice was made, for balance purposes, and I actually largely agree with it, but the feeling of being a clunking metal behemoth is never really there.\n\nHowever, on an overall level, the sequel makes several key improvements. simultaneous usage of plasmids and weapons make combat much more fluid and satisfying, and the introduction of new enemies (alphas, brutes, big sisters) and the revamping of old ones (spider splicers, rumbler daddies) really contribute to this. Also, the game feels a good deal harder than the original without sacrificing the ability to make gameplay choices, and this is partially accomplished by upping the ante of combat. Where before you would only see 2-3 splicers an engagement, in Bioshock 2 it is not uncommon to engage a brute or two and 3-4 leadhead splicers in the same area.\n\nThe adopt/save/harvest mechanic with the little sisters works very well, allowing you to kill big daddies as before, and choose whether to a) harvest them right away b) have them gather ADAM for you and then harvest them c) save them right away d) have them gather and then save them. Obviously the best choice either way is to have them harvest ADAM from special corpses in the level first to get more ADAM, but this adds a great deal of moral and gameplay depth to the little sister dynamic. Plus, having the little sister ride on your shoulders and comment on combat as you go along is at times hilarious, or just cute, and a little sad. A very nice touch. Messing with the little sisters angers the big sisters, who often come for you after you've dealt with most of the little sisters in the level. They serve as improvised and random boss-fights, and are most definitely a challenge. They add a new source of tension (and ADAM) to the Bioshock formula.\n\nAnother gameplay change is the revamped Plasmid and Gene Tonic system. Plasmids at higher levels (2,3) have differentiated visual and gameplay effects, such as being able to charge up for more powerful attacks and shoot streams of elemental damage. They add a great deal of gameplay variety and re-playability. In addition, gene tonics are now all organized into one large slot, a welcome change, and some new ones have appeared that cover multiple effects, such as the elemental gene tonics. Finally, research remains useful but has been streamlined with a few minor tweaks.\n\nFinally, the much touted ocean underwater sequences remain a pretty but relatively gimmicky and useless area of gameplay, where you are basically placed in a tunnel from one airlock to another. They are incredibly atmospheric, but they serve very little gameplay purpose other than scrounging.\n\nVisuals-\nBioshock 2 is the full fledged sequel to Bioshock, although visually speaking it feels more like an expansion pack to the original. The game runs on the same engine as the original from 2007, and while innovations have been made in art design and level design, the same graphics remain largely untouched. The same low-res textures and effects are intact, and with the exception of new plasmid effects and a few minor tweaks, the technical graphics remain the same as they were in 2007. This is very upsetting, but it is an industry wide trend, and consoles are almost entirely responsible. Therefore, Bioshock 2 will not be penalized too harshly.\n\nArtistically, the game does not disappoint, and the sound effects that accompany these new designs create a great atmosphere for the city of Rapture that feels fresh the second time around. New posters, new music, new character models, new weapons, and new effects.\n\nStory-\nIn addition, the story, which has received some flak from Gamespot and other websites, is surprisingly good, and the audio diaries continue a wonderful trend from the first game that add a great deal of back story to Rapture and the tale of Andrew Ryan that newcomers and especially fans of the first game will love. Phoebe Lamb is the near antithesis of Andrew Ryan, and just as villainous for it, which is a refreshing change of pace. The ability to kill or spare certain key characters and the fact that such choices actually do have an impact on the story really adds to the replay value here. While the plot lacks the "holy s**t" factor of the original, it is quite well written and acted, and really draws you in, Bioshock fan or not.\n\nMultiplayer/GFWL-\nThe game also includes a full fledged multiplayer mode, which is pretty much all of the standard fps game modes you would expect, but from a Bioshock perspective. Throw in a Modern Warfare style leveling and unlock system and a surprisingly well integrated multiplayer backstory and you've got a very solid multiplayer mode. A very nice touch is the inclusion of specific characters with unlock able audio diaries, backstories and customizable appearances in lieu of traditional custom skins and models. They also have high quality voice acting for these avatars. A particularly nice touch is the in game player apartment, which serves as a front for a standard multiplayer menu, and gives us an incredibly atmospheric glimpse of life on the eve of Rapture's collapse. Various pieces of furniture and appliances serve as server browser, audio diary storage, loadout customization, avatar customization, and story introduction. In addition, there are a variety of maps, many of them revamped and cleaned up versions of locations from the first game which add a great deal to this atmospheric multiplayer.\n\nHowever, I have a bone to pick with Bioshock 2, and that is the forced installation of Games for Windows Live, without which you cannot save or load your game. Essentially you are tied to the service, which you are also forced to make an account with. This imposition is reminiscent of Ubisoft's recent DRM debacle and ties PC gamers to what is essentially Xbox Live for PC. I don't want this. Nobody wants this. I already have steam, why should I be forced to install GFWL? A small upset, maybe, but an important one.\n\nUltimately, Bioshock 2 takes the "if it ain't broke don't fix it" approach as a sequel, with some important and welcome exceptions. It doesn't blow my mind as the first one did, but it does do a great deal right, and with a few exceptions it makes very few unwelcome changes. It's a great game and a must buy for fans of the first.","December 31, 2013","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The original Bioshock was really well made, and this game wasn't really bad, but can get a bit boring. In my opinion I like the feeling of being a Big Daddy and having a different perspective on the little sisters, most annoying things are the big sisters that just come to attack you at random moments. Other than that, the story can sometimes grab you in even when it seems to be dying. The dual wield really aimed my score to this game high, because if it wasn't for that, I'd be complaining so much in the game and probably just quit. I personally finished all of the Bioshock games (on my ps3) and I'm not disappointed in this game, it has it's moments. I especially loves the graphics in all of the Bioshock games, especially how the places are unique and have their own backstory, rather than you just fighting in a floating city because you have a tattoo.

Turned out to be a very good game.  Bioshock 2, to me, was a lot easier to get into.  I held out  on playing this one because it didn't have controller support, but it was recently patched in when GFWL was removed.  Graphics are slghtly better than the first.  They can be improved by using the NVIDIA Control Panel for better AA and AF.  You can also improve the slow control responsiveness by altering the .ini file.  The game also has well-know sound issues.  This doesn't take away the fact that it's a lot of fun to play through.  You're a big daddy, and you will need to make the same choice of rescuing or "adopting" the little sisters.  I rescue them all to get the "good" ending :)  Plasmids and tonics still a lot of fun to play with, and finding all the recordings is essential to follow the story.  Rapture looks great!

However, the storyline feels a bit grindy and aimless, with the main character's goals feeling relatively unmotivated compared to those in the first game Yeah, he's dying, but for some reason it just doesn't feel compelling.

Playing as a Big Daddy must be the biggest plus of this title compared with others in the franchise, along with many improvements in combat system that even the later Bioshock infinite can't reach. The story, while not as deep or twisted as Infinite or the original Bioshock, leaves you with so many moral-wise decisions that affects how the game processes, and depends on how you chose, will haunt you for quite long after you've finished the game.","November 18, 2013","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Turned out to be a very good game.  Bioshock 2, to me, was a lot easier to get into.  I held out  on playing this one because it didn't have controller support, but it was recently patched in when GFWL was removed.  Graphics are slghtly better than the first.  They can be improved by using the NVIDIA Control Panel for better AA and AF.  You can also improve the slow control responsiveness by altering the .ini file.  The game also has well-know sound issues.  This doesn't take away the fact that it's a lot of fun to play through.  You're a big daddy, and you will need to make the same choice of rescuing or "adopting" the little sisters.

The gist of it is you’re a prototype Big Daddy who got resurrected and you need to find your little sister (now grown up). On your journey, you go through misadventure to misadventure. Overall, not the strongest out of the Bioshock series\n\nGameplay- Gameplay is more polished and improved from the first game. While there are very few new plasmids, the old ones are improved and have more development than the first game (For example, Electro Bolt at Level 3 can shoot a stream of electricity and chain lightning) Gunplay is also very fun, but some weapons are better left untouched at a Power to the People station than others. Overall, solid and entertaining\n\nGraphics- The models are a step up from the first game, now more polished and scary looking. Environments are similar to the first game, but with improved textures and a more abandoned feel. In sum, an upgrade from the first game.\n\nControl- The controls were fine. You can now duel wield a plasmid and a weapon. Switching weapons and plasmids in a fight could become tricky, but isn't a major fault that affects the game.\n\nDifficulty- Identical to the first game, with the added challenge of being limited to 5 medkits and 5 EVE hypos. Most of the time it’s a fair incline, but be prepared to gluttonously consume medkit after medkit during some fights.\n\nPolishes- Hacking is improved (Replacing long boring tube puzzles with quick button pressing) Plasmids are fun to use and they defiantly spice up the gameplay. Research is also more innovative, making the player contribute.\n\nLow Points- Games for Windows Live (GFWL) sucks. There, I said it. I recommend finding a way to disable it and adding -dx9 to launch options (Oh and stay away from multiplayer if you don't want a sour taste to be left in your mouth). Also, you can't go back to previous areas, so better scavenge the area well.\n\nFinal Verdict: 7.5/10\n\nBioshock 2 improves upon the first game (gameplay wise), making it more enjoyable to play. However, the games basic plot and lack of social/political commentary may leave some fans disappointed. If you want a game that improves upon the first gameplay wise, but lacks any real voice, I recommend this. Otherwise, it's best to save up $10.00 more to buy Infinite\n","August 31, 2014","true","60.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your enjoyment will hinge on how much you liked the first BioShock, and how long it has been since you played it. I tried playing this game a while back right after I beat BioShock 1, and I just couldn't get into it. Fast forward a couple of years, and I really enjoyed it. For sure it suffers from "more of the same" syndrome, which is why my enjoyment increased exponentially returning to Rapture so long after playing the first game.\n\nI don't think the story is quite as compelling as the first game, but it's still excellent compared to most other games currently on the market. The graphics and sound are still amazing, and the level design is top notch.\n\nI did run into one "stuck" bug where a door closed behind me during a boss fight, and the boss was trapped in the room on the opposite side with no way for us to fight. Luckily, I had a save file I created just before the fight, so I just had to reload.

I played the first Bioshock game years ago on the Xbox 360 and so had explored Rapture before; but I didn't really know what to expect upon coming back to the franchise. The storyline is very compelleing, though finding most of the audio recorders is crucial to understanding all of the plot and setting, in my opinion. The combat feels much more involved and chaotic than Bioshock, with so many different weapons and abilities to choose from; you really would need a few playthroughs to be able to use them and/or upgrade them all. The plasmids (abilities) of this game are by far the gem of the game and much fun can be had from using different combinations.\n\nHowever, there are some bad points to this PC port of the game regarding the technical aspect of it; the most frustrating being 'failed to load save game file' and random crashes to desktop. I have left solutions for these at the bottom of the review. It's a shame the game has not patched and had this game not been gifted to me and I instead purchased it; I would be feeling quite annoyed.\n\nStill, it wasn't enough to ruin this masterpiece of a game. Everything in this game is so refined, the combat, the highly detailed and dynamic world which always keeps you on your toes, the element of reward for compulsive loot checkers like myself and the dialogue and ambience of the dystopican Rapture is brilliantly crafted. There are multiple endings to the game depending on your actions within the storyline. In some games this feels like a useless feature but in Bioshock 2 your actions have real tangile results so think your choices through carefully. Even with the problems of this game, I would thoroughly recommend it.\n\nTECHNICAL FIXES:[/b]\nThe save issue can be rectified by entering the ini file and rewriting the save file location to your current drive.\nCrash to desktop I believe this is unfixable. All I did was quicksave often and I never really lost any progress in the game when it did crash.\nIncorrect mouse sensitivity The game does not seem to save the correct mouse sensitivty setting. Upon resuming the game, go into the control menu and click 'apply' again before unpausing the game; this should resume the correct mouse settings.","July 30, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The art design is absolutely mesmerizing, complemented with a sensual soundtrack and astounding voice work. The gameplay is quite intuitive as well; guns feel distinct and your entire arsenal is an equillibrium of diverse offense. Plasmids feel unique and the inclusion of traps allows for a meticulous, strategic approach when protecting Little Sisters' and their harvesting. BioShock 2 succeeds in these aspects, though it falters in others.\n\nComparing this game with BioShock 1, however, proves much dissonance. While BioShock 1 provided enough backstory to support necessary explanation for things in the universe, BioShock 2 unloaded an excess- it feels forced, uninspired, and ultimately like fan fiction. The new information given in BioShock 2 doesn't mesh very well with what BioShock 1 established- the tone of the subject matter feels radically different between the two. The story of this game feels as though it lacks true progression of any sort, and ultimately hinders in pacing and character development. To make this game feel more as if it didn't belong in the main canon, it was entirely neglected in both episodes of Burial at Sea for BioShock Infinite- no mention of any characters, foreshadowing of any sort, and even entirely negates some of things established in BioShock 2.\n\nBioShock 2 is a love/hate game- on its own, it stands quite fine.

The combat was ok but the fact that you could only have 2 guns at a time really killed it for me. Bioshock 1 is good, but compared to 2 its nothing. In 2, you really feel the power of being a Big Daddy. Using plasmids while firing a massive .50 cal machine gun and drilling holes in hordes of splicers is endless fun. Youre a massive walking tank, and you can destroy anything in your way.\n\nI will admit the storyline isnt as good as Bioshock 1 or infinite, but its decent. Nothing to complain about.\n\nOverall, if you liked the basic combat of 1 or infinite and want to take it a step further, or youre looking for a dark sci fi shooter, this is the game for you.","May 8, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a pleasant surprise to find GFWL was gone when I reinstalled it which caused issues last time I attempted the game. The control scheme makes it clear that this is an xbox port but is still functional with a keyboard and mouse, though I suppose if you use a controller this doesn't matter in the slightest.\n\nI find it to be significantly less creepy than the first BioShock, despite the frequent encounters with Big Sisters, and seems to show a transition between the intentional horror of the first game and BioShock Infinite which sought mainly to disturb rather than scare.","December 20, 2013","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Years later when I grabbed the aging title in the steam sales, I got a lot of "omg you're playing that?" remarks.  These comments were taken with a grain of salt, particularly given that some of the naysayers had never played the game. Nevertheless they weren't exactly wrong.\n\nAs it turned out, it's not actually a bad game. It's just not as good as Bioshock1, and if I had bought it full price I'd have been far less pleased.\n\nThere's no real innovation and frankly being a big slow clumpy metal man is a bit of a drag after having played the original mostly with stealth and traps. Yes, there are clyclone traps, but these were not all that useable in the end.\n\nThroughout the game II found myself constantly having to pop health packs, switch weapons who’s ammo capacity was abysmal, and avoiding enemy fire with line of sight. This rendered the "gimmik" of Project Delta, the main protagonist, rather unusable. What's the point of having a nifty giant drill attack if using it will put you in close quarters out in the open losing a good chunk of your health, and the "ammo" runs out quicker than you can say “this all looks the same.”\n\nThere are a shockingly low number of enemy unit types. Sure,  there are a few minor variations on the models, but the actual types? Very few. There's little in the way of environment either, with many assets seemingly plucked straight from the original and no real care having gone into differentiating the new parts of rapture you’re visiting from those you entered in BS1. All in all, the story is decent, and the voice overs very good. What lets the game down is the game design Not nearly enough thought was put into "is this actually FUN."\n\nBy the end, I was simply glad the whole thing was over (it's quite long if you explore) and I could move on to biosock infinite, so I made no moves towards the DLC, or multiplayer.\n\nIf you can get the game for less than 5 euro, it’s worth it if you liked bioshock 1. Turn the difficulty down to easy, and just mindlessly blast your way through while following the story.","January 19, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/8850/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Bioshock 2 is a direct sequel to Bioshock, and as such can be directly measured up to it's predecessor. How well does it compare to the original?\nWell, both games have their own experience to give; both games have their own stories, characters and themes to follow, both games I feel have individual strengths over the other which makes both of them stand out. Bioshock 2 is a different journey through the dilapidated streets of Rapture, there are new locations to explore, new secrets to uncover, new weapons to use and new enemies to use them on...\nTo start out on what I feel are direct improvements over the previous game: The process of hacking machines has been improved tenfold, it's no longer a distracting element that takes the player out of the environment temporarily so they can solve a puzzle, it's a sequence of actions and reactions that tests the players reflexes and rewards them for success. Instead of a frustrating puzzle it's a needle simply moving back and forth waiting for the player to activate it while it's over a green area of the meter, this is a vast improvement over Bioshock 1 in my opinion because it's not distracting in the slightest, and instead of giving the player a massive mess to sort out its a simple imput system thats easy to use and understand.\nThe options on how to manage Little Sisters is a much more engaging experience, you can choose to harvest or adopt them temporarily. Adopting them gives you the option to use them to harvest Adam from corpses, which can increase your Adam intake by a large sum while still keeping your conscience clean, afterwards you can take them to a vent and again you are given the option to rescue or harvest them, what you do is your choice.\n\nNow to summarize the rest of the game: The story places you in the role of Subject Delta, an early prototype of the infamous Big Daddies: Your Little Sister has been taken from you and you have been killed in the process only to be revived by a Vita-Chamber, with no recollection of how you ended up there your only goal is to reuinite with your Little Sister, Elanor Lamb. To do this you must brave the run-down streets of Rapture which have seen eight years of neglect since the events of the first game. All the while the story reacts to your choices on how to deal with Little Sisters and other NPCs, giving the player one of (from what I understand) several different endings.\nThroughout Rapture you will come across some familiar enemies, Splicers, and some new blood-thirsy additions to the stock. Notably the Big Sisters, the Brute Splicers, the Rumbler Big Daddies and the Alpha Series. Each of the new enemies gives a lot more to the experience and are spread out, keeping the game from being unjustly overwhelming. The new weapons are a lot of fun to use and are adaptive to your respective playstyle thanks to the alternative ammunitions available to each one, allowing the player to be either extremely aggressive, you can be exploitive of your enemies weaknesses or being defensive setting up clever traps. The weapons and Plasmids, like Bioshock 1, are all reactive, fun to use and have a good powerful feeling to them. I'm especially fond of the spear gun, that little gem will forever hold a special place in my heart.\nLevels are again fun, flawless and well paced, with plenty of opportunity to explore and discover, and in doing so the player is rewarded with extra ammo and health as well as audio diaries delivering exposition to Rapture's recent years or not-so-ancient past. Not to mention the jaw-dropping visuals, haunting soundtrack and out-of-this-world graphics.\n\nNow the question that will always nag at me: Do I like this game or the original Bioshock more? All points and aspects considered I will have to go with the original. I like the story and characters so much more, it delivered a larger impact to me about a man struggling to break free of the chains keeping him enslaved without him even knowing it. Where Bioshock 2 takes on a sort of rescue story, which doesn't lend itself to the kind of tale that can justify the sheer amount of discovery that Rapture offers.\n\nUltimately Bioshock 2 cannot compete with its predecessor (but what can? That game was almost perfect in every regard), but still its a great game thats well thought-out and is a lot of fun to play through, keeping the elements of the original in place while giving the player some new toys to use.\n\nAnd before I forget: Users of DirectX 10 like myself will encounter crashing problems as they try to play, please refer to this guide for a long list of possible solutions:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210917941\nThanks to the writer of this guide for letting me enjoy this game to it's fullest potential without interruption.","July 18, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the storyline makes sense if you haven't played the first, it will be a complete picture if you play the first.\n\nMore dystopia, more splicers, new baddies and a few different game mechanics.\nThis game carries on from Bioshock and does a nice job of it. Starting from about the time Fontane was rising in power and Ryan in dismay, a new "leader" emerges. Dr. Lamb is quite the accomplished Psychiatrist. Her daughter, Eleanor is to be "the one" uniting force in this "utopia".\n\nYou can kind of see where this is going, of course. Ryan had similar visions, albeit without a child as the visionary.\n\nYou play a Big Daddy. Yes, those "disgusting and ugly brutes" as Tenenbaum would say.\n\nYou are the hero but without spoiling too much more, it gets interesting. 2K did a great job in the latter stages of the story telling process and having Eleanor as a guide worked well.\n\nIf you played the first one, you will notice some game mechanic changes.\nKeybinds may be wonky to start with but you will explode a rocket at your feet prematurely and accidentally. Well, at least I did.\nI found the keybinds didn't translate well from the first to the second game so, a little time mapping your keybinds from the first may fix all of that.\n\nThe research is still there and is a little easier to manage. No longer do you have to switch your weapon from the camera, but now its a video. The more interesting it is, the more research points. There are 4 research stages. As soon as you get the camera, roll that video on everything you see. It helps later on.\n\nHacking is no longer out of the live game environs so, take cover while hacking.\n\nApart from that, have fun slaying the baddies and stay alive out there.\n","May 4, 2015","true","25.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Utilizing a licensed third party keyboard mapping software utility I was able to play the game with an XBox 360 controller with great results. After initial setup game play immediately submerses you into an atmosphere similar to other popular titles mixing technology with old world charm. The mission based game play is somewhat loose allowing time to hunt down items and develope player character skills much in the vein of free roam titles.\n\nI found the game playable, challenging and quite enjoyable at a general level slightly better than average. The title is somewhat the must have due to its franchise lineage and doesn't require much more than a familiarity with the first in the line to wrap your mind around direction and plot. Game play mechanics, graphics and general mood do well to hold the title together and should easily fill a good weekend bender for more skilled players.","May 9, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is arguably improved a bit from the first game, with a broader weapon set and extra polish, as well as some tweaked plasmids (Security Command is a fun one- lets you summon flying security bots wherever you are). However, the storyline feels a bit grindy and aimless, with the main character's goals feeling relatively unmotivated compared to those in the first game Yeah, he's dying, but for some reason it just doesn't feel compelling. You never actually meet two of the big characters in the game- Sinclair and Sofia Lamb- in any major role physically, so they just feel like voices in your head for most of the game. Also, this game is as glitchy as the first, if not more, and will probably crash you out to the desktop more than a couple times. Quicksave will be your best friend.\n\nReservations aside, I highly recommend this game, because the slight complaints I have are well worth sticking through for the experience of the game as a whole.","May 5, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

None of BS 1-2 ran correctly in full screen even after the latest patch (1.5.0.019 of BS2). Mouse click always switched them to windowed mode furthermore BS2 changed the aspect ratio to portrait (wtf?!) however I played it on a similar old pc on 4:3 aspect ratio.

The scrawny, overlooked middle child of the Bioshock franchise. Neither the adrenaline-soaked action of Infinite, nor the dark, atmospheric journey of discovery of the original. Now that I've played it I can see why it was a let down for many.\n\nHere is an example of when worlds collide for the worst. The ability to wield the power of the Sith in one hand and the power of the Terminator in the other does not suit the dreary tromp through Rapture's half flooded tunnels. It's an action game in a horror setting, where the action overwhelms any sense of dread, knowing that whatever pops around the corner will find themselves just another red smear on the soggy carpet in the blink of an eye.\n\nWriting is far weaker than the original. Sofia Lamb is a little more than Andrew Ryan, except she was found in the clearance aisle of Villains R Us. Like Ryan, she calls out your actions throughout the game, but never succeeds in getting under your skin. Minor villains come and go with no significant buildup nor payoff. The moral choice system is back, too. Just as useless as it was in the first game.\n\nSpeaking of mechanics, playing as a Big Daddy turns the 'Little Sister Escort' level from the original game into a game mechanic, again with the ability to save or harvest them once their Adam collecting is done. The 'save or harvest' aka 'good or evil' mechanic was already pretty gimmiky in the original game and even more so now. Any player who pays any amount of attention to escorting Little Sisters will be positively swimming in Adam, without a single harvest.\n\nAll in all, though, Bioshock 2 is still a worthy game, despite feeling more 'DLC' than 'sequel'. It does an admirable job of expanding upon the lore of the original game and fielded some new mechanics that would be refined and put to greater use in Infinite. Had it not need to follow in the footsteps of the original Bioshock it likely would have fared far better than it did.\n\nOn the note of Bioshock Infinite, the similarities between Bioschocks 2 and Infinite are quite noticeable. Beyond the mechanics there's the father-daughter team, with the daughter as a support character, going up against a deluded tyrant insane with the goal of utopia. There's the insane religious dudes, the frustrated minority, sick of discrimination, and the painting of the protagonist as the harbinger of doom to a close-knit society. Get the feeling that, like Subject Delta, this game is a prototype. At least it's a fun one.","July 19, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A change needed for the more action-y nature of the game when compared to the original Bioshock.\n\nWhile the gameplay feels very familiar, the storytelling isn't. The difference comes from the fact that the first game was all about introducing the player to Rapture and telling him the story of it. What was driving us all was the discovery, walking through the city that fell from its glory and plunged into darkness. That, and a very well constructed plot with just the right amount of surprises.\nYou won't find that in the sequel - we know the place, we know the story. The plot got much simpler. What is it about, then? Feelings. Bioshock made you listen to the tale, yet stay a bit to the side. Bioshock 2, on the other hand, sacrifices some of it to make you feel and experience the Rapture as  Big Daddy. It's pulled off very well, and keeps the game on high level even if it is nto married to the same idea as the original. Gathering, protecting, curing, harvesting - it all feels more personal now. Same how it is for all the encounters with the 'main NPCs', which you can kill or spare. They all are relevant to who you play. You are not a 'stranger', but a part of the city. This aspect, and the general attitude of resorting to showing instead of telling gives this one a unique charm.","September 10, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think storyline wise, I like 1, but I'm not finished with 2 so that's a premature judgement.

Yeah. Welcome to a Over-destroyed rapture, where splicers have evolver to HUNT big daddies, wich doesn't makes your travel easy. New big daddies are kicked in the back directly to the streets of Rapture, and you only have one interest: Get yourself to your Little Sister, wich is AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CITY.

Now i say randomly, but it only crashed in the very beginning and the end for me. however, i have seen it crash for other people. there are 2 solutions for this; 1 is to save very, very often. this is obvious, but if you save often the odds of you losing a lot of progress are minimized. 2 is to follow Denis's guide;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210917941\nif you dont want to leave steam, this is what i did; right click bioshock 2 and click on properties, go to "set launch options", add "-dx9", and the game should work. the only downside is that the graphics get a serious downgrade. if you do route 2, i suggest doing it BEFORE you start the game so you wont notice the difference. i did it at the second to last area and it was really obvious the graphics became worse. i dont even know how to undo the "-dx9" stuff, so it might be permanent. (of course you could try uninstalling and re-installing.)

Bioshock 2 is a great example on why not all sequels are bad.

So naturally, that meant I was looking forward to playing this game. And I was not disappointed. "Bioshock 2" really does manage to keep the fun of it's predecessor, and giving a good story to follow. Though at times, it felt like it was lacking. But I still played through it, and I got a satisfactory enjoyment out of it.\n\nI bought this game with "Bioshock" and "Bioshock Infinite", so after completing the first game, I jumped right in to this one.  The story is very heart wrenching, with an interesting theme, and it expands upon it's setting, while still maintaining the spirit of the first game.\n\nWe return to Rapture in this game, eight years after the first game ended. And it looks worse for the wear. Having played the first game, I really felt some of the awe was gone from wanting to explore. But I still found it fun to see other places in Rapture that weren't in the first game, and I really enjoyed the aesthetics, how much of a novelty this city is. The game uses the same graphics from the first game, but it still keeps the setting looking very nice, and I liked how it incorporated underwater areas, which are very gorgeous to go through.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively unchanged from the first game. This helps maintain the learning curve the first game had, making it easy for first-time and returning players to get into the game. I still enjoyed using the Plasmids, they're really nice. But I liked how you no longer had to switch from weapons to plasmids, as Subject Delta (the player character) can use both at the same time, which is a definite improvement. I also liked how you no longer needed to divide tonics into categories, giving you one full selection. Like in the first game, you could make Subject Delta your own character with your choice of Plasmids and Tonics to suit your own gameplay style. I tended to focus on hacking more, since I hacked a lot of stuff in this game.\n\nBut what I really liked was that you were playing as a Big Daddy, allowing you to get a sense of what it's like being one. Whenever you adopt Little Sisters, you can either harvest them or take them with you to gather more ADAM or take them to an air vent and free them. However, the Little Sister defense got really repetitive for me, and more of an annoyance over time, but I really wanted that extra ADAM for more Plasmids and Tonics.\n\nThe plot wasn't as predictable as I expected, and the game really turned up the morality to make it more meaningful in the long run. It still keeps it straightforward and never overcomplicates it with too much plot, like the first game. It no longer revolves around saving or harvesting Little Sisters. You encounter certain characters who have a connection to Subject Delta, and you get the choice to either kill them or let them live. This really affects how the final act of the game takes place. I also liked Eleanor Lamb, and her connection to Subject Delta in contrast to her connection to Sofia Lamb, giving a great theme of parents going to extreme lengths for their child's welfare. I really hated Sofia and her stupid ideas, and this game suceeds in the same place of making an extremely unlikable antagonist, it makes you keep going.\n\nI liked how they changed the hacking minigame, but it's still annoying, as you have to pay very close attention to the needle when it hits the right spot.\n\nThe enemy variety is unchanged, but with the addition of the Brutes and Big Sisters. Both of them were extremely annoying, even after I got better weapons, plasmids, and ammo. But the Big Sisters, they add more of a risk to saving/harvesting the Little Sisters, and they make you really duck for cover before you fight them, so they do have a bit of a scare factor. And again, USE THE CAMERA! You'll need the research.\n\nI overall liked this game. It delivered what it promised, the setting still holds up, the gameplay is still easy to learn, and the plot is still kept pretty simple, and the morality is expanded upon to make it more meaningful. I was disappointed that the game didn't really have much else to offer, but it's still a good time. I intend to play this game again soon.","November 17, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a superb Unreal shooter wrapped in mediocre level design and story. The gunplay is worthy of a sequel to Bioshock, but the story itself fails in one key point: making you care about the characters that occupy the world. Bioshock 1 had great pacing for introducing characters that seemed reasonable and slowly descended into the realm of madness as the game progressed - 2 just throws you into the madhouse and asks that you kindly shoot it up.\n\nThere are tons of brilliant and unique ideas in Bioshock 2, but they're missing that master touch - it's like a poor imitiation without really understanding the reasoning behind the design decisions of the first game. I have no doubt that with another 8 months and a rewrite the game could've been stellar. If you really like the shooting, then by all means play the main campaign, but that's about all you're going to get from it.\n\nThe multiplayer is dead nowadays, but it was one of the better Unreal experiences online when it launched since it relied on the excellent gunplay and plasmid mechanics of the campaign.\n\nThe reason I am recommending this game (on sale) is because of the DLC. Minerva's Den is an excellent piece of design, in both level and story. It's a phenomenal experience and is convincingly alive in the world of Bioshock. Buy the game and DLC (again on sale) and play Minerva's Den. The pacing, writing, dialogue, and thought that went into it is worth of some real Bioshock material.

Utilizing a licensed third party keyboard mapping software utility I was able to play the game with an XBox 360 controller with great results. After initial setup game play immediately submerses you into an atmosphere similar to other popular titles mixing technology with old world charm. The mission based game play is somewhat loose allowing time to hunt down items and develope player character skills much in the vein of free roam titles.\n\nI found the game playable, challenging and quite enjoyable at a general level slightly better than average. The title is somewhat the must have due to its franchise lineage and doesn't require much more than a familiarity with the first in the line to wrap your mind around direction and plot.

They once again present us one of the greatest stories in the gaming history.\nThe improved gameplay makes the game much more intuitive. It feels like the game is shorter than the first one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/8850/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","Bioshock 2 is a sequel to the original game and was developed by 2K Marin. The game, taking place roughly seven years after Bioshock, follows the story of Subject Delta, an early prototype Big Daddy, as he tries to reunites himself with his original Little Sister while trying to survive the danger of a derelict Rapture, now under the command of a psychiatrist, Sophia Lamb, with total opposite philosophical views from Andrew Ryan.\nAs far as gameplay goes, Bioshock 2 doesn't introduce anything exactly breathtaking over the first game's formula, only tweaking some elements and adding some novelities along the line. The biggest difference between the first and the second game is that now you can fire plasmids and weapons at the same time, hack security machines and other mechanism remotely thanks to a dedicated tool, several enemies from the original game are now more dangerous one way or the other and you'll have to face far more kinds of elite enemies (and not all of them are Big Daddies). As far as general difficulty goes Bioshock 2 manages to be a mixed bag: while the opposition you will encounter is far more deadly than the one in the first game, you are given plenty of new plasmids, tonics and weapons to compensate, and, much like the other games in the series, Bioshock 2 actually becomes easier as you progress into it.\nThe story of Bioshock 2 was recived in a variety of ways. The main plot is, at its core, a self-insert fic which tries to expand the characters and the story of the first game while introducing some new elements that however do tend to make little sense at times (the biggest problem here being that we are introduced to new characters and events that were supposedly of major importance in Rapture's history, and therefore should had been mentioned in the original Bioshock too). There is also some consent that the plot of the original game didn't need an expansion whatsoever. Still, Bioshock 2 manages to tell a fairly good story on its own thanks to a cast of (mostly) interesting and emotional characters. The game also features a rudimentary moral system: depending of few decisions you are called to make regarding the Little Sisters and some major NPCs, you can get a different ending.\nBioshock 2 also features a multiplayer mode, dubbed "The Fall of Rapture". However, as I'm writing this review, this mode has been pretty much abbandoned and it's downright impossible to meet other players, let alone start any match. It's worth mentioning that Bioshock 2 multiplayer wasn't exactly that well recived though.\nAs it stands, Bioshock 2 feels pretty much like an expansion pack for the original Bioshock instead of a deep, epic and completely overhauled sequel. If you can get over this fact, however, you will find that the game is genuinely enjoyable on many levels","October 3, 2013","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I believe both stories are very strong, but Bioshock2's ending dissolves rather quickly and therefore, I believe the original Bioshock has a stronger story all around.  Both games offer a very seemless alternative steampunk universe which is amazingly creative and fun to think about.  Bioshock 2 has better graphics (if you can get the game to work without using the dx-9 launch option).  The biggest and best difference for me is the defensive segments in Bioshock2 which can be a lot of fun.  You are given as much freedom and time you want to set-up booby traps and ammo selection to give yourself a better shot at surviving a wave of enemies poised to kill you and the little sister you are protecting.\n\nSteampunk heaven!","December 30, 2013","true","30.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now i say randomly, but it only crashed in the very beginning and the end for me. however, i have seen it crash for other people. there are 2 solutions for this; 1 is to save very, very often. this is obvious, but if you save often the odds of you losing a lot of progress are minimized. 2 is to follow Denis's guide;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=210917941\nif you dont want to leave steam, this is what i did; right click bioshock 2 and click on properties, go to "set launch options", add "-dx9", and the game should work. the only downside is that the graphics get a serious downgrade. if you do route 2, i suggest doing it BEFORE you start the game so you wont notice the difference. i did it at the second to last area and it was really obvious the graphics became worse. i dont even know how to undo the "-dx9" stuff, so it might be permanent.

This time you got to play as a big daddy. The story was interesting to say the least and one mechanic was updated from the first. You could get a plasmid in one hand and a weapon in the other so you didnt have to switch back and forth constantly. I enjoyed this game a lot.

I had a blast with Bioshock 1. Smooth experience, no crashes and an overall satisfaction. The end of Bioshock was kinda if-y but hey it was a really good game.\n\nNow what can I say about Bioshock 2? Well it was a great game, to be honest I liked the mechanics more than the first part and the story was so intense and beautiful that I got sucked into it and finished the game in 2 days. I will strongly suggest if you haven't played bioshock series to play do so.\n\nNow the problems with Bioshock 2.... O My F%#@*! GOD ! ! !\nFirst of all I had to spend quite some time figuring out a way to start the game since it was not loading at all and after a two days of brainstorming and forums-searching I found nothing. Then I've decided to delete it and re-install + the already unavailable Games for Windows Live and somehow, somewhat it started.\n\nThe first 15 minutes of the game were awesome and suddenly CRASH ... like what ?!?\nOk no problem I re-started the game and ... nope you've guessed it no auto save every 5 minutes or so, had to start from the beggining. This kept happening until I finished the game, every other hour or so I was getting a crash with no error message, no NOTHING. I did read some forums and tried all the turn off DX10 thing and resolution change and logs and well nothing helped.\n\nWhat I'd strongly reccomend is make QUICK SAVE on a keybind that you will be using atleast every 5-10 minutes, otherwise if you get sucked into the game and forget to save it it will return you back at your last auto save (which is either the beggining of the mission or a very important transition) and believe me after a while it gets frustrating (A LOT!!!).\n\nThe game is intense if played on the right difficulty, the story is incredible and a good ending to the Bioshock series but the CRASHES are terrible and made me thing of leaving this game. Just finish it and I hope you don't have the same issues as I did but hey its the same thing, different pc :) (Windows 8.1 btw and my machine is really strong)\n\nHope you enjoy the game and I wish it is a crash free experience for you :)","June 27, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Utilizing a licensed third party keyboard mapping software utility I was able to play the game with an XBox 360 controller with great results. After initial setup game play immediately submerses you into an atmosphere similar to other popular titles mixing technology with old world charm. The mission based game play is somewhat loose allowing time to hunt down items and develope player character skills much in the vein of free roam titles.\n\nI found the game playable, challenging and quite enjoyable at a general level slightly better than average. The title is somewhat the must have due to its franchise lineage and doesn't require much more than a familiarity with the first in the line to wrap your mind around direction and plot. Game play mechanics, graphics and general mood do well to hold the title together and should easily fill a good weekend bender for more skilled players.","May 9, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also has many fewer issues with WIndows 7.\n\n+ Graphics look pretty much the same as the original.  The humans look a lot better, though.\n+ Much better gunplay.  Same amount of weapons, but this time, you can dual-wield them with plasmids.  The melee weapon is a drill, and it's actually useful to the point where you could play the entire game dashing and smashing ♥♥♥♥ing everything.  The pistol is now a more powerful rivet gun, the tommygun is now a gatling gun, the single-barrel shotgun is now a supershotgun, etc. Switching between plasmids is a bit of a chore.\n+ Better, faster hacking mechanics that didn't feel like ♥♥♥♥.\n\n- Levels aren't as expansive as the original.  They're more linear, which I didn't mind, but it might be a deal-breaker for some.\n- There are still a few issues with the port, especially in Fontaine Futuristics where I had the game crash many times.  This time, thankfully, your keybinds don't get wiped.\n- The FOV thing still happens.  Not that terrible since you can use a keybind to set your FOV, but it still happens when you zoom in with the speargun.\n- Game's easier than the original, partly due to the better guns. Again, it's a console shooter.\n- No final boss this time, just a final wave of enemies.  I wouldn't mind having Big Daddy Sinclair be the final boss, with more attacks and more health.\n\nIf you liked the first Bioshock, get this one too.","July 7, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't autosave as much as I wanted it to, so save often!\n2-The scarier moments from BioShock are pretty much gone (make of that what you will), so if you're not a horror fan, you'll probably enjoy this a bit more than BioShock, but it's still pretty bloody.\n\nSo you're a Big Daddy by the name of 'Subject Delta', but you can still use Plasmids and such, because your a prototype. Your little sister, now a grown-up sister, needs your help after you get ressurected. The story is above average, but overall weaker than BioShock. Similar progression to BioShock as well, semi-linear missions but plenty of exploring for cakes and ammo. We've also got some new characters to go with our new areas too. Another change I like is the visual style. Set 8 years after BioShock, Rapture's leak problem has got a little...bigger...to say the least. The art deco style has been preserved, but there's odd glowing underwater plants and stuff, and the sequences where you get to wander around on the ocean floor are really beautiful. I spent the first 10-ish minutes going 'Whoa, everything's so pretty!'.\nGameplay is largely the same, except now we can dual wield Plasmids and Weapons, a much needed improvement, and a full new host of weapons as well. Plasmids are largely the same, but some changes and additions, usual sequel things. I also found I was using a greater variety of weapons and Plasmids than BioShock, where I was often just using Electro-Bolt and the Machine Gun, Gene tonics are more streamlined, so you only have 1 HUGE set of Gene Tonics, which is rather nice as in BioShock, I was often thinking 'gawd, I need more combat tonic slots!'. Hacking isn't total ♥♥♥♥ anymore, just a kinda Quicktime event, but you can still screw up, and you can also hack from a distance, hooray! Enemies are largely the same, two new types of Big Daddy and one new Splicer is all I've seen so far. So pretty solid all round, nothing too different from the original, but some much needed changes.\n\nHowever, BioShock 2 does have a fair swathe of problems. The story isn't as good as before, which is a real weakness. The main antagonist has the most annoying voice ever, and she's always around, but the other characters are fine. As a Big Daddy, when you get to a Little Sister, you have two options: 1-'Adopt' her, take her to a corpse, gather some ADAM as you munch through half your health and Ammo after fighting a butt-ton of Splicers, then do it again, and finally send her to a vent, and I don't think you even get rewards unlike BioShock. Or, 2-Kill her on the spot, 120 ADAM, bam, no fuss, lots of mess, but no uneccesary usage of Health kits.\nOn the note of Health and EVE Hypos: You can only carry 5 of each, but First Aid Kits fully heal you. I found I was often low of health. And it annoys me how you can eat, drink and smoke through your steel diving helmet, unless Subject Delta can absorb nutrients through Osmosis or something.\nWhen you are dealing with Little Sisters, there's a chance it can summon a Big Sister, a kind of Mini-Boss. They're kind of annoying, but not a huge ♥♥♥♥ to deal, and you are given proper warning. But please, ONLY spawn one if we're being evil and harvesting them, NOT protecting them with our lives and finally freeing them from their torment.\nThe other two problems are more technical. I found the Audio was very quiet, everything was quite distant most of the time, which is really annoying, especially when sound is so important. The other problem is buttons. Although being able to dual wield is nice, there's a lot of extra keys, and it can get a bit cluttered. Due to too many keys, there's no manual way to reload EVE, which is a real pain in the middle of a fight, so you have to zap yourself to 0, then reload, which is about as fast as the original.\n\nBut overall, BioShock 2 is still solid. It's kind of like Portal and Portal 2. They're both good games, but BioShock is superior to BioShock 2. The story is less tight than before, and there's some dangling threads here and there. BioShock 2 also has the morality element present, but it's handled a lot better, a bit more grey. And I genuinelly felt sad with the ending I got.","June 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Let me tell you, it certainly does make a difference. Plasmids are like magic, there are different types (Electricity, fire, freeze, ect). There are a fair amount of weapons, from machine guns to shotguns. In the game, you get to play as a Big Daddy (Known as Delta). This game explores the bond between a little sister and a big daddy and makes it seem much more touching. The characters are great and memorable, the story will get you hooked, and the ending is very emotional (Depending on which of the multiple endings you get). Something very cool that they added is that you can go outside Rapture sometimes! It's pretty neat walking around in the water :) Overall, I really enjoyed this game and I highly recommend this game. I give it a 9/10","April 17","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For one, dual wielding has been added, meaning you don't need to wait for your character to switch between having a weapon and plasmid out in the heat of battle. Because you play as a Big Daddy, the game has expanded upon the ways you can collect Adam to upgrade your plasmids. Like before, you can choose to harvest or rescue Little Sisters, but now you can also escort Little Sisters around so they can harvest Adam off of corpses for you. Also, hacking has been drastically improved. Not only can you now hack machines from a distance, but also the pipe minigame has been removed, being replaced with an extremely brief timing-based minigame that will make you want to hack things much more frequently than you did in the original.\n\nThis is also the only Bioshock game to have a Multiplayer mode. It's a fun distraction, but it didn't really appeal to me as something I'd wanna dedicate my time towards, especially considering how small the multiplayer community is now. I never was unable to find a server to play on, but that's only because there's often only 1 or 2 servers available. That being said, the achievements in the Multiplayer are not only rare, but easy to obtain, so it might be worth checking out if you're into that.\n\nOne final thing I want to point out is the Minerva's Den DLC. This extra campaign is definitely worth picking up, as it's extremely well written and designed. It's definitely better than the main storyline.\n\nAll in all, Bioshock 2 is a fun Bioshock experience. That being said, I'd mainly recommend it to people who are already fans of the Bioshock series, as the changes that have been added to the gameplay aren't really enough to satisfy considering the underwhelming storyline. Basically, if you've played Bioshock and want more of the gameplay, play this. If on the other hand you've played the original and want more of the storyline, play Infinite and it's Burial at Sea DLC.","May 21","true","23.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I liked the fact that the game emphasised using strategy and teamwork at times in contrast to just mowing down all the enemies by yourself and the auto turrets were especially a nice addition which complimented this.\n\nIn terms of the story, Bioshock 2 had a few twists but I felt the story wasn't as fleshed out this time around, however don't be mistaken, as the story is still very powerful in Bioshock 2 and is by no means a slouch. There was plenty of new characters who had convincing back stories and the game also alluded to some of the characters from the previous game which was a nice touch.\n\nOn the contrary though, the plasmids could of been updated a little more as if memory serves they were the same ones from the original so it would of been nice to see new plasmids. Overall though, i'd definitely reccomend Bioshock 2 to fans of not only the series but fans in the fps genre as well & anybody who enjoys a thought provoking story.","May 20","true","16.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While from the 3 main Bioshock games this got the lowest overall ranking, it still keeps up the higher standards what we can await from this legendary series. Playing as a Big Daddy has huge advantages with more health, more badass looking weapons and if I count to that huge selection of plasmids, the ways how you can defeat your opponents is basically endless. And you hella need it cause the game contains quite a number of enemies and in certain parts the waves seemed almost endless.\nIn technical part the game is...let's say okayish. The graphics are nice, but not a noticable improvement over the first and the support of DX 10 seems still cause more problems, as real use. Also the character models could use more variations and a bit shift to realism from this pseudo-comics-CG style.\nIn overall, the game is a very good choice, if you get a good price.

That being said, it plays just as well, if not better, due to some much needed design modifications. And the game looks markedly better as well. Its problems lie in the storyline and how it progresses. While the communism v.s. objectivism theme sounds fantastic on paper, it is not as convincing as Bioshock's treatment of objectivism and capitalism. Perhaps it reveals that Ken Levine knew what he was writing about, whereas Bioshock 2 better resembles a summary of Wikipedia pages on the subject. But, if you're there for the gameplay and experience itself, you'll be happy. Combat is smoother; the environment is more detailed and traversing it is more challenging. However, the means to obtain Adam soon grows very tedious.\n\nRemember that section in the first game when you protected a little sister against waves of enemies? In the second game, you don't have a little sister until you defeat another big daddy and take his. Naturally, the combat here is very challenging. However, if you harvest the little sister right then and there, you'll get very little return. Instead, you must let her extract Adam from three designated corpses in the area; each time, you are beset at all sides by enemies who only become stronger the further you advance through the game. Of course, after doing this three times, you are met with the same binary choice as in the first game: harvest or set-free. But don't forget, each area has three big daddies and three little sisters. Once all little sisters are harvested or freed in an area, you'll be forced into an immediate fight to the death with a big sister.\n\nThis is what I mean by 'boss battle overload', and it's all the more confusing that the character you're playing should, by all means, BE a boss! It certainly doesn't feel so, as you die just as easily as any human. So, unless you LOVE this gameplay mechanic, you might come to hate hearing the words, "look daddy, it's an angel!" That being said, certainly persevere with the game. You just might like to save the expansion, Minerva's Den for a while later.","September 11, 2014","true","25.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's packed with thrills and spills that will keep you on your toes as your surroundings become something to fear. You will find yourself battling the demons that will turn to be your worst nightmare. The game is set in Rapture. Rapture is a massive underwater city forged by the personal dreams of Andrew Ryan to escape from the political, social and religious anxieties of a post-World War II world. It was established on November 5, 1946 and finished in late 1951.

Served as a distraction until another masterpiece came. Different developers for Bioshock 2 served only as a purpose of providing the same gameplay from its predecessor with a mildly engaging plot. When I try to look in retrospect how much I enjoyed it, I can barely remember much. When you compare it to the standard of bioshock, it sounds really bad. When you compare it to a typical shooter with RPG elements, it still sounds good.

It borrowed a lot from Bioshock 1 and the story was not as interesting, but I still liked it.\nThey definetly did not put as much love and polish into making this sequel.\n\nMultiplayer:\nI Hated the Multiplayer with a passion for four reasons:\n\n1) The Multiplayer is not fun - I think most people will agree with me on that\n\n2a) It takes forever to level up your MP Character. Boosting is made very difficult, so you will most likely be stuck leveling legit.\n\n2b) The Single-Player Trophies/Achievements are hard enough, so I do not understand why they thought it was a good idea to make the Multiplayer Trophies/Achievements so time consuming.\nIt Forces you to play to the point that you completely despise the game, just to get your 100% trophy/achievement completion - I am a perfectionist, passionate about in-game collectibles and game completion percentages so it might not bother others as much as it does me.\n\n3) Adding Multiplayer took resources away from the Single-Player.\nThe SP could have been much more polished, innovative and closer to the quality of Bioshock 1.\n\nThey nearly made the same mistake with the third Bioshock installment "Bioshock Infinite", but decided to scrap the Multiplayer. They did however put resources into "Bioshock Infinite's" Multiplayer before scrapping it. So just imagine what could have been if all resources had been devoted to Single-Player only?\n\nFYI Regarding my Reviews of Multiplayer in General:\nI generally I do not like Multiplayer at all, but do like CO-OP Multiplayer.\nI only play multiplayer when I am forced to because they are tied to and unlock PSN/Steam Trophies/Achievements. Rarely because I think a game's multiplayer is any good.\nSo I must admit that I may be a bit biased in my review of  Multiplayer in General.\n\n\nLastly this game is newer than Bioshock 1, but somehow the graphics seem to not have been improved in the sequel. It seems on par with Bioshock 1, but the Sound is not nearly as good as it was in Bioshock 1 (e.g. the dreadful sound of a Big Daddy approaching).\n\nI remember the days when Bioshock 1 came out and everyone was astonished at the graphics, physics etc. and then everyone (including my friends and I) ran out to buy a better graphic card in order to be able to play it. This was not the case with Bioshock 2 because it was not innovative.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN EXPERIENCING THE "SHOCK" & PARTICULARY "THE BIOSHOCK SERIES" OF GAMES:\n\n- Play the classic "System Shock" games.\n\n- After that, play all three Bioshock Games + their DLCs (the SP DLCs are good). Play the games in the order that they were released.\n\n- Each time you beat each game,  Read/Watch a few analysises of the story/plots twists/ending/morals of each game before moving onto the next.\n\nDO ALL THIS, AND YOU WILL GET THE MOST OUT THESE WONDERFUL GAMES - NOW GO PLAY, YOU CAN THANK ME LATER!","March 28, 2014","true","25.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Plasmids and tonics are special genetic-reencoding liquids that grant the user active or passive abilities, respectively, and include many of those introduced in BioShock as well as new ones. plasmids can give the player the ability to use telekinesis or to invoke fire, while tonics can improve the player's movement speed, attack damage, or damage resistance. Several of the weapons in BioShock 2 were previously seen carried by Big Daddies in the first game, including a powerful drill and a rivet gun. The player can use each weapon in a close-range melee attack, unlike in the first game, and is able to equip a weapon and a plasmid at the same time, which they can use in quick succession to destroy enemies. you take the role a earlier version of the big daddy as the alpha series named subject Delta, the story was amazing, the graphics look fasincated, gameplay was great, this game also inculdes a mulit-player option where you get to fight other players online and this time with plasmids, i give this game a 9.5 out of 10, i highly recommened that you should get this game also i can't wait to get Bioshock Infinite","December 10, 2013","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The storyline is clearer and the difficulty is more managable. In Bioshock 1, what frustrated me the most was that I had to keep dying and respawning just to kill a mob, and I was almost always out of ammo every time. This was not the case in Bioshock 2. It also isn't as dull as Bioshock 1, having a larger variety of enemies, environments and weapons. It is also now more convenient to use Plasmids and Weapons as you can equip both at the same time on different hands.\n\nHacking machines also feels less time-consuming.\n\nThe bug where your customized controls and settings wouldn't save is also fixed from Bioshock 1.\n\nThe DLC, Minerva's Den, is also very worth the money. It gives a few chapters and hours of extra gameplay with a slightly different arsenal of weapons. I especially love the Ion Laser, which is more effective than the Machine Gun.\n\nRating: 7/10","January 10, 2014","true","15.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A BD is tough guy in scuba gear, which can beat out the ♥♥♥♥ of bunch of splicers without sweat. BUT you are a special one. So now one splicer can beat out the ♥♥♥♥ from YOU. Literally. When I played first Bioshock I always hated BD's because of their skill to ♥♥♥♥ me off so quickly. Bioshock 2 beaten the score. The game itself is like reunion beteween Doom 3 (boring train sequences) and Bioshock. You start almost same as in the first game, you even walk through game like in ♥♥♥♥ing Dejavu. This is not so important to me but it made my bitter smile so early, that I needed to write it. What is even worse than this copy pasting is the necessity of scavenging and using every ♥♥♥♥ing object to hide. Even the weakest enemies can kill you, when they jump at you and you shoot them in the air to the groin, no damage will appear. Than another big mistake is limitation of your resources. You spend ammo so quickly, but you can have just few mags. Worse case is with health packs and Eve's. And I cannot describe how madly I started laughing, when my wallet was filled with 600 dollars. So you are here, in Rapture, eating and drinking everything in your way to survive another attack of mad splicers. You cannot save your resources for later use and when you really need them, nothing is in reach. Last thing for mention is the Questing. You spend most of the time running in circles to achieve a step in goals like > Well we cannot reach it from here so you need to search for another option. And now you need to run all the way back to the start, because suddenly some door opened. So I sighed and quit.(the best part is when you have level almost done and suddenly game crushes, without save) In my oppinion this game is WORTH one play to the end, just to see the whole story. Because story is strongest part of every Bioshock. And Bioshock 2 has such great story it made me almost feel guilty about what I wrote here. But this unbalanced game will take you through hell and the half path to the surface will be bloody painful. The second one will be boring, because you will become OP.","December 22, 2013","true","17.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

All I heard was that this Bioshock was weak, lame, etc. However, it's pretty clear that it is NOT a true sequel to Bioshock, simply another story that takes place within the same location at a different time. There are small details connecting the two within the game but neither story has anything to really do with the other.\n\nGameplay was familiar so there was no learning curve but fighting Big Daddies and Big Sisters became a challenge. Still too many Plasmids to choose from and use, plus everytime you equip one, it seems to change which is binded to which key, which made utilizing them effectively a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nPlaying the perspective of a Big Daddy was very cool and certainly a different atmosphere from playing Bioshock. Controls are smooth, game looks nice, it feels different and familiar all at the same time. My only real gripe with the game is that it crashed as I was trying to finish collecting the ADAM samples to draw out Alexander and had to use the '-dx9' command to jury-rig the game so I could finish.\n\nI don't think I have the heart to attempt playing the games again to get the other endings, since the Little Sisters are much too sweet to kill.

However, from a gameplay standpoint, I'd say that this game is superior in every way. Better hacking, more opportunities to get Adam (i.e you can gather 2 bodies with a little sister to get some extra Adam),Dual Wielding (THANK OUR LORD AND SAVIOR ANDREW RYAN FOR THAT DESIGN CHOICE), and, of course, you get to play as a Badass Big Daddy. It's pretty cool how you start off as an amnesiatic guy with nothing but a drill and end the game as a killing machine making other Big Daddies look like pushovers in comparison. Now, about the defence missions. These missions arent as bad as some people make them out to be. Mainly because the game gives you just enough gadgets to prepare yourself. At the start of the game, it may be a bit annoying, but as you go through, it'll become alot less so. If you dont want to do them, you dont have to. You can just skip the gathers by killing the Big Daddy, adopting the Lil sister and taking her to a vent and choose to save or harvest her. Like i said before, while the story is weaker than it's predecessor (its not terrible, just not as good), Bioshock 2 surpasses it in terms of gameplay. It took what the first game worked with, and improved every component of it. In my opinion, Bioshock 2 is the BEST game in the trilogy. 9/10\n\nNote: I forgot to mention this, but the game has the tendency to occasionally crash. If the game crashes on you at some point, I reccommend constant quick saving so you dont lose much progress.","July 9, 2015","true","15.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

All I heard was that this Bioshock was weak, lame, etc. However, it's pretty clear that it is NOT a true sequel to Bioshock, simply another story that takes place within the same location at a different time. There are small details connecting the two within the game but neither story has anything to really do with the other.\n\nGameplay was familiar so there was no learning curve but fighting Big Daddies and Big Sisters became a challenge. Still too many Plasmids to choose from and use, plus everytime you equip one, it seems to change which is binded to which key, which made utilizing them effectively a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nPlaying the perspective of a Big Daddy was very cool and certainly a different atmosphere from playing Bioshock. Controls are smooth, game looks nice, it feels different and familiar all at the same time. My only real gripe with the game is that it crashed as I was trying to finish collecting the ADAM samples to draw out Alexander and had to use the '-dx9' command to jury-rig the game so I could finish.\n\nI don't think I have the heart to attempt playing the games again to get the other endings, since the Little Sisters are much too sweet to kill. Being called 'best daddy' even though I'm a chick was just too cute and heart warming.","February 4, 2014","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The story is deep and twisted and you should play the first game before this to enjoy it to the fullest.\n\nGameplay: Moving/shooting is solid and weapons really do damage unlike in BS1. You have a lot of choices with weapon upgrades and plasmids (sort of magic in BS-world) and you can make your own "character build" to some extent. You can use different approaches when it comes to encountering enemies i.e. hacking security cams to make the enemies trigger the alerts instead of you, shooting through the corridors or confusing your enemies to fight each other with plasmids.\n\nStory: Story is dark and gritty and mostly presented with audio recordings. This isn't necessarily the best way to tackle the storytelling but you will be rewarded with a lush backstory if you have the patience to listen.\n\nSummary\n\nPros:\n-Graphix still pretty\n-Improved gun-/plasmidplay\n-Story\n-Atmosphere\n-All the different options and upgrades\n\nCons:\n-Story told mostly by audio recordings\n-No one plays the multiplayer anymore\n-I encountered some serious crashing during two last levels and lost 3 hours\nworth of progress. Because of this I encourage everyone to quicksave/save\nconstantly to avoid such thing.

Not content with awful 64 bit support, the disc version of the game stopped activating when Securom was driven back to hell. Activate the game code in Steam though and everything works fine.\n\nBioshocks 1 and Infinite ("BS" and "Limited" would be better names) may both start with a fanfare and progress with  mighty crescendos, but they soon forget the tune, bore with repetition and end with a spluttering fart. Rarely have games promised so much high concept and delivered so little gameplay.\n\nBioshock 2 is different. You're just dropped straight in and told to get on with it. It's a little underwhelming to start, but the game progresses well. You gather a varied arsenal of plasmids and weapons, upgrade them, explore the non-linear levels at your leisure, and have the opportunity to plan every takedown of the bigger guys and girls. It's all rather satisfying, which was quite a surprise. Even that damn pipemania hacking thing has gone. And your droids have names like Phyllis and Nathaniel (who said I wasn't easily pleased?).\n\nIn summary, it's hard to see why this gets lower reviews than the other two, but that's the consequence of putting gameplay above glitz. 6/10.\n\nMinerva's Den is more of the same with some new stuff, but an odd tendency to crash occasionally. 6/10.\n","April 27","true","18.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

GFWL was a nightmare, there was constant crashing, multiplayer was a buggy mess, and the actual campaign was severely lacking. I probably would have given it an overall rating of 4.8/10. A slightly below average game.\n\nWhen it was updated recently, I gave it another try. I do applaud 2K for releasing the massive patch so long after the game was released. For current owners, they got the Minerva's Den DLC for free, GFWL was removed, Steam achievements were added, several bugs were fixed, and multiplayer was much better. Still not perfect though. Lots of lag and no proper anti-cheat in multiplayer, and lots of crashing in single player.\n\nAnyway, on to the main game. The biggest problem I had with the story was that it felt the exact same as the first one. The villain, Sofia Lamb supposedly had entirely different point of view than Andrew Ryan of the original game, but it didn't feel like that because the way she carried out her actions and the way she talked/presented herself was the exact same as Ryan. Some of the endings were a little cliche, the writing for Eleanor had some really cheesy and mediocre moments, and the overall story just didn't feel right. Like, it was all based around this relationship between Eleanor and you, a big daddy. And you're not even her actual father or anything haha. It was just strange. Cool idea, but I think it could have been written better.\n\nI do think a few of the added moral choices were a great touch, how a few main characters fates were all dependent on you. Soundtrack was also fantastic. And while the multiplayer is completely unnecessary, when it worked, sometimes it was pretty fun. The whole background was kinda cool, how it all takes place when Rapture goes to ♥♥♥♥. But of course, there's a stupid levelling system tacked onto it which can kill interest quick. Had to grind for so long to get the last few achievements.\n\nGameplay wise, there was definitely an improvement. Instead of having all the different types of tonics, they were just grouped under one general selection. Dual wielding was great, and many of the weapons were a lot of fun to use. However, just like the first one, the movement is clunky, the FOV is awful and the guns still felt sluggish. Graphics are ugly for a 2010 game, and environments were practically identical to the original. Enemy variety was essentially the same, and the constant Big Sister fights were just annoyingly tedious and stupid.\n\nI guess I'd give BioShock 2 a flat 6.0/10. It's a decent game. There are definitely improvements from the original, and a few great ideas. However, throughout the campaign, it just really felt like 2K was beating a dead horse. Get it on a sale.\n\nAs far as the Minerva's Den DLC goes, it gets universal praise everywhere I see it. I really didn't think it was that special to be honest. The story was decent and the pacing was good, but the gameplay just felt like more of the same. I'd give it 5.5/10, it's an above average add-on.","June 28, 2015","false","51.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Bioshock was so unique because it was a different type of shooter with RPG elements.

The story while not as astounding as the first, was still pretty good. The new characters are not as memorable as Andrew Ryan, but there are some nice editions.

Bioshock was so unique because it was a different type of shooter with RPG elements. The story itself was movie quality writing and for that, it earned it's reputation, Bioshock 2 is like if you took Bioshock 1 and drop it in the dirt, it's the same game, but if you wipe it off, it's pretty fun. The story while not as astounding as the first, was still pretty good. The new characters are not as memorable as Andrew Ryan, but there are some nice editions. Missions and plasmids have been greatly updated. The game is without-a-doubt not as good as Bioshock, but it isn't bad.

I could wander there for hours just to look at the small details in the environment.\nThe story IMO is not as good as the first one but I think it holds up well on it's own. The game has some welcome news as for example, Big Sisters and that you are able to dual wield weapons/plasmids which makes battles more fluid than in the first game. The graphics may be outdated but the audio is outstanding, all the buzzing of cameras, dripping water and footsteps echoing the halls really makes me immersed. I really like the music as well, a little pompous but I think it fits really well here.\nThe multiplayer portion is pretty unbalanced I think when it comes to team/match making system and plasmid/weapon combos. There are combos that are extremely OP compared to the weapons you start with. That makes me want to gain XP fast so that I can unlock new weapons to compete in any way. The MP maps are really nice, I was a little surprised that there were so many of them, this is first and foremost a single player game and a lot of different modes to play: free for all, capture the sister, ADAM grab etc.\nAll the achievements are transferred from the GFWL service and is a very welcome addition, even though I first bought it on GFWL.\nI recommend this game wholeheartedly!","February 23, 2014","true","61.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It adds new stuff, of course, and it's easier to get ADAM. But generally, it's not much different from Bioshock 1. It's like Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel in terms of sequels. Other than multiplayer, it doesn't add anything new of substance ( multiplayer has terrible optimization and a small options menu, also it has permanent hot mic, you'd have to change steam settings to turn off mic). Although, it is fun after awhile.\n\nP.S. If you change the settings of your gpu card to a low quality or to preformance instead of quality, it looks really ♥♥♥♥ and the textures spaz out constantly.\n\nP.P.S. Like the first game, there are multiple endings that you get based on your morality. Also, killing unarmed enemies will not get you the bad ending. Of course, harvesting little sisters will. That is the only thing that affects the ending, like Bioshock 1.","March 1","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's alright but I can only play it so far then it just crashes,  won't let me go any further. I believe the name of the area it crashes is called Pauper's Drop. Luckily I bought this during a STEAM sale. I'd say I got my $3-$5 worth or whatever I paid, because that's all I got to play $3-$5 worth. (o)_(O).. :)\n\nI give it a thumbs down because it crashes, otherwise I would give it a thumbs up.","February 24, 2014","false","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/broadwayjay88/recommended/8850/","broadwayjay88","BroadwayJay88","http://steamcommunity.com/id/broadwayjay88/","6 products in account","Well, to start out, I have a windows 8 with 4 gigs of RAM and a radeon HD Graphics 2.00 GHz and a AMD A6-5200 APU and its a 64 bit operating proccessor and the game crashes a lot.  Every time I play for around a half hour it crashes and before anything big happens in the game, I have to save it incase it crashes (which it does) so if you don't have a better computer than me DON'T BUY THE GAME I will save you about $20.00 USD if you listen to me.  Besides, I think the 1st one was a lot better.\n","November 11, 2015","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You could go into the game knowing nothing about the first game and do just fine. What you do with the little sisters matters end game.","December 6, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
