"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scathelock/recommended/361690/","scathelock","scathelock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scathelock/","144 products in account","Here's a game that no trailers or screenshots can really make you understand. If you're a veteran of the old days and just here to see if this is worth getting to play on your modern rig, then yes, this is the same experience that you know, and it's been patched so you can play it without any problems. (In fairness, GOG gets points for not having the CD-rom issue in the first place.) But for the uninitiated...\n\nYou can see that the game puts you in the cockpits of the galaxy's most iconic starfighters. What you don't realize is that your micromanagement skills will be tested as thoroughly as your reflexes and hand-eye coordination. You hear the missile lock warning, so you immediately switch targets to see who's on your tail, at the same time dropping your throttle for maximum evasive maneuverability while simultaneously dumping your weapon regeneration power to the engines so you can zoom out of his firing zone, but ****, you've forgotten to transfer your current laser energy to your shields! A single blast connects before you set your shields fully aft, and then all you can do is hope that the countermeasure you just launched will take care of any other warheads coming your way... And that's just for the keyboard. Your other hand will be pushing your joystick as far as it goes, hoping to juke your pursuer so that you can line up your own assault - which isn't just a matter of pointing and shooting, but requires you to lead each shot so that you're firing at where you anticipate your enemy will be after a split second. What, this sounds too complicated? Did you think you could just sit down and instantly fly like Wedge Antilles? You've got some learning to do, trainee... (Fortunately, there is an extensive series of exercise missions that will walk you through all of your available tools. Whether you decide to do these is completely up to you, given that you can immediately jump headlong into any mission you wish.)\n\nBy the time all of the intricacies become second nature to you, you'll be hungry for some real allies. While the AI does an admirable job of either being extremely aggressive or extremely passive (depending on the difficulty), the toughest missions beg to be played with live wingmates. I was introduced to GameRanger, a straightforward third-party program that does a decent job of connecting you to fellow pilots. There is the issue of lag with slower connections, but that's negligible considering how rewarding it feels to communicate and work together towards a set of challenging goals.\n\nThis is an old-school game that, despite its dated graphics, continues to shine as one of the most immersive and authentic experiences out there. It's not for everyone, but if you ever wanted to be a starfighter pilot, this is your chance to prove it.","October 26, 2015","true","50.3"," 115 of 118 people (97%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","97","115","118","13","6"

Just a heads-up...If you own a Saitek X55, you're going to have issues. You see, X-Wing vs TIE Fighter only recognizes 1 joystick...and the X55 (the stick and throttle) counts as 2. Just be aware that if you only own an X-55 (like myself), it might be time to pick up a cheap stick for these older games. None of this is the game's fault of course, so I'm not blaming it. Blame Saitek/Mad Catz instead.\n\nEDIT: Apparently you can use joystick emulators to get around the X-55 issue.

I use a crappy joypad PS2 style, I can play quite well, not as I used to when I was 11 and played wit a joystick, but the analog stick is good enough. You can bind any button on the joypad and that's a good thing since there are so many commands.\n\nThis was the first game I played extensively, I cannot racommend it well enough, but it's not for everyone.

It was so exciting! Play as Rebels AND Imperials, and the biggest feature, it was multiplayer! I was expecting X-Wing and TIE Fighter rolled into one game, where you choose a side, go through the concourses, play some campaigns, and multiplayer on the side, maybe co-op campaigns! What I got was a datapad with a list of missions, with ribbons awarded based on performance. The multiplayer was a blast, being able to cooperate on a variety of missions, and you can just dogfight with your friends if you want to. However, I couldn't help but be disappointed but the end product.\n\nThen the expansion pack, Balance of Power came out. Two new  campaigns with cutscenes, featuring a Super Star Destroyer! Also new was the B-Wing, which I quickly fell in love with after hating the slow Y-Wings. Each campaigns feature some 14 missions, and 3 cutscenes each, and they can be played on co-op too. The expansion saved the game for me, and I'm glad it was included in this release.\n\nHowever, the biggest feature of this game, multiplayer, is rendered a bit moot due to lack of online play (online gaming wasn't quite a thing, with everyone having 56K modems), so you're limited to LAN play. I personally can't do multiplayer anymore because of issues with versions of Windows between computers, but maybe you still can.","April 30, 2015","true","2.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","3"

The music perfectly sets the mood and you'll start to sweat as you realize that you've let a Tie Fighter get on your 6.\n\nNote that you must have a joystick to play but this only serves to enhnace the immersion.\n\nOverall I have so many fond memries of this game and it runs flawlessly on modern systems.
