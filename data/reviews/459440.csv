You either play real time, or max acceleration.  No 2x, 4x, etc.\n- Extended commands (i.e. "VIA" and "AFTER TAKEOFF FLY...") are not part of the UI, have to be typed manually.\n- You cannot type two commands in at once (You have to type "TAXI TO..", hit enter, click send, select the aircraft again and then type "AFTER TAKEOFF FLY..", hit enter).\n- Graphics issues (landing lighs are spheres of illumination the radius of a 737 cockpit).\n- UI issues (limited zoom, fixed camera location, no way to change the size of text on the strip window).\n- Planes readback is not in common avionic parlance (250 is read "two fifty" instead of "two five zero").\n- Limited setup options (can't turn off bloom, turn on AA, etc).\n- No manual or charts.\n\nFeels like a beta more than a finished sim.

This is based on a very short stint (the tutorial, plus a few minutes outside of the tutorial).  So with that qualification:\n\nWhile the premise is promising and there is definitely potential, the game has a very unfinished feel to it.  The very first tutorial aircraft I encountered pushed back from the the St. Thomas terminal like a proper airliner... wow, neat.... except for the fact that it was a Cessna.  OK then.  Then on the GA ramp that typically would have hosted the Cessna, a Dash 8 type turboprop taxiied right though the farm of its fellow turboprops to get to the taxiway.  The game took a slight hit to suspension of disbelief there.  And the Cessna thing seemed pretty darned obvious to me.\n\nRushed.  But could be fixed.\n\nPros: Promising mechanics, aircraft behave more or less as they should when commanded.\nCons: Rudimentary graphics and textures.  Aircraft movement is not terribly smooth.  View control is poor; zoom functionality is not terribly effective.\n\nThis has the potential to be a really good and engaging sim, but it's not there yet.\n\nMy advice - buy it to support the developer and encourage them to keep working on it.  Try it out.  You'll probably be disappointed.  But come back in 6 months and I expect (or hope) that it will be signficantly improved from its launch state.","May 31","true","0.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/459440/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?\nTower 3D is an Air Traffic Controller game aimed towards the casual end of the 'simulator' genre of games.  It's no ATC2 or Global ATC (and doesn't pretend to be), but it's not a lightweight time management game like Airport Madness either.  Tower 3D is aiming for a very neglected middle ground for ATC sims, so I had huge hopes for this one!\n\nHowever, given that Tower 3D is really the only middle ground title that's both globally available and current, I'm disappointed at the missed potential here.  It didn't need to do anything different (all the basics for an excellent casual game are right there) but it should have done them all so much better!  Anyway, here's a list of the good and bad stuff so you can decide for yourself:\n\n\nWhat's to like?It's a fun presentation of ATC (ie more than maps and a radar screen) for people new to the genre\nA basic tutorial mode is provided\nWhile casual, it's not too dumbed down\nAircraft strips have plenty of details about speed, direction, attitude and altitude\nThere is flexibility to type specific commands as well as click pre-defined instructions\nThe game offers 3D views of planes taking off and landing\nIt's an ATC game that doesn't require an Einstein-esque level of knowledge in Geometery and Physics!\n\nWhat's not to like?The graphics are actually horrible - so much so that I suspect this must be a serious bug (aliasing, flat and muddy textures not at all like the video presentation, little shading, low resolution aircraft with blurred decals) - definitely NOT 'stunning' as described!\nThere are no free-camera options whatsoever - you can only zoom in slightly and have no control over the direction of view, and the camera frequently gets stuck pointing at nothing until the next plane arrives which can take a while\nIt's missing some basics such as 'holding short' of the runway, expediting aircraft, accounting for wind factor and such\nOnly the ground controller role is simulated (there's no tower, approach or departure gameplay)\nAll commands are read by the same female voice - there are no 'radio' voice recordings and no variety\nThe UI leaves a lot to be desired with windows that are difficult to resize or reposition for a better fit, and various buttons in dire need of basic tooltip descriptions\nGameplay is somewhat slow-paced and I soon became bored\nIf the poor graphics and limited audio are not faults, then it's too expensive for the level of quality provided (it's more of a £7 game rather than £22).\nNo manual to explain more detailed options\nIt feels very 'Early Access' yet is actually a fully complete title.\n\nShould you buy it?\nIf this was an Early Access game, I'd say 'yes' to support the developer and help the game develop into a polished product, but it's not EA at all so there has to be the assumption that no further improvements beyond patches will happen.  As a result, I don't recommend it - especially not at this price point.  However, remember that Steam does have a 14-day window in which to return games provided you've not played them for more than 2 hours so you could always try it out if you're unsure.  People who have never played an ATC game before will probably find it fun, but anyone who has played a semi-casual game like ATC3 will just notice how much poorer it is compared to other games in this niche.\n\nIf the game should improve (ie the terrible graphics and frozen camera do turn out to be bugs), I'll revisit this review.  I'm not refunding it because I know Dovetail does maintain Train Simulator very frequently, so I'm keeping hope.  Right now though, it's really not a good game to spend a lot of money on, and I'm really sad about that.\n\n\nSome alternatives to look for:\nCasual\nAirport Madness!  (stupidly fun, casual time-management game)\n\nIntermediate\nATC3* (pitched at the same level as Tower 3D)\n\nSerious\nATC2 (vintage, but still current and the most serious ATC to date)\nGlobal ATC ('new kid on the block' but has a free playable demo you can try)\n\n______________\n\n* ATC3: I Am An Air Traffic Controller (its full title) can only be bought as a full product from Technobrain (in Japanese only).  A very expensive offshoot "Tokyo Big Wing" was released internationally with just ONE of the 12 airports and only about 10 minutes worth of game (so it didn't sell too well).  However, for non-Japanese gamers, fans of the original full product (with all 12 airports and related missions) have made English-translated versions for download from various sites around the world. Note that ATC3 is in no way similar to the much more serious ATC2.","June 1","false","2.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","6"

Jets have reverse thrusters when landing to stop the aircraft, I don't see any of those. Their needs to be more aircrafts in the games along with different versions of each model such as the Boeing 747-100 and Boeing 747-200.

Yes this game really seems unfinished. The graphics on "fantastic' is terrible, and depite having a decent computer with an excellent GPU, there were times I got 15 fps when a plane takes off. It could have been a great game, even with the existing graphics from 2003 - but the user interface is unintuitive, and essential ATC features are nonexistent - like slowing down or speeding up aircraft.   No tooltips, clunky interface and rubbish almost non existent tutorial are further negatives, but the worst is the hefty, almost absurd penalties for mistakes, which takes the last bit of fun out of it.\n\nA rushed, half arsed effort. I do not recommend buying unless the developer updates and finishes this product.  Buy Airport Madness 3d instead.

I had high hopes for this one. Put in just under 4 hours before getting frustrated. This product suffers from a serious case of "Unfinished" feel. So many issues with a game that has such enormous potential, but seems to have been rushed to release. I cleared my runway of arrivals and departs only for the camera to be stuck on the last depart until another aircraft checked in. In the mean time, I'm staring at empty sky watching a jet leave my view with absolutely no way to change the camera focus to something else at the airport or terminals. A free camera mode seems to be mandatory, but totally absent from the game. There also seems to be a total lack of a manual available here on steam, or even at the web site link.\n\nWhile I can command the aircraft to change direction to avoid a mid air collision, there is no click menu option to change the altitude of an aircraft in flight, nor to assign one at take off. Flight strips also seem to be incomplete. While I'm use to the aircraft strips in Global ATC, this seems to make the Tower 3D version to be lacking useful information.\n\nThe game can have a lot of down time where you wait for something to happen. It would be nice to be able to either speed and slow down time passing, or density of the traffic (Or both).\n\nSound effects of engines speed up and shut down are seriously cheesy. Even engine sounds in Airport Madness 3D are better. The computer voice acknowledgments of commands or check ins are also not polished. Traffic commands are not repeated or excepted in industry standard format, so just don't quite make it believable.\n\nSure seems like an early access game, not a polished simulation. For $29.99 with the future of pay to play DLC, and the additional cost for the PRO version, I can not recommend it. Maybe when/if it becomes polished or at least having the feeling of being complete.","June 2","false","7.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Considering how much development was made throughout Tower 2011, you would have thought those developments would be the bare minimum in the new release...unfortunately not the case. I became instantly irritated at the game after the absolutely atrocious lack of control in regards to audio. The music is infuriating, and there was no way to turn it off without muting the entire game. The tutorial was lacklustre, and provided no real insight into the operations of ATC for anybody new to the aviation world. There were numerous bugs, including aircraft landing on a runway and somehow colliding with aircraft that were on the parallel taxiway, which were en-route to the holding point ready for departure. The whole feel of the game is just wrong. The heavily advertised "3D" element to the new release is rather boring too. Aircraft pushing back through scenery, awfully simple modelling, and a seemingly random way of switching views that the user has absolutely zero control over.\n\nFor the price, this game is absolutely disgusting.
