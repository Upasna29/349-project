Let it be known that looks are quite deceiving, and Our Darker Purpose's resemblance to Edmund McMillan's indie blockbuster begins and ends with the top-down, twin-stick shooter appearance that both share.\n\nWhere The Binding of Isaac is a fast-paced, almost bullet-hell game, Our Darker Purpose is much less about quick reflexes and more about patience and planning. You will never achieve Isaac levels of speed and destructiveness in this game, because that isn't the point or the core of its challenge. This game is about endurance and taking in the world around you. There are times I've felt more engaged by Our Darker Purpose's gameplay than Isaac's simply because it is a more demanding game. If Isaac is about reflexes and becoming mighty, then Our Darker Purpose is about staying two steps ahead of the game, because once you perform any action, you are committed to it.\n\nThe game features a wonderful art direction and soundtrack that blends together into a beautifully gothic piece of design that I fell in love with from the first trailer I watched. There is a detailed lore and story woven throughout this game that is surprisingly esoteric and adds a flavor of mystery to this pleasantly Dark little journey. Similar to the original Dark Souls, the different elements of this game support each other in such a way that were any one of them removed or altered, the entire game would lose its unique atmosphere.\n\nLong story short: Don't go into this game expecting anything similar to The Binding of Isaac. It isn't a copycat just because it bears some surface level similarities. If you allow yourself to approach this game on its own terms, you will find a unique game whose world is enchanting and challenging in its own right.","November 4, 2014","true","3.9"," 300 of 316 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","300","316","3","1"

The way the story and setting is drip-fed to you via talking desks or boss descriptions allows you to engage with it or get on with the gameplay itself, and the writing manages to be funny without being cringe-worthy. The music is also truly amazing, perhaps the best I've heard in any indie game.\n\nI find the gameplay particularly engaging as well. On the surface it does hug closely to Binding of Isaac gameplay, with randomised rooms, unlockable items and locations, starting over when you die etc. But it does go beyond that. The emphasis on choice over randomness is far more evident in ODP: Each time you level up you choose between two perks that may boost your attack or survivabilty in some way (life leech, attack speed, or some more exotic perks), and you unlock lessons that you can equip before a play-through that can have a dramatic effect on your gameplay. You can also choose which floor to enter after a boss battle, and each floor may have different enemies or modifiers to them (enemies will drop more juice boxes, won't have champion enemies, you and the enemy will take more damage etc.)\n\nThese elements allow for less of a feeling that the RNG was against you, and more that if you die you messed up in some way. It also means that even if you are having trouble, you may unlock lessons that will help you in the future, so there is always a small sense of progression without making the early levels feel trivial.\n\nOne downside to the game is that earlier areas can feel repetitive, as there is a smaller set of potential enemies and items that you will encounter. Earlier levels can also look a little too grey for my liking. It also isn't clear how to unlock each of the lessons - something I find frustrating but other people may enjoy discovering the unknown.\n\nOver all its a good game to play for several hours in a row or just half an hour, and its easy to sink at least 30 hours into the game (for those who care about replayability).

To be fair, it does resemble Binding of Isaac a lot, a keyboard, top-down shooter with accumulation of items and perks. The mechanics differ enough to give this game an entirely differnet backbone, though, and let it be said that Avidly Wild games did not rip off Edmund Macmillan in any way, shape, or form.\n\nThat being said, though this gives some pretty good Binding of Isaac type gameplay, whether it helps the addicts who are weaning themselves off that famous game remains to be seen. Our Darker Purpose's art style is, in my humble opinion, far more beautiful and intriguing than Isaac's quirky and humorous one, and the music in this game is subtle yet stellar, offering a nice, edgy background to the game's ominous atmosphere.\n\nThe lore in Our Darker Purpose is uniquely amazing. Binding of Isaac came with tons of items and an allegory within a story, but it's story is hardly as good, interesting, or compelling as that found in Our Darker Purpose. Many words went into the lore of this game and for that, Avidly Wild, I applaud you. Cordy is a character one can sympathize for, have fun with, and imagine a backstory for in the dark orphanage she lives in. The fragments about bosses, items, and Edgewood are equally fun to read, and all offer a dark humor that is quite well done.\n\nOur Darker Purpose adds more choice than Isaac as well. Isaac's customization had two options: yes or no. You took the item, or you didn't. In this game, the perks and items are a bit more varied and a bit more easier to alter. Arguably, Our Darker Purpose is more user-friendly and easier in that sense. The wiggle room allowed by its choice of perks upon level up and its item stores allow one to build up Cordy in a more specific and designed manner than Binding of Isaac.\n\nNow that I've said everything it has over Binding of Isaac, let me warn you about what NOT to expect from this game. Many people fell in love with the sobbing little boy sitting on poop because of the game's learning curve and skill requirements. You had to be fast on your fingers, or else the unforgiving monsters of the basement would get you. In Our Darker Purpose, however, speed and reaction time is less important. Cordy, though she moves smoothly as of the most recent update, will never hit the speed of Isaac with speed-ups, Wooden Spoon, and the Belt. Though this might seem like it makes the game easier, the enemies in this game are far more advanced, difficult, and tankier than those in Binding of Isaac. This game prioritizes thought over reaction time, and you'll find yourself frustrated not because you didn't tap down fast enough, but because you didn't think to roll at the right time.\n\nTL;DR: Our Darker Purpose has the same surface mechanics as Binding of Isaac, but a deeper story, fresh graphics, and an entirely new item customization system. While it will never replace the mad speed dashing and the crazy bullet and fly frenzies in Binding of Isaac, it offers a new dimension of thought and planning while in the midst of combat. It is definitely worth looking at and getting if the abovementioned bonuses are attractive.","November 1, 2014","true","28.7"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","57","64","0","2"

I can't think of many reasons why anyone would dislike it, except maybe its difficulty. One thing that might be putting people off is the game's seeming similarity to Binding of Isaac, which is understandable, but very superficial. I played the hell out of Binding of Isaac. I finished both the original and the remake with all their DLCs on 100%. It's got a very special place in my heart. But I would never say Our Darker Purpose is a cheap copy of it. It's very much a game of its own. Besides belonging in the same game category as Isaac, it's not affected or derived from it in any way. There are indie games out there that downright copy Isaac and use the word 'homage' as an excuse for their lack of creativity.\n\nAnd creativity is something any sane person can't deny this game has. The gothic/Burtonesque art style is so neat and polished, it almost tops the phenomenal orchestral soundtrack, which is probably the thing I loved most about this game. It's unheard of amongst indie games. Yes, Binding of Isaac had addictive tunes, but it's like comparing the Looney Tunes theme to Star Wars. Both are addictive, but only one is epic and blows your mind. Too bad you can't truly enjoy it, until you reach higher floors. From the little background I could find, the music is made by an experienced composer who writes scores for famous TV shows. Big thumbs up to the devs for getting him on board! One thing I shouldn't forget when mentioning creativity is the story. While I love the art style of Binding of Isaac, I've always felt it lacks a deeper concept, yet alone a story. It's gore-ish and grotesque, but somehow bland. This game has such a dark, depressive and deep story, it actually feels like playing a game based on a novel. Have you ever read through the Harry Potter books and thought the last book was dark and depressing compared to the first ones? Well imagine the same leap, but use the last book as a starting point.\n\nThe gameplay itself is much less fast paced, bullet-hellish and much more about strategy. Where Isaac relies on reflexes and synerging good items, ODP is much more about the learning curve, which is very distinguishable and steep. Every time you play, you get at least one step further. Also there's almost no grinding involved, which in my opinion is a good thing. Sure, there are better items unlocked by finishing challenges, but they aren't essential for a succesful playthrough. Each time you finish a floor, you get to choose between 2-4 ways to continue. There are different sets/clans of enemies on each floor type and random floor traits you get to choose from. Usually floors with the more rewarding traits (e.g. higher loot rate) have more difficult enemy sets. You also level up during every run and gain perks in the process. Another thing I really appreciate is that ODP, unlike Isaac, isn't locked to 60 FPS (let alone 30), so I can fully enjoy it on my 120hz screen.\n\nI never really loved bossfights in Binding of Isaac. Most of them feel the same and instead of finding a strategy and/or weak spots, you just have to keep dealing massive damage and dodge projectiles. Bosses in Our Darker Purpose remind me more of Dark Souls / Titan Souls. There's a total of 24 bossfights and each one of them is smart, unique and requires a different approach. For example there's a bossfight inside a maze with an enemy that randomly teleports every 10 seconds. There's a slow trail of fire behind you and floating projectiles that reduce your movement speed on hit (to an eventual zero), so if you aren't careful enough, you get too slow and either burn or can't keep up with the boss anymore. I don't want to spoil too much, but there's even a boss involving a little game of chess!   All in all this game is very though-through and if it had half the support and fanbase Binding of Isaac has, it could be legendary. I can't wait for another game by the same developer and I'll do my best to spread the word about it, so it doesn't die off.\n\n______________________\n\n\nSummary/TLDR:\n\nThis isn't a Binding of Isaac clone! It's a very creative game of its own, that does many things different and lots of them even better! Don't get discouraged by the few superficial similarities and its rather high difficulty. Visually, musically and even story-wise it's a piece of art! I'm a roguelike games lover and this is game is one of my favorites. Its bossfights remind me of Dark Souls/Titan Souls. Give this hidden gem a chance, it deserves it!\n\n9/10!","March 27","true","139.1"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","45","48","0","2"

And it squanders it all.\n\nOur Darker Purpose aspires to be the next Binding of Isaac - it's a top down, twin-stick, rogue-lite with an exhausting array of usable and passive items. But it's worse in every way, and three times more expensive to boot. I couldn't even fathom pouring more than 10 hours into this game, let alone the 100 hours Isaac can satisfy. What it comes down to is gameplay. Signs of sloppy design are on display almost by the minute. The hitboxes of enemies are incomprehensible and your pathetic, pixel-size shots pass through even the largest of bosses for no discernible reason. Movement is imprecise and, without rolling everywhere, is slow and clunky. Everything takes far too much damage before it dies and deals far too much damage, each creature doubling in strength, HP and defense after every level, as opposed to the strict rules governing monster types in Isaac. Difficulty is never an issue if it's fair, but the poor design choices present the challenge as cruelly unfair. A player's skill will never be able to respond to impossible to dodge hazards that appear the instant a player enters a room, or the awkward placement of innumerable indecipherable objects that block player projectiles and obstruct any sense of movement.\n\nIn the end, the greatest crime Our Darker Purpose commits is an obvious empty ploy to prolong the length of its campaign. Rather than implement as large an array of items as Isaac or Risk of Rain, encouraging a sense of discovery and experimentation, a lazily implemented upgrade system built around earning 'credits' in a poorly designed menu sets positive bonuses for the next run. A next run that you won't want to make.","May 9, 2014","false","24.2"," 112 of 155 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","112","155","0","1"

I love roguelikes, I love twin-stick shooters, and I love that bizarre crossing of dark and cute. I mention this because it's impossible to review Our Darker Purpose without bringing up BoI at almost every turn. The gameplay, the progression, the enemies, the items, even the aesthetic are all heavily informed by Isaac, and while there are some interesting tweaks to the formula, they come at a cost.\n\nODP poses you as a wayward resident at the Edgewood Home for Lost Children, a mix of orphanage, asylum, and Hogwarts. Within its randomly-generated halls you will meet all manner of disturbed students, monstrous school supplies, and debris. While the first two are interesting and varied in their Tim Burntony designs, the debris and traps are the only features of the rooms, lending them much less variety than the maps in Binding. Levels themselves can have random attributes, though, like lower light (+light radius is a thing again!), extra healing items, or more damage.\n\nItems can be found in rare chests, from defeating rare minibosses, or buying them from vending machines. They come far less frequently than BoI items and have far smaller effects on gameplay, usually providing a random chance for an effect or a very corner case bonus. Your main method of progression is earning EXP from kills, leveling up, and picking one perk from a randomized pair. The game definitely has a stronger RPG vibe than you-know-what, with full stats for your character, critical hits, dodge chance, and so on. It adds a bit of complexity but also dilutes some of the raw appeal of combat and simple progression.\n\nHopefully by now you're recognizing the trend that Our Darker Purpose follows. Everything it does in deference to Binding of Isaac is done in half-measures, never quite meeting the quality of the originator. The look is interesting and more detailed, but lacks weight and impact. The progression is more complex, but never gets as creative. The sound design is also rather off, reusing many effects and missing some key feedback cues. Worst of all, though, is the uneven difficulty. Some rooms and bosses will just absolutely wreck you in ways the progression may not account for, ending otherwise promising runs in pretty sour ways. There's an overarching progression system with more perks to unlock, but it looks to take ages to get anything particularly interesting, if it even exists.\n\nIt's not a bad game by any stretch, just one that never lives up to the example set for it. If you've burned out on Binding of Isaac it's worth a try, and fans of the look or the RPG progression may even find it more engrossing.","October 10, 2015","true","2.2"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","0"

It has great atmosphere backed up by a great art style and music. Everything is functional, but the more I played, the more one thought kept coming back: "The Binding of Isaac did this better."\n\nOur Darker Purpose plays very similarly to Binding of Isaac, but just about everything it does, Isaac does better. Isaac has more variety of powerups and enemies. Isaac has a deeper and more interesting resource management system. Our Darker Purpose is much more focussed on the moment-to-moment combat then big picture balancing of resources. There are no keys, and your "bombs" are used exclusively for fighting. Most upgrades offer only numerical stat increases. The actual gameplay, however, has different ideas. Hit detection is awkward, enemies and hazards are more annoying or frustrating than interesting, and for all the focus on numerical upgrades, you never really feel more powerful than when you start. Isaac had it's share of numerical upgrades, but on any given run, you were bound to find at least one item that fundamentally changed how you approached the rest of the game. Each run felt different and unique. Each run of Our Darker Purpose just feels the same, but with the numbers shuffled around a bit.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you spend all your time with a game thinking about a different, better game, then that's not a very good sign for the game you're playing. If you've completed everything in The Binding of Isaac and really need something similar to hold you over until the remake, you'll get some enjoyment out of Our Darker Purpose.

Whenever I start it up, I feel like I am playing an extension of "Coraline."\n\nIf you have played "Binding of Isaac," you will feel at home. If not, do not fret. This is an isometric roguelike game. You start off as a weak Cordy, throwing tiny fireballs at malformed students. You progress through levels, picking up items, until you either die and start over, or beat a chapter and repeat the process, having unlocked another section of the towering orphanage. By the end, you feel powerful, even though you will only have a maximum of two active attacks (your basic fireball and an on-use item).\n\nThis game is tough. Even if you are extremely skilled at dodging enemy attacks, you will likely fail or take a very long time to win. Your victory depends on getting the right item drops and the right upgrades when you level up. However, there is a permanent upgrade system, where you spend credits earned after beating levels. Along with that, new items are unlocked, for accomplishing ingame achievements. This gives "Our Darker Purpose" heaps of replay value, and there is even a hard mode that can be unlocked, for those interested in an even bigger challenge.\n\nThere are some balance issues in the game, mainly with bosses. Some bosses feel like they have just the right amount of health, and others, mainly at the middle sections of the game, have way too much health and on-screen attacks *cough Time Keeper cough stationary plant boss that I cannot remember the name of* going on. If you get lucky with items, they are not too bad, but even then, these bosses will take quite some time to down. End-game enemies also take a lot of hits, depending on your build. By itself, this would not be an issue. These enemies, however, are usually jammed together in rooms full of hazards, causing some mild annoyance with the amount of kiting that has to be done.\n\nThe game is, as a whole, fantastic. The developers have given it several sizable updates, and it looks like it will get even more. It is very polished, with anti-crash measures put in place. It even has a borderless window mode (!!!).

I will list some of the issues I have with the game at launch, some may sound minor but have a very real impact on the way the game is played.\n\n-- movement speed --\n\nThe starting character (there may be others to unlock) is woefully sluggish. This slow movement combined with much-quicker-than-you enemy projectiles and othewrwise acceptable mechanics like your momentum affecting your own projectiles can lead to frustrating and needlessly tiresome encounters.\n\nThere are a number of perks available at level up that profess to increase movement speed, these are either completely incorrect in their supposed effect or the gains are far too minimal as even after taking more than one such perk there is never any noticable increase in your movement speed.\n\nThe interesting thing is the roll mechanic which acts as a little boost to evade enemies, the inclusion of which would have been unnecessary if the overall movement wasn't so awful. What I'm curious about is whether the roll was added to compensate for the overly slow base movement speed or whether the base movement speed was deliberately made that slow so as to make the planned roll mechanic relevant and useful.\n\n-- hitboxes / collision detection --\n\nThe hitboxes on both the player character and some enemies is, in my opinion, a little off. I suppose the issue here is that the hitbox on the player character is a little too big, a hit is registered even though your character sprite wasn't contacted by the projectile, environmental effect, etc etc. It's true that with continued play you would probably adapt to this slightly too big hit box and learn to compensate but you shouldn't have to, a game like this needs a reliable, accurate and finely tuned hit detection system.\n\nIn contrast, enemy hit boxes seem, at times, bafflingly arbitrary and with zero reference to their character sprites. More than once I've seen a projectile pass straight though an enemy without registering a hit, only for the next projectile on the same trajectory to instead register a successful hit. Again, this type of game thrives on tight, accurate hit detection, which at present, just isnt here.\n\nA lesser issue is with collision detection on environmental objects. This could well be tied to the above issue of your slightly oversized hit box but occasionally you do get stuck on environmental objects, even though it looks as though there is room enough to get by.\n\n-- pacing --\n\nThis is more of a personal one but I really feel the pacing of the game needs to be addressed, both in terms of character progression and item acquisition. In short, leveling up seems to take a little too long. Combined with the...underwhelming, shall we say, perks that you get on level up, this makes the whole level system seem honestly quite redundant. I never once found myself pleased, excited or glad to have levelled up, it just doesn't feel like much of a reward.\n\nItem acquisition is probably a bigger issue, more specifically WHEN you get items. This game lists Binding of Isaac as one influencing game and it really shows. In Isaac however, there is a reliable and reasonable pacing to item acquisition. By and large each floor has one item room and an item from the boss room. There's no guarantee either one will be any good but at least there are reliably (keys allowing), AT LEAST two items per floor.\n\nThis game does not have item rooms on each floor nor does it provide items as rewards after boss fights. In fact your most reliable source of items are the occasional mini-boss enemies (like elites from Diablo). These enemies are fairly few and far between however, you MIGHT find one per floor and some floors don't have any by design. This means you end up with very few items and the majority of itemsa you do find are unremarkable. I'm being quite generous when I say unremarkable by the way.\n\nI should note you can get items from vending machines but most are limited use and almost all are more than you can afford given the relative scarcity of money.\n\nAll in all, despite how critical you may feel I've been, I really do think this game has potential and there are some things to enjoy here but there are more things that I feel need to be addressed by the developer before this game can really be recommended.\n\nIn short, if you want to play an enjoyable but challanging twin stick shooter with tight controls and good pacing, play Binding of Isaac. It's pretty much all this game aspires to be and is considerably cheaper to boot.","January 29, 2014","false","1.6"," 157 of 270 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","157","270","0","23"

I do like the game but right now, I cannot recommend it for the simple reason it needs more time to bake.  Currently, my two major issues with the game are gameplay and balance.\n\nThe game lacks a decent reward system.  Your character starts off weak and stays weak throughout the game.  You can earn experience, level up, and get 1 of 2 perks.  Unfortunately, some of the perks are completely worthless (for example, -10% move speed for +2 healing pack capacity.) while others offer such a negligble benefit you can hardly tell they are there (+50% drop rate to items.)  You do find gear that can be useful but a lot of them don't work on bosses, others are broken, and some are so poorly implemented they do not make sense (2% health per 5 enemies killed. Worthless when you have around 100 life on average; why bother?).  Health, coins, and chalk (bombs essentially) drop in the game at a pathetic rate, leaving players scrambling for health.  I have had several runs where healing packs don't even drop.  You can buy items at vending machines but you cannot rely on them for survivability for long.  Lastly, you can donate credits (which you earn by completing levels) to unlock lasting benefits called "lessons" or donate to a counselor for passive, persistent upgrades.  You can only carry so many lessons and you only get more by donating to the counselor.  Unfortunately, you are forced to waste thousands of credits on the counselor and you only get upgrades every other level.  So while it is great to get +2 health pack capacity, it really sucks wasting 500 credits and being told the counselor was "expecting more."  I get the purpose behind it but since you get so few credits per level, it's insulting more than anything.\n\nThe enemy balance right now is all over the place.  Most are fine the way they are while a few are ridiculously cheap (firing homing clouds that phase through everything and confuse you [interesting bug with that; if you exit to the menu while confused, the menu controls are inverted]).  Enemy strength scales with level so you take more damage while having very little way to heal yourself due to the aforementioned awful drop rates.  Bosses are incredbily tedious due to how long fights last.  If boss health was shaved 20%, I think the balance would be right.  Currently, all you get for defeating bosses is decent amount of experience and progression to the next level.\n\nAs to the graphics, I greatly enjoy the grim feel of the game.  The music is appropriate and the sound effects are adequate.\n\nDue to the lack of balance at this point, I cannot recommend it.  I enjoy hard games.  I have spent way more time than I should in Binding of Issac and Dark Souls.  Those games offered a sense of accomplishment when you defeated a hard enemy.  Our Darker Purpose offers little for anything you accomplish.  That said, I would watch the progression of the game.  The developers are working hard and constantly updating the game.  I believe when all is said and done, Our Darker Purpose will be a great product.","February 25, 2014","false","9.3"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","31","48","0","0"

Every playthrough is different, and as you aquire different items each time you'll also have to play very different each time.\n\nYou will die often when starting to play Our Darker Purpose. But that doesn't matter, because with every achievement you get you'll also unlock classes, which are permament and can be chosen as you like.\n\nThe only downside to this game are the strange controller keybinds. The inventory and log, for example, are both on the right analog stick, as is the "use" button. It's also not possible to change this keybinds, which is a bit sad. However, this is just a small problem and the rest of the game more than makes up for it.","November 5, 2015","true","38.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

I was always interested in the "Binding of Isaac"-like gameplay but I just couldn't get over its special art direction. While Our Darker Purpose has an equally special art direction I like it personally a lot more. The goth design of the whole game works very well with its Lore and is interesting to watch.\n\nAs for the gameplay: The game begins with Cordy awakening after surviving the attack of her co-students. Your goal is to reach the highest floor (there are twelve in total) of the  Edgewood Home for Lost Children. Every floor consists of multiple rooms (taken from a pool of predefined rooms) which will be arranged in a random order. Everytime you enter a new room you have to kill all enemies inside to unlock the doors to the connected rooms. In order to ascend to the next floor you have to beat one of the many floor bosses. At floor 4, 7 and 11 you will always meet the same boss since they are story-based encounters. While playing you will die a lot and everytime you die you have to start anew from floor 1. The same happens the FIRST time you beat any of the story bosses. To help you in your quest to reach the top of the building there are several ways to get stronger:\n- On every floor you can find items either in chests, dropped by a champion (a stronger version of a normal enemy) or buyable in a vending machine with collected coins. They range from giving you an additional attack like bubbles or to slowing down enemies or reducing damage when hit. What items you get is random so there is a certain amount of luck involved in the game. Atleast at the vending machines you have some choice.\n- For killing enemies you get experience and so you can level up. Every level up you have to choose between two randomly chosen perks so have the possibility to adjust them to your playstyle or your found items.\n- In the process of the games you will earn (for example by unlocking the in-game achievements) different lessons and a number of periods needed to "equip" those lessons. This is the part you have to choose between two game sessions and where you have the largest influence on your own playstyle.\nSo as you see there is a lot of luck and random elements to assure replay value but also the possibilty for some own choices to adjust the game to your liking.\n\nFor the story: Genre typical it appears rather easy, has an interesting lore and another story hidden behind the surface. Take your time and find it yourself.\n\nFor the graphical and musical aspects: As stated before I really like the goth-like art style. The whole game fits nicely together and doesn't make a difference between high and low end pcs. The music fits the game nicely, most time more eerie and for the boss fights  more action orientated. If you find yourself liking the game I can only recommand to buy the available OST.\n\nAll in all "Our Darker Purpose" is a very recommandable game with a lot of replay value, an interesting art style, good music and a challenge for every skilled and/or patient gamer. As a special side note: The developers still update the game irregularly and try to give their customers the best experience possible. You can check this out in the update section yourself (Edit: It seems that there are no longer updates but the game is working and has a lot of content).\n\nPS: If you have questions just post them and I'll try to get back at them as fast as possible.\nPPS: If you want some more infos and you don't care for the obvious spoilers then I have here a guide showing and describing everyone of the 25 bosses of the game: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457157304","October 29, 2015","true","93.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

If you're shooting while strafing, the shot will fire at an angle, also requiring precise movement while shooting.\nHitboxes are odd, but you get used to them after a while.\nYour character isn't very mobile unless you utilize the dodge mechanic, so remember to use it in combat.\nIt's very expensive for what it is. It's on Humble Bundle right now, so I'd recommend getting it there.\nWhere the balls is the soundtrack!?\nGot the Touhou flowing through my veins a few times.\n\nUltimately, though, this review is coming from someone who has never played Risk of Rain, Binding of Issac, or any other games people compare it to.

The patterns of monsters are frustrating at first(like BoI) but you will eventually get the hand of it and when in critical danger you can roll to move away faster.

Enemies are grouped in factions, each faction has it own theme, appearance and they play differently from one and another. The each faction is harder then the last, the final faction can be very difficult to fight. The bosses are also unqiue, there is only two bosses that are similar. Most boss fights are fun and hard, only some are annoying. The levels also impact the game, the level are just as different as the factions.\n\nThe music for the game is amazing. Each theme go greaty with it's faction or boss. The music makes the game even more fun and it also make some bosses feel more challenging .\n\nThe game also has a nice story and lore. There is no voice acting, the story is all text base but should not be a problem for most. Most of the story need to be discovered  and most of the story is left to the player to interpret.\n\nThe art is very good. I like how they made it look hand draw. It has a story book feel to it.

Isaac has similar limitations, but thats due it's heritage as a flash game, and its tileset based environments and level design account for that, but not so here.\n\nAdd to that things like odd hitboxes, clunky movement, a sound menu which doesn't actually show what you have selected, and seemingly randomly set difficulty don't help, either.\n\nI'd recommended it, but not at the current price (around $15) when there are better alternatives - probably worth picking up cheap in a bundle though.\n","May 4, 2015","false","1.4"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","15","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/recommended/262790/","loveandpeace","sigh of dog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/loveandpeace/","809 products in account","tl;dr: It's Binding of Isaac as a girl.  If you liked Binding of Isaac, you'll like this game.\n\nIt's obvious -- an overhead, oldschool Zelda-inspired, 4-directional dual-stick shooter in which you play as a hapless, ambiguously 'innocent' child in a dark, gothic setting, moving from floor to floor collecting powerups and fighting huge, challenging bosses in a rogulike gameplay shell.  Yep, it's Binding of Isaac.  But not exactly.\n\nFirst of all, the little aesthetic differences on the surface; to start off with, you play as a girl (though one could argue you can technically play as a "girl" in BoI, and this game's Cordy looks kinda like Eve, but that's besides the point).  And instead of tears, you shoot fireballs.  And instead of going down an increasingly surreal basement, you go up an increasingly surreal schoolhouse / orphanage.  And instead of vicious, freakish abominations of nature, you fight vicious, freakish orphaned children (and eventually abominations of nature).  Yeah, really similar stuff... though overall ODP has a slightly less cartoonish, more Tim Burton-esque gothic style to it, which depending on your tastes may look a lot better than BoI's, and it's at least marginally "classier", with a LOT less bodily fluids and toilet humor, though its share of less-than-prudish bits here and there; it's more on the "somewhat unsettling/disturbing, but kind of cool" level than the "gross-out until you get used to it and just laugh the rest of the way" level BoI sits on.\n\nBut what about the gameplay?  Well, it is indeed EXTREMELY similar to Isaac, but with a few fundamental differences.  The biggest ones are:\nA) an experience/levelling system, which guarantees at least semi-regular increases in power comparable to a useful passive item upgrade, especially if you're one of those players like me who insists on clearing every single room in every floor.  This kind of replaces BoI's item rooms on each floor, though this is somewhat of a blessing since level-up bonuses are nearly ALWAYS good if not great.\nB) a persistant upgrade system to make yourself or the world around you more geared for your success as you build up tokens earned by completing floors and getting achievements, which you can spend on either 'lessons' (passive effects you earn through achievements as well) or your 'guidance counselor' (which is basically a way to bank extra currency for gradual bonuses, similar to the coin bank in BoI in a way)\nC) the ability to DODGE ROLL.  You have no idea how good this is and how it changes the experience compared to BoI!  Not only is it just a universally useful thing to have but it allows you to, say, take a slow movement-speed build and not be forced to tank countless hits from enemies/projectiles that are literally unavoidable without speed past a certain threshold like in BoI.\n\nThere are other smaller differences, like the fact you get to manually choose your next floor out of 2-4 choices and see the variables they have (kind of like curses in BoI but often with both positive and negative, or even outright positive, effects)... or the fact that instead of bombs which I say are of dubious quality anyway in BoI, you get chalk which is basically a very rare but very powerful utility that can be used both offensively and defensely.  Also, as opposed to your regular bombable secret rooms, in this game they're rather obvious and easy to find and only occur once every few floors on average, anyway.\n\nAside from those points, it's more or less an identical game.  But that's not a bad thing.  Like so many great games of PC gaming past copied the original Rogue and created the genre we now know as roguelike, ODP copies Binding of Isaac which is this generation's most well-known and quite possibly well-made roguelike.  And it is a great game.  There's really no reason I can think of NOT to buy it if you like Isaac at all, or just action rpg/overhead shooter/roguelikes in a general sense.  The graphics are unique and lovely, the music is atmospheric, the gameplay is tight and spot-on, and it never seems unfair, far less than Isaac.\n\nI suppose if I had one criticism, it'd be that it's more 'subdued' than BoI... besides in an aethetic sense as mentioned earlier, there are definitely far less ways to make your character / shots nearly as 'wild' or unique as you can in Isaac, and it's basically a matter of doing what you can to make them stronger, faster, have longer range, and add as many supplementary alternate 'bullets' as you can through various means.  But since the game's designed and balanced around this less over-the-top style it's really not that big of a deal.","July 10, 2015","true","28.0"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Add some magic to the already surrealistic world and you get Our Darker Purpose: the story of Cordy who has to survive in this magical, yet treacherous school as all students turned on one another.\n\nThe similarity to Binding of Isaac is out of question. Procedurally generated world? Check. Going from one room to the next till we reach a randomly picked boss in every chapter? Check. Very (and I mean VERY) difficult, challenging gameplay that is unforgiving from the very beginning? Check. When the going gets tough, the tough get going: just because you have only one life you will still return to see if you can defeat the boss during the umpteenth time.\n\nI liked the game's graphics as well as its excellent soundtrack. Both create a unique atmosphere: the further progress you make (you basically go upstairs in the school) the more diverse the rooms and enemies get. Levelling up and collecting items (that either give you passive or active abilities) make you stronger which is a must especially when it comes to boss battles.\n\nOne particular thing I liked about the game is how it rewards you with "lessons" for achievement completion. These are all aids that help you during your next run: you can activate them from the main menu by spending the credits you earn during each floor. And if you haven't gotten any achis unlocked during an unsuccessful run, don't worry: the counselor is always waiting you in the main menu and by donating credits he gives you various bonuses. Make sure you look for the archivist as by exploring his study you can get info on what achievements you need to unlock for rewards (you need information on the game's lore as all achievements are hidden).\n\nThe game is tough. Boss fights require you to get to know your enemy very well. And if you mastered the fight with them you can still add an extra challenge by defeating them with a criterion; this must always be met if you want the corresponding achievement. I still find it hard to believe the Disciplined can be eliminated just under 75 seconds. Also, there's still a hard mode for those that find normal not challenging enough. I do not think there's such a person, though.\n\nIt's always nice to see the active support from the community. ODP started as a Kickstarter project and people pledged their support by donating around 50,000 dollars. Half a year later the game was greenlit on Steam and in just a couple of more months it was fully released.\n\nIf you liked Binding of Isaac and are happy to try something a bit more gothic in style then you are in for a treat.

So ODP is basically a twin stick roguelike with a heavy emphasis on finding the right item at the right time. Unlocking the right items can be a bit tedious since the first rounds tend to be quite difficult. But after the first bumpy runs you get used to the flow of the game and it really opens up. It's a bit short but you'll want to run the game more than one time anyway. The art style and music is really great and transports the atmosphere of the abandoned children shelter quite nicely. The lore is great if you want to invest the time in reading it. Overall a great game which I can only recommend since the devs are still providing patches for the game with new items or the newly added controller support, there is nothing which I could really criticize. A good buy which I don't regret. For fans of the genre a great buy, everyone else can buy on sale and the chances that you may like it aren't that slim.","January 21, 2015","true","13.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Room layouts and enemy types are random, items drop that augement your shots/defenses/etc, there are bosses at the end of every floor, and so on.\n\nThe differences are in the details; ODP is a bit more strategic and less random than BoI. Player movement is much slower (but you can roll for extra speed), projectiles also tend to be slower, and enemy patterns tend to be a little more predictable. Further:\n\n- There is an XP system, and every level up you get to choose between two books, which are essentially Fallout-style perks- most are only beneficial, some require trade-offs.\n- Pickup items, bosses, etc, all unlock in greater quantities as you progress.\n- As you unlock achievements and generally progress in the game, you unlock different "classes" which are persistent perks, and can be equipped using available "class periods" so you can mix and match your class schedule and have a somewhat persistent build. For example, my current character starts with a few extra coins, extra crit chance when close to enemies, and the ability to shoot while rolling. I may want to switch these for other classes once more lucrative ones are unlocked.\n\nI have played for 11 hours and completed the first of three (four?) chapters at the 9 hour mark. I've only gotten past that point a couple of times since. I am still seeing new enemies and bosses and have less than 50% of the pickup items unlocked according to the ingame stats.\n\nAll of the artwork is hand-drawn (the player and enemy sprites at least) with great thick ink lines. I almost think the assets were done on paper and scanned into sprites. Just like the screenshots indicate, it's very reminiscent of Edward Gorey, Tim Burton, Neil Gaiman's Coraline, and other media in the Goth Kid style. It's clean and consistent throughout. The music is decent and fits thematically with the visuals. Some of the tracks (especially the boss battles) sound properly big and orchestral which is impressive considering it was composed and orchestrated by one guy[natefenwicksmith.bandcamp.com] (this is a link to the soundtrack). As for the setting and story, the game again draws deep from its obvious influences but adds enough of its own spin that things never feel derivitave or cliched. The ingame writing- the item descriptions and lore pages and such- is effectively humorous and creepy, often at the same time. The slow drip of the plot and absolute consistency in the narrative (a school where things are not quite right) are high points.\n\nPerhaps my biggest praise for Our Darker Purpose is that in all the hours I've played (now 19 at the time of this edit) I have always felt a sense of progression. Every run seems to go a little further than the last, or I find a new item for the first time, or unlock one thing or another and want to go right back for another run. It hasn't just been a smooth learning curve -- everything about it has improved with as I've played more.\n\nThis was a rare day-one impulse buy for me - I had never heard of Our Darker Purpose before it launched on Steam. And what a pleasant surprise it's been! Highly recommended to any BoI fan or really anyone who enjoys these "rogue" influenced action games.","February 9, 2014","true","21.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zapfap/recommended/262790/","zapfap","Anus-Eyes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zapfap/","359 products in account","Incredibly disappointing, on the surface Our Darker Purpose seemed like it would be a promising addition to the "Procedural Death Labyrinth" style of roguelike games, but once you start playing the bad quickly outweighs the good.\n\nOne thing that drew me in was the art style shown in the previews, looking very dark and bleak. While it is prevalent throughout the whole of the game, it quickly loses its shine after repeated playings, especially when the player character looks ripped from a chibi manga for no apparent reason. All in all it looks like a 13 year old A Series of Unfortunate Events fan's failed deviantART page, with very little that's truly original in design, not to mention the framerate for pretty much all character animations are stiff and awful, and not in an intentional way designed to add to the atmosphere.\n\nThe biggest problem is the gameplay, though. Attacks are bland, enemies show little sign of taking damage when hurt and die in tiny puffs of smoke, movement is slow, items can be near-useless, leveling up isn't exciting, bosses are either boring and tedious or ridiculously difficult, traps are hard to dodge or are so easy to avoid they don't even have a purpose of being there (unless one of your item's effects sets it off unintentionally, which is INCREDIBLY annoying, by the way), there's a light mechanic which seriously doesn't gel with the game mechanics, the areas blend together into monochromatic vomit and overall it's just not fun to experience. I seriously had to push myself to play it, saying to myself that I probably just didn't get far enough into it for it to grab me, but that's pretty poor reasoning, as a roguelike it should be MOST grabbing on first run since it's your first time stepping into the game's atmosphere and mechanics, it should fill you with excitement for a new experience, not make you catatonic within three hours of playing.\n\nI should probably talk about the story. It's bland. It's SO bland. There's a boarding school where the faculty are an evil sovereignity who barely care for the students that act as an anarchy except for the major social cliques who behave like warring tribes and you already know this plot because you angrily scribbled it into your diary when you were an emo kid in middle school.There's barely a drop of originality in the worldbuilding or plot, 90% of it is concepts that have been used several times before, the bullies being giants, the younger students acting like feral demi-humans and using school supplies as adhoc weaponry, the school faculty underreacting to student death or actively causing it, it's all been done before and done better.\n\nOverall this game is a lot like taking an x-ray of Tim Burton making love to A Series of Unfortunate Events while The Addams Family watches from out the window with a tub of store brand petroleum jelly: it's awful, pretentious, empty, not as slick as it could be, hard to see without proper light and has a chance of giving you cancer.\n\nAnd with that awkward metaphor said I slip back into my cave.","May 3, 2014","false","1.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Nothing special, but a lot of additional, unlockable pieces of lore through following archivists and beating bosses.\n\nGameplay:\nVery much like Binding of Isaac. Rectangular rooms with doorways in any of the cardinal directions, enemies, and random (annoying) pieces of debris/furniture scattered about. Different types of rooms include: Challenge rooms, vending machines, bosses, and the normal 'can't progress until you beat all the enemies' room. WASD to move, arrows to shoot, space to roll. Randomized items dropped by champion (red) enemies, in chests, and from vending machines. Each run will probably be different. Medium sized roster of bosses and enemies. Also, selectable paths with different traits, and passive upgrades that you can unlock by completing certain achievements. Overall, challenging, smooth controls, and a lot of replayability. The biggest issue that I have is that some of the hitboxes are a bit odd.\n\nArt/Soundtrack\nDank and dark. Just kidding, partially. The atmosphere is gothic and sticks to cooler/darker hues. The soundtrack just adds to this feeling. Solemn menu music, (slightly) haunting/eerie music while exploring the floors, and "mystical" boss music.

I remember playing this for the first time and thinking that everything was unfair. Your character, Cordy, is painfully slow and she does barely any damage. The enemies on the other hand seems to have too much health, too much speed, and whittle away your health very quickly. You can dodge using the roll to move faster, but you can't attack while rolling and you always seem to roll into the enemy attack and harmful environment instead of away from it. Why the hell can't I attack diagonally? How does anyone get enough tokens to pay for the exorbitant prices of items in vending machine? How am I supposed to get stronger if the items are too expensive to buy? How can anyone maintain decent health with the lack of juice boxes around to heal you? The bosses were incredibly difficult too. Their sole purpose seem to be to lower your health to less than half percent so that even if you do somehow beat the boss, you'll probably die to the more difficult enemies on the next floor. These bosses aren't even the main boss, there's a chapter boss after three "mini" bosses. After my first playthrough, I remember thinking that there was no ♥♥♥♥ing way I'd ever get good enough to beat even the first chapter. I didn't feel like playing anymore. But I got this game as a gift and I sure as hell wasn't wasting that person's money by playing less than an hour. So I kept playing, and I'm glad I did.\n\nOne thing you have to realize is that this game is hard. The learner's curve is freaking huge and you will die a lot. A lot a lot. You will die every time you encounter new enemies, you will die when you see new bosses, you will die when you play in different floor types. However you will eventually get used to the game. You will learn the way certain enemies move. Eventually you'll be breezing through entire floors while only taking a few hits the entire time. You start rolling and dodging like a champ. The slow movement and low damage no longer becomes an issue. The credits you earn after completing a floor can be used to gradually improve your character by unlocking "lessons" and permanent upgrades that last throughout your subsequent playthroughs. Every time you encounter a new boss or enemy, it seems like the difficulty suddenly spikes. Yet the game always gets easier after the first time you defeat a boss. You  will	 learn how to play this game, but only if you keep playing it.\n\nPeople like to compare this to Binding of Isaac. They say it's BOI except worse. Same twin-stick gameplay with a dodge mechanic and gothic artstyle, but less variety in items and clunkier mechanics. I myself have never played BOI, but I'm telling you now that the more you compare this game to BOI the less likely you'll enjoy this game. There are some criticisms I'd agree with, like having less variety in items. But Our Darker Purpose is NOT BOI. If you try to play this game like how you'd play BOI, then you're going to have a bad time. The game seems sadistic and cruel and UNFAIR when you first play, but once you learn how to play the game gets much easier. Personally, I don't view the smaller hitboxes, weaker character, and slow movement as "gameplay flaws" but rather as things you better get used to and use to adjust your playstyle accordingly. I understand if you don't enjoy this game because of that, but I disagree when people call them bad mechanics.\n\nThis game is my surprising Indie game of the year, even though I started playing this a year and a half after launch. I really enjoy playing this game, and I imagine I still have quite a few more hours to play before I reach the final boss.","December 14, 2015","true","29.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There's pretty much no flaws to it, other then a few meager little nitpicks.\n\nNow first off, I want you to imagine Tim Burton made the Binding of Isaac. Now remove anything remotely similar to Johnny Depp. That's what our Darker Purpose is. The game plays almost identically to BOI, albeit a bit more slow-paced. You collect items and level up every once and a while.\n\nThis game is a rogue-like, it has randomly generated floors, each with randomly generated rooms. Many of these floors will have a certain level-feeling (i.e. To Big, Leaderless, Power Struggle, Sensetive, etc.) that can make or break your playthrough. It's very rare that a death in this game will be the game's fault, although it won't be uncommon that your playthrough may get harder thanks to the luck of the draw present in all rogue-likes.\n\nIn short, Our Darker Purpose is a fine piece of work, and by-and-far one of my more favorite games. It has a nice sense of humour, a gorgousley grim art-style, plays near perfectly, and is hard to boot.","March 5, 2014","true","6.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgewalker_zero/recommended/262790/","edgewalker_zero","Edgewalker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edgewalker_zero/","207 products in account",""Our Darker Purpose" is a "me too" roguelike that no doubt means to sail in the wake of runaway successes like The Binding of Isaac. Unlike the others, though, ODP offers significantly more in the way of RPG elements.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, ODP is very much in the real-time roguelike tradition, with a series of rooms in which the player faces challenges of combat or dexterity. You are locked in a room until you complete it, and then may enter an adjoining one.\n\nPros\nCompared to other roguelikes, ODP has level progression per session, with choices of perks at each level-up. Your choices are effectively a build for the session, and reduce the randomness normally associated with roguelikes.\n\nThe gothic art style is a good choice, and was no doubt influenced by Edward Gorey, a personal favorite of mine, as well as more recent expressions of the genre, such as "Don't Starve."\n\nODP has a story that unfolds in fragments, and while it's hardly a masterpiece, it's far more than one would expect for the genre.\n\nCons\nThe lack of controller support is a big mark against the game, and an oversight that is more egregious considering the genre.\n\nI like the sketchy, gothic art style, but ODP's art style feels amateur and inconsistent. Some objects feature sharp, fine lines and hard edges, while others are soft and look like they've been heavily resampled. Also, there is insufficient variation in room props. I've seen many pixel-perfect-identical desks or chairs spawn in neat grids in the room.\n\nThe pacing is poorly managed, and the rooms quickly become boring and repetitive. Many rooms require far more patience than actual skill, at times making the game a tedious slog.\n\nPickups are mostly uninteresting and give small bonuses to stats like health, critical chance, and damage. Roguelikes usually feature a variety of highly powerful objects or abilities, or at a minimum, very interesting ones with multiplicative synergy. ODP's pickups lack synergy and (generally ) only linearly affect stats.\n\nThe game's difficulty is disappointing. The game is very easy when compared to hardcore roguelikes, and will probably disappoint players who expect a serious challenge.","April 11","false","2.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","4"

I mean, you picked some glasses that will extend your projectile range. But your character stays the same from start to end.\n\nI've tried to like the game. My first impression on the game was like "I can't believe I paid 10 bucks for this." So I played give the game some more time, played it some more. The devs has patched the game with some updates, changing the item drop rates, starting movement speed and firing rate. The result: the game got better.\n\nThe most noticeable flaw in this game is the lack of sound effect. The lore said something like the kids killed all the "quiet ones".

This one seems to take the same starting point as The Binding of Isaac, and steering the game towards another direction entirely.\nWhat I mean by this is that takes a very similar formula (a randomly generated Zelda-like dungeon with bosses, "shops" and items), but focuses on different aspects. While TBoI was a more visceral and kept item effects to more mysterious (not a lot of detailed description and stats), Our Darker Purpose tries to take things more precise in terms of gameplay, making the runs longer and significantly more difficult, and embelishes it with a fully fleshed lore as well as permanent progression.\n\nUnfortunately, it's a very tall order to beat. Taking the same genre but opposite design choices isn't always the best option. In this case, while I can see some people having a great time with this game, I can't say that I've enjoyed it nearly as much as the TBoI.\n\nI can't write a full review on a game like this, since the details are the secrets to this genre. If you're not very familiar with Binding of Isaac, I can't guarantee that you'll understand my points. Sorry if that's the case.\n\n\nFirst off, presentation. In this game, presentation is one of the highlights, and certainly something that took the developer's focus. It has a very gothic, Tim Burton-esque feel to it. While it may be a bit rough around the edges, it's pretty awesome in this regard. Everything seems to work towards delivering the same feeling, and it succeeds in doing so. From the music to the artstyle and the backstory, it is definitely very solid.\n\nEach Boss has a lore that you're told about after beating them, there are achievements to be unlocked (in-game only) that also give you even more story about them, etc. Everything you do seems to have a bit of story attached to it, which is good, if that's what you're looking for. If you're a purely mechanical player in these kinds of game (which is totally understandable), it may not matter as much, but it's still good that it's there.\nOne problem I have with it, is that it is not very subtle, for the most part. Lore is usually presented through full pages of text that require you to stop playing to read them... On the other hand, the furniture also talk to each other! After you finish a room, there's a chance that the tables and chairs will start talking, revealing a bit more of the game's dark humour. Later on, however, you'll be trying to beat the game rather than patiently waiting for them to stop talking to resume your gameplay so, while I like what they were trying to do, I don't think it worked particularly well.\n\n\nI can't divide this very well, so I'm just going to mention topics that come to mind about main differences to other games in the genre (and what makes them/this more fun).\nFloors are, as expected, randomly generated. In this, however, the algorithm had some problems, as adjacent rooms rarely had a connection (aside from the one exit/entrance). In each floor you have normal enemies, a secret room chance, a vending machine, a Boss fight, and possibly Elite enemies. Normal enemies may drop Health/Chalk consumables or money. The vending machines may also have consumables, or items for you to buy, both passive or active.\nThe Boss fight rewards you with XP only, but not an item. To counter this, Elite enemies always drop an item. There are also some environmental hazard rooms with a chest in them. Some are hard to reach, while others are locked for a given time, and you have to try and survive during that time. Chests also contain items.\nOnly very cool aspect, is that every floor has a twist to it. When you finish one, you're given choices of several random floors, and you're given some information about them. The most important, is floor modifiers. Some are very dark but provide discounts (or more XP), some have more Elites, others guarantee you a secret room, some have 2 vendings machines, some have none, but give you more money, etc. etc. There are a bunch of them that you'll encounters, and their effects are not 100% clear at first. It provides another source of variety in playstyle nonetheless, once you get the hang of it.\n\nOne of the main sources of power, is leveling up. You get XP by killing enemies (or getting some items that improve your gain, or level you up instantly) and with each level, you can choose one of two perks. These are also random (although I believe the pair is fixed. Two perks are often together, although you may get different choices, randomly).\nUnlike many games in the genre, they're very clear about what they do. They give you +20damage, or 15% moving speed and more consumable drops, etc. In my opinion, it makes the game less fun. One of the great aspects of the genre , is experimentation. You get some cryptic items, but discover what they do with time. In here, it's all very... safe. It's mostly straight up upgrades, although some require you to sacrifice one attribute to gain other.\n\nThe most important aspect in this game that took my enjoyment out of it, was the fact that the items are not very fun at all. There aren't as many items as one would expect, and they don't change gameplay all that much. While some do (maybe create 2 shots when you're not moving, or slow projectiles near you, or discharge electricity near you), most of them are simply stat changes, and it makes the game feel very stale.\nIn say, TBoI, there are often items that change your run drastically, and many of them synergise unpredictably with one other, which oftens leads to some crazy runs that are really fun. In here, there's very little of that. Besides, due to the low number of items, every run ends up feeling very same-y, and you require the same items to succeed.\n\n\nAnother very important aspect, is how the game feels. You character feels very impotent. Shots are tiny, with huge rooms full of enemies, often with hazards that are much bigger and faster than you. You do have a roll ability, though, you allows you to walk faster, but not shoot (unless you had a certain perk -- more on that later).\nWhile it may seem very intentional, the game doesn't benefit a lot from these details at all. Another problem, is how hitboxes are a bit too dodgy and don't match with the perspective. It's also a bit dodgy in other games of the genre, but it's especially noticeable here, and it doesn't feel right.\nAnd lastly, regarding this, is how the movement and shooting feels. I'm sorry for bringing it up again, but look at TBoI (LOL). Tears travel faster when you're shooting in the direction that you're walking, and travel slower if you talk on the opposite directions. When you walk to the sides, it changes the angle AND speed. In Our Darker Purpose, there's no speed change, only angle. This doesn't seems that big of a problem, but you can't imagine how much worst the shots feel as a result! It's something I hadn't considered before, but it's really impactful. Vlambeer, for example, is known to make great feeling games, so that's something I'll need to dive into soon enough. But yeah, movement and shooting doesn't feel very good to play, unfortunately.\n\n\nOnly one last aspect I want to mention. The game features a permanent progression system. Completing floors awards you with credits, and completing achievements and chapters (groups of floors gated by a final boss) grant you Lessons.\nYou can use credits to donate to a character (and gain passive benefits), or buy Lessons. Lessons then require you to have periods (you get one per chapter) to activate them, and they also give you passive benefits, although you'll have to choose carefuly between them. These have the ability to change your game quite a bit and give you some headstart.\nIn this game, this is a good thing, because it would be even more nightmarishly difficult without it.","November 22, 2014","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Of course we have the top-down perspective, shooting projectiles at enemies while running through rooms and picking up items. Heck, even the stragely sized rooms of ODP have been matched now that Rebirth is out. However, that is where comparisons for me end. Where as Isaac is focused on action and unsubtle humor, ODP is more about atmosphere, mystery, and discovery, with a sprinkle of humor mixed in for the dedicated or patient. How many games have idle conversations between pieces of furniture or sacks of potatoes?\nIts atmosphere is where it stands out the most in comparison. It is far darker (both in tone and in actual lighting) and there is far more to learn as the game progresses. Defeating bosses, finding secret rooms, and collecting certain items gives you insite into how the orphanage work and what dark secrets it was hiding, even before the events of the game. I felt like the lore of ODP is much deeper than Isaac, because where Isaac is more about interpretation, ODP is more about discovery.\nThe gameplay is the most similar between the two, but it has enough that sets it appart. There is dodge-rolling, recovery items (juice boxes) that you can hold for when you need them, a level up system, and a health bar with a value instead of hearts. Another huge difference is that in ODP, there is a special ability board of sorts in which you can unlock abilities, spend the points you get on each run to get use of them, and use a certain number of them to help improve your chances in various ways. And yes, improve your chances. This game is far more difficult than Isaac. There are very few, if any, overpowered items, although a number of them do synergize nicely. You have to work with what you have and hopefully use those preselected abilities to your advantage.\nOverall, I really enjoy Our Darker Purpose. While I do find Isaac more fun due to its wacky combinations and god-like status by the end of a run, Our Darker Purpose feels more satisfying. Going up the floors feels like far more of an accomplishment, beating a boss without taking damage or by beating it in its own special way is more fun, and the difficulty spikes so hard that if you aren't prepared you will die, no questions asked.\n","December 28, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoboldCoterie/recommended/262790/","KoboldCoterie","Kobold Foreign Relations Bureau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KoboldCoterie/","1187 products in account","This game tries very hard to be Binding of Isaac. In some ways, it succeeds, but in others, it fails.\n\nOur Darker Purpose features a fairly dark storyline involving rogue children in a boarding school of sorts, with a faculty akin to The Addams Family. Gameplay is very reminiscent of Binding of Isaac, as are the controls. Instead of bombs, you have chalk, which you can use to create puffs of chalk dust that damage and stun enemies caught within. Items are gained from killing minibosses or found in rooms similar to Binding of Isaac, though the game is much less accomodating and even the item rooms are generally full of traps and environmental hazards waiting to kill you. You have a dodge roll available (on a 2ish second cooldown) that can be used to move quicker or get out of tight spots, and works well with. You get health potions in the form of juice boxes that can be stored and used when needed, and rather than crying to damage enemies, you use some sort of magic to throw fireballs (this isn't really explained, at least in the first two chapters, which is what I've seen of the game as of the time of this writing). Completing levels and achievements earns you a currency which can be spent on unlocking permanent bonuses (extra juice box slots, for instance), and there's a number of passive bonuses that can be toggled on or off (you have a limited number of slots to fill with these, so choosing a set that works for your playstyle is key). This allows for a feeling of progression even when you aren't actually winning. This is good.\n\nThe game has more RPG and less arcade feel than Binding did - you have a character sheet of sorts with actual stats like crit chance, dodge chance, damage resistance and hit points, all visible to you at any time you care to look. Items increase or decrease these stats, and damage you deal or take is shown via floating numbers so there's much less guesswork than in Binding. Similarly, items tell you exactly what they do when you pick them up (or review them on your character sheet) so there's no need to try and figure out what that thing you just picked up does.\n\nThe game offers some interesting flavor / lore text attached to items, and bosses all come with a few paragraphs of lore (which becomes viewable when they're defeated), and occasionally after clearing a room the furnature (!) will have little conversations with each other that you can get tidbits of story hints from; I can't comment on the quality of the storyline conclusion (nor would I in a review such as this, but that's beside the point) as, as mentioned earlier, I haven't finished the game as of yet, but it's got enough mysterious elements to keep me interested.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws, though - the biggest of which, in my opinion, is the hitboxes. They're very illogical in some cases, and it becomes a matter of trying to memorize what each enemy's hitbox looks like so you can hit them reliably. It's difficult to explain this without illustrations, but some enemies have a hitbox covering their entire body, while some, the hitbox only covers their lower half, some have hitboxes that are wider or skinnier than the actual sprite, and the furnature / obstructions in the rooms have even stranger hitboxes - from some angles, shots will go through them, and from others, shots will 'hit' them without actually touching them. This is by and large the most frustrating thing about the game, to me. It also doesn't help that the characters are very tall and thin, for the most part, so it's significantly more difficult to dodge something from the left or right than it is from the top or bottom, as your hitbox is significantly larger on those sides.\n\nSome of the room layouts can seem pretty unfair, especially considering the hitbox problems noted above. A particular enemy may normally be no problem at all, but in certain rooms, because of the number of unkillable traps and obstruction placement, may result in losing 30+ hit points (out of the base 100) before being able to kill it. While this is, naturally, part of the game, the room layouts in Binding of Isaac never felt anywhere near this big of a factor.\n\nThe art style is very similar to Don't Starve (this may be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your personal preference), and this art direction certainly doesn't detract from the experience. The animations feel a little lacking, though - characters have a 'walk left' and 'walk right' animation, and an 'attack' animation, but not much else. Granted most games of this style use a similar system, but it feels much more noticeable here than in others due to the detail of the sprites.\n\nOverall, the game is quite fun. It doesn't feel as polished as Binding of Isaac did, but if you enjoyed Binding's gameplay, you'll likely enjoy this, too.\n\nThe Good:\n- Flavor / Lore is well done and interesting\n- Dodge roll mechanic leaves you feeling more in control\n- Items are interesting and varied\n- Gameplay is fairly addictive\n- Has a definite 'Just One More Try' effect\n- Bosses are varied and interesting (and numerous)\n\nThe Bad:\n- Hit boxes are a little funky.\n- Some room layouts feel unfair, even very early in the game\n- Animations feel too lackluster considering the detail of the sprites\n\nOverall Verdict:\nGood game, worth the $15.","January 29, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I was compairing this to one of the greatest games ever made (BoI) and didn't really review ODP as its own game with its own challenges and characteristics. What also made a huge difference for me was the updates in the hit detection. Which also shows that the dev's are listening, updating and I commend them for that. Surprisingly, the updates also balanced the games difficulty more and the shots seem a little less cheap. You still get stuck on just everything but is what makes this more challenging. What ODP does have in common with Binding of Isaac is how it is played. In BoI, the game cannot be beaten in one run, which is where ODP shares a commonality. The only other 2 things in common between them is the game play and large selection of random powerups. I am still a little disappointed in the mini bosses. A little more effort in the character design would go a long way and makes a huge difference both in first impressions and the replayability but I'll look past that. ODP overall is a good game, sorry not $14.99, but on-sale good. I can now recommend this to any twin stick shooter fan. I also retract my UGH!/10 rating and effective immediately, am giving this a 8/10. * -1 Miniboss clones, - 1 Progression = - 2\n\n#-+--+---+-------+------+---+-Prior-Review-+---+------+-------+---+--+-#\nWelp, it took me a couple games to make up my mind whether or not I liked this one and now that the nostalgia of a possible Binding of Isaac replacement fix has worn off I can now honestly say in one massively huge sigh, No, I do not like this one bit. First of all, this game, in every aspect of it is unfair, every little task seems like a chore, and has absolutely no balance to the dificulty, of which is only one, impossible. Also seems like every shot you take is a cheap one. Hit detection is ♥♥♥♥ poor on computer sprites, on top of being thrown into rooms which are traps with no way out. You are thrown into option screens at the most inopportune times. "Press Start to die" is what the menu should say. There is no progression as the first world at times can be harder than the next 2. I'm not sure if this is attributed by th random world generations or poor coding but the room design is aweful ans is comprised of some objects that make no sense but you'll get stuck on everyone of them! This game is not even a good challenge where it feels as if you did a little better you might make it through but feels more like Peyton Manning did after the first play of the Super Bowl. Hopeless. I really question if the hardness factor is due to a lack of content. I mean, if you can't reach the end, it's not like we know if its a short game. Boss fights are long, drawn out, and repetative. Mini bosses aren't original, just common enemies recolored, which are also repetative. Its like repeting repitious repitition. Out of 10 I give it an UGH!\n\nBut! It all makes sense now. We know I what their darker purpose is... its to rip those BOI fans of their $14.99.

It is, at its heart, a Binding Of Isaac clone, set in a haunted/♥♥♥♥♥♥/abusive orphanage/boarding-school. The issues with this game are not in its concept, but in its execution. Binding Of Isaac works because of randomly generated but stable room plans, simple yet challenging monsters, and hundreds of wacky but serviceable powerups, all of which build on eachother to make a game that takes seconds to learn, and weeks to master. ODP falls flat on each and every one of those points. The room plans are disorganized and random, with hazards and set dressing not clearly divided, and the rooms themselves often being far too large to suit the gameplay. The enemies have very little variation, and only offer challenge in situations where you get boxed in and have no other choice than to take damage to escape. The powerups, what should be the most interesting and creative aspect of a rogue-lite game, are bafflingly bland and do little other than provide paltry bonuses which hardly ever change how you pay the game, compared to better games of the same type where a single item can change playstyle completely, or at least open up new options. To top it all off, the gameplay is functional, but features many features it flat out does not need, from chalk-dust clouds that are objectivly useless, to treasure chests and items requiring manual interaction (why would I not want to just pick it up? Why can I only interact with treasure chests from one side?). To make matters worse, though the game is obviously sprite based, it tries to emulate an isometric layering effect, which only produces annoying hit detection issues, especially on bosses. I could honestly go on about everything the devs did wrong in this game, and how the lore and art style have a ton of great potential, but I think anyone who wont listen to me  already owns this game, anyone who's curious will no longer be interested in buying it, and anyone who thinks this game looks like crap will just end up saving money.","March 25, 2014","false","28.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

That comparison might seem an injustice to people who claim to like the additions this game adds, but really, it's hard to see where else they gathered influence to make the game.\n\nAnd it's the minute change of style that makes ODP fail. The game lacks any sense of reward/feeling of progression to your character in your present playthrough. Not unlike Isaac, you gain items and passive abilities to 'improve' your character. Thing is, 90% of those items are arbitrary. 10% added to X abilitiy and Y ability don't mean a damn. And what further makes the system so unrewarding is that they are few and far between. Yes, even the bosses do not drop items. To me this goes against everything that the game is trying to be. The idea for a roguelike is to strain to overcome a point in the game giving you trouble, and rewarding you. After defeating a pretty ridiculous early boss that fires in bullet-hell style with my character of several useless abilities, it felt so sigh worthy to know that fight meant sweet fa to me in the grand course of things.\n\nThe game's difficulty (and I'm not averse to difficulty) is pretty unbalanced too, especially when you take the previous point. It's worth noting that only 2 or 3 levels in and you will face levels that will make I Wanna be the Guy players wince. Problem is, you have little room for error ( unlike the IWBTG games ) and little to work with, because the game just doesn't help you along the way. Worth pointing out is the movement mechanic; it's incredibly slow and gives you a 'roll' button which is so finicky to control with WASD. Collision detection is also mediocre.\n\nIf you though Isaac got difficult toward the end, this game is definitely not for you.\n\nNow, I can hear people defending these points, but those people are happy to ignore technical aesthetic and just play the game with the inordinate challenge in mind. Also, the game has a great story element, humorous and dark, and a great musical score.\n\nYet, I really can't recommend this game to even Isaac fans.","February 28, 2014","false","4.6"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"

It's actually pretty hard to recommend it, although I really want to do it. It has nice visuals, great art style and pleasant music. It has a certain Burton-esque feel because of that, which I like, I won't lie.\nIn gameplay terms "Our Darker Purpose" looks like a follow-up to "The Binding of Isaac", there's no doubt about that. And to a degree it does some things even better that "Isaac" - personally, I like the fact that rooms are different in size almost every time, instead of 3x3 blocks in "Isaac". It gives variation. With that, and with addition of a level up mechanic and the ability to roll and dodge, it makes this game to stand out next to "TBoI". But...\nThere are problems. And they are pretty bad. First of all, level up benefits and bonuses from items. They are practically non-existent. The only time I actually saw a slight change in combat performance was with rate of fire, and that was only because I've leveled this stat with basically every level up and item that have dropped from mini-bosses. And again - this was almost a non-existent change. As for the other stats... Well, there was no feel of change at all - not with range of fire, not with movement speed, not with anything.\nThe movement speed is one of the biggest problems. You move with the speed and grace of a snail, no matter how many level ups you dump into a movement speed upgrades. Developers added the roll as a way to move faster, sure, but it doesn't make it better. It feels more like a cheap way to justify the roll mechanic.\nThere is another problem - hit detection. I have a feeling that the hit box of your character is actually bigger than the characther herself. Because of that it's hard to say when you would take damage and when not. Not to mention an always present chance of stucking in an environmental object while walking or rolling at the most crucial moment because of those odd hit boxes. But it's worse with enemies. Some times your projectiles just fly through them, doing nothing. Granted, that's more likely to happen with enemies bigger then Cordy. For instance, the only way to actually hit that tall-as-a-mountain girl who throws chairs at you is (when you are not above or under her) is to shoot in her legs/belly. Why? She is twice as big as Cordy! Why I can't shoot her in a head, for god sake?\nWith all that, the game is supposed to be that "fiendishly hard platformer/action", I guess. Basically a game genre on it's own these days. Yes, it is hard. But not in a good way, unfortunatly. Take, for instance, "They bleed pixels". It is a great "fiendisly hard platformer". Why? Because it's hard but fair. Unfortunatly I can't say the same about "Our Darker Purpose". Here all this difficulty comes mostly from one source - the game throws tons of projectiles and enemies at you at the same time. Combine that with odd hit detection, slow movement speed, basically non-existent stat changes, and you get your "fiendish" difficulty. And what's more depressing is that it feels cheap. "You want your game to be very difficult? Make your character slow, make his damage output weak and throw tons of stuff at him! Have fun!".\nOverall, would I recommend this game at all, considering its problems?.. Suprisingly, yes. Under all these problems lies a good game. It's just that right now "Our Darker Purpose" feels unpolished, almost unfinished in terms of game mechanics. Would I recommend you to buy it? Yes. Maybe not for a full price, but yes. Support "Avidly Wild Games", show them that this game has potential on the market, that gamers are interrested in it. So that they would look at all these problems and fix them.

But it's still fair and also, every time you die, that run wasn't a complete waste, since you get crystals to upgrade stuff for future runs.\n\nGenerally, the game has an awesome, Tim Burton-like art style, combined with very atmospheric music.\nThe mechanics work a lot like The Binding Of Isaac, but faster, harder and with bigger rooms.\nEspecially the boss monsters are freaking creative and cool to fight. Some are harder than others, but with the right upgrades and playstyle, you should be able to defeat every single one of them.\n\nSo yeah, if you aren't a complete newbie in the Indie Game-szene, I'm definitely giving a big "YES" for this game, it's really worth every penny!","February 24, 2014","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is challenging, and I would say more so than The Binding Of Isaac. However, it has kept me coming back for more attempts despite this. Having just cleared the final chapter, I am currently hunting a couple more achievements before moving on to hardmode (another wonderful addition which in a sense makes the game 1.5 times longer.)\nThe lore is another difference from The Binding Of Isaac.

It will invariably draw comparisons to the Binding of Isaac, and fair enough, it's probably the most similar game to it. People will say the devs copied, devs will say they were inspired... play ODP for a bit and you won't care. If you like the play-style of BoI you will love this and comparisons will melt away as you get drawn to ODPs unique features it brings to the genre. Comparisons at this stage are possibly analogous to saying Sonic ripped off Mario because one came later and similarly involved jumping on platforms, picking up coins/rings and powerups in a side-scrolling 2D environment -I'm sure there will be others a lot like BoI to come. But ODP is great in its own right and excels at putting together a creepy room-crawler that feels like some kind of macabre harry potter adams family mish-mash. The lore and occasional talking furniture keep things interesting and darkly light-hearted and the music and art evidence that a lot of love went into making this. For a first game, Avidly Wild games did a great job. I've somehow invested over 100 hours in BoI, so I look forward to being ruined by this.","February 10, 2014","true","81.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

At least at its current state (and its not alpha, so i dont think its getting a lot better later).\nFirst complain - there is not much things to do. Lets compare it to something like Binding Of Isaac. On each floor it has secret rooms, item room, shop, consumables are constantly dropping like pills, tarot cards, chests, there is a meta-games with keys and bombs involved and its not even full list of stuff you can find in isaac. But in here, there is barely anything going on, except klling enemies over and over again. Yeah there is a vending machine on each level, but you rarely get enough money to buy stuff, and there is not that much stuff you can buy, in first place. And yeah there is a level up mechanics, but again, it happens rarely.\nSecond complain - too much freaking invincible enemies. I guess its developers trying to solve the problem of there not being much to do. So you are constantly feeling at least something. And the thing i felt was anger. In every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ room, not one, but several enemies you cant do anything about.\nThird complain - scarcity of items. At least in my experince i was getting like 5-7 same items every time i played the game. Are there even more items exist? And also, you get items rarely.\nSo in the end, this game sure has its positives, but all the negatives mentioned above are killing any fun you could have had.\nIf youre a fan of Binding Of Isaac, dont buy this game - you'll be disappointed.","February 2, 2014","false","3.8"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","1"

This is not one of them. Instead, it borrows whole-heartedly from the formula that made BoI so successful. The similarities make it impossible to review in its own universe.\n\nFirst, the difficulty is increased relative to BoI. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing, but I would recommend you play that game first if you are unfamiliar with the top-down rogue-like.\n\nThe artistic direction is superb. It still certainly draws on themes from BoI, but still manages to differentiate itself through its story-telling which was by-and-large non-existent in BoI. The story is generally told in the form of text with accompanying images, through small chunks of "lore" found after accomplishments, or by overhearing the conversations of sacks of potatoes. The small details like chattering furniture paint a more complete picture of the Edgeworth School for Lost Children.\n\nThe quantity and variety of items is somewhat lackluster. Most items act solely to adjust the unseen variables of the system (e.g. +10% movement speed. +10% range.) The items which alter gameplay stand out, but are relatively rare and thus, the stat-altering items feel monotonous by comparison. Sure, it is easier to design several items around the "attack speed" variable, but grabbing those items is not as impactful as picking up one that changes the trajectory of projectiles.\n\nHowever, ODP play the rogue-like balance well. As opposed to a more hardcore rogue, it has a system of persistent upgrades known as "classes" which grant the player new traits. The classes add depth by removing some of the randomness over multiple playthroughs while not detracting from the difficulty. Additionally, it incorporates a "leveling" system within each individual session that allows the player to augment the strength of the character to suit his styles.\n\nOverall, if you like BoI, you will like Our Darker Purpose. You are getting the same dish cooked and served by a new chef.\nIf you haven't played BoI, you can still enjoy Our Darker Purpose, albeit with a slightly steeper difficulty curve.\n\nIn either case, if you are looking for a challenging game saturated in gallows humor, I would recommend Our Darker Purpose.","November 1, 2014","true","21.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But Our Darker Purpose on the other hand relies on the skill of the player far more than the items that you get. I am not saying Binding of Isaac does not  rely on skill butit definitly requires less. In Binding of Isaac the boss's you face can all be brute forced while in Our Darker Purpose some boss's can not be beaten unless a certain tactic is employed. This along with the level up system, the constant lore that is provided (granted you look for it), and gothic drawn art style paired with harrowing music provide a very enjoyable experience.","January 15, 2015","true","86.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It also has a persistant aspect like League of Legends, where the credits you earned from your last few runs can be used to buy other passive upgrades like starting fromt he second floor, or start with more in run currency.\n\nThe good thing about the system is that yes it does allow you to slowly get more powerful and rewards you for playing well. That being said i'm stuck on the first chapter because I either suck at know how to dodge(likely), or i'm not getting good combos to kill things or kite them quick enough.\n\nOverall this game is fun with some glitches like being randomaly teleported away from a boss room into a black room. This game is still enjoyable to play with it's humour and references while still having a very dark storyline.","February 1, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I double-reviewed it with Costume Quest, so just scroll down a bit if Tim Schafer's stuff doesn't interest you.\nLink: http://azerothtozork.blogspot.com/2014/08/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html\n\nOur Darker Purpose is a top-down action roguelike with light RPG elements and a deliciously dark, gothic set of sensibilities. The game has bits of “The Binding of Isaac” and “Don’t Starve” in its family tree. The humor and art owe a bit to Tim Burton and a great deal to Edward Gory.\n\nMovement and combat is in the classic twin-stick style. You comb a floor of randomly laid out rooms for useful items and the chamber of the boss guarding the way forward. Each time you enter a room you’re locked in until you’ve cleared all enemies or overcome some other hazard, so you can’t just rush through.\n\nODP is set in a towering, Victorian, half boarding school, half orphanage called Edgewood. The school is a nightmare Hogwarts, teaming with darkly comic fates for poorly behaved or unwary students and ruled by an unseen but amusingly malevolent administrator. The bits of lore and narrative slowly unlocked through play are gothic black-humor at their finest.\n\nYou play as Cordy, an adorably pale waif with a permanent expression of bemused worry. When the faculty and staff of Edgewood abruptly vanish Cordy barely survives the purge of the small, weak, awkward, and unpopular children that immediately follows. With nothing to lose and nowhere to go but up she sets out for the top floor of the building, searching for answers and a way out. Provided she can survive the savage gangs of fellow children that have formed in the absence of adult supervision and the stranger things scuttling in the shadows and crawling across the chalkboards of the darkened school.\n\nFortunately Cordy has inexplicably developed the ability to hurl small darts of flame to defend herself. While Cordy can only hurl flame in the four cardinal directions she can move and shoot independently. An extremely limited number of chalk-bombs and an evasive roll (crucial to avoiding damage) round out her modest set of starting abilities.\n\nEarly attempts to ascend Edgewood invariably end in failure and death, a fact the game itself is quick to tell you to expect. Indeed it’s not mechanically possible to clear ODP on your first playthrough. Overcoming a major boss for the first time advances the narrative and adds a new set of variables to the game, but also ends that particular run. Like all true roguelikes ODP is intended to be played many, many times before completion.\n\nEdgewood is a stark, relentlessly hostile environment. Healing juice-boxes, money, and other useful items are in short supply and invariably guarded. Attrition as much as anything else usually ends a run. Learning the attack patterns of the various inhabitants and hazards is critical to long term progress. Finishing a floor without taking damage is an accomplishment to be lauded.\n\nODP is highly challenging and carless play will end a run in short order. Each attempt does help you slowly unlock new items to be found and build up a modest set of permanent bonuses. This helps create a sense of progression and that your efforts are being rewarded, even as you die time and time again.\n\nWhile primarily an action game ODP does manage to offer meaningful character development choices and interesting items. Each level-up offers two randomly selected but sizable stat upgrades. Some options include penalties still worth considering, like a permanently slower move speed in exchange for a large chunk of cash.\n\nMany of the items that can be scavenged from Edgewood’s chambers change Cordy in fundamental ways, like giving a massive boost to attack rate while making her formerly accurate shots spray out in a random arc. Some of the most powerful bits of gear break after you absorb a certain amount of damage (as if you needed another reason to dodge), while others require completing difficult challenges to unlock their power.\n\nOf course there’s no guarantee you’ll be offered useful items or upgrades, and everything is lost when you die anyway. This is normal for Roguelikes, but it can still be frustrating when bad luck dooms an otherwise promising run. The game’s other chief sin (significantly harder to forgive) is that creature hit-boxes don’t always match up with their models. While the game is two dimensional the “camera” is implied to be at a slight angle, meaning shots often pass behind an enemy’s head.\n\nReasons to play: Deliciously dark, gothic humor and art. Challenging twin-stick style gameplay. Meaningful progression from run to run.\n\nReasons to pass: Very high difficulty level. Slightly miss-leading hit-boxes.","August 26, 2014","true","22.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I purchased Our Darker Purpose as part of a Humble Bundle package, so I can at least say no harm no foul in having to pay money for the game.\n\nI'm constantly frustrated by this game, which makes enjoying it damn near impossible. I know there's an interesting story in there somewhere waiting to be told, but when you can barely play the game to get to that story and understand it, then what is the point?\n\nThe dodging aspect of the fighting is more damning than it is helpful, in my opinion, and any and every power-up I've received has never felt like it has done anything to help or hinder my gameplay. I feel just as weak as I did starting. You never know when you're about to walk into the boss room, so you can't prepare yourself for the ordeal, and pickups from enemies are so rare that they may as well not happen at all, leaving you to hoard the items that you get from the start. From a strategy point of view, there's also no delay whatsoever from the moment you walk through a door to the moment the enemies attack, not even a split second to assess your surroundings (which are insanely dark, a flaw that takes away from the art style instead of enhancing it) and plan your moves.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I really did, but it made a terrible first impression.","December 28, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Binding of Isaac was fun, most definitely, and this game tries to emulate the cutesy-creepy angle with a more "Addams Family gothic" angle, and while that's always pleasing (if a bit shallow), the mechanics are a bit stilted and I don't feel like I die knowing any more strategy than before. Also, it has the very annoying habit of claiming it's already running when it isn't, so accessing the game in the first place is nearly impossible. I can start up all my other games except for this one. Much like a leech, it seems to latch on out of sight until it meeses up my other processes. Restarting my laptop takes time, and time is money.

Music is great, but non of the monsters make sounds.\nThe boss fights are unique.  One or two of them are lame as hell, but overall, very postive experience.\nThe rogue-likeness keeps the game replayable.\nThere are permanent unlocks that add extra health ups, ect.\nThere are unlockable "classes/lessons" that you can choose before a run that do helpful things such as add higher dodge, higher crit chance, more frequent champion spawns (that drop good items).  As you progress further you can use more and more.\nMany more item unlocks that makes the game feel like its progressing.\nI'm not going to lie, you have to play through the game multiple times and unlock achievements to unlock better items/classes, but in return it makes the game easier.\n\nCons:\nThe difficulty sometimes feels unfair, especially some of the achievements attached to them, such as gain a 10 win-streak.  This game does require some degree of luck.  While there aren't items that are bad, not all of them are game winners, and you can easily end up with a weak character.  The game also takes a SOLID hour+ to complete without totally rushing.  Some of the end game achievements just seem like a cheap way to add to extremely frustrating replayablity.\nSome of the hit boxes on the enemies are questionable.\nMoving around can sometimes be clunky, you can get snagged on random objects that you shouldn't, which can lead to tons of unnecessary damage.\nThis game seems to make itself harder by using really annoying mechanics, such as having monsters constantly teleport everywhere, putting you in undodgeable rooms,  creating a totally cheap bullet-hell environment, and making the rooms so poorly lit that you can't see what the **** is coming at you, ect.\nThe difficulty can become more along the lines of do you have really powerful items versus gaming skills.  You could be ****ing boss at this game, but without good items you're gonna get ****ed in the face.\nHard mode literally just adds harder to kill enemies earlier on, and gives bosses extra bullets to spew in their already cheap bullet-hell, therfore making it more about finding killer items earlier on versus player skill.\n\nOverall, I really ****ing like this game, but as a player who likes to 100% the achievements this game is incredibly unfair with it's criteria.","September 7, 2015","true","99.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

True, it does share similarities to many familiar ones (Binding of Isaac is a frequently over used comparison by example), however, it is quite a bit different in quite a few ways.\n\nThis game has a harsh learning curve, you will die, you will be punished for mistakes, you will in general get stomped in some runs when you wished you hadn't. In return though, your experience in learning the patterns of the enemies, unlocking challenges, items, courses, and more will help with your progression through this amazing, yet harsh game.\n\nThe soundtrack is a mixed bag, many of the themes are quite memorable in my opinion, including but not limited too:  Welcome to Edgewood (level 1 theme) to Madness theme a later stage boss's theme. Catchy, dark (sinister), and very suting for your romp through Edgewood's dark halls.\n\nThe level up system you gain from killing enemies by obtaining EXP, are actually quite useful most of the time which some powers can easily make or break a run, depending on the RNG of which traits you manage to obtain in a run. For example one level up trait allows you to gain +1 damage for each Edgewood coin you pick up. Which doesn't sound that good until you start picking up large quantities of coins and watch your default 60-80 damage hitting for upwards of 150-300 damage in later stages if you manage to find a fortune of coins.\n\nThe course system which are perma-traits you can unlock and choose which to use can also be quite helpful, whether it be giving you a few additional starting Juice Boxes (which help restore HP when you are damaged by enemies or the misc. traps within Edgewood) to giving your critical hit a boost, to even expanding each individual room by 3 rooms.  Sure, you are forced to pick and choose which one you will start with, but most of them feel quite useful.\n\nThe enemies and bosses within the game are well varied,  and as you progress main enemies get improved in their damage dealing capabilities, and how much they themselves can endure which is also true for the bosses.  Sure, for a few floors you may face similar generic enemies, but they do switch up as you progress. Like I made mention of the learning curve, of how you approach each floor, the traits of each floor (which also givs variety to each independent floor) makes this a very harsh but rewarding game.\n\nIn comparison to similar games (Binding of Isaac): Yes, they are both rogue-like games, that have you progressing through levels, killing bosses, and obtaining a random assortment of items with varying effects, that's about where the comparison ends however:\n\nWhere Binding of Isaac is only moderately (at best) difficult, Our Darker Purpose is quite a learning experience in both success and failure.  Where Binding of Isaac most runs are easily feasible as long as you don't get certain items, Our Darker Purpose requires you to be wise to your own playstyle, and make wise decisions if you wish to progress far.\n\nWhere Binding of Isaac main mechanics revolve around the items, in Our Darker Purpose, the items, level up traits, Course abilities, and even level traits will majorly effect how the game plays out.\n\nBut in the long run, if you can handle facing a challenge or don't mind a learning curve, this game is certainly a worthy purchase, and now and then it still gets updated with tweaks (new level traits/items/etc.)...\n\nTo finish, this game is great, and I easily recommend it.","March 25, 2015","true","22.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hit detection is unreliable, your range is rubbish and the sound for smacking an enemy in the face is almost exactly the same as your projectile puttering out fight in front of them: I found myself firing at a boss thinking "boy, this guy is really soaking up the hits" only to realize that half of my shots are either landing harmlessly in front of him or striking/passing through a section that apparently doesn't take damage (And no, we're not talking about bosses who can only be hurt in one vulnerable section). And don't get me started on the fast, unpredictable bosses who are hard enough to hit WITHOUT the crazy amounts of shots they fire out.\n\nEnemy/room balancing leaves a lot to be desired. The game uses a "lighting" mechanic which makes it hard to see very far: a nice gimmick, but incredibly annoying when faced with enemies with extremely fast projectiles that come with no warning in huge rooms, or traps that spring when you come vaguely close. The props dealt about rooms lends some aethetic charm, but at times are difficult to predict whether they'll block movement or projectles. My main bugbear are certain enemies that fire slow moving clouds in your general direction. Doesn't sound too bad? Wait until there's four of them in a tight room, and they're all huddled away in hidey holes that can only be shot at from one direction (which you can't reach because the clouds chase you away while your aforementioned rubbish range can't hit them), AND there's an extra enemy who's raining down chairs so you can't even stand in the sweet spots for two seconds.\n\nI like hard games. I don't like games that get their difficulty from tedious play and horrible controls. I want to fail for reasons that are my fault, not because I didn't want to spend two minutes in ONE room taking potshot at those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ entrenched smog ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, or because I couldn't tell all my shots were missing because there's no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ audio/visual difference between hitting and missing something, or because the game wants to be a bullet hell without polished, reliable mechanics.\n\nAnd to think some people accuse this game of being a Binding of Isaac ripoff.

Sadly, you'll find these powerups are mostly useless, and you'll inevitably find yourself slowly, slowly, losing the game due to gradual loss of health.

I so wanted to like this game. But wow its so boring. Not really bad, just really really boring.\n\nNow, I've played many Isaac-esque games and I've loved most, one or two even taking my favor over isaac. And not once did I feel the need to compare the two. But in this case? The entire time I played it (which if you look really isnt long) I just kept thinking 'This is isaac this is isaac' until I realized 'No, of course its not, Isaac was actually fun.'\n\nLets start with the positives. The music is gorgeous, I adore the soundtrack to this and hoestly, despite not liking the game I would buy the soundtrack. The art style is great, for what setting they were going for it works, almost like a more detailed 'Dont Starve' look to it. They also have a dodge roll type feature which I like the idea of, but it also has its downsides. But thats really all I can give it.\n\nI found this game just didn't feel right, it lacked the polish. First off, the controls, your forced to used the keyboard only, so WASD for movement, arrows for shooting. And right away that put me off, I didn't like those controls in isaac (Used mouse in the first and controller in rebirth) and I certainly don't like them here. They feel really tight, and not in the good way, you feel so restricted to having both hands in a set place on your keyboard and the fluid motions of moving and using the mouse for shooting cant be replicated through a keyboard. Also but having to use the keyboard, you are forced to snake your fingers around trying to use your active item, chalk or rolling. Yeah remember I said about rolling having its downsides? Being forced to use the keyboard it limits how effective the rolling can really be when your also trying to shoot at the time time almost making the rolling redundant.\n\nThe animations are lazy. I can't really say it any other way than that. Especially on the main character (Cordy) where you would expect to see the most. Her movements look clunky (all 3 frames of it (not including the rolling)) and most enemies just seem to rock side to side.\n\nOne thing I find amusing is the store page for this game 'Key Features: Fast-Paced'. Let me tell you, it most certainly is not. The combat is so incredibly tedious and slow its insane. Even the weakest of the enemies take more than a necessary amount of hits. I've seen people say that this adds a level of depth and strategy to the game. I say it adds too much monotony and repepativeness to the game.\n\nWhile were talking about combat, you know with isaac how shooting things feels so satisfying? You feel the thud, you hear the collision? You don't get that with this. Due to everything taking so long to die it became quick to realize that its not satisfying to shoot things, the sound effects are incredibly bad and really get on your nerves really fast plus things just seem to waltz through your shots like nothing.\n\nI also saw someones review saying 'Where The Binding of Isaac is a fast-paced, almost bullet-hell game', which yes isaac is much more fast-pace, but the 'bullet-hell' thing also applys to this game, more so than isaac in my opinion. While not directly bullets the begining floors at least had A LOT of electrifying obsticals making it very difficult to maneuver while in combat and not getting hit. Not to mention the second boss I faced (some cauldron thing) which quite literally a bullet hell boss, an insanely tanky one at that.\n\nSo while no its not a bad game per-sey, its incredibly boring and slow and while you play it, like it or not your thinking 'Isaac did this better'. With that I genuinely cannot recommend this game when other games like Isaac, Hero Seige, Risk Of Rain etc exist.","December 19, 2014","false","0.3"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","10","22","2","3"

Smooth, challenging, constantly on your toes fun. Lives up to the atmosphere displayed in the trailer, the literature is fantastic. Unfortunately that becomes difficult to enjoy.\n\nFor some reason though the development and engineering of this game is horrible. The 2GB ram requirement is a LIE because the game runs 2/3 instances at a time, it can easily eat up 3 - 4 (as far as I can physically tell) gigs of ram for absolutely no reason other then the developer chose not to leak memory and after constant play (unless you have a few spare gigs of ram floating about, which most do up to 8) it will start skipping freezing up until crash. The game also constantly writes to a sql server running concurrently to store data for *every* stat (no literally everything, constantly) in the game, rather then your own computer.\n\nI play on a junk system sure (I only have 2gigs of ram), the requirements fit up for me, so I should of had no problem enjoying this. But I've had a HORRIBLE time trying to enjoy this due to poor development (engine?/Scripting? wise) and I'm shocked that steam allows such poorly designed indie games in their store. I guess I'll have to study a lot more about the game/read more reviews before purchase then trust the minimum specs.\n\nI feel like I shouldn't need a LOT of processing power to run this.

Thoughtful, well-balanced controls combined with well designed encounters leaves you with a game that rewards you for your increasing skill at surviving, while setting the bar higher notch by notch across four robust chapters.\n\nWhen they say brutal difficulty, they are not joking. Straight into the first chapter or even the first floor you will find yourself barely scraping by your first few runs, but though it may be unforgiving, it is also fair. The difficulty curve is smooth, and every monster has a clearly obvious attack pattern, every bullet is easy to track. Nothing you come up against will surprise you, but that doesn't lessen the challenge. If anything, it adds to the enjoyment. It's very satisfying to come out the other side of a difficult boss battle unscathed knowing that it was purely your skill and experience that got you through it.\n\nCharacter customization is fairly robust in the form of 'lessons,' powers you unlock over time and can then mix and match at the start of the game. Through this system you could, say, shoot while rolling. Or, alternatively, shoot further while standing still. It's a nice way to complement your individual playstyles. In addition, you can level up through your run and choose from a pair of random perks to further enhance or alter your play.\n\nCombine that with 80 items and you've got plenty of variety run to run to enjoy. Certain items even offer challenges of their own to activate, and the most powerful can break after you take damage, further incentivizing smarter and better play.\n\nIt's not without it's certain annoyances, however, and the worst offender is probably the room terrain. Objects can be 'sticky' or in fact be angular when they do not appear to be so. Seems minor until you realize your dodge was halted by an unseen prong sticking out from a desk, or a bouncing projectile suddenly taking a hard 60 degree turn off the door frame. You can learn to adjust to this, but it's counterintuitive and could have been better executed.\n\nThose small issues aren't be nearly enough to throw me off what is a great game. One of the few roguelikes I constantly walk away from with a sense of satisfaction, as I and the game both know I did better this time than the last.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nBe sure to check out my video review for a partial run and some gameplay footage along with me saying juice box wrong a MILLION times:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/jkoYjCtAkOQ","January 31, 2014","true","60.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The gameplay is fast and frantic. I love the difficulty, and that dying forces you to restart from the beginning. Being a roguelike game, levels will always be different, and therefore it will be extremely hard to predict who will be in what room, if that same room even exists.\n\nThe multiple pathways and plethora of items to collect guarantee replayability, and each playthrough will provide more details and more background to why Edgewood is the way it is. I'm a huge fan of story games, so I'm anxious to get as much as information as possible. There are multiple items to pick up throughout to help you, such as increased attack speed, or move faster after every roll (moreso than the default speed increase). Leveling up allows you to read a book, which offers a nice boost. As a beginner to this game and dying quite frequently, I like taking the extra life book, assuming it pops up.

How about something a little a lot harder!\n\nThats a good thing though. The one downside to Isaac was that it was sometimes to easy, given the right items getting to "It lives" was a strole in the park.\n\nCompare that to Our Darker Purpose, and it black and white! Im loving this game so far, really tests your reactions and concentration. I've only ever made it to the 3rd floor without dying but i've seen more than enough to know that this is something a little bit special.

The game features relatively tight controls, a feeling of progression as you can unlock new abilities each play through, even though each death sets you back to the beginning, and there is a wonderful sense of lore and mystery surrounding the story.  I don't like the ending, but the game itself is solid, save for a few hit box issues, where larger enemies have to be hit in the center to take any damage...which is annoying.  However, I consider this a fun little rogue-like, and the addition of a dodge roll makes this feel much more fluid and survivable than many out there.

Initially I was going to discard it as another indie game that sold entirely on the premise of its pretty art, but seeing as it was a roguelike, I decided to try out my new payment method by buying it.\n\nWell, those ten dollars could have been better spent.\n\nTrue to its roguelike nature, the game thrusts you upon the ruins of a school that changes every time you play the game. The thing is, you'll find yourself doing that way more than it'd be fun to.\n\nDon't assume I'm giving this game a bad review because of the difficulty.\n\nNo, it's because of the unfairness. There is practically nothing for your character (a distressed, half-goth-half-moeblob shy little girl named lovingly named Cordy) to do once an enemy has set their sights on you. What I imagine must have initially been designed as an evasive roll is instead little more than a glorified burst of speed where you can still be hit by the enemy. The rest of your abilities are terribly uneffective attacks -or at least, I assume they're attacks, by what little information I managed to absorb from a "tutorial" consisting of a few scribbles on the first room of each new game. It's nigh-impossible to dodge enemy attacks, and skill has naught to do with it.\n\nThe entire game's design either lacks foresight or is simply lazy. The majority of characters have a terrible lack of animations; Cordy herself only has an animation for her roll, and an animation for her walk. Getting hit by an enemy elicits little more than a "blink" from your sprite, reminscent of those from a past-decade arcade beat 'em up. Even the menus are strange, allowing you the use of your mouse in one menu, and taking it away from you in the next one. Like I said, the game offers you little-to-none information on just what the ♥♥♥♥ you're supposed to do, and it wasn't until my third death that I took it upon myself to navigate the jumbled menus to see if there was anything as my reward for future progress. True enough, there was a "Counselor" in one of the menus to whom I could pay the "favors" I earnt at the end of each level in exchange for tips.\n\nLike I said, the game didn't tell me any of this. I could have potentially gone an entire playthrough without even realizing there was a friendly NPC in the main menu. There may even be more helpful stuff out there for me to find. Perhaps if I type in the Konami code I'll get a lightsaber? If I don't experiment I'll never know.\n\nThose are the two main downfalls of this game. The lack of information, and the tediousness of the design. Oh, and the unfairness; did I mention you're screwed for the whole game?\n\nNow, the game has just come out, so it may be unfair for me to write a review this early. But you're supposed to release a game when it's at least completed enough to be /fun/, not as a half-baked cake with an IOU.\n\nIf you're looking for a game with similar art, get Don't Starve. If you're looking for a roguelike, get Rogue Legacy or Spelunky. At least at the moment I am writing this review, this game is not worth touching.","February 1, 2014","false","3.4"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","2"

If in Isaac your success depended on farming exploits or rolling useful items at the start, here it is even more randomized. Although there is a leveling system in the game, when you level you can choose between two abilities, some with partially detrimental effects, but worse, even these options are random abd you can easily get a nearly worthless roll every time. Frankly, that's not difficulty, that's merely luck-based gameplay, akin to playing dice, as your natural projectile and such can be nearly useless in most situations.\n\nAdditionally the rooms are cluttered with big junk that not only stays in your way, but actually have uneven, rough hit detection and often hold you in place if you walk near enough, making you that more vulnerable.\n\nYet again, if you liked Isaac, you might like this more randomized version (you could finish Isaac without a single item if you were good, here you'll be struggling with movement and projectile issues.), if you haven't played a roguelike before, try Isaac before coming around this.","January 30, 2014","false","2.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

It does a poor job of ripping off Binding of Isaac, ending up being too slow and plodding to offer anywhere near the entertainment value of its obvious inspiration. The visuals are nice, but it has very little else going for it, and bizarrely lacks controller support, which should be a given in a twin stick shooter. In Isaac it was excusable because it was a flash game, here it is not (and unlike Isaac, the controls don't map particularly well to a controller even if you use a key meandering program due to the game's use of way too many buttons for way too many things that should have been combined). It has potential, but fails to live up to it, offering a watered down experience that isn't worth your money.","October 30, 2014","false","1.7"," 6 of 28 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","6","28","0","0"

(There are upgrades you can start the game with once unlocked)\nIn addition to walking you have a roll move. The first is too slow to dodge much and the second loses too much precision of control to dodge effectively. This is a problem in what often feels like a bullet hell game. Also why does the dodge move have a cooldown timer?\nEnemies (both regular and especially bosses) take too long to kill. I often get frustrated and take more hits then I need to because I just want a boss fight to end already. The boss fights can also get very repetitious because you will see the same bosses again and again on every play through\nTo optimise your chances of dodging you need to keep a moderate distance from enemies so you have more reaction time when they shoot, but the default weapon range is very short. So often you will want to sneak into range, fire a few shots, then back away again. Combined with the high enemy health fights become really long-winded.\nThe game has rooms that scroll rather then being single screen which works very poorly in some situations. For example one enemy type throws furniture into the air which disappears off screen before coming down where you are standing. If the enemy is offscreen you'll only realise they are there when you get hit\nAfter all that complaining, I will still say that if you are a Binding of Isaac fan, you will get some fun out of this one. Try to get it on sale.","February 2, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll be the first person to admit, I love Binding of Isaac. It is a great game, between vanilla and Rebirth I've got over seven-hundred hours of Binding of Isaac and I will also be the first person to tell you that I think it unfair to compare the two.\n\nYes, this is a rogue dungeon crawling game about suffering, where you time your projectiles other creatures who also exist in a perpetual state of suffering, but it offers some subtleties that compliment the gaming experience in a completely different way. Between each level your are offered your choice of a few new randomly generated levels to choose from, each with its own unique attributes that are usually focused around making you feel sore in the bathing suit area.\n\nThe art and music is charming with gothic overtones and playful undertones. My feelings toward the game are quite different though there are some distinct similarities between it and Binding of Isaac. If you want another Binding of Isaac game though, pick up Rebirth, it's amazing, but there is no need for another developer to create a clone of a game that exists. This product stands alone in its own light (or darkness rather).\n\nGameplay wise this game reminds me of Gradius more than anything. It's more about dodging than getting more powerful to kill bigger uglier baddies. In Gradius a player found themselves weaving in tight spaces to avoid getting hit and dying. This game is a ton of that, squeeze in the little space that isn't on fire, covered in caltrops, or saturated in electricity, then shooting your pew pews hoping they'll kill the guy who is trying to derp you in the bathing suit area.\n\nIt may not be a game for everyone, but I wish it was.","February 7, 2015","true","154.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It provides the difficulty I never seemed to feel while playing BoI.\n\nDark story, unsettling atmosphere, and sketched out graphics all seem to highlight the game perfectly.\n\nWhile it does a feel a little clunky at times, as aiming can get a little getting used to, as well as poor starting range, the player has a very large health pool which is forgiving. However, try not to get hit as boss battles tend to be very lengthy and damaging, someimes taking out the majority of your health leaving you helpless for ensuing levels.\n\nAll the items in the game, as well as bosses and areas, have little tid bits of lore which I find absolutely fascinating, encouraging me to play more and more as I learn about the story.\n\nI can see how people would not like this game, as the difficulty spike, multitude of unkillable traps, and controls may be offputting. But for me, I like it. Maybe games with female protagonists who aren't especially glorified for their sexiness is something I praise in games.","January 16, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is elegent, the music just as good, and while the controls could be better failure in Our Darker Purpose feels very much one's own fault over simply being dealt a poor hand which is more a factor in Binding of Isaac.  I'm not sure of the fun, game-breaking elements of BoI are present in Our Darker Purpose -- I've only beaten one chapter -- but this is a game designed to be played through repeatedly.\n\nIf you like hard games, if you like a different experience each time, if you enjoyed Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac and other games where you've just one shot to complete it but don't want to be screwed over with simple bad luck then this could be the game for you.

While it has obviously drawn inspiration from several more popular games, especially Binding of Isaac which I have sunk far too much time into, Our Darker Purpose is its own thing entirely. Bullet hell dual stick shooters are fun in general to me. Our Darker Purpose has an interesting story that is, for some reason, related to King Lear and manages to be integrated to the game without being invasive to gameplay. There's also a clever sense of humor that shows up in item descriptions, backstory, and the talking potatoes.

This one comes with a roll dodge that increases your movement speed and can provide invulnerability given you have certain items. The game relies on a leveling system as well so there is an incentive to kill enemies and explore for more exp. On the flip side, a lot of the upgrades at this point feel a little unrewarding. Moreover, combat often feels like an uphill battle as there is a built-in vision system and your circle of vision can increase or decrease depending on items. There are also floors labelled as pitch black. Also, the default  shot is very small and travels a short distance so hitting enemies is a lot harder. Meanwhile, there are a lot of rooms where you will be bombarded with attacks which you are expected to dodge. Fortunately, taking damage isn't quite as punishing as Isaac as "juice boxes" (health potions) can be collected and stored for future use to restore your health which defaults to 100. The game also offers an achievement system whose rewards help out with future gameplay as you can spend "credits" earned from achievements for buffs in all games down the line. Overall, this game offers a beautifully dark and artistic take on Binding of Isaac that will also present much more difficulty for those that are looking for it.","June 23, 2014","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very similar to the game The Binding of Isaac, in the dungeon-rogue like way that  you have to collect items to improve your character and how you have to fight enemies and bosses to move on to the next floor. I've enjoyed playing this game for a number of reason some of whice are: The soundtrack is amazing, the storyline is pretty well done and detailed, the items are interesting, the dodging system is pretty nice and something new that I haven't seen before in any other games I've played, and it has talking potatoes! What more could you possibly want! The one thing that I've noticed they could improve on is how the hitbox works but other then that it's a great game! I rate it 8.5/10.

Similar to the Binding of Isaac in a few ways, such as top-down shooter, horde of collectible items and powerups and whatnot, and similar overall level design, but that's it! This game has it's own unique story, it's own enemies and bosses, it's own traps and obstacles, IT HAS A LEVELING SYSTEM! (something tBoI is unfortunately lacking), different moveset + functions, such as ROLLING!!, a number value for hp, (instead of hearts), and JUICE!!!!(as healthpacks!!!) The art style, animation, and use of light are also fantastic imo. Much more rogue-like, with unlockables...unlocked by replaying the game and earning credits to purchase new powers to START the game with, as well as passive bonuses. To those saying this game is too like tBoI, I both agree and disagree. They have a similar starting formula as tBoI, but expanded in so many wonderful ways that tBoI never did. I've spent a collective 375 hours playing The Binding of Isaac and Rebirth, so I feel as if I may say that it is one of my favorite games of all time. The fact that Our Darker Purpose shares some similar components, (while adding plenty of their own), to tBoI should mean it should be praised as another good game, in the same genre, not called a ripoff and hated and ♥♥♥♥ on for that fact. (Sidenote: IMO more challenging than tBoI)\nI really enjoy(ed) playing ODP, and think that anyone who loves the binding, will surely love this game.  :) 8.5-9/10","April 29, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some sound effects could use some work,  namely for the basic attack.\n\nThe only real problem with this game is how slow the progression is.  It feels like it takes way too long to make a difference.  Dozens of play throughs before you earn things to use throughout the playthroughs.\n\nThere's a lot of polish that could be done, including new features that would help it out.  Such as the ability to spend credits to directly increase starting stats as perma-buffs persistent throughout play.   Perhaps the ability to choose starting abilities that replace chalk, juice, the basic attack, and even the roll with similar but different effects.\n\nIf I were to change anything about Our Darker Purpose,  and believe me I'd love to see the change,  is a drastically increased pacing.  The hit box issue people often complain about isn't much of a problem once you get use to it and can even benefit you on occasion.\nThe pacing however is a serious problem and limits the enjoyability.\n\nI'd say to -DOUBLE- the amount of XP gained,  start with the option of a level up perk from the get-go,  and have bosses award either an immediate level up perk or an item,   then up credit gain significantly.   From there I really do believe that having the ability to spend credits to directly augment stats persistently would be a fantastic addition.   With these,  I think Our Darker Purpose would be one of my favorite games to play.\n\nIt could be really fantastic then.    I still prefer it over Binding of Isaac personally,  I think the biggest reason is the aesthetic and lore but also the timed cooldowns on items and numerical HP rather than room-based cooldowns.\n\nI would recommend it.  It seems to be a love/hate thing for most Binding of Isaac players,  who either prefer the differences or tote it as being "inferior in every way".","April 22, 2015","true","89.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is elegent, the music just as good, and while the controls could be better failure in Our Darker Purpose feels very much one's own fault over simply being dealt a poor hand which is more a factor in Binding of Isaac.  I'm not sure of the fun, game-breaking elements of BoI are present in Our Darker Purpose -- I've only beaten one chapter -- but this is a game designed to be played through repeatedly.\n\nIf you like hard games, if you like a different experience each time, if you enjoyed Risk of Rain, Binding of Isaac and other games where you've just one shot to complete it but don't want to be screwed over with simple bad luck then this could be the game for you.

So here's my two cents.\n\nFirst of all, I love The Binding of Issac. But between the two I much prefer Our Darker Purpose. And with all mechanics aside, I love this game's story, art style, and atmosphere. It's as if Lemony Snicket decided to create a video game centered around the nonchalant killing of children. Its concepts are gruesome, but presented in a humorous, light hearted manner. Even reading the flavor text for items gives me the chuckles. The enemies are neat, the bosses well thought out, and the setting of a boarding school has never been more depressing.\n\nWhat makes this game more appealing to me than The Binding of Issac is the fact that not everything is randomized. Unlike Issac where your ability to do well often depended on what items you recieved as rewards from chests and bosses, this game allows you the option of planning. Do you want to be centered around survivability or damage? Dodge or firing speed? The periods and item selection from vending machines allows this type of focus.\n\nSo don't knock this game just because it's a top down shooter and you're unable to look past similiarities. It's clear that the developers spent a lot of time and work on this game. And to top it off, it's pretty damn fun.","March 18, 2015","true","60.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the most recent beta patch, controller support is improved significantly, and the game now plays more like the twin-stick shooter it is at its heart. Everything feels more natural, and everything works better.\n\nIt's not perfect by a long margin. Reconfiguring controls could be more intuitive, and there are times when our hero kinda just shoots the direction she wants to instead of where you're telling her to... but it's all livable, and a significant improvement over its previous state.\n\nI love seeing developers (small or large) continue to make improvements after game launch, and the developers behind ODP clearly care about their game.\n\nI previously called this a "clone" of Binding of Issac, but for clarity's sake, I'll amend that: this game is very similar in tone, gameplay, and theme to Binding of Isacc. It is not, however, a "clone" in as much as there are substantial differences between the two. For my part, if things keep improving here, I may wind up liking this one better.\n\nAnd for those advising using the "mouse" to play? You can't. It doesn't work. There are no configuration options that work in that regard. I personally don't care: after the beta patch, the controls work just fine.\n\n((EDITED for Spelling, because I'm an idiot))","August 9, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","8"

Our Darker Purpose is a very close rip-off of binding of Isaac (which itself is a rip-off of Smash TV, which is a rip-off of that robot shooter arcade game I used to play when I was a kid (forgot the name)).  It's important not to get overly self-righteous about this.  But Binding of Isaac was comlpetely  original in it's weird, demented atmosphere.  The imagery of the setting, the enemies, and even the protagonist himself reflects this obtuse reality.  Our Darker Purpose tries to imitate that, but with less success.  It draws the line at being creepy.  And creepy is good.  But it falls short of it's predecessor.\n\nNow, that being said, it does pass the most important test of all... it's fun!  My favorite gameplay element is that you can build your character between playthroughs, which means that your progression isn't entirely skills-based -- good for those of use who lack the natural fast-twitch abilities of the modern teen.  I like the creepy as well, though not as much as I relish the deranged from Isaac.  But the designers did an excellent job of crafting a dark, unpleasant locale.  Also, a big positive over Isaac is that rooms are larger and can extend beyond the screen.   This makes for much more frenetic combat.\n\nIf you liked Binding of Isaac, you will have fun with this... no question.","May 7, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is really about RNG not just in the level up choices you are offered but in the loot you collect. The music is nice, descriptions are nice, its not gross like Issac can be. I like its art style more than Issacs and monster/bosses. I don't really care for the multi cody story so far. Sometimes you get a room by RNG that completely messes you up.\n\nAlso the disciplined king is a really frustrating boss. I've yet to be able to beat him and I've yet to enjoy more than 1 floor after defeating the fort boss since I always get the disciplined king as my first boss.\n\nEdit I've played way more and nearly finished the game.

Plus this game has a beautiful art style and atmosphere, but unfortunately there are three problems that prevent this game to shine like a true gem. And what are those 3 flaws of the game?\n1. Lack of enough polish 2. Lack of enough polish 3. Lack of enough polish.\nIn fact this game still look like an early access game, even 1 year after release. Here are some examples:\n\n- There are problems with colliders, for example door's collider is placed so poorly that going to next room is always frustrating.\n- Particle effects and FX of the game isn't in proper shape for release.\n- Sound design of the game is ridiculous: lots of charracters doesn't have any sound for their actions! and the in-game music doesn't match the gameplay, it's more proper for a walking simulator genre. devs should definately look into BoI's musics\n- Animations of characters don't have enough frames, so they aren't catchy enough.\n- Some here and there bugs.\n- Chalks aren't as useful as BoI's bombs. one reason for this is very low item/coin drop rate in the game. so you will never have enough chalks on the path to make them game changing.\n- After all leveling up and picking different items, you will never feel that your character is powerful enough. usually effects of items aren't very tangible. for example at start of the game, fire rate of our hero is 1.6 and at the end of the game it's something like 2.4 and that's something like 2 shots per second (not so fast). shot's range and damage are the same as fire rate. the result is that items and leveling up aren't rewarding enough.\n\nThis game could be a wonderful game with a score of 8.5 or 9. But in the current state, it still is a good game but it's more like a wasted potential.\n7/10","December 4, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can choose between two upgrades everytime you level up (boosting speed, health, atc.)\n\nOn top of it you can also pick up items in certain rooms that give added effects like instant level ups in the next chapter or damage resistance.\n\nHowever I feel like the movement speed is a little too slow. It wouldnt be such a big deal, but the movement speed upgrades feel like they dont give a boost at all.\n\nBesides that this game awesome.\n\nThe game is challenging and it forces you to play strategically, which makes it fun.\n\nI recommend it especially if you're a fan of difficult rogue-like games.\n","February 2, 2014","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However theres some important differences to note, before people go in expecting an BOI all over again.\n\nThe devs put in that dodge feature and damn do they expect you to use it, expect this game to be ALOT more defensive than BOI. Youll be dodging, prolly even more than youll be attacking, and that can get tedius/frustrating.\n\nDont expect to get like, 3 items a floor. Bosses dont drop them, money is incredibly scarce and usually better spent refilling health, so odds are youll get only 1 item per floor and youll like it. (Although i should mention, you do level up from time to time, which is basically like obtaining an item. As you progress however, they become rather infrequent)\n\nat time of writing, im about 2 hours and some change into the game, ive yet to encounter a single passive that changes my attack type. (*edit* Ok they do exist, got a bit farther, and ive found some.) There also arent any other classes to my knowledge. So dont expect a wildly different playstyle each time.\n\nthose are just the big differences, that wont be immediatley apparent in the screenshots. None of the games choices are bad, but alot of people might hear "its just like BOI" and be sold right away. if the above details bother you, you should consider moving along.","February 3, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're going to try to play it like Isaac and just be disappointed that it doesn't play in the same manner and then spread dislike about this game because it's highly likely that you're not going to adapt to how the game should be played.\n\nSecond, if you do buy the game, download the test, aka "beta", version first to get the latest version (400 or higher) if the game isn't already at it.  The patch addresses a majority of the problems most people have of it, even though I felt the base game was actually pretty good to begin with.\n\nThird, this game is hard.  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about this at all.  You HAVE to stick with it and unlock lessons, classes, and the counselor bonuses to make it easier for you.  Some of the attempts will require luck to unlock the boss/chapter achievements.  Others involve great skill.  It gets easier, especially with practice, trust me.  However, the difficulty of the game makes it that much more rewarding when you finally do succeed in various aspects of the game, like beating the chapter 1 boss for the first time.\n\nStraight up, I like this game and that's why I'm recommending it.  I'm not going to talk about aesthetics of the game, the actual feel of the game play, or anything else that's subjective to me in this review due to the fact that everyone likes different things in games.  All I can suggest is watching videos of it being played.  Hell, leave a comment and I'll record videos, with or without commentary (though I don't know if I can provide entertaining commentary).  If you like what you see, buy it.  If not, buy something else that suits your tastes.

I'll be the first person to admit, I love Binding of Isaac. It is a great game, between vanilla and Rebirth I've got over seven-hundred hours of Binding of Isaac and I will also be the first person to tell you that I think it unfair to compare the two.\n\nYes, this is a rogue dungeon crawling game about suffering, where you time your projectiles other creatures who also exist in a perpetual state of suffering, but it offers some subtleties that compliment the gaming experience in a completely different way. Between each level your are offered your choice of a few new randomly generated levels to choose from, each with its own unique attributes that are usually focused around making you feel sore in the bathing suit area.\n\nThe art and music is charming with gothic overtones and playful undertones. My feelings toward the game are quite different though there are some distinct similarities between it and Binding of Isaac. If you want another Binding of Isaac game though, pick up Rebirth, it's amazing, but there is no need for another developer to create a clone of a game that exists. This product stands alone in its own light (or darkness rather).\n\nGameplay wise this game reminds me of Gradius more than anything. It's more about dodging than getting more powerful to kill bigger uglier baddies. In Gradius a player found themselves weaving in tight spaces to avoid getting hit and dying. This game is a ton of that, squeeze in the little space that isn't on fire, covered in caltrops, or saturated in electricity, then shooting your pew pews hoping they'll kill the guy who is trying to derp you in the bathing suit area.\n\nIt may not be a game for everyone, but I wish it was.","February 7, 2015","true","154.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/recommended/262790/","MysteryAlex","I Aten't Dead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteryAlex/","258 products in account","I think thirteen hours in and an agonizing defeat near the top is enough time to give this game a fair review.\n\nOur Darker Purpose is an insanely hard Rogue-lite with many similar elements to Binding of Isaac only with a sort of Tim Burton / A Series of Unfortunate Events twist which really allows it to shine on its own merits. To quickly go into the simularities this game has to Binding of Isaac, there are several different floors with increasing difficulty and theming, interesting bosses, an open-to-interpretation plot, tons of unlockables that you grab over the course of several games, and steady length increasing (every time you complete a run, you unlock a newer harder area which becomes the new end of the next run).\n\nWhat Our Darker Purpose does differently is that it escalates... well, just about everything. But the most important aspects are the bullet hell style evasion, more RPG leveling and stats, and how very quickly the game can bite you in the ♥♥♥ no matter how hard you try. To say that it's unforgiving is putting it mildly, if you're willing to put up with failure after constant failure, learning and adapting to the game, then this is a great fun game with a steady incline in difficulty. To be honest calling it a Rogue-LITE feels inappropriate as almost everything in this game is dependant upon what items you get with a constantly changing metagame. You can have an amazing early game, grab lots of amazing items, and then get your ♥♥♥ handed five times to sunday because you're not getting any more tokens or Juice Box spawns. Not that it matters considering that enemies deal steadily increased damage as time goes on. I had two hundred health by the top floor and hard hitting, fast shooting enemies were dealing about thirty damage. I died in that room in agony.\n\nI love Binding of Isaac and found Rebirth to be almost a little too easy for my tastes, so Our Darker Purpose was a great amount of difficulty I thrived for. But, I've also found that Our Darker Purpose's greatest strengths were also its greatest weaknesses. For starters the game constantly gets harder, which is awesome as before long I was beating Chapter one without a sweat. Because the game is exponentally harder as you progress, you can never really have much time to practice those floors. bosses, enemies, and learn their patterns. And when you die, it'll take a good hour or so just to make it back to that place again, and who knows what items you'll get - if any - when you get back there. There's great variety in items and leveling perks (you can choose between two random ones every level) that work together very well. But you only get items from enemy Leaders, chests, and vending machines, not bosses, which means that if the first two decide not to appear and there aren't enough tokens around the map, then you're without items. Leveling also quickly dips off as enemies give more XP, but not enough to give you additional levels. Plus there's no way to grind levels as once you finish a floor you're onto the next. Also the books are randomized, so you could never get the book perks that you need to really make a run beautiful. By itself the darkly comedic (and straight up horrific) lore is wonderful, and manages to shine without any real falterings. So good for it.\n\nSo - again - Our Darker Purpose takes the Isaac formula and runs with it, to mixed results. As the game continues to get balancing and general gameplay patches, I can expect some of my complaints to change or at least be diminished in time. Eventually it may become the go-to game for a more demanding Rogue-lite bullet hell game. It has the atmosphere, it just needs that polish. Personally I hope for an easy mode or some sort of continue option so I can at least learn how painful the upper floors will be without having that cloud of "if I lose I'm going to have to start all over again" hanging over my head. I think it'll also make the game a bit more accessible as it's already really amazing for more dedicated players (there's a hard mode! A ♥♥♥♥ing hard mode!).\n\nHighly recommended if you like Binding of Isaac, or at least its formula, and want something much harder. Recommended if you want to see what the hype is about and are willing to put a lot of time into learning how to play the game through constant failure. Not recommended if you get frustrated easily, or just are on the edge about games like this. This game will not change your mind, if anything it'll make you feel like the hundreds of poor hilariously abused orphans in this game.","January 26, 2015","true","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing I noticed about the game was the Atmosphere: The dark, gothic visuals juxtaposed with the  brooding, orchestral soudtrack and the cynical humor parceled throughout the game made for a wonderfully melancholy environment that I just loved. The soundtrack particularly stood out to me as I am an audio engineer and I really appreciate how the music absolutely nails the mood of the game. The second thing I noticed about Our Darker Purpose was how ungodly difficult it is. The gameplay is deceptively simple but tense and addictive. you mainly enter a room, run around throwing fire at enemies while dodging ememy attacks untill you clear the room, level up, pick up items, etc. The difficulty lies in the various enemies and their increasingly powerful attacks, the general scarcity of health, and the fact that when you die, the game is over. I know several people who started playing this game but gave up after a few hours because the game was too hard for them. I, on the other hand, just found this game too good to quit. The rooms, items, and abilities when you level up are all randomized which means that the game is different every time you play. After playing and dying more than a few times, you'll start to understand that good reflexes, pattern recognition, a considerable amount of luck, and sheer tenacity are needed to beat this game. Overall, I think Our Darker Purpose is amazing and I would recommend it to any gamer who can appreciate the gothic atmosphere, dark humor, and is not willing to back down from a real challenge.","November 3, 2014","true","243.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're going to try to play it like Isaac and just be disappointed that it doesn't play in the same manner and then spread dislike about this game because it's highly likely that you're not going to adapt to how the game should be played.\n\nSecond, if you do buy the game, download the test, aka "beta", version first to get the latest version (400 or higher) if the game isn't already at it.  The patch addresses a majority of the problems most people have of it, even though I felt the base game was actually pretty good to begin with.\n\nThird, this game is hard.  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about this at all.  You HAVE to stick with it and unlock lessons, classes, and the counselor bonuses to make it easier for you.  Some of the attempts will require luck to unlock the boss/chapter achievements.  Others involve great skill.  It gets easier, especially with practice, trust me.  However, the difficulty of the game makes it that much more rewarding when you finally do succeed in various aspects of the game, like beating the chapter 1 boss for the first time.\n\nStraight up, I like this game and that's why I'm recommending it.  I'm not going to talk about aesthetics of the game, the actual feel of the game play, or anything else that's subjective to me in this review due to the fact that everyone likes different things in games.  All I can suggest is watching videos of it being played.  Hell, leave a comment and I'll record videos, with or without commentary (though I don't know if I can provide entertaining commentary).  If you like what you see, buy it.  If not, buy something else that suits your tastes.

Much more rogue-like, with unlockables...unlocked by replaying the game and earning credits to purchase new powers to START the game with, as well as passive bonuses. To those saying this game is too like tBoI, I both agree and disagree. They have a similar starting formula as tBoI, but expanded in so many wonderful ways that tBoI never did. I've spent a collective 375 hours playing The Binding of Isaac and Rebirth, so I feel as if I may say that it is one of my favorite games of all time.

The game controls in the exact same way as Isaac, with the addition of the space bar adding a "sonic spin dash" like dodge that allows you to get out of some tricky situation. Our Darker Purpose has a much darker tone (yes, somehow darker than the story of a mom killing her child) and it's hand drawn graphics style are pretty neat to look at. Enemies and bosses are pretty unique, ranging from things like cardboard dragons, a chalkboard drawing, and a pot of gruel. The game of course has rogue like elements, floor, enemy, and item placement change every playthrough, and the game is designed to kill you as much as possible. The game gets a little easier with every death, as you start learning the enemies better, along with being able to unlock and equip various skills by accomplishing certain acheivemnts in the game. Donating credits to the "school counsler" also gives you certain upgrades, like being able to carry more healing items, and chalk, which acts a projectile clearing, enemy smashing super weapon.\n\nThe game isn't without it's flaws. Sometimes there are so many projectiles on screen it almost becomes a bullet hell game, and feels like it's just impossible to get through an encounter without taking serious damage, and since the doors remain locked in every room until you defeat every enemy death can come quickly if you're not careful. Certain enemies are very annoying when placed in certain parts of the room, such as the chalk duster clapping enemies that produce a cloud of chalk that stalks you around the room. In certain places these enemies can only be hit in one precise spot and since they can produce two chalk clouds at once you'll only be able to get one or two shots in before you have to retreat and wait again. At one point two of these enemies were side by side, surrounded by walls, with a floor trap beside the only opening that sprung whenever I approached, meaning about 70% of my health dropped in a matter of seconds as I had no choice but to defeat them.\n\nI loved the Binding of Isaac, and any game that can give me even a hint of that games greatness is very welcome in my book. While not quite as fun or memorable as Isaac, "Our Darker Purpose" is a great game for anyone looking for more of that same flavor, I can't recommend it enough.\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game when it first came out. It draws multiple parallels with Binding of Isaac, one of my favorite games and the only game that I achieved 100% achievements on. What turned me off was the awkward hitboxes and being trapped behind corners of obstacles. With the new updates, I can say that this game is more polished than it was before, and that it is a game worth trying for those who love roguelikes.\n\nThere is a "credits" system that lets you carry on some bonuses you earned with each playthrough. It took me at least 50 tries before I finally got to the ending of the game. Story-wise, I am still a bit confused but I shall go back and figure it out. The dodge-roll system is very tight and responsive. The items and levelling up are both very satisfying near end-game.\n\nHow does this game compare to the Binding of Isaac? It's not as friendly as you first pick it up as the Binding of Isaac. I found myself frustrated at the number of projectiles flying towards me. It was infuriating to dodge a projectile only to realize that ALL PROJECTILES are semi-homing. This makes the game a lot harder to get used to as compared to the Binding of Isaac. To make things worse, the projectile that comes out of Cordy is small, unlike the Binding of isaac where the tears are about 1/5 of the enemies' size or more. Cordy's projectile is super small. The projectile doesn't work the same was as Isaac's so it takes awhile to get used to that too.\n\nAll in all, get Binding of Isaac first. Play that game, get the DLC, love the game. If you're up for a more advanced and more satisfying challenge, Our Darker Purpose is your game. It is the advanced Binding of Isaac.\n\nedit: new updates, unforgiving. metaphorically, the fun is the brick in your mouth you end up trying to eat.","February 15, 2014","true","63.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(There are upgrades you can start the game with once unlocked)\nIn addition to walking you have a roll move. The first is too slow to dodge much and the second loses too much precision of control to dodge effectively. This is a problem in what often feels like a bullet hell game. Also why does the dodge move have a cooldown timer?\nEnemies (both regular and especially bosses) take too long to kill. I often get frustrated and take more hits then I need to because I just want a boss fight to end already. The boss fights can also get very repetitious because you will see the same bosses again and again on every play through\nTo optimise your chances of dodging you need to keep a moderate distance from enemies so you have more reaction time when they shoot, but the default weapon range is very short. So often you will want to sneak into range, fire a few shots, then back away again. Combined with the high enemy health fights become really long-winded.\nThe game has rooms that scroll rather then being single screen which works very poorly in some situations. For example one enemy type throws furniture into the air which disappears off screen before coming down where you are standing. If the enemy is offscreen you'll only realise they are there when you get hit\nAfter all that complaining, I will still say that if you are a Binding of Isaac fan, you will get some fun out of this one.

Plenty of people won't have the same experience with BoI, and that's fine, but it just made me not as interested in playing in the long run. In that regard, Our Darker Purpose is the precise game I've been waiting for.\n\nMake no mistake, the themes of this game are still dark, but in more a way that I'm personally comfortable with. While it lacks some of the polish in terms of gameplay of BoI, especially compared to the later Rebirth addition, I enjoy the Burton-by-way-of-Don't-Starve aesthetic a lot more. I also always enjoy a dash of persistent progress in my Roguelites a la Rogue Legacy, and Our Darker Purpose has that in the form of unlockable/equippable bonuses that tweak and improve your overall power as you continue to play. It gives a little feeling of accomplishment, even on play sessions where you seem to be mostly bashing your head against a wall or two.\n\nThe roll/dash is a nice addition to the gameplay, although my Dark Souls experience makes me expect invincibility frames (hint hint, Avildly Wild), so I had to get my brain past that mental block. The chalk is...weird, at least at first. It only has a single charge, recharges are rare, and it's not *so* powerful that it seems a good balance with that. The power-ups tend to lean more on the positive side so far, and less on the "really messes you up unless in very specific builds" side of things like you'd see in BoI. The coin curve overall seems better in early levels, and while I never have enough for *everything*, I can usually get at least one item in a vending machine per time I encounter one unless I'm just starving for juice boxes, the game's health-recover item.\n\nThese are nit-picky points though. It's a bit more of a slow and deliberate pace than BoI, but by no means would I call it very easy, especially as you progress. I think that this would be very welcome to anyone who either liked the idea of Binding of Isaac but didn't dig the aesthetic and/or themes, or even anyone who loves Binding of Isaac but would like a change of pace and a way to enjoy this little sub-genre of roguelites in a different way.\n\nRecommended.","July 10, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This doesn't mean the game is unfair, no despite the steap learning curve it is possible to even traverse (at least) the first floor without getting hurt using the knowledge from all your previous failings which is to be expected. There's also small upgrades that you can choose from in and before the game that while don't make the game easier will help you survive an extra minute if you learn to utilize them.\n\nThe plot is simple: you are Cordy, a little girl trying to untangle the mystery behind the orphanage when all the teachers dissapear and the students scream Mad Max-esqe rules and start killing each other while establishing a new heirarchy with the most nasty creatures at the top floors of the svhool.\n\nMy favourite part however has to be the bosses, all amazingly unique in design with the only similarites being in how some of them attack or defend. But this is only one overlap between a miniscule amount of monsters who accidentally showed up wearing identical pairs of socks while the rest giggle in their ballgowns made of the player's carcass.\n\nHowever there is a point in the game where it (not completely) delflates a bit where as you progress you only come across maybe two levels (at most) of the really hard enemies. You could say I was being greedy at this point and the game was only trying to reflect a traditional social triangle, but when I'm being beaten by enemies and they finally bring out a paddle to add to the fun I'd like it to last more than two wacks!","August 30, 2015","true","49.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are some examples:\n\n- There are problems with colliders, for example door's collider is placed so poorly that going to next room is always frustrating.\n- Particle effects and FX of the game isn't in proper shape for release.\n- Sound design of the game is ridiculous: lots of charracters doesn't have any sound for their actions! and the in-game music doesn't match the gameplay, it's more proper for a walking simulator genre. devs should definately look into BoI's musics\n- Animations of characters don't have enough frames, so they aren't catchy enough.\n- Some here and there bugs.\n- Chalks aren't as useful as BoI's bombs. one reason for this is very low item/coin drop rate in the game. so you will never have enough chalks on the path to make them game changing.\n- After all leveling up and picking different items, you will never feel that your character is powerful enough. usually effects of items aren't very tangible. for example at start of the game, fire rate of our hero is 1.6 and at the end of the game it's something like 2.4 and that's something like 2 shots per second (not so fast). shot's range and damage are the same as fire rate. the result is that items and leveling up aren't rewarding enough.\n\nThis game could be a wonderful game with a score of 8.5 or 9. But in the current state, it still is a good game but it's more like a wasted potential.\n7/10","December 4, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes you get a room by RNG that completely messes you up.\n\nAlso the disciplined king is a really frustrating boss.

With the most recent beta patch, controller support is improved significantly, and the game now plays more like the twin-stick shooter it is at its heart. Everything feels more natural, and everything works better.\n\nIt's not perfect by a long margin. Reconfiguring controls could be more intuitive, and there are times when our hero kinda just shoots the direction she wants to instead of where you're telling her to... but it's all livable, and a significant improvement over its previous state.\n\nI love seeing developers (small or large) continue to make improvements after game launch, and the developers behind ODP clearly care about their game.\n\nI previously called this a "clone" of Binding of Issac, but for clarity's sake, I'll amend that: this game is very similar in tone, gameplay, and theme to Binding of Isacc. It is not, however, a "clone" in as much as there are substantial differences between the two. For my part, if things keep improving here, I may wind up liking this one better.\n\nAnd for those advising using the "mouse" to play? You can't. It doesn't work. There are no configuration options that work in that regard. I personally don't care: after the beta patch, the controls work just fine.\n\n((EDITED for Spelling, because I'm an idiot))","August 9, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","8"

The musical score had me coming back just to hear the song juice boxes required play. It sucks that this game will have to live in the shadow of issac but at least the artstyle makes it looks like it belongs there so its playing to its strengths. the game has an inital tougher start than issac but once you learn the enemies attack patterns you feel like a pro and the game rewards you for your effort with nice abilities that allow you to finetune the way you want to play eg you can grab abilities that enhance the roll and let you attack while rolling or just give you teleport, these abilities will make you feel like a vet and apreciate the game more. at the end of the day though Id recommend Our darker purpose on good music and replayability.","March 20","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unforunitly there is one single thing that prevents me from recommending this game. The hitboxes are horrible, shots that look like they should hit don't, shots that look like they should miss hit, I mean it may just me being used to the locations of the hitboxes in Binding of Isaac, but you basiclly have to aim all your left/right shots above their head to hit them, sure you can just figure the enemy is about 2/3rds of a body length higher up on the screen then you expect, but it just doesn't feel right.\n\nOther then that one bug bear I would fully recomend the game, but that is a big issue that makes the game a lot less enjoyable then it should feel. The choosing between two different perks (that some have possitives and negitives attached to them) every time you level up, the unlocking permint perk chooses (you can unlock 36 of them but are limited to x amount per run) by completing challenges like defeat the chandeller boss without ever leaving it's light radius, or defeat the cualdron boss before its add, or defeat the present boss with 4 or more adds left alive (like the 4 drakes achievment in the one raid in WoW)... So challenging things to do that take skill to complete that unlock perks that make the game a bit easier (or harder depending) which you get to choose a few to bring into each run.\n\nFix the hitboxes and I would fully recommend, but the hitboxes are just to much of a turn off to recommend with games like Binding of Isaac Rebirth at the same price feeling like you have better control due to the hit boxes being where you would expect.","March 6","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I figured that I would be okay with that; I picked the game up on sale, and I've honestly spent two dollars on worse things.\n\nIf you've played Binding of Isaac, the gameplay is done in the same style. The floor layout and enemies are randomly generated. When you die, you go back to the beginning. Yeah, that all sounds familiar.\n\nBut Our Darker Purpose is so much more than Binding of Isaac in a different skin. I've played a handful of hours (at the time of writing), and have barely cracked the third floor. I mean, I'm not a hardcore roguelike player (or usually a fan of the genre at all), so my thrill comes from getting just that little bit further each time. Right now I think of Hard Mode and shudder, seeing as how I regularly get mowed down by run-of-the-mill enemies.\n\nBut that's part of what makes the game accessible. Well, to me at least. People in the same boat as myself can enjoy the game. We can hunt down the bits of lore, delight in our achievements (because, to us, they really ARE achievements), giggle/sigh at the conversations between inanimate objects, wonder at the art and the music, raise a very pointed eyebrow at some of the character design, and then get back to business because we ARE going to beat Chapter 1 tonight, d@mmit!\n\nAnd then the people who are great at these games, who want a challenge, can chew their way through Hard Mode. I honestly don't know if story matters as much to that type of player as the gameplay itself; I can image that is where disappointment lurks.\n\nOur Darker Purpose pulled me in in a way that Binding of Isaac never did. It's that drive to find more nuggets of dialogue that brings me back to empty rooms. It's getting to the next floor with 9 HP and, for a lark, seeing how far you can get anyway. It's not having enough juice boxes to heal through the boss's damage, but he's almost dead, and oh god I hope I can kill him before he kills me.\n\nIf you're a player who enjoys sinking into a fresh new world, where the details come in bits and fragments, where wit and charm can overcome a few oversights in artistic direction, then this game might be for you.","April 21","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each playthrough will earn "credits" that can be spent on upgrades for future playthroughs, though it only allows a certain number to keep the game difficult. I've played over 50 hours and have only faced the final boss once. I can stop playing for awhile, then pick it up again weeks (or even months) later with ease and it's still just as enjoyable.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys roguelikes.

It's got a bit of awkward style, but where it really shines is in how it plays. Enemies interact in interesting ways with the environment. It has two separate tracks of progression, items and levels, as opposed to Isaac's items, which means fewer runs where you end up daunted by the random item generator. The persistent unlocks, meanwhile, let you emphasize specific builds, making a lot of choices pretty tactical.\n\nAnd you can roll! Rolling makes this game. Isaac tends to overwhelm you with bullets as it ups the difficulty; Our Darker Purpose throws very angry, charging enemies at you, and expects you to be able to dance around them. Which, with the roll, you definitely can.\n\nThe writing's pretty cute, too. The level up books are a nice touch, as are the series of in-universe middle grade excerpts that come as lore.\n\nIt's not a classic of videogaming, but it's charming and challenging and strangely compulsive.","June 5","true","59.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
