A little bit further, I got absolutely stuck even though I knew exactly what I needed to do, and ended up giving up on the game. The game's weird interface causes lots of problems and makes it almost impossible to figure things out at times - even when the underlying puzzle is solid (for example, there is a lovely puzzle involving building a ladder out of tube parts that is renderd too obscure by its execution). There is very little clarity, very little consistency in how interaction works, and it's not helped by very fiddly or clunky sections.\nOh, and there are time-sensitive puzzles and parts where you are attacked by unbeatable monsters.\n\nAll of this is a huge shame, because as said before, there is a lot of love and imagination in the game, and when it works, it can be pretty great. It's worth trying and supporting, just be aware of what you're getting into first.","June 13, 2015","false","4.9"," 90 of 102 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","90","102","0","5"

Langley, nightwatch at the space station JUPITER, and the only solace from this monotonous position as a lowly guard amongst the important scientists working on god only knows what kind of experiment is yet another drinking binge. Who can blame him really? With the mundane day-in and day-out occupation of sitting and watching, wondering what exciting experiments your peers at the base could be conducting, left only to guess what the strange sounds behind doors late on the night shift really are.\n\nThe last scientist leaves for the night, wishing you a goodnight and marking the start of he most boring, lonely part of your job. You get up to stretch your legs shocked only to find the ground beneath you suddenly crack apart and swallow you into the depths of the unknown recesses of this diabolical research facility amongst its many secrets.\n\nDeveloper Fabrizio Zagaglia sets out to create a new kind of first person experience, shedding the current trend of bland military shooters and free to play models in favor of a rich 60's sci-fi style and a unique approach to adventure game story telling. When asking Fabrizio what brought about his decision to go with this unique setting and its retro flavor he replied,  "The main goal was to make something with this kind of mood, maybe a bit naive, simplistic and ingenuous... but full of mystery, astonishment... amazement that I can find only in old sci-fi operas, rather than make an explicit rip off of 60s sci-fi series. Nowadays it's all too serious, realistic, evil... cold..."\n\n"I aimed to avoid the current mainstream typical features. Take for example the flatness of games like COD... or the F2P and socialgames drifts etc. Of course, still there are good things, and still exists interesting "new" or derivative genres ( sandbox, narrative and art games and so on)... but overall I feel a lack of "something" that I can find instead in 90s games... something similar to what I can find in 60s scifi series and can't find in the newest ones."\n\nAlbedo isn't just a first person action game as it may seem at first glance, it's clearly a thinking person's adventure that sets out to wrack your brain on tough and puzzling situations in order to make your daring escape from each obstacle-ridden area. The starting room alone had me guessing for awhile, combing through the locked and wasted sci-fi storage room for pieces of the trial-and-error puzzle I had to put together in order to trick and trap the oncoming and unseen terror from beyond the locked door before me. I was reminded of a much tenser, trippier and sci-fi oriented Myst, and that's a very good thing.\n\nAlbedo: The Eyes from Outer Space is a sci-fi geeks dream come true, a wonderful combination of adventure game situations and logic solving from the perspective of a first person shooter. All with just a touch of retro-inspired action and brawls with strange alien creatures that evoke the same kind of love I have for monster designs of classic series like Doom.\n\nEach of the different rooms of the sprawling space complex acts as a tough situation of trial and error puzzle solving, forcing you to use the surroundings to your advantage scavenging pieces of useful material to combine with parts of the environment and further reveal the path ahead. These are extremely small details usually and will require every bit of your unbridled attention to even find. You'll be forced to keep your eyes peeled for the tiniest of details from grabbing a paperclip off of a seemingly unimportant stack of papers to recycle as a lock-pick to finding secret notes slipped under locked doors with mysterious passwords. It's beyond easy to gloss over the most obvious clues, but ultimately they feel very rewarding when discovered.\n\nAlthough the logic and puzzle solving are tough as nails and may even leave you feeling as if at a dead end sometimes, there is always hope thanks to the strange and terrestrial Temporal Dilation Tool, which seems to show some sort of an alternate world where problems are fixed and solutions are highlighted.\n\nThe settings are detailed and vibrant in a grotesque organic sort of way, with each living membrane that plasters the wall gleaming with vivid texture and giving off strange phosphorescent lights of warm and strangely comforting natural hues. The lab itself and the tools around you, including the aforementioned Temporal Dilation Tool give a very retro/future feeling to your surroundings with the tinted green and static-y glow of the hologram and rustic qualities to metal surfaces.\n\nOne thing is certain when stepping through the deteriorating halls of JUPITER; a lot of care, love, and devotion to the genre went into creating this intense set-piece.\n\nEven in its early access state of ongoing updates it's hard to find faults with Albedo: The Eyes from Outer Space, especially with the small amount of people involved with its development considered. With an exciting cliffhanger ending and more content on the horizon there's really no bad time to get involved with the game and watch the adventure of John T. Langley continue to spiral into something even more insane.","October 23, 2014","true","11.0"," 67 of 86 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","67","86","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/277520/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","This is a really difficult game to recommend. If you take a gander at the negative reviews you will see the same sentiment echoed over and over "I wanted to like this game." And, I did want to actually like this game too, but there are some heavy flaws that get in the way of the experience. I think what it comes down to is that I am recommending this game because I think it was frustrating in the right ways more than the wrong. I will always appreciate a game that tries do something more or different and fails over one that suceeds at doing what every other game already did.\n\nAlbedo: Eyes from Outer Space is meant to be a first person adventure game. In that sense it has puzzles, action and storytelling all done in real time, first person. Think of it like a point and click (Walking Dead, Monkey Island, etc.) meets a rather nonviolent first person shooter. The meat of the game comes from solving puzzles to move on to the next area with small bits of action here and there. I play a lot of games in general, but as someone who plays both point and clicks, and puzzle games, these puzzles are arduous. I absolutely needed to use a guide to help me ge through the more demanding areas, even on easy mode. Difficulty is just a hard thing to measure. Games like Super Meat Boy. Hotline Miami, or IWBTG! make me think there is no such thing as too difficult, but I know that even those gems can turn off some players (I didn't dare waste more than 10 minutes on the opening level of IWBTG! before I moved on). But, if a developer makes a game too easy, players will get bored. So, while Albedo's puzzles can be incredibly hard, I think the solution aspect of the puzzles is fair and challenging. It's the execution that causes puzzles to be frustrating.\n\nThe inventory system, controls, and interface of the game are far from intuitive. As someone who uses a trackpad mostly, I can deal with a lot of wonky controls in games, but even Albedo made it unnecessarily difficult to do something simple like equip the right item for a solution I already knew. Some of the more classic point and clicks used to be frustrating because you would have multiple actions that could be attached to a large variety of items in your inventroy, making for a large number of combinations that could easily make progression nigh impossible. Thankfully, Albedo limits itself to a few per item and does not attach every action to each item. However, even with this saving grace, I still had struggle to combine item A with B many times.\n\nOutside of mechanics, the game some great aesthetics. The style of the game is interesting and fits with the sci-fi feel. The aliens are wacky and the enviroments all look great and easy to tell apart. The ambient noises are a nice touch, and the soundtrack does well enough, but there might be a lack of theremin to help conjure up that 60s sci-fi b-movie vibe.\n\nOverall, this is a really tough recommendation. The puzzles are challenging, clever and have some good variety (number sequences, multifaceted pipe arranging, picking locks etc.). However, the demanding puzzles come with the clunky controls that can get in the way. Those hoping for an even split between action and puzzles will find that there is more focus on puzzles than action sequences: they pop up more often, there is more variety, and they feel more rewarding.\n\nThis game is ultimately not the champion we needed to bridge the gap between first person shooters and point and click games, but I think it is still a game worth checking out. For those of you that want a film comparison, this is more  Le Voyage Dans La Lune than 2001: A Space Odyssey. If you think you are up to the challenge, or are willing to swallow your pride and take just a quick peek at a guide, this is a strange and fascinating experience, and I hope to see more games like it.","July 18, 2015","true","15.7"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","44","50","0","0"

Isn't this game still in early access??\n\nTo answer your question is a simple 'yes', but there are so many reasons to consider a purchase. For one big thing, the game had started development in 2002, and has been in development ever since. The developer deserves at least SOMETHING after a ~12 year development period!\n\nLet me go ahead and begin with the pros:\n\nGraphics are certainly unique. Tinted a slight tan, providing a very eerie mood.\nGreat environmental interaction! (seriously, I'm not joking)\nThe little things: small puzzles, such as picking locks, are ideas I've never seen before.\nDemons that make your blood run cold, yet at the same time, give you a hearty chuckle. Not in the bad way! In the way that makes you think This really fits in with the game's theme, does it not!\nINTENSE FIGHTING, MOTHERF_CKER!\nAlthough, it is told that when there is a positive, there exists a negative.\n\nCertain models could be upped in their graphics more.\nSome areas can be dark at times.\nNot so much a tutorial. It does say things like This button does that! and  That button does this! But it doesn't help you out much in solving the first puzzle. It provides hints, but sometimes, you will get stuck. EXTREME PROTIP: PUNCH TAB TO LIGHT UP EVERYTHING YOU CAN INTERACT WITH FOR A SECOND!\nSpeaking of puzzles, they can be demanding sometimes. Please take the time to acknowledge what I said before: When I say Great environmental interaction! I am really, really not joking. But don't worry! Once you get the hang of what to do in the first few puzzles, you'll get the hang of it!\nAlriiight, so let's get down to dumming this all down.\n\nSupporting the developer can really come in handy right now, due to the extremely unpopular state this game doesn't seem to be moving out of as of current.\n\nAll and all, this is recommended by me... If you want to support the developer! If you buy it now, you may not receive all that you were hoping for just now, but if the game has been in development for roughly 12 years already, I don't think the developer will be backing down anytime soon.\n\nOh yeah! A note to the developer:\n\nPLEASE, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING! BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS A REALLY DAMNED GOOD JOB!\n\nAs far as I can tell, if the game continues development at it's pace, it will become one of two things:\n\nA highly popular game on Steam.\nA VERY highly underrated game on Steam!\nRight now, a solid 8/10. This game has an extremely high potential!","October 5, 2014","true","8.6"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","39","50","0","3"

Run and never turn back!\n\nThis game, THIS **** GAME somehow manages to be frustrating, funny, extraordinarily stupid and challenging at the same time. Why is that? Let me explain.\n\nThe very first thing that one notices about this game is the style - very reminiscent of some of the silliest old comedy horror films (the game title is a great clue already). Everything, including enemy models, items you pick up and places you visit contributes to the atmosphere. Add in amazingly (heh) delivered lines from the main character and you might feel like a star! ...in a film directed by Ed Wood. Much of the games humour relies on the atmosphere; the potentially dangerous situation (alien invasion) is turned into something ridiculous because of the genre Albedo emulates. On a sidenote, people interested in funny references/Easter Eggs will love this game.\n\nNow, one should take note of this fact - Albedo can be REALLY hard. While not impossible, some puzzles might leave you plain confused or even clueless about what are you even supposed to do in the room you're in. This isn't necessarily a bad thing but sometimes one might feel really frustrated, walking around and searching for that one item you might've missed, or a possible action you overlooked. However, sometimes the difficulty spikes are caused by neither hard puzzles nor confusion but...\n\n...action sequences. Especially those which are at the same time technically "timed puzzles". There is one sequence, you'll know which one, which made me want to bang my head on the keyboard. Even if you like timed challenges, you might find yourself frustrated at the rather unforgiving circumstances in this one. Fortunately, this puzzle, like many other, can be skipped (but true gamers shouldn't do that, should they?).\n\nUnfortunately, this is not always the case and sometimes, just sometimes, one might be extraordinarily unlucky and find themselves a bug. Not a walking one (well, it is possible to be bitten by a spider/eat a spider) but ugly nontheless (sorry, all the insects of this world...) - for example, some essential items might suddenly become impossible to pick up. Fortunately enough, the game saves automatically at least once per room/puzzle, so you have a quick solution to that. In my case this bug appeared twice but not in the same room and with the same item.\n\nTo sum up, Albedo: Eyes from Outer Space is a solid title, a great parody just like its "cousins" from the big screen. A perfect title to pick up after completing Alien Isolation or something like that :)","November 29, 2015","true","6.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","25","31","2","0"

I want to say it'd be fitting on a mobile device (as in perfect for swiping); it's NOTHING but annoying here.\n\nYou have two buttons bound to Previous and Next Action. Not sure if that works in scrolling through your inventory; there is no proper menu for the inventory. It is a drop-down thing at the top of the screen that you can scroll through with the mouse wheel (if something else that you can interact with isn't in the vicinity of the reticle, otherwise scrolling cycles through the actions with that item). Once you get to the item you want, click and drag the mouse down. Click and hold to bring up a radial of your possible actions with the item. Drag towards the action you want to do.\nTheoretically, that Previous and Next Action could nullify this gripe; once you get down the action icons, it's (theoretically) quicker to do the mouse dragging.\nMore often than I'd like, either dragging an item from the inventory or dragging to an action - the visuals show that the game accepted your action, but the result isn't shown (either no item equipped or nothing done with the item). Such finnicky-ness would be fine in a "casual" puzzle game, but in one with action...\n\nI shan't criticize the puzzles, as I'm glad to see another vague first-person puzzler (Kairo, FRACT OSC, Ilamentia, Antichamber, etc.) that isn't grounded strictly in the abstract (that has practical puzzles, i.e. lockpicking and rotating pipes to allow for flow). All I can say is, if you're stuck, go back and pick up every object that seems of some interest. Upon entering a room, most interactions with them will be Observe and Drop/Throw. Once you get a step closer to progress, make the rounds again to find that you can now Use some objects.\n\nAlong with the Inventory system, the general actions are extremely clunky.\nAlso: Why does Longy only hold onto an object for a few seconds before dropping it on his own?!?!?!\nNo words can describe my stupidity. I misunderstood the controls in the Options (rebind-ed them). For some reason, the "Previous Action/Next Action" at the top threw me off.\n\nI made it to the fourth room, found some shears, Longy commented on another eyeball (it wasn't hostile before then). I decided to Fight with the Shears; a few spams of the mouse button (after selecting the Fight action from the interface, which was a pain - one must wait a certain amount of time before the game decides to register the action you dragged to) and the shears flew out of my hands. Eyeball seems to have escaped.\nEDIT: Shears flew out of my hand because no words can describe my stupidity.\nMonster didn't escape; another story with actual Eyeball.\n\nI have to assume that the issues with the game are because the dev wanted it to be as "realistic/immersive" as possible, taking cues from those games that did away with "intrusive" interfaces. For example, games like Montague's Mount, Dream, and ASAMU don't allow the player to actually pick up pages, only to zoom in ever so slightly.\nThat vision of realistic/immersive impedes the accessibility and intuitive-ness, making the game little more than infuriating.\nThe story and atmosphere necessitate that I leave a Positive recommendation... The game itself gets in the way of that, though (and not in the way one would assume (i.e. puzzles)), so I must do what I did.\nKnow that the point of the *Thumbs Down* is more to get the attention of the dev, rather'n to dissuade you from buying/playing it. MAYBE it simply comes down to getting used to the interface; thus far, when I've thought I've gotten it down, it acts unresponsively ("one must wait a certain amount of time before the game decides to register the action you dragged to") - I get discouraged from slogging any further into the game.\n\n\nEDIT: I would have turned this review positive because I cited an issue that furthered my case in DownVoting the game that wasn't an issue with the game at all, but with mine own intelligence. However, I made it to the fifth room and am still having to wrestle with the mechanics just as much as with the big and hostile Eyeball residing therein.\n\nI hope (and actually expect) to turn this review positive, if I can beat the game.\nNot to end up saying "Psh, it wasn't that bad, I can recommend this game because I beat it, though I couldn't while I was in the prcoess of beating it."\nIt's to say - as I said - that the premise and atmosphere is very alluring; should the story ultimately satisfy, the "slog" will have been worth it, contrary to what I said.\n\n\nTL;DR\n((This whole review serves as further proof for the definition of "review"; how can one review something without having experienced it "well enough" (in this case, actually beating the game)?\nTynon_1221 has no business writing reviews. Do Downvote this))\nAlbedo is a first-person puzzler set within an intriguing universe.\nThose who don't get frustrated with the puzzles, will probably with the Inventory system.\nThe developer should be proud of the game, abso-fickin'-lutely.\nTynon_1221 shouldn't be as impulsive.","May 31, 2015","false","2.5"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","28","38","4","3"

What little I did play, I didn't really enjoy and often found myself frustrated.  Without any sort of tutorial to guide me, I found myself stuck in the very first room for about twenty minutes just messing around with the various objects.  Based on the trailers, I expected a FPS sci-fi game with an emphasis on the "S"...instead I discovered this game to be extremely puzzle heavy.\n\nIt's not that I don't enjoy puzzles, but the help system (TAB key) is absolutely useless.  "I need to repair the door"...way to state the obvious!  I longed for an escalating help system as featured in BTTF:TG that gave me the answers after so many hint requests.  What's the point of having a difficulty setting if your puzzles are going to be that demanding regardless?  That's not to say it won't be fun for some who have the time to devote to solving these puzzles, but it is clearly not for me (at least, at present).\n\nI'm giving it a positive recommend because the setting and ambiance is indeed fairly good, but I would like to see options / mechanics to help out new/casual players who don't want to spend hours trying to solve complex puzzles.  "Deadfall Adventures" incorporated multiple difficulty levels for the puzzles alone, for example.  I grabbed this for cheap during a Bundle Stars sale (10 games for $4) so I'm not too miffed that I didn't enjoy this title.  Since the game is Early Access, I reserve the right to change my opinion as development continues.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9weANXLZcA\n\n","December 8, 2014","true","0.5"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","23","38","0","0"

Played the game for almost 5 hours and I feel I still didn't get used to it, as even 5 hours and a couple of levels into the game I found myself still confused and not getting to the action I meant to do rigt away. I guess they tried to do something more intuitive that would fit the game's style but I really found the whole interactions and inventory business confusing.\n*Story is almost non-existant. Perhaps in the full game? I sure so hope so..\n*Another thing which doesn't really concern the game itself, but nore about wrong advertisement - the game seems like an 'action-adventure' type, with combats and killings etc... But I've barely encountered action sequences in the game itself. It's mostly just puzzles. Again, maybe in the finished game?\n\nAnyway, even with these minor problems, and some more which you could expect from an unfinished product, this game is truly a gem. It's basically just a bunch of puzzles, but unlike many modern adventure games (or video games in general), it doesn't take the players as stupid fellas.\nThis game is pretty tough and challanging, but not in a terrible way, not in the "oh ♥♥♥♥ I'd have never figured that out!" way, but in a satisfying way. You have to truly pay attention to your surrounding, be sharp and creative, and if you manage to solve a riddle on your own it's usually very satisfying!\nThe other technical aspects of the game are also great, the horror setting is very bizzare, creepy and fills you with uneasiness.\n\nPersonally I quit the game for now, as it got too complicated for me, even on the easy level.\nI still think the game is great, though, and am looking forward for the full product - hopefully more polished, wiith some more story, more hints and perhaps a walkthrough for the tough sections!","January 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

With science fiction thrown into the mix.\n\nLike in my original review. I praised this game for it's puzzle mechanics. And i still do. You will have to put on your critical thinking cap to get through most of these puzzles. Some are easy. But some are harder, and in most cases requires certain items. The game is still glitchy and buggy in most parts and hopefully that will get patched up. But overall the game is very much playable and enjoyable.\n\nThe only two negatives i could say about this game is the voice acting. Not really good for the main character. The VA feels out of place, louder than the environment itself in some areas. Plus if this is a science fiction game, at least give the character a gritty feel to it. Not some B movie voice acting monologue like what we see on the SyFy channel.\n\nAnother problem is the crazy 'looking' senstivity. You can't really adjust it sadly. So if you get sick from the constant fast pace looking around and such. I highly suggest not playing this game till they patch it up.\n\nI still recommend this game for it's challenging puzzles and intresting story.","April 19, 2015","true","1.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I mention this specifically as many of the negative reviews highlight this are seemingly missing the point. In the options, I chose the UK accent for my avatar and it was spot on. Each of the different areas had good graphic variation on the theme. I had no issue with the controls and found the gameplay fun.\n\nThe puzzles, pick ups and inventory choices are varied and nicely challenging. This is not an 'easy' game, you have been warned. You can expect to spend some time figuring out what to do next. There is a hint system, and depending on the difficulty level you can expect your avatar to give out timely advice. I did not find it frustrating, but then I like this genre.\n\nThere are a couple of infrequent bugs I experienced. Some graphical interactive items can cause visual glitches and bounce your avatar, nothing serious or game breaking. Another bug involving puzzles and inventory requires restarting the game client, but I did not lose any progress as the game autosaves at each puzzle. Minor inconvenience.

What this man has accomplished by himself is remarkable.\n\nAlbedo: Eyes from Outer Space is a first person action puzzle sci-fi game. Where you play a man trying to escape a lab during what seems to be an alien invasion.\n\nThis game is just gorgeous looking. I've only played a few hours so far but according to the most recent update you can play through the full game now.\n\nYou move back and forth through a beautifully designed world picking up items, solving puzzles, and occasionally killing some giant eyeballed aliens!\n\nAlbedo is a well designed, fun experience. The music direction is great you always feel tense, never knowing when an alien may decide to ruin your escape. The puzzles are challenging and executed well.\n\nMy only gripe with Albedo may be the awkward control scheme. I found myself dropping items accidentally. A minor annoyance more then anything.\n\nIt's the best sci-fi atmosphere in a first person game, maybe, ever. It has a feel of 'Mars Attacks meets Half-Life'. This could be a point and click adventure and I'd enjoy the hell out of just the environments.\n\nCurrently in Early Access for $14.99 on steam.

Many other games are breaking out and trying new things, but at least they made that the mechanics gained simplicity through contextual input instead of just making use of whatever worked for other titles. It's really tough to get a hang on them until later on when you are forced to so you can survive.\n\nWhich brings me to my final two points, the actual gameplay and the story. Gameplay wise, I really liked the idea of merging FPS with adventure, and yet I wish both were at least segregated. To pull out weapons and use them quickly I have to go through the menu to get to the best weapon possible for the situation and it just adds frustration instead of actual tension.\n\nThe story is about as 70's and idiotic as you can imagine. Taken right out of pulp fiction sci-fi mags, it really did adhere to the formula and managed to get me to laugh my ♥♥♥ off at some points during the game. I just wish the voice acting was better, but I can't really fault it seeing as how it was mainly made by one guy.\n\nThat's really all I have to say on the subject, and if you do find the game cheap and don't really mind all the gimmicks I mentioned, then prepare for a nice adventure game that'll really make you wish it was made by a full studio or that something of the sort might happen with the developer in the future.","November 11, 2015","true","6.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm particularly surprised it's not more common among indie games, where you could pass off Poser models and barren levels as rubber suits and movie sets. But I suppose if this game proves anything, it's that you need more than B-movie stylings to make your game fun.\n\nAlbedo is a first-person adventure game, posing you as a dopey security guard at some secret laboratory. Things go wrong as they always do, and you end up trapped in the basement with a bunch of impolite ambulatory eyeballs, presumably from outer space. The first thing you will notice about the game is how intensely... intense the graphics are. I can't rightly call them hideous because they are expertly rendered and arranged. The colors tend to be far too saturated an garish, however, straining your eyes against the otherwise darkened backdrops. This can also make it very hard to locate things you want or need to interact with, hidden as they are amid a technicolor mess. Which is kind of ridiculous, given that the game is broken into tiny single rooms to puzzle your way through. Despite there being virtually no room to explore, it's STILL hard to find the things you need.\n\nIt's harder still to use the items you find, thanks to the onerous inventory system. I'm sure it sounds good on paper: Left click to pick up, mouse wheel to scroll through possible actions, left click to take action, right click to move items into and out of your inventory. But what actually happens is a lot of confused scrolling because not all items have the same interaction options. And then once you decide on what you want to do with the item, there's no guarantee you can DO it because the game is full first-person 3D and you need the hit detection to line up. Some items have a convenient Use With prompt but others do not, requiring some agonizing trial-and-error to get things into the right spots.\n\nThe puzzles themselves can be maddeningly obtuse, and I'm sure I'm not the only person to get stuck in the first room because I didn't realize I needed to attach the rope to the broken snack machine and put the loaded mousetrap in front of it and then pull the rope to open the door on the other side of the room. Oh, and there's combat too, so enjoy clicking Use Screwdriver On Monster about a dozen times every few rooms. I think you get weapons later on, but I'll never be able to confirm. The icing on this wholly unpalatable cake was that the rooms are so small and the field of view is so narrow that the game made me nauseous after about 30 minutes. The host of negative reviews on the Steam page indicated that this is not an uncommon problem, so add that to your list of reasons to give this one a pass.","October 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It has a lot that I love and a lot that I absolutely hate, but no one can really say it's a "bad game".\n\nMost of what's wrong with it is wrong at the very core of it, and is only wrong considering what people expect from it.\n\nIt's a pure adventure game, like the older point n' clicks with some very wild solutions to puzzles. It does have some other problems, mostly related to how it conveys important information, but those problems would be minor in any other genre.\n\nThe game has several levels, each being a more of less self contained puzzle. But the puzzles don't follow a pattern or a type. They're completely different from one another, which can be very... alienating (pun intended).\n\nThere was a level where you had to (SPOILERS!) melt wax into a padlock to see its pattern, and figure out the number code to open it.\nThat's stretching waaaay too far out of what the player expects. I'd also like to mention that it doesn't seem to be an actual method of "breaking" locks -- at leat a quick Google search didn't find anything.\nThere are other puzzles with some quite clever solutions, as they're all very physical, in a sense. It's the kind of improvised solutions that a human being might try, if he were actually there.\nUnfortunately, this is a video-game, where things don't quite work as well as one would expect, and it's very, very easy to miss crucial aspects of a given puzzle.\n\nThere are guides for that, if you want. I'd recommend, if you're in the game to experience its setting.\n\nWhich is what I love. It's pure old sci-fi. The kind of suspenseful from movies, with a very characteristic soundtrack to go along with it. It's awesome!\n\nI really love what it's trying to do, clearly being a game that stands on its own. It's not dictacted by fun or what players want, it's clearly a very personal project, and I commend it for it!\n\nIf that's what you're looking for, definitely give it a go!\n\n\nThere are some other problems, especially with the brightness levels not being very clear. That game doesn't have a gauge (something like "increase brightness until you can barely see the darkest image"), so I didn't want to push it too high. As a result, there were some items that were completely obscured, at some points. Not ideal.\n\nAnother big problem is the camera. First Person puzzle game tend to give me A LOT of motion sickness. This is no exception. At times it was physically painful. The camera is very wanky, contantly moving a lot to the sides. It's especially annoying in the shooting sections.\n\nOne last thing is how the interface is rather clunky, but bearable.\n\n\nAs a conclusion -- it's not perfect. Not even close. It has some very frustrating moments, mostly because the player didn't get the right information, or, in a particular level, the controls were incredibly dodgy. But, if you can withstand it, there's an incredibly unique game in this, with a nice twist at the end.\nIf you're a fan of old sci-fi, I recommend it!","August 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They are unique and so very much fun that i was literally amazed by every one of those. They felt like something made by a gamer for gamers, they were never tiering nor did it ever felt forced do do them so i literally enjoyed every one of those, and the best part is that there is not a single puzzle that is like the last one(or any other puzzle for that matter) which is a real rarity nowdays. I can say that the puzzles put my mind and imagination to a test and admit that most of them were really challenging(i think that the puzzle difficulty is adjustable in the options menu if someone wants to take it easy) but at the same time, for the most parts, intuitive and self explanatory.

I honestly do, because it has one of the neatest premises I've seen in a very long time. The art is very 1950's cult sci-fi, the sound design is great, and the premise is a refreshing take on an otherwise stale subject. The puzzles, from what I have been able to see, are well thought-out and require more than just the usual brute-force approach.\n\nHowever, there are two huge problems standing in my way.\nFrom a stylistic standpoint, the game has the worst inventory system I have ever borne witness to. It is utterly counterintuitive, awkward, slow and detracts from gameplay. The addition of shortcut keys helps a little, but they're generally unresponsive.\nBut moreso than that, is that the game is broken. THe menus don't respond correctly half the time, puzzles are frequently unresponsive and don't work correctly until the game is reloaded, and important items have, in several instances, clipped through the floor and become irretrievable.\n\nI get that one guy did this all, and it was a valiant effort.

However all that effort did not deliver a good end product.\n\nWhen I first saw this game during the early access period I was really impressed with the concept and how it stood out from the rest. So I bought it and in order not to ruin the experience waited for it to be fully released.\n\nStarting the game I was really enthusiastic and was eager to turn a blind eye on some minor glitches etc. I really wanted to like the game, but after 4 hours of struggle, that was mainly comprised of struggle with horrible interface Inventory controls, I gave up. The game simply does not worth the trouble, the story is week - "oh no, aliens attack I gotta get from point A to point B". The puzzles, well, some of them are interesting, but some are just boring and sometimes you simply have to click everything around and see what interact with what. By the end of the fourth hour this became unbearable and I deleted the game.\n\nThe idea is good, the style is original, but the execution kills the game and at some point the stress that game creates overweights the entertainment component.\n\nAs such I would say, well done to the man who singlehandedly put so much effort and indeed for a solo project it is quite good, but as a general game, it sucks before the actual gameplay execution and controls kill it.\n\n5/10\n\nFor more reviews join my group - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/","July 16, 2015","false","4.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Great b-movie atmosphere alone earns it a thumbs-up. That said, until it's been tightened up I'll only give it a tentative recommendation. Like may games of its type, progression is largely unclear and that's a good thing. Now, you're not going to be tricking a cat to run through a hole in a fence over which you've draped a piece of tape in order to steal its fur which you then use as a fake moustache in order to impersonate a man's passport to finally rent a motorbike...but, there are still some head-scratchers. That's the point of these games, so no whining about that.\nInstead, I'm here to complain about the software itself and the reason why I stopped playing. You see, alt-tabbing out tends to screw menus up so I thought to myself why not play in windowed mode. Turns out that by doing that and setting it to fill my screen, I've bugged out the game and am presented with nothing but a black void and sound-effects. That's it, the game isn't bad per se but its internal flaws make it borderline unplayable and in my case entirely irretrievable.\nGood attempt, guys but tighten things up before you release a game next time.

The clips I saw of gameplay footage were just amazing. I thought it was going to be like watching the lovechild of Half Life and Bioshock. Then I actually start playing, and I can't even get outside of the stupid cellar I'm holed up in. Now I can sort of relate with the game creator, games like Call of Duty can only be appreciated by small-minded gamers that want their gameplay experiences like they want their rides at Universal Studios, easy and completely laid out for effortless progress. Games like Resident Evil also insult my intelligence with how little effort is put into the puzzle-solving aspects.\n\nThis, however, is completely on the other side of the spectrum. It's like the game requires you to be Sci-fi McGuyver in order to even get out of the first room. There is a huge monster pounding on the door, and I can only assume the game wants me to make use of a brick, a broken valve, a rope, and a used rat trap to somehow kill this thing when it breaks in, and I'm just not understanding what the game wants from me. Even games like Testament of Sherlock Holmes at least give you some context on what exactly you need to accomplish, without outright telling you how to do it. I mean why not just have the monster break in within like 30 seconds, and you kill it by pulling the cable from a circuit breaker and electricuting the thing to death? It'd be clever, interesting, and not make me dwell so much on a moldy cellar.\n\nI really want to see how much potential this game really has.

The "reviews " on the store page compared this to Myst. Really?? I see NO and I mean NO similiarity at all.  The game is not terrible it is just rough around the edges in so many ways. The graphics are mediocre at best. The controls are awkward and at times very frustrating to deal  with. The controls may be the worst I have seen in an adventure game.  Their are still bugs where things disappear or cause "shaking"  of interactive objects or even getting thrown into graphic sub layers of the game. For the price this game sells for on Steam I would say no......do not buy.  I understand that this is done by a one man army but I am a one man army also with a wallet. Be careful here.

Give it a score without..., I will just have to tell you about it for you to understand.\n\nFirst off, at the starting scene there are no voice actors for the characters involved, just REALY FAST text that passes you by. Also you have  no idea dafuq is going on.\nThen you get thrown into the game.\n\nI tried interacting with EVERYTHING I could think of, no way out of the first room. (And i'm not going to spoil how to beat the room eighter) after about 30 minutes YES 30 MINUTES of searching I finaly find the most abstract things you have to do to leave. And am thrown into another room wich also took 20 minutes to solve.\n\nAs I struggle tirelessly to interact and be repeatedly killed by a single foe in a sertain bs room.\nI get to a room with lots of water, you are supposed to somehow escape by fixing an underwater core. That requires you, and I ♥♥♥♥ you not... To litteraly launch yourself like a dolphin onto a platform wich takes like 50 tries.\n\nSome of my friends come to me for help with these kinds of games cause they are "Too easy and obvious" this only is so abstract you need to actualy have the patience of a saint. Btw I was promised to be shooting things with guns. 4 hours in, stuch on like the 5th room. I finaly ragequit. 4 HOURS people. This game has interesting puzzles but my god are the abstract, hard to solve because there is no serious indication of what you have to do as a goal. You just "Figure it out yourself"\n\nI was watching a walkthrough on the side, and even people who do walkthrought for these type of games had no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ was actualy going on... In fact it took longer for them to solve it than me for atleast as far I got.\nThis game is rage inducing. And i'm generaly pretty calm.\nSo what would I rate this and what do I think of it.\n\nPuzzle Design: -3 "Some are just a bit long winded and difficult."\nMap Design:    -5 "I have no idea where or what the ♥♥♥♥ I should be interacting with."\nGraffics:            7 "Looks good, even for my old pc."\nPlot:                 -7 "After 4 hours I am yet to find a plot."\nUI:                     8 "Easy to use, very bad system for panic situations."\nGameplay:        1 "Game is too hard and abstract at current."\n\nFinal conclusion:\nThe game is as fun as grabbing a bag of,... lets say grain, then emptying that bag into an airvent making it be blow all over  and throughout a skyscraper and then tasking someone with finding all of the grain, piece by piece.\nJust as fun as trying to find anything you ever need and just not finding it for hours on end. And then realising you are missing something else,... The search continues.\n\nMy point is, games are supposed to be fun. This game in the 4 hours of time I gave to try and be entertained. I was not entertained. I did not have fun. And thus this game failed to do what its supposed to. And before anyone goes, well you just don't like this type of game. Actualy I generaly don't, and wouldn't normaly buy a game like this, but I do enjoy some of them. They are fun when they make sense, and you feel like you are actualy progressing and doing something worth your time. This game did not make me feel like it was worth my time.\n\nI will make my best efforts to finish a game, and aslong as there is some kind of fun to be had I can keep going. But this game is not a game I will ever finish. I rarely review games, but I just felt like I had to on this one. If you want to buy this game for the "shooting any type of gun" aspect, I adivise you don't touch it with a 20 foot pole. Because like me, you will never, ever, get there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdit:\nI recently made a lets play / walkthrough vid, I will be doing a series on this game with me speaking my mind about the game.

Early sci-fi cheesyness? Whats not to love!\n\n\nThe gameplay and lack of voice acting, for one.\n\nI have been stuck in a room for 30 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MINUTES, with not a single clue of what to do. Pressing the "Hint" button does nothing, all it did was highlight ALL the items in the room(MANY of them absolute garabe that does nothing). Whats even worse, you are just THROWN into a room with little story other than OOPS A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT EXPLOSION THING YOURE TRAPPED.\n\nThe lack of voice-acting really also hurts this game. Bad-dubbing/fuzzy voice-acting was what made old sci-fi, but this is not yet implimented(early access, blah blah). I really wish this game wasn't early access, I really do. Because if it was finished and polished, it might feel better to me.

You want to be Early Access? Then be Early Access.\n\nIncluding yourself in a bundle while also using Steams Early Access is a slap in the face of people who may buy your game at full price while it is Early Access.\n\nThis game also goes on sale outside of Steam quite often. -60% off at GMG as of the time of this writing.\nhttp://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/info?plain=albedoeyesfromouterspace\n\nIt is not following Early Access guidelines and only states it is Early Access in small text and without detail rather than following the Steam Early Access Branding Requirements set by Valve.\n\nAs for the game itself, it has visual appeal in the Main Menu, but once the game starts that appeal fades quick. There is no voice acting and the sound is basic, taking away from the atmosphere the game tries to setup.\nThe first bit of gameplay is a puzzle to get out of a small room. But the controls are wonky and strange, non-intuitive and you aren't given any instructions for a tutorial on how to play.\nAs a result you just randomly click things for awhile until you get frustrated and bored.
