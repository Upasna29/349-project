What it should say is "you won't even give a damn about beating the game after playing the first level".\n\nI like challenging games. The price was right, so I thought to myself: "Why not? It's only $1.79!"\nWell, I wish I would have avoided this game like a fart-filled elevator.\nTHIS GAME....is bad. Not bad like "ugh, what a waste of time" bad, but "the developer trolling Steam" bad.\n\nThe game describes itself as an "80's challenge", which it is in the sense of comparing it to a broken Atari game with bad controls. You literally can die within a second of starting the game, and the controls and collision detection are so damn awful that you'll laugh to keep from firing off a string of expletives. Also: there's NO SCORE and NO FINISH LINE, so there's NO POINT in playing. Why play a game with absolutely zero objectives other than to stay alive?\n\nTo top it off, there's no option menu. NONE. You can't change any settings (because it only has two: suck, and suck harder), you can't map the controls (control being used very loosely), and the MOST egregious omission is that there is NO WAY to exit the game without a CTRL ALT DEL. What a joke.\n\nI wish I'd spent the $1.79 on a bag of potato chips rather than on this pile of cow chips. Epic Games should sue the developer for misrepresenting this rip-off as an actual "game". This garbage defiled the Unreal Engine to the point of it being a crime.\n\nPlease go to Youtube and look up "Airlock" for the Atari 2600 by Data Age. THAT is better than this.\n\nDO. NOT. BUY.","April 7, 2015","false","0.1"," 358 of 371 people (96%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","96","358","371","49","13"

Ok, I signed steam page, fine EULA for me.\n\nNext problem is resolution - it is fixed and it is low (kinda 1366x768).\n\nAfter that finally the game. Ok, how do I control it? Mouse doesn't work, arrows as well, appeared that A-D keys move your character sideways. Can you change these keys? No. Are there any options at all? No. Is there exit button for this game? No, you have to Alt+F4.\n\nAbout gameplay. It was claimed to be challenging, at the end the challenge is game design. There are no clear hitboxes, fancy coat make you unable to tell if you hit something or just was suddenly blowed off, some levels are under construction (level 10 or 12, for example).\n\nBy pressing random buttons you can got general idea that q is kinda pause, c - first person view, caps lock - ghost run (oh, it's not a ghost, it's player 2 to be controlled by arrows, ffs), n - next level, x meant to do something but it doesn't, 1...9 teleport you to level with the same number, o teleport you to level 12 and i to level 10. After you die you can spawn tons of warlocks at level 10 with the same i, also this level is not designed to be beaten at all. I didn't find jump button yet..\n\nYou are expected to run, but to be honest, the character is running on the same place, and just some objects run towards you. Not really a problem, but this looks ugly.\n\nOptimisation... this game used up to 1300Mb of my GPU RAM, which is insane for such a simple game.\n\nOverall the game is raw, badly tested and unfinished, claimed challenge is not a challenge so don't get baited. By the way, what is the key to jump?","April 7, 2015","false","0.3"," 201 of 207 people (97%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","97","201","207","21","0"

Theres no options menu, the key-binds are a mess ( you can skip through portions of the game by using number keys) and the objects you dodge have horrible collison boxes.\nIf you like this game then you'll like that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aeroplane game that came out a while ago and got taken off soon after.\n\nSteam has some terible quality issues.....\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTEpTcnNGWc&feature=youtu.be","April 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 149 of 156 people (96%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","96","149","156","10","0"

I was running on the spot as what I can only assume were large pieces of ravioli edged closer to my screen, but there were too many and I was overwhelmed by the pasta-esque dastards.\n\nAlso, the game has this cool feature where there is no 'exit' or 'quit' option in the menu, so no matter how much you want to leave, you cannot.\n\nPretty cool game.  I'd recommend it if you also enjoy swallowing gravel, or sucking farts out of your father's ♥♥♥.\n\n1/10","April 10, 2015","false","0.1"," 125 of 131 people (95%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","95","125","131","50","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/recommended/361660/","BridgetFisher","BridgetFisher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BridgetFisher/","4086 products in account","The Bad:\n1.  Starting the game does something weird with vid cards showing some backwards use of the engine to reboot the display driver or something causing it to lose signal.\n2.  Upon first boot this terrible 2 second loop or so of sound kept repeating, thought the game was broken but that is the music that sounds like a horse running in circles on an elevator driven insane by the elevator music, the horse now spends eternity running in circles desperate to escape.\n3.  There is no game, you stand in place and the animation runs but the character never moves.\n4.  Nothing is explained, even random button mashing yields results that still dont help understand what is happening.\n5.  There is NO way to quit the game, much like the man cursed with running, it seems the player could be cursed with paying it forever or just hit alt-F4 to close it...\n\nThe Good:\nPlaying as a business man cursed to run forever you enter  world that looks like Mad Max crossed with pyramids.  Pretty cool atmosphere.  The character looks kind of deus ex like which adds a cyber punk kind of feeling.  For those who say the game is impossible, the levels are beatable, though why bother is a diff question.\n\nWhat is real strange is the developer Albert Espin put his name all over the game, even here on the store page.   For a game so bad it was removed from steam, its odd someone put their name all over it.  The internet never forgets, if this person tries getting a job somewhere in gaming, that might not work out.  The ideas seem nice but this person might make a better creative designer than a game developer.  Would be nice to see an accidental runner 2 with these themes that is actually a game.  Many may hate hearing this but for the developer to be forgiven, they should make a no holds barred sequel that is playable.  The dev should play lococycle which has the spirit and mechanics the dev may find useful for that sequel or one of us could gift it to him.  :D\n\nThis game could be cool if it was a game...\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","May 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","23","25","3","0"
