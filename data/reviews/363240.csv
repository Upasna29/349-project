You can train your people to do certain things. There are 3 classes. Hunter, who kills dinosaurs and can attack the hostile ai. Gardener, who can pick up dead dinosaurs bodies and fruits. The third and the last class is preparer, who is preparing the food (that is killed by hunter, delivered to the cave by gardener). But what for we gather all the food??? With the fruits you can heal your proteges, also after you gather needed amount of food you can get another dumb idiot, which you need to teach. There are also rewards which you can buy when you achieve certain amount of points. The rewards are really useful as you can buy things that will help you with teaching this dumb people. There you can also buy things that will **** the ai up :D As you can see the gameplay is kinda simple. Nothing could be more wrong, as it is really challenging. (of course you always can buy only hunters and do blitzkrieg, but for me it ruins the purpose of the game)\n\nThere is also local multiplayer in this game, but as far as i see you need to have a controller to play it, which is kinda sad :(\nThe soundtrack is nice, but after few hours kinda annoying.\nThe graphic looks ok, it could have been done better, but it is not bad.\n\nI really recommend that game, but the in responsible price. If it is -50% take it without a doubt.","August 28, 2015","true","8.1"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","81","35","43","14","0"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEW\nDo you remember Age of War, that strategy flash game that you can find on sites like armorgames or max games? Caveman Craig is basically that, but only in one time period and more mechanics to it. In this game you actually control one of the troops, caveman Craig, and you need to conquer the other tribe because... of reasons! The game includes 5 levels each time increasing enemy AI. You need to build your own tribe and teach it how to fight back, collect food and prepare it while fighting dinosaurs and defend from enemy attackers. The game also has XP system which awards you with points that you can use to buy additional stuff like watchtowers, special troops or timed power-ups. One of the problems is that NPC AI is dumb, I'm not talking about enemy player AI, I'm talking about the troops, they would sometimes just wander off into enemy territory and get instantly killed or wouldn't attack them while in range, other than that this game is really humorous, addicting and while it only has 5 levels and few minigames it will take you at least 10 hours to beat the main campaign.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/363240\n\n═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONS\nPros:Addicting\nHumorous\nCustom mode\nUnique gameplay\nOffline 1v1 ModeCons:Dumb AI\nEnemy troops don't seem to care if you throw rocks at them\nMinor bugs\nIf you deploy a right strategy from beginning you can win all 5 levels easy═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game is for everyone who enjoys playing strategy games while being a part of strategy themselves. I rate this game 9/10, would restart the game from beginning when the dumb hunter gets killed again.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curtations here!","October 11, 2015","true","3.9"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","19","30","5","0"

Again not that is too hard, but its not easy also.\nAi is very smart for cavemen so its not recommended rushing in to it in early stages.\nWe have here lots of tribe upgrades, many dino species with abilitiy to play it in co-op that will surely bring lots of fun hours playing it.\n\nGraphic is cute, actualy looks way better in-game then on store video. Nothing too special but its nice.\nAs for sound, music is all drums and ugachaka prehistoric very cool.

The game provides such an easy gateway out of reality and into the world of Craig and his cavemen. The original game alone had enough content to keep you occupied all day, training your cavemen to gather, hunt, and prepare food. With the new version, it only amps up the experience and keeps it fresh!\n\nThe game features not only the five levels, but new game modes that bring new energy to the game, and challenge players in new ways. It's very evident the developers knew their game inside-out, because they found what makes it great, and made sure each addition to the game complemented the already phenomenal experience they crafted.\n\nThis game will forever hold a special place in my heart.","September 22, 2015","true","5.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

It's a game that shouldn't be taken super seriously, and that's totally ok. The game is fun, has a great soundtrack and an all-round beautiful aesthetic. Its an RTS, really, but it's got a goofy spin on it that makes it unique. The chaos that can ensue after  you amass a clan of Cavemen can be incredibly entertaining. You train cavemen, gather resources and take them to the enemy base and rek their ♥♥♥♥. You can spend resources to upgrade your cavemen or get perks/rewards (including a frieking mammoth) to give you an edge during battle. There are achievements as well, so the trophy hunters can get their just reward.\n\n10/10 - would throw rocks at large stone statues over and over again.","September 2, 2015","true","4.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You start a game, you drop one or two of each type of caveman, you teach them, and then that's it you just kinda run around doing chores and screwing with the enemy AI. Over time you make more cavemen, do the exact same thing, then it's back to the waiting game of chores and screwing around. There are some powers you unlock that somewhat spice up the game but in the end it's a huge waiting game on how overpowered your side can get before rushing the enemy. Also you'll hit all the content in about 5-6 hours if you take your time, 4 hours tops once you get into the groove of things.\n\nIs it worth the price?
