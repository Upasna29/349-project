Initially this game had a really rough day 1, with issues such as frame rate drops/frame skipping, unbearable online play and a bunch of other problems. However since I got to play the public beta version for an upcoming patch to the game, most of those problems have been addressed and I'm pretty satisifed with this game.\n\nAlso don't listen to those players crying about the lack of superficial features from the PS2 version of the game like 3D Backgrounds, Arrange Soundtracks, etc. They aren't required to enjoy the game where it matters most - the gameplay.  Most of the 3D backgrounds looked awful anyways, and while the Arrange Soundtrack is really good, I'm sure there will be a way to mod the music in the game anyways as with most PC titles.\n\nIf your first time playing The King Of Fighters series was XIII, you are in for a wild ride. This game is way different, everything hurts alot more, normals and anti-airs are much stronger, characters and movelists are far more diverse, and the action is very faced paced and unforgiving! Truly this game is one of the finest 2D fighting game classics out there, and you can even play the original '98 in all it's glory.\n\nLast but not least, Eiji Kisaragi is the greatest. So glad to play with him again. He's a real beastly character.","December 19, 2014","true","61.0"," 50 of 61 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","50","61","5","0"

However, that means it's the final rebalancing. It doesn't include the features the PS2 one does because that's not the version that was ported. It's a port of the XBLA version with all the balance changes applied to it. It's about as close to arcade perfect as you'll get. I can understand why people would be disappointed by that, but all things considered this is a good port. Now let's talk about the part everybody cares about most.\n\nThe netcode itself seems to be about KoFXIII's levels of quality. So it's very playable, but not perfect. This has been my experience with player matches only with players ranging from 100ms to 200ms. Yes, it displays the ping times, thank God. When someone's connection has issues, you can definitely feel the delay, but it resyncs pretty quickly.\n\nSingle player consists of small challenges, arcade mode, 1v1 matches, etc. All the stuff you would expect from a fighter. It also includes the NeoGeo version of KoF98 if you want to play that.\n\nSo to sum it up: few SP modes, no PS2 features, only way to play FE outside of arcades, netcode is good for input delay based netcode. So you're getting an arcade faithful version of KoF98UM FE with online play. I'm happy with it, but you can't please everybody. One little thing I'm personally happy about is that everybody is unlocked from the start, too.","December 18, 2014","true","18.3"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","0"

I love this game. King of Fighters is my favorite video game franchise and I have been playing it for years now. even though I have the PS2 version of this already, I was psyched when this was coming to Steam. I'm happy to support SNK because they deserve it. They make quality games. BUT, this particular version of the game is terrible. It honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off pretty bad. Allow me to explain the reasons.\n\n1. True full-screen mode is not optional.\n\nWhat is with this? In the PS2 version of '98 Ultimate Match, the game is in full screen like it should be.  I get that this is an arcade version, but this really could not be stretched for the steam release. The sidebars are distracting and I don't like playing my games in a tiny window in the middle of the screen. It's a good idea to have the sidebars if you're setting up an arcade cabinet with this game. But, it should be optional. Boo to them on that.\n\n2. No arranged music option.\n\nWHY? The PS2 version had it. Why not this? Would it have been so hard to include it? I think not. This is a big let down. I like both the OST and AST. But, the option should have been there.\n\n3. No color editing.\n\nOnce again, WHY NOT? The PS2 version had this too! This would have added even more depth into the game if they had included it. It's fun to create your own unique color palettes for your characters. Very bad decision not to include this.\n\n4. The online.\n\nOh boy. As much as I love KOF, I have to say that the online in KOF titles has always been terrible (At least XIII on steam is a little better). This is no exception. The online is awful. It's extremely laggy. The first match I played had about 3 second late input delay. I'm not kidding. I see why the online is dead already. It's a shame.\n\nAll in all, the KOF '98 Ultimate Match is a good game. But the Steam version is not. These fatal flaws just make the game much less enjoyable and souless. If you have a PS2 or a backwards compatible PS3, get the PS2 version. It feels much more complete and joyful than this. Or, if you don't have KOF XIII on Steam or console yet, get that instead. You'll enjoy yourself a lot more. I was hoping to be able to give this a positive review. But, I can't. These stupid mistakes have ruined this version of the game for me. Let's just hope they'll do better with KOF 2002 UM when in comes to Steam. (And hopfully KOF: Maximum Impact: Regulation A)\n\nBy the way, the 3D backgrounds from the PS2 version are missing.

One of the all-time greats of the fighting game genre,\nand now, you got it here on steam at a much more affordable price than what I had to shell out for a Neo Geo CDZ, it even has online play to boot! So if you like fighters and wanted to check out KOF, make it this one.\n\nThe roster is made up of every single fighter featured from KOF '94 to '97\nwith the last couple of missing combatants being additions for the "Ultimate Match" update from some years back.\n\nYou got two different styles, or "Grooves" if you are so inclined.\nAdvanced plays like your average KOF game today, you fill up your gauge by fighting and it eventually adds up into separate stocks. Using a special move consumes one stock, but you can also use a stock to enter a super mode, from there, you can use one more stock to do your character's most powerful move, The other mode on the other hand takes after KOF '94-'96's style with you having to charge your stocks manually and being granted the ability to use infinite supers when at low health. The rest of the gameplay follows a 3-man team-based structure, though you cannot tag in and out party members. Once all your characters are exhausted, you lose.\nBy far the most striking feature of KOF, however, is the jumping mechanics.\nYou got several different types of jumping at your disposal, like a short hop and another, entirely different hyper-hop that advances you forward quickly while still staying low to the ground. It all adds together to make KOF into one of the most frantic offense-based fighters around. The different types of jumping are done by inputting specific directions and immediately moving the stick in another direction. Knowing which type of jump to go for at each moment may seem daunting at first but as long as you stick to it, it'll become second nature in no time and is definitely rewarding enough to justify the learning-curve.\n\nI really cannot stress enough that if you even have only a passing interest in fighting games,\nyou NEED to experience KOF '98. And this new shiny rerelease with online play is just the perfect opportunity to do just that. You even get the original vanilla '98 on Neo Geo packaged with this updated rerelease if you like to be authentic!","December 16, 2014","true","0.5"," 47 of 75 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","47","75","0","0"

Ignore what the pings say (180-200) because they're clearly incorrect.\n\nOther than that there's not much to say about the game. King of Fighters '98 is one of the classics so a decent online version stands on its own. Kof98 and Super Turbo have always had a special place in my heart. They really don't make fighting games like they used to.\n\nThat said, you'd think with this being their 20th anniversary game though that'd they'd pack the thing with extras or do something cool like SF2AE where you could play all the old character versions... unfortunately that is not the case. There's a challenge mode, some EX characters and that's about it. No art gallery, no arranged soundtrack, no real graphics filter... these things are just examples of stuff that would take minimal effort to include and would make the game so much better. The King of Fighters '98 arranged soundtrack is one of the best video game soundtracks of all time.\n\nIt's nice but the game could be so much more. Really shows how times are with SNK.

The control feels a bit wonky on a pad and some people have reported issues with sticks, plus poor keyboard support. But there's no lag / pausing problems when playing single player. There's 30 challenges in the game too but I don't believe you get anything for clearing them, since all the secret characters are unlocked by default. Classic NeoGeo mode is also available, which is a nice plus, but it doesn't have any of the extra characters.\n\nCons: No arranged music, no 3D stages, and only twelve achievements, two of which are wasted on the typical "beat 5 / 10 players in a row". Plus some of the music sounds off, like Billy's theme, which has a bit that sounds like they had the wrong settings in their YM2610 emulator, but it's still not nearly as bad as Metal Slug 3's. And the netcode is horribly broken as of launch.\n\nIs it worth it? HELL YEAH IT IS. I wasn't expecting the game to be this good out of the gate, and it's a shame that we didn't get the arranged music as an option, but this is a fine offering, so hopefully SNK Playmore hires Code Mystics to handle their future PC ports instead of the idiots at DotEmu.","December 16, 2014","true","5.9"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","30","54","0","0"

Mediocre port.KOF 98 was one of the greatest games in The King of Fighters franchise. And when KOF 98 Ultimate Match first came out in consoles, it has major improvements compared to the original, including ALL the characters from KOF 94 to KOF 97. Unfortunately, the Steam port is a crippled version of the console versions, especially regarding visuals and music. While in the PlayStation2 version you could choose between the classic 2D and re-vamped 3D stages, and between the original soundtrack from the NeoGeo arcades and the arranged soundtrack that played in the original console ports, the Steam version comes only with 2D stages, and the NeoGeo's OST. No options to choose 3D stages or arranged music at all. This was a disappointment to me.

After some time with it, it's become clear that this tweaked and expanded version truly is a worthy update to one of the best fighting games ever made. A handful of new characters expand the roster a bit, but the addition of a significant amount of alternate versions of both pre-existing and new characters really beef up your options for team creation nicely. The changes are rounded out by a slight rebalance, the addition of a new mode to Advanced and EX, and online matchmaking. Throwing in the original version as well was a nice touch. Most of the criticism leveled at this game seems to come from the fact that it's not the PS2 version. This is still one of the most rock-solid fighting games in existence, with or without a few cosmetic bells and whistles, the absence of which hardly justifies a negative review. It's colorful, balanced, charming, fun, and accessible. If you're new to KOF and cut your teeth on XIII, pick this one up and get a taste of fighting's golden age; There's a good chance you'll find this game superior to its later installments. If you're a Neo Geo veteran, you'll come to enjoy the changes even if you're a hardened purist.","January 11, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Most people complain about the bad netcode and I don't blame them, it kind of sucks; but hopefully this will get fixed. Another thing is the lack of content. Where are the arranged tracks, the 3D backgrounds, gallery, and other unlockables  at? Not that they affect gameplay, but it just feels incomplete. Some might say, "The only thing that should matter in a fighting game is the fighting", but then you realize that  it's almost 2015. Modern games not only offer the satisfaction of challenging yourself and beating the game, but they offer other extras too.   Should of included these, especially when its competitors offer them.  So the original 98 is included with this port, but really I don't see much diference between this 98 UM and the original 98, only thing diferent is the game display (menu, character/order select screen, win/lose screen).

The balance has been re-tweeked, several characters have been added and now there is online play (welcome to 2005).\nThe graphics are certainly of the nostalgic variety; if you enjoy the old school sprites of yesteryear, you will feel right at home. If you aren't a fan of that retro look, the game still moves and plays silky smooth and decently quick.\n\nA gamepad is a minimum requirement for this game, so if you don't already have one, that extra investment is to be considered. To truly experience this game to its full potential, I strongly suggest purchasing a fightstick. This game is fully playable with a keyboard, and some actually do, but it is not recommended.\n\nNow let's talk a bit about the online. Quite frankly, the online in this game is acceptable. I know several people lombast it, but compared to other fighting games, it certainly isn't bad. That said, I come from the old arcade culture, and I have yet to play a single fighting game online that is acceptable to me. I simply cannot abide by ANY level of input delay. I am very greatful for this game's input delay display (available in the beta version) so I at least know exactly how psychic I am going to have to be, or how early I need to prompt my inputs.\n\nIf you are a fan of fighting games, especially if you have other friends whom are as well, this game is a must buy. It, like all other fighters, excels when there are others to play with in the same room. If you are a fan of the series and are dying to find others who are of a like mind, at least the option to play online is there, and it's certainly not the worst.\n\nRatings:\n\nIf you are a fighting game fan: 9/10\n+Tons of characters\n+"Spot on", very tight gameplay\n+Good balance\n+Retro graphics that hearken to a better time\n+One of the best and most varied soundtracks of any fighting game\n\nIf you are apathetic toward fighting games: 7/10\n+Tons of  varied characters to learn\n+Smooth, fast paced fighting\n+/- Retro graphics, love 'em or leave 'em\n+/- Retro music. Great compositions hampered by archaic sampling/synth, unless that's your bag!\n- Keyboard playable, but not the optimal input device.

The arcade version is the NEO-GEO version with all the characters and fancy menus.\nThe PS2 version of this game features a enhanced soundtrack, taken from arranged albums of the KOF series, 3D rendered backgrounds and several improvements over the arcade.\nIt's kinda sad that SNK pushed an inferior port to STEAM in order to make more money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spleenfinder/recommended/222420/","spleenfinder","Dick Cheney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spleenfinder/","250 products in account","A huge disappointment. The new characters are interesting, it's great to have Extra mode be useful for once, and the balance changes are welcome, but the good pretty much ends there. The netcode, even after multiple patches, is questionable at best --- playing the original '98 with proper rollback is still the way to go. The exclusion of 3D backgrounds and an arranged soundtrack is no tragedy, and the game is perfectly playable without them, but still rather bothersome. The real problem lies with the game itself --- the damage has been turned far, far down from the original '98. The amount of health that each character has is more akin to XIII than the older entries. This would be perfectly fine for a game like 2002, where long combos dominate high level play, but a huge part of '98's appeal is the lack of such combos: most of everything is under ten hits, just enough that learning combos will give most players an edge, but huge combos do not dominate competitive play and the game remains tactically well-rounded. Turning the damage down in such a game makes matches draw on for a bit too long, long enough to stagnate. As a result, Time Outs are far more common in this game than in the original '98, and strong tactics are far less threatening --- the game is less about being constantly on your toes and more about getting your opponent into a situation where you can hit them with your character's best tactics several times in a row in order to do as much damage as using that tactic once would do in the original '98.\nSome older fighting games just don't really translate well into the modern scene --- see Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix for a perfect example. It might seem like a good idea to tune down damage and nerf strong tactics for these games at face value, but this ultimately destroys much of what made these games popular to begin with. The reason why people still play Super Street Fighter II Turbo, Samurai Shodown II, Street Fighter Alpha 3, and indeed King of Fighters '98 is that they are very high risk/high reward at all levels of play. One mistake can doom a player for an entire match in these games. There's a sort of tension to these games that modern fighting games lack almost entirely (though they make up for it in other aspects). This revision fails to capture this almost entirely. It tailors the game to a modern audience --- one that has King of Fighters XIII anyway, and has demonstrated time and time again that it doesn't care about this game in the slightest, as this game failed in arcades and failed to make it into any major tournaments.\n\nIf you just want the new characters and don't mind gimped damage and weakened tactics with almost nothing to replace them, this game is decent. However, the original version of this game is the way to go if you value the things that made it fun. Most people should either play the original '98 on GGPO or Fightcade or something, wait for King of Fighters 2002 Ultimate Match, which translates far better into a modern setting, or just get King of Fighters XIII.","January 19, 2015","false","8.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

For casual players it doesn't matter, but for those who want to play online it is very destructive.\n\nHopefully it's gonna be fixed. The KOF 13 steam version is actually great, but this one is little crappy.\n------------------------------\nThe beta Update fixed the half cycle ibnput issue.

Ignoring all of this, the game itself easily warrants a perfect score as the definitive iteration of one of the greatest fighting game series ever.

At least there's online to make up for it...but beware of the high ping spikes. Don't just match with anyone. Make sure you check their ping and that it's around 100 and below before you go into a match. I've had very laggy matches due to ignoring the ping at first, and then very awesome matches because I paid attention to the ping.\n\nIf you are getting the game to play online with friends...hopefully you won't experience ping problems with them. Otherwise, search for a player you could rival up against, friend them, and play away! A great experience and good training!\n\nNow as for the game itself. King of Fighters 98 is a much more simplified game than what it became with XIII and even 2002. You'll be using more basic combos, some juggles, and technical gameplay strategies to outwit your opponents with mix-ups and what not.\n\nThere's a great selection of characters and they all play very unique from one another. Not to mention, there are even second versions of some characters usually based on previous renditions of them whether it's referenced to older KoF games or their origin (such as Fatal Fury or Art of Fighting.)\n\nUnfortunately, why I reccommend to get the a CD based version, (Neo geo cd, PS2, etc) is for its incredible arranged soundtrack, color edit (I enjoy this since it allows me to personalize my main team), and actually functional graphic filters.\n\nLet's just hope they patch a whatever they can with the netcode, and maybe that someone will make a mod to add in the Arranged sountrack.\n\nOtherwise, I'd still reccommend the game to anyone who wants a taste of King of Fighters' origins beign that people claim this is the most balanced KoF game.

Seriously people what fighting game nowadays don't have anything besides the fighting game itself even ultra street fighter 4 has bonus stages.\n-New Extra mode.

I bought this knowing that those bells and whistles were not included in this version.  I've been a huge fan of the series for a very long time- my experience coming from playing emulations of the games back when I was a highschooler with no disposable income.  Now that I'm a grown man with a 9-5 I can finally give back to the current owners of the franchise and buy whatever decent ports of the games they offer.  I happily paid 60 bucks for Kof XII when it hit the PS3 and both the PS3 and Steam ports of XIII.  If I weren't a total fanboy for the franchise, I'd probably be really dissapointed paying 15 bucks for a barebones fighting game with blocky graphics and sound a step above sega genesis.  For people looking for something that can stand on it's own without nostalgia, I'd recommend KOF XIII, Blazblu or USFIV.

The NeoGeo version that is.\n\nThe problem is however, that this new steam version has NO players online and is almost impossible to find anyone to play against with a ping < 500ms. And I live in the UK with fibre internet. I can ping 15ms to servers in the UK.  The trouble is there just aren't any players to find online here it seems. Not on this side of the world anyway.\n\nExcept there probably are, they are just not using this version. Maybe they use emulators. Or they play offline. Or only play with friends they invite in private matches. Or they use a real neogeo. I don't know, but it is such a let down for me, when I just want to start a game and find someone to play against and this game just doesn't let you do that unless you live in Asia. Or if you would like to try playing a fast paced fighting game with over 500ms then great.\n\nIt's not really the games "fault" that there are not many people playing. By "not many" I mean basically 2 people in the UK have this game by the looks of it. Seriously? Where is everyone!?!  If I search for a game and it takes 20min plus to find someone, and they have 500ms then something is wrong.\n\nI know I can get a ping < 100 ms to USA servers so why I hardly even see any of those is beyond me. USA have a strong following for games like KOF.. but so far I have played against just 1 single person with a ping under 100ms (was 80ms) and that game played very well. But just 1 single person..  so where is everyone?\n\nOr maybe the matchmaking is broken? !!  That is an idea..\n\nSo basically, the game is great... seriously brilliant gameplay, just really pointless if you cannot find a single person to play it WITH.\n\nMaybe advertise the game a little? Get people to know it even exists on steam? I only found it by chance, and I'm a FAN of kof98.\n\nAnd maybe if I had of known this version would be like this I would not have bought it. If you know people who you can invite to play then you will have a great time with this.\n\nI <3 SNK but this is just not worth it.\n\n** I guess people would say "oh it's your firewall and router blarr blarr" which is strange as every other game I play inc streetfighter works fine online. It's a shame because kof98 is so much better than SF.","April 13, 2015","false","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although this title lacked any sort of story at all, it made up for it with the inclusion of all characters seen up to that point including those had been retired or killed during the story, as well as an overall improvement in gameplay speed & balance.\n\nThis particular version of this game is actually the third revision of the game, apparently based on the arcade version of "The King of Fighters 98: Ultimate Match" while adding some requested changes (such as the return of the assist attack, that for some unknown reason was taken out of the previous game!). Which explains the lack of extras such as reworked 3D stages & an arranged soundtrack that were featured in home versions such as the one released for the Playstation 2 at the time. But do not let the lack of those extras discourage you from playing this excellent title. Featuring perhaps the largest roster seen in the series thus far, you may rest assured that you are certain to find characters that suit your playing style.\n\nAll in all, this is a highly recommended title for KOF fans that may have missed the second revision of the game back at the arcades, as well as younger fighting game fans who have an interest in old-school fighting games.","October 17, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have played any of the older KOF games(pre PS3/XBOX360), then this game will be familiar territory.  The game has a solid roster, good game play, and doesn't get too complex with it's bars/meters. Overall, it is a very solid fighting game.  As for this edition, there are several changes.  First, there are additional characters added since the original arcade version including several boss characters from past games.  Second, some of the characters received new or modified moves and (S)DMs.  Third, there is an inclusion of a 3rd mode that is included which is customizable from a combination of extra and advanced modes.  As for online, there isn't a lot of people playing the game so finding a match can be challenging.  However, overall, this is a solid game, and for any fan, it should be a must buy.\n\nIn summary, if you are a KOF fan, I absolutely recommend this game, but likely, you've already purchased it.  If you are a fighting game fan in general, or would like to get into the series, this is definitely a recommended title.","September 27, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I only occassionally play it compared to KoF XIII's solid mechanics and KoF 2002's insane roster of characters but KoF98 has a lot of little charms that are missing from the latter games. The stages are more characterful and change between bouts with all sorts of little details hidden away that they didn't seem to bother with in the later games. There's a lot more character interactions before the start of rounds which is an excellent way of fleshing out who these characters are and how they relate to one another without resorting to sometimes lengthly dialogue excahnages as you get in KoF XIII and Blazblue. It's probably the toughest of the KoF games on Steam and because of it's multiple systems, has a lot more depth to it but it also has some of the most overpowered characters as well (Orochi in particular).\n\nThe bottom line: If you're a casual fighting fan like me then KoF 98 offers a good roster of characters and some of the best visual design in the genre (which is why I like it) but KoF XIII is generally prettier and a lot easier to get into.","June 27, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am aware that the PS2 port was also an updated one, but I only played the arcade and this one, so the comparisons will be made between the two.\n\nNew:\n\n* 10 more playable characters (Including Orochi officially playable for the first time)\n\n* Several new stages and music, mostly lifted directly from KoF 96 / 97\n\n* Rugal is not the only available boss. Now it's either Rugal, Orochi or Goenitz and the boss team before that also changes depending on this.\n\n* New power gauge bar (Ultimate) in addition to old Advanced / Extra setup\n\n* Customization options for  pixel graphics (original / blurred (smoothed))\n\n* Online features\n\n\nSome changes were made as well. These include:\n\n* Different / new special moves for certain characters\n\n* More characters have alternate form (by holding down the start button on the select character screen)\n\n* The fighting is more fluid. Hit detection / counters / dodges were tweaked for greater balance.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\nOverall - this is one of the best 2D fighting games currently available on Steam.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DTTEhsan/recommended/222420/","DTTEhsan","Ehsan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DTTEhsan/","192 products in account","The Ultimate Match edition of King of Fighters '98 is the best in home experience that you can have with this fighter outside of buying a Neo Geo. The roster is rather large and includes a good number of exclusive characters, so you'll have a lot of teams to experiment to your liking. '98 is the first King of Fighters that I felt nail the style of the series that most players remember today, with a robust yet easy to pick up system and the presentation and art having a dramatic lift from previous iterations. This version also has the updated Ultimate Match while also giving the option of playing a Neo Geo rom of the original version of The King of Fighters '98 for the purists.\n\nThe only issue is a mainstay in most SNK ports, being that the netplay is bad. While the connections are up in the air, it's hard to even find a decent match online. Sadly, there is not a large community currently available, so unless you have a group of friends, it's best to go in expecting not to get much mileage out of the online play.\n\nNearly 2 decades later, The King of Fighters '98 still holds up as a very competant fighter and is enjoyable to go back to every now and then. While I recommend The King of Fighters XIII as the best overall representation and evolution of the series, '98 is still a very well made game and worth checking out to see the roots of SNK's most well known fighting franchise.","December 26, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
