From there, you can use portals like wormholes to travel to different virtual spaces. First off, I tried playing fetch with a robotic dog on the top of a mountain, which appeared to be real. Then I played an arcade cabinet, which transported me inside the game called Xortex. I picked up a space ship, which I then had to manouver around, dodging bullets, missiles and lasers while shooting at the enemy ships. I managed to win the game on my second go, once I realised that the bullets were aimed at the ship, and not at me, bodily. Even though I was rooted to the spot, I had to weave and dodge and even crouch down, so it was quite a work-out, especially the boss level. I would call it a kind of VR shoot-em-up.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent showcase and quite up to Valve's usual level of strange brilliance.","April 25","true","0.8"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

I was watching all the videos on youtube and was hyped like crazy.\n\nNot only me, every single person that tried it out was amazed and incredible flashed by the possibilities this so called room-scale and those controllers would promise in games if implemented like in the demo compilation.\n\nWe were starting to dream about Half-Life 3 in VR, even that we hadn’t any idea how to fix the walking nausea and we couldn’t care less about teleporting actually.\n\nValve definitely set the bar very high for independent developers when it comes to room scale with the Vive. And to be honest, until now (end of May 2016) I have not seen a single other Vive game that could compete with the experience The Lab provides, with the quality of the image they managed to achieve, the precision in controlling, even if the biggest problem of the Vive or Oculus is the very low & blurry resolution of the screen. Subsequent HMD generations will improve this certainly.\n\nBack to The Lab, which might be the best selling reason for the HTC Vive and for VR in general. It is the perfect tech demo you use to show off to your friends & family, to any critic of your precious new device.\n\nDetailed graphics, huge room scale, smart avoidance of blurry images and the best implementation of 3D-360 as well as the full functionality of the Vive controllers are key and shiny.\n\nIt shows in short tech demos everything we are actually waiting for in a full title. It is now up to Valve to follow-up on their promise. It is up to Valve to publish at least a handful of AAA titles with the same quality as The Lab in coming month. For not letting us down. Leaving us back behind with the desire for more. And to be even more existential, for keeping VR alive and not letting it die in a shortly as a hype with promise, but without any care for high quality follow-up.\n\nWe are waiting!\n\nThe Lab is a unique experience. It will blow your gaming mind and warms your tech heart. It is the perfect fixer into the unreal world of VR. But now we desire more. So please Valve don't let us down and don't leave software supply to shady VR profiteers that sell their tech demos for shameful high prices.","May 27","true","1.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Most experiments stand on their own, while a few were forgetable. The highlights are Longbow and Robot Repair.\n\nLongbow has you standing on top of a castle firing arrows at minions, in a similar vain to Space Pirate Trainer. The arrows fly straight and hitting targets is hard but satisfying. It's difficult to have proper form though, in comparison to real life. Really wanted to rest my draw hand on my cheek but failed. Can't seem to find a comfortable / consistent place to rest it. This is the 1 demo that keeps me coming back.\n\nRobot Repair has excellent texture quality and the sense of scale got me stoked. Glados is HUGE. However the chaperon system is confusing. It sets you in a room I thought was mapped to the play area. Got too excited and ran into a wall... There is actually a teleprot system inside this tiny room, so you can blink next to the edge then the VR and Real rooms get out of sync.\n\nXortex has similar problems with room bounds. It has more involved / time based movements that makes it more frustrating. The only time you see chaperon is when your right next to a wall, which doesn't work with fast paced movements. If you have just barely enough play space, the walls are a constant concern. In contrast, Space Pirate Trainer does it right and always shows you the bounds via a textured floor. Here, I was scared to move fast, which is a shame because I like the game itself.\n\nJust to be clear, room bounds were only a problem in The Lab, not other VR titles.\n\nEdit: After more time with Longbow, I've gotten much better at aiming from cheek.","April 9","true","4.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The games you can play are both challenging yet very simple to grasp. The "experiences" are an interesting change of pace from the games, especially since this isn't something Valve is known for. They are all very detailed and are also a great way to show off the potential non-gaming applications of VR.\n\nI highly recommend this be one of the first things you play when you get your Vive.","April 6","true","4.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was blown away during my initial reaction, but the real fun is showing all the various demos to your friends and family. My wife couldn't believe her eyes during mountain demo, and proclaimed that she really felt like she was there. She loved playing fetch with that little dog thing haha. My 8 year old daughter had a go with the archery demo, but we found out that she was just a little too short for reaching over the castle walls to hit the invaders as they were running past underneath her. As she was leaning toward our living room wall facing our 52" TV, I placed a kick with full force to her lower back sending her almost flying into the TV. The TV screen cracked and fell from its wall mounts and I noticed a spark in my peripheral as our entire house went black from the blackout. (The kid is FINE but she didn't found it as funny as I did!)

This is the absolute first thing you must play on the Vive. It is a gentle, near perfect introduction to room scale.\n\nIt is damned impressive. There's nothing that could induce motion sickness in normal people. It requires no previous VR or room-scale experience and little or no gaming experience in general, but it helps if you're going for a high score in the arcadey mini-games.\n\n(p.s., the time played counter is lying. I've played this for 2-3 hours, which is what it takes to leasurely try the different experiences and mini games; I will be going back to the mini games to try to improve my scores and I will be comming back to show family and friends).","May 2","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Far more entertaining than Fantastic Contraption and probably better than most of the VR games you can buy right now, The Lab is a wonderful collection of minigames and other VR experiences. The graphics are fantastic and the experience overall is very engaging. There is plenty of humor and if you got a kick of out Portal, you'll be laughing out loud at The Lab.\n\nThere are three three minigames in The Lab, two of which are ridiculously amazing proof-of-concepts.

However, it's so devilishly cohesive with a delightful amount of classic Portal wit, I spent 2 hours in it the first time I tried it and I /still/ haven't found everything. The catapult game has various cores you need to calibrate with many of the enthusiastic and emotional cores being voiced by Justin Roiland (of Rick and Morty fame).

The experiences in this are all short, but that's great to get a feeling for the Vive, and to provide a great game to allow friends and family to test out when sharing the Vive with others. The game has that traditional Valve sense of humor and there are tons of easter eggs for you to find as you play around. I can't recommend this enough and can only hope to get a full game from Valve at some point (crossing my fingers for Portal 3!)\n\nSome may say this is too short or too simple, but I think that is the strength.

Robot Repair and the game with the bow and arrows were amazing too.\n\nAlthough we are just scratching the surface of what VR is capable of, these first experiences are some of the sweetest ones.
