It's a lot of fun to play with friends or alone. It also relies entirely on skill, not luck, so it's gonna be great to play competitively. There's some kinks, but overall it's a great experience that's I'd highly recommend to anyone even remotely interested in the genre.

I was not sure what to expect, but was impressed with many of the games aspects: great catchy music(seems this company always does a really good job with sound and music)  Play styles and modes are very different giving the games some decent depth to a multiplayer brawler.  The game has legitimate laughs, from playing and from the annoucer.  Polished in all areas (I was surprised the first time a dad hit me in the choose a player screen) and good replayability.  Best with at least one other player as the AI is strong, even on easy.  My only gripe is that the game is local multiplayer only, no online multiplayer, which honestly would actually make the game a little easier by playing with other humans.  8/10","November 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Being one of the 5 people who own this game is pretty rewarding as you are the only one with these cards and badges and what not. Its sort of fun, I mean, I played a bit of it then idled the rest. I play this when I am bored and literally have nothing else to play. I think it is worth the $5 and I am sure its decently fun if you get ohter friends to play with you.","February 25","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"
