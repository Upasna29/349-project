I use to play this on the PS2 when I was younger, and it was the FIRST PS2 game I ever owned. Nostalgia hit me hard when I saw Steam had this and had no choice but to by and play. I don't regret it. It's a game I have had a lot of fin playing, and the only thing that could make it better is if Jedi Starfighter became available.\n\nBasic concept of the game you play in three different ships running through various missions during the timeline of just before and during Episode I: The Pahntom Menace. You can win fairly easily, combat is okay but ONLY if you have a controller or joystick. It's difficult to manuever your hand as the game asks you to, since rolling left and right to keep yourself straight is the E and Q keys. Either have something on standby, or change the config before you tear your hair out trying to play the game.\n\nI'd rank the game on a personal level of a 6 or 7. It's fun if you don't mind spending the money, just don't expect endless hours of replay value, maybe just a small handful. Still a decent game in my opinion for fans of flight simulators and or Star Wars.","January 19, 2014","true","2.8"," 60 of 67 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","60","67","2","1"

My play sessions consisted of a single mission, maybe two, at a time and every time I started up the game I rebound the keys ever so slightly to make them slightly better for me.\nBy the time the final mission rolled around I was finally pleased with how it felt, and the game was entirely enjoyable.\n\nThe plot isn't anything special, but it's sufficiently seeped in Star Wars lore that it was entertaining for me. It features a cast of three new characters experiencing the invasion of Naboo and getting caught up in the conflict. Missions are split up about 50/50 between planetary battles and space battles, but you are always in one of the three titular Starfighters. Each character has his/her own ship, which controls slightly differently and has different secondary weapons and looks.\n\nIt's not the huge budget movie tie-in you might be used to, but those also tend to be very bad.\nIf you're patient enough to jump in and out to tweak the controls to work for you and have some fondness for Star Wars that at least somewhat extends to the prequel trilogy this might be a fun title to pick up.","September 28, 2015","true","2.6"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","49","56","3","3"

Then yes, play this. In a world where space combat sims grew on trees, I might say this game was too mediocre to recommend, but in a world where this genre has been in hibernation for a decade, and Rogue Squadron doesn't work on any computer newer than Windows 98, it's hard to pass this one up.\n\nYou get to fly three different ships. One is a bomber, in which you'll do a lot of airstrikes and ground based targets. One is a dogfighting specialist, with totally awesome and totally OP homings lasers. The last is the N-1 as seen in Episode 1, a powerful all around fighter.\n\nMechanically, the game is solid, with one exception: the ridiculous camera shake whenever you get hit by anything. Which makes it almost impossible to react meaningfully if you're ever under attack, so you usually take several more hits as a consequence.\n\nThe game's biggest issues come from level design, though. Some missions are straightforward and fun. However sometimes the difficulty ramps up for what usually feels like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reasons, in most cases an over-abundance of tanks or turrets that are way too accurate, do way too much damage, and make your camera shake like a maraca. And then there are friendlies you have to escort that have no interest in their own survival. There's one mission towards the end that starts out positively frantic, then you spend the rest of the mission boredly waiting for NPCs slowly move down a path. Basically, the mission design is totally inconsistent in terms of fun and the difficulty curve is whack, which is a shame because you end up spending more time retrying the frustrating bits than you do enjoying the fun parts.\n\nThe story is shoddy, but serviceable. It's not well developed, and the dialog is lacking, but you can tell what they were going for, and it doesn't get in the way. Some parts rely on the movie to fill in what would be huge gaps. And yes, the plot is focused largely on the invasion of Naboo, so if you can't handle the stink of Episode 1, then don't bother, but that really shouldn't be the reason to avoid this game.\n\nThere are also some unlockable bonus missions, and mission medals to earn if you want more from the game. It's just the right amount of extras, IMO.\n\nThe graphics show their age, but there's nothing to complain about.\n\nLike most games in this genre, you really want a joystick, but a console controller will do. Mouse and keyboard will NOT. Note: You can't rebind keys or change other options from in the game, but you can do it from the Windows game launcher that opens before the actual game starts up. Which is kind of annoying.\n\nThis review probably sounds pretty negative, but overall the game is fun. There's just not much to say about it aside from the complaints. You fly a spaceship and blow up other spaceships, what more do you want?","November 9, 2014","true","5.6"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","0"

But that's all I can really say about it.\n\n\nIt's ridiculously short, and it's hard to play without a joystick....Well, I have a joystick, but this should be SOMEWHAT playable with a keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe game is essentially about the exploits of Naboo pilot Rhys Dallows, mercenary Vana Sage, and pirate Nym. They eventually form an unexpected alliance and they basically protect Naboo from the Trade Federation attacks from The Phantom Menace.\n\nYou use the joystick or keyboard and mouse combination to move your starfighter. The game didn't come with a manual, so you'll need to look up the controls yourself. It's somewhat sluggish, to be perfectly honest. A joystick is recommended for this, even though it isn't anywhere close to a flight simulator.\n\nThe game's levels are decent. Heck, you can even (sorta) recreate the finale from The Phantom Menace! There's some variety in terms of flyable ships. There are also unlockables, but you can easily cheat for everything with the OVERSEER cheat. Enjoy the cheating.\n\nEveryone is complaining about the game's difficulty, but it honestly wasn't that hard. And that ruined it for me. I like challenge in my games, and flying games are certainly no exception.  The adventure lasts about 2-4 hours, and there's no extras besides bonus missions and unlockables.\n\nDid I mention there was no multiplayer? One small question - WHY!? This game would have been a great multiplayer game and multiplayer alone would possibly redeem this game. Heck, the PS2 and Xbox versions had local multiplayer! WHY DIDN'T THIS HAVE MULTIPLAYER!? And did I also mention that a boxed version of this game (without the fixed engine introduced with the Steam release) will lag constantly due to Microsoft software updates?\n\nAnyway, would I recommend it for 1-2 quid? Yeah, it's a decent flying game and I recommend that you pick it up when it's on sale. However, if we're talking about full price....Just wait for a sale. This should have had more levels, multiplayer, etc. It's decent, but that is all I can really say about this. Really, it was a missed opportunity.","March 23, 2014","true","5.8"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","27","41","0","0"

You will want to have your controls properly configured - take the time to do this or else you'll find yourself fighting with the controls instead of using them.  You are a PC gamer, keyboard and mouse is great, but this game was based off a console game, and this game is not the only console-style game out there, please take the money to get a gamepad.  It'll make your overall PC gaming experience even better.\n\nI played the X-Wing Collector's CD-ROM on my Mac Performa 637CD over a decade and a half ago and I had a blast.  I also enjoyed the immensely popular X-Wing vs TIE Fighter when it came out later and really enjoyed the space assault missions in Star Wars Battlefront 2.  I saw this on sale during the "May the 4th be with you" sale for $1.69, and I have to say, for less than the cost of a drink, it's a really good deal.  Once you get your controls in order, the game feels really good.\n\nIt's an arcade space flight sim, much along the vein of Rogue Squadron 64, so you don't have to worry about things like managing your front and aft deflector shields or figuring out how much power you want to get into your engines, etc.  If you've played the space assault mode in SWBF2, this game plays exactly like that.  I suggest mapping your your boost/brake not to your triggers, but to your right analog up/down - it makes flying around much easier to deal with.\n\nThe missions are extremely fast paced and most of them are pretty short.  This game is great for quick "get in, get out" play sessions.  Unlike X-Wing, where a lot of time is spent on the buildup towards the missions, this game gets you right into the thick of the action.\n\nThe story is so-so, three random people end up teaming up together by chance to take on the evil Trade Federation.  You've heard it before and like any game, it adds to the universe that these games have built up.  Granted, if you've heard the news, Disney-LucasArts have officially said that none of the games or books are canon, but I'd say considering the amount of milking they've done of the franchise, they're still good enough to stand as their own stories.\n\nWord of warning, although the game runs fine on modern systems, the highest the game will run at (without registry edits) is at 1280 x 1024, and most of the textures are upscaled so they'll sometimes look blotchy.  However, it's a 12 year old game, so that's to be expected.  I've been told that the Steam version of this game was "GOG'ized" to make it run on modern hardware and to detect modern gamepads, so that's definitely a plus.  For $5, it's a bit too much, but if you can get this during a Steam sale, definitely get it.","May 4, 2014","true","4.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/32350/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Starfighter has a long history behind it, and a lot to stand up against with the X-Wing series and the first Rouge Squadron both having been released prior.  The history of Star Wars flight sims is one of beauty and challenge . The X-Wing series is hailed by many as they best Star Wars flight sims ever produced. Perhaps a little complex for some players to grasp, the X-Wing series gave the player a level of control over their ship that hasn’t been seen since. But I’m not reviewing that game, I’m reviewing Starfighter.\n\nAs mentioned in the Wikipedia blurb, the story follows three different pilots, from three different backgrounds, that end up working together. You’ve got the new recruit in the Naboo forces, a mercenary, and a pirate captain.  The story doesn’t have the cohesive flow one hopes to find in most video games.  Instead it has that quick mashed and thrown together vibe.  It, mostly makes sense, and so long as you don’t question much, you can follow it easy enough.  But I personally, kept asking why, and didn’t get many answers back.\n\nYou fly three different ships, however you don’t get to pick which ships. Each level is assigned a different ship, and while this makes sense on the early levels.  The later ones where all the characters are fighting together, an added feature of pick-your-ship levels would have been nice, and even added a little replay-ability. Replay factory is something this game does give you.  As it tracks if you’ve beaten each mission on each skill level, as well as each mission has bonus objectives to accomplish. So right out the gate you can play every mission three times with a little personal goal of 100% completion. There are also unlockable missions, both single and multiplayer. These add a little more playtime, but not a whole lot of fun. As I noted before, the multiplayer is pretty lacking.\n\nGraphically Starfighter isn’t bad, it’s what I call PS2 graphics.  Which makes sense since that is what the game was built for.  But PS2 is also a good marking point on the graphic timeline.  If there is one constant from Lucas Arts, it’s that their games always seem to be at the top of the line for graphics.\n\nThe controls were a little poor.  But I have to admit that this was probably due to the Logitech software more so than the game.  Some of the buttons weren’t mapped how one would have expected them to be, while others not used at all.  This can be fixed in either the Logitech software or in the games settings.  But since you have to exit the game to adjust the controls I never bothered, and just learned to work with it.  Maybe it’s just me, but when I play a combat flight sim, I expect to have to lead my targets.  If we’re both moving I shouldn’t be able to just put the cross hairs over the target and hit it.  I should have to send the shots ahead of them, so they fly into them.  Is this not accurate?  Because Starfighter doesn’t do that, here you just put your cross hairs over and fire.\n\nOne of the big problems about the game, and more so writing about it, is that it doesn’t leave anything with you. You play it, you beat some levels, and that’s it. There really isn’t anything that you take away, no real moment that you reflect on later. It’s almost just a sort of time filler for everything else you do. Its not a bad game, its not a great game, its just a game. Stuck in this sort of grey zone of quality. I cant say I hated it, nor can I say I loved it, and I’m pretty sure in a few days I’ll have forgotten I even played it. I guess that’s what leaves the biggest mark on this game, when its not there right in front of your eyes you forget it even exists.\n\nOne thing of note, if you want to check this game out, and you opt to go with the PC version.  Get it on Steam.  I’ve read some various things around the web that say the original released version is pretty much borked on Windows now.  But that the games engine was fixed for it’s Steam release.  However I would personally recommend PS2 for this.  Unless you have an epic joystick, in which case that might improve controls improving the whole experience.\n\nI didn’t play any of the multiplayer, for a few different reasons.  One being that unless the game is only multiplayer, I don’t use that as a measuring factor of it’s quality.  I’m anti social remember, I prefer to play solo.  The other being that I didn’t have anyone or the means for multiplayer.  I’m assuming it’s not network/internet capable with the multi, and that it’s just a split screen venture.","May 16, 2013","true","6.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

You can do loopings, shoot robots in some canyons, fly about some factories on the land, there are tons of different landscapes, planets, vessels, space areas, asteroid fields,...\n\n\n\nIt is real 3D, I mean not like in usual games, which are 3D but in fact you move in a plan, so you play 2D (like all the FPS Call of Duty, etc, etc..). This one is real 3D, you have to move in all directions (3D directions !), you fly in real space. People are not used to that. So it takes time ; took me about a week to just know how to fly and start aiming my targets and all.\n\n\n\nIt goes beyond sensation and imagination, I've been playing for a long time and was not very aware of the games released recently, but I must say that this one -released in 2002 only- has it all and is incredible. I can't think that there is possibly better games than that one nowadays and I wonder how it is not more famous or how I didn't get to know it at that time (back in 2002). This game is so cool that you can't possibly want to play another game after it.\n\nWell, so I grade this game 22/20. And I triple it. And put exponent 4 and square it.","July 24, 2014","true","53.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","0"

The graphics are surprisingly decent enough for the time (Being a console port) and the story has some interesting characters, The fact it's a console port doesn't really do much to damage it other then there being no cursor for the menus and can work perfectly fine with a mouse and keyboard.\n\nHowever the game is short and I mean really short, I completed it in 3 hours for all the story mission and the bonus objectives in less of an hour.

Yeah, that sounds mean, and probably is to the origional game (though not the Steam port).\n\nGraphics were fairly good back when this was new, and are adequate (if dated) now. Art design doesn't stand out, but there's also nothing terrible, so on the whole a plus. The music is excellent, with various well done rearrangements (if not outright remixes) of John Williams also excellent work (eg: the bells in the Duel of the Fates variant in the final mission). Other sounds are generic, but recognizably Star Wars. Voices give reasonablish commentary initially, but if you pay attention, the throaway chatter quickly becomes repetitive and has little to do with the current situation.\n\nControls are good if and only if you have a gamepad. Keyboard and mouse are awkard. A joystick is less awkward, but correctly assigning axes is, uh, interesting. (Google for the roll issues with throttle for details) Get around that, and you still run into a sensitivity that's really aimed at thumbsticks. And of course, there's the fact that you can't remap controls in the game, so if you want to test out setups, you need to edit them in the launcher and then restart the game. The cutscenes in the intro are skippable, but you have to hit a button several times to reach the main menu because :effort:. Which leads into just how awkard navigating the menus is. The 'hints' are too generic to properly list the actual keys for things, and options that "should" allow y/n as well as enter/esc do not.\n\nActual gameplay has a (subjectively?) good core, even if some missions squander it. Arcade style shooting is quite fun, though there are times when the restricted environment size gets in the way. The limited targeting options made me wish for the more versatile system in the X-Wing/TIE Fighter games, but are usually adequate. The nature of enemy spawning seems to work well enough in space, though wanders towards annoying when near planets. Occasionally wingmen options or the variety of enemies give you some tactical options, but it's mainly about getting from point A to B fast and hitting hard. You get your choice of difficulty, which seems to mainly make your craft more fragile and not give any additional reward. Keep that in mind if you want to go for something like 100% completion.\n\nBack to the missions, you get a moderate seeming amount, but the wall clock time spent is remarkably low. The entire game can be beaten in <5 hours without any attempt at speedrunning! Somewhat more content is available if you poke around with the bonus missions and especially if you replay campaign missions in an attempt to unlock everything, but there's still the risk of getting close enough to 100% completion in less time than it takes to watch both trilogies. Or just one if all that replaying feels grindy. Which it probably will, given the pseudo-cuscene that runs when you attempt to abort a mission, and the repetitive dialog.\n\nThe plot is unspectacular, with seemingly nonsensical character arcs and overconfident stupid evil villians. The development of the heroes might have worked better in a longer game with more in or between mission development, but again :effort:. Obviously it's an excuse for the shooting, but the attempts at development and gravitas (especially at the end) feel off.\n\nOnly worth getting if very cheap to free (say, as part of a bundle with several games you actually want), and most likely only worth playing if you have a gamepad are are okay with it lasting about as long as a rental.","February 13, 2015","false","4.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Then there was X-Wing Alliance. All extremely fun to play and all with good interfaces which really brought Star Wars space combat to life. We also had the Wing Commander series and its Privateer spin-offs. Great games all.\n\nPerhaps I'm just spoilt, but Starfighter was a complete letdown. The graphics were disappointing even for its time and the gameplay ridiculously simplistic. It also gives the impression that you're "boxed in" whether you're flying in open space or across the surface of a planet.\n\nWas I expecting too much because it's a Star Wars title? Perhaps. But considering what we've been graced with previously, I would've honestly expected more from the developers.\n\nFor any die-hard Star Wars fans I'd say this. It was worse than watching The Phantom Menace. For space-sim fans in general: Taking the Steltek drone on using the Tarsus in Privateer would be more fun.\n\nFor everyone else: Don't waste your time. This game fails even as a bit of cheap arcade escapism.","July 24, 2014","false","0.7"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

The game offers very little story and explanation for controls. The graphics have aged moderately well but with limited options there isn't much you can do to tweak the setup of this game. After you run a few of the missions you will have explored all this game has to offer.

Then I thought I escaped the Federation ship to discover I had entered another dimension technically still inside the ship. I was half way back to naboo when I realized the mission wasnt going to end and only half of the trade federation construction was behind me with its interior showing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/32350/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","A flawed space craft shooter\n\n\nStar Wars: Starfighter is a 3D flight simulation game developed by Lucas Arts.\n\nStory is forgettable. Set before and during episode 1, you play as Rhys Dallows a new pilot for the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps (NRSFC). After negotiations with the trade federation don't go to plan (no surprise here), you are forced to ally with a mecenary as well as a pirate to take on the seperatist threat. You also play as the mercanary and pilot. The plot is generic and predictable with no plot twists.\n\nGameplay is a mixed bag. Each level in the campaign, you start off playing as one of the three playable characters set in different areas in the star wars universe. You have primary and secondary objectives which include protecting allies and eliminating units and buildings. Failing a primary objective will end the game immediately and you are forced to restart. Secondary objectives aren't as crucial, as failing them doesn't end the game for you. However, accomplishing a certain number of secondary objectives through your playthrough will help you unlock new levels in the 'Bonus' section. You play with three different types of ships including a fighter and bomber. Each ship has different primary and secondary weapons to use. One issue I had was that you couldn't select which aircraft to use (as aircrafts are locked to the character you're playing as), which was a problem as some crafts were good while others were a pain to use (due to weak weapons and handling). Another issue was level design. Some levels were fun to play in while others (especially the last level) feel more like a chore.  Finally, the lack of checkpoints in the game meant that when you fail an objective late in a level you must restart from the beginning of the level again.\n\nGraphics are dated. The space ships look alright. However, in most levels the terrain lack detail and features. The cutscenes haven't aged well either.\n\nControls aren't good. If you are using mouse and keyboard (which most will) then you are in trouble. Your aircraft movement is clunky and difficult to turn with. Even after adjusting mouse sensitivity, I found it too difficult to use and was forced to stick with keyboard (which also wasn't good but at least I could fly with it). As such I found it difficult to move my space craft around to hunt down fighters, which hindered my enjoyment of the game. If you have a joystick, I highly recommend you use it.\n\nAs you can expect fom a star wars game, audio is great. Weapons sounds authentic, like from the movies. The soundtrack is has some familiar tunes from the films as well. Voice acting is a mixed bag unfortunately, with some characters being average while others (especially the protagonist) are lackluster.\n\nIf you are a dedicated star wars fan or interested in an average space shooter, this game might apease you. Else, find something better.\n\n\n","April 20, 2015","false","4.4"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

This game starts to show its age the more you play revealing its ugly underbelly the more its played.  There are missions where team mates you need to protect charge off into firing zones and just die.  This happens where your protecting ships and boats, they will hazardly just drive as fast as they can to their doom making it difficult to manage all the enemies.  On other levels the objectives can be unclear, such as destroy a landing pad, great what is that and where is it?  Giving your team commands such as cover me or to protect something seem to have little to no affect on what your fellow squad mates decide to target.  The end of the game is just spam, the enemy spams units, so many with such terrible AI they just crash into you alot.  Worse is when hit your ship shakes making it impossible to target whats hitting you, worse is there is no directional damage telling you what direction to move away from.  The game may be dated meaning that odd squares or other things that look like their just well a square fire and kill you, other parts the graphics are fine which is odd.\n\nTrying to like this game just ends with resentment for even wasting time on it.\nRating:  1/10  Value:  $0.99","July 10, 2014","false","5.9"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

From seeker proton torpedoes, to shield breaking ion cannons, each ship will have the same basic gameplay elements. But speed, power, and specials will affect some strategy in some way. The missions themselves are varied from training missions, dog fights, escort, defending, and search and destroy. The missions don't feel too overwhelming, but can get pretty repetitive at times.\n\nGraphics: Graphically speaking, it hasn't aged well in that department. The graphics are still "blocky" and heavily pixelated. However, for that reason, you don't need a super powerful gaming rig to run this game.\n\nSound: The sound is easily one of this game's strong points. The music is basically ripped from the movies, but fits very well. All of the sound effects fit the Star Wars universe as well. The voice acting is either hit or miss unfortunately.\n\nControls: Controls for the keyboard are a bit wonky, but are much smoother with a gamepad, which I'd strongly recomend the later. The controls are customizable, though some actions apparently can't be assigned to analog controls.\n\nI'm using my DualShock 3 controller utilizing an XBox 360 controller emulation. The zoom feature is dodgy at best, but is best used when using the brake or completely stationary.\n\nVerdict: Even with the faults, which aren't many, this game is still fun to this day. A worthy title for any Star Wars and flight simulation fan library alike.","September 30, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The targeting system can be useful at times, or just plain annoying. It's hard to tell what's your enemy and what's not if you choose to ignore the targeting. It's really a mixed bag when it comes to that. The targeting computer from the Rogue Squadron series is a bit more enjoyable. Otherwise, it's pure mindless arcade style Star Wars shooting action. Almost every Star Wars fan should drop 5 bucks on this game. The fact that it's set during Episode 1 doesn't really hurt the game, unless you just enjoy shooting Tie fighters due to pure nostalgia. There is no Jar Jar, no midichlorians, and no young annoying Anakin. Even when you go after the Droid Control Ship and Anakin blows it up, you don't hear his annoying voice once. Speaking of annoying voices, this chick who's flying with you is always screaming annoying stuff, not unlike the Rebel Marksman from Battlefront 2. The main issues with this game revolve around annoyance, and not actual gameplay issues. Bonus props for adding bonus content and a password system.\nAs a hardcore Star Wars fan, I give it a 7/10, but if you're not a Star Wars fan, the game probably falls more in the 5-6/10 range.","September 1, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is promising at first, but goes by too fast to leave any impact. You get to play as three different pilots who each hate the Trade Federation and decide to help Naboo. The pilots are cool, but, despite their enjoyable banter, and meaningful backstories, the game does not take enough time to develop their relationship, and makes their friendship seem unearned.\n\nIn 2001 the game must have been impressive, and even now you can see how good it must have looked. This is especially evident in the final mission which has you take down the droid control ship. Unfortunately, that same mission is immensely frustrating because its exiting first part is completely nullified by its second part, where an almost unbeatable boss (who remains invincible until the final stage) gets to pound you repeatedly with high damage missiles, which are hard to dodge. It leaves a very sour taste over what is otherwise a (nowadays) flawed but enjoyable game.\n\nFinally, a strange omission for a Starfighter game is a radar, which means you often don’t know where the enemies are, or can’t find the objects to defend. There’s a limited amount of replayability and some bonus missions, though whether it’s worth going through some frustrating levels again to unlock them is something I’ll leave to you.\n\nIt’s a short and disappointing ride, and makes you long for the Rogue Squadron games.\n\n5/10","February 13","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was the "Rogue Squadron" of the PS2; although, having played RS myself, they're just similar in that they are both flight games - that's it. Does that mean it's bad? No. The flight combat mechanics are quite smooth and the gameplay is quite fast. It's great in its owy way. I recommend that you use a gamepad for this game (it even recognizes an Xbox 360 controller!).\n\nAs for the story, it's setting during Episode I, although it's focused on characters that weren't in the movies. You play as Rhys Dallows (a Naboo fighter pilot with the familiar N-1 fighter), Vana Sage (a mercenary with the Guardian Mantis) and Nym (a pirate with the Havoc bomber). The characters are likable and it's a shame the story wasn't long enough to spend time with them (it's just less than 6 hours). But you also have bonus missions and you can replay the story missions with different craft (e.g. flying the N-1 fighter on Nym's missions instead of his Havoc).\n\nGiven the low price, I recommend this game if you like space or flight action games, and even more if you're a Star Wars fan.","December 24, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game provides a different view of the Naboo invasion than what's shown in the movies, which makes the story somewhat interesting.\n\nNormally I don't like flight simulations, but I enjoyed this game... when I wasn't being blown up by missiles or tanks. In the missions where you face swarms of enemy fighters (the last mission in particular) you become immersed in the dog-fighting. Also, the graphics aren't horrible either.\n\nThe controls do take a little getting used too, particularly turning/rolling (which uses E and R while A and D switch targets). Once you get the hang of things the game is fun.... until it suddenly ends. The game is short (took me <5 hours on medium) but it's an enjoyable ride nonetheless.\n\nOne other negative aspect is the final boss who is a pain with his missiles which go through your shields and his health restarts after each of the first 2 sections of the boss fight. Also, there is a lack of direction of where to go for the fight. I lost the boss in the middle of it and was flying around in a hangar area for a few minutes before seeing a passageway to go through. The boss is tough, even on easy. This boss just seems out of place with the difficulty of the rest of the game.\n\nOverall, this game is good for a few hours of fun and definitely worth the money if you see it on sale. Also, the game is good for making you dizzy and to lose your sense of up and down. All this is achieved by spaceships that seem to be able to halt and turn in an instant with no regard to speed and inertia.","June 3, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/32350/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","To be honest, I didn't expect a Star Wars game to be this short.\n\nBut I've played shorter, and as my father always told me, "It's never about the length. It's how well you do with what you've got."\n\nThat did't save Star Wars Starfighter, though.\n\nI'm supposing Starfighter is a spiritual successor to the beloved Rogue Squadron (a game I only casually played as a child), since a lot of the mechanics in the game seem similar. Flying ships, and performing various tasks for your side during a certain period of time in the Star Wars film cannon.\n\nI was honestly a little excited to play this. I always say it and Jedi Starfighter at GameStop when I was littler, and always thought that if I had enough money, I'd totally buy it. But when the time came, I ended up spending it on Star Wars Bounty Hunter.\n\nA wise decision, in hindsight.\n\nIn Starfighter, you play through the critically appraised and widely beloved... Phantom Menace... See, this game was made two years after Episode I. The designers must've thought that the hatred for this film would wear off, and people would want to play through their "favorite" moments in this "excellent" movie.\n\nWell, enough with beating around the bush. In Starfighter, you play through 14 missions across the whole Naboo-Blockade crisis, between three characters and play in their three separate ships. And the story linking the battles is incredibly dull. Nothing of any emotional weight happens. It's merely a vehicle for you to shoot mercenaries and pirates from one venue to the next.\n\nAnd for a game about Starfighting, the levels you play in are so... vapid. There's only one decent mission- the canyon mission- which has you progress through very tight canyons to new valleys in order to shoot down more enemies. And it got reused. No changes. Just more enemies, and a night filter. The rest of the levels are you piddling about, waiting for whatever next objective awaits you with little else going on. And it wouldn't be anywhere near as bad, if the flying weren't so damn clunky.\n\nTo be fair, I did get used to it. But why the hell did the developers think that players wanted the default set to first person? In a flying and shooting game? I had no idea what key triggered the change to third person until 3/4 through, and that was entirely by accident (it's ~, by the way), and when you DO play third person, it's a hell of a lot easier to control. And it's close to fun when you're zooming through the sky- or space- and nailing whatever shots you can through enemy fighters.\n\nAnd then you see another god-awful cutscene, and forget why you enjoyed this game. Seriously, the pre-rendered cutscenes look BAD. Like Just Cause 1 bad. Like it would have been better if they used the in-game graphics, bad. And the voice acting all around ranges from mediocre at best, to flat out ridiculously horrible at worst. Especially Rhys. His voice actor is trying so hard to emote with his voice, and it's so obvious I cringe everytime he speaks.\n\nWhile there are tons of things in Starfighter that I abominate... there are those few things I did enjoy while playing. Again, few things. But I feel like everything kind of averages out in the end, to a nice even 5/10.

I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nHowever, bits of it are not so well supported.\nFirst, it only goes up to 1280x1024 resolution, and no widescreen support, so you'll have to change your screen resolution manually so it doesn't stretch.\nYou have to exit and restart the game to change keyboard bindings and other settings.\nIt occasionally crashes or loads corrupted and has to be restarted.\nThe save system doesn't work. Create a second save, and it will already have all the unlocks and medals from your first save.\n\nNone of those should deter you from enjoying the game, just be aware.","May 17","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Highes available res is 1280x1024, frame rate is around 2000 on the GTX980. Cutscenes are 30fps with black frames on every other frame. Not a good port.

Waste of 6 bucks, not worth your money, if you want a good fighter simulater, play World of Airships, its free and way better than this s**t.","June 1","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play the role of Rhys Darrows, a pilot with Naboo's Royal Guard during the events of The Phantom Menace, as well as his allies-of-convenience Nym the pirate and Vanna the mercenary, and are fighting against the droid armies of the Trade Federation. For the Queen! For honor! For glory! For good old-fashioned revenge!\n\nThe flight interface works fairly smoothly once you figure out what all of the keyboard/controller commands are. The first level is a tutorial, but it doesn't specify what all of your command options are, which can be very frustrating. To configure your controls, you need to use the launcher menu that appears before Starfighter actually launches. It lets you set your control bindings to whatever you want, and at the same time does what the actual game does not: tells you everything that you are capable of doing.\n\nIf you're looking for depth of story or revolutionary takes on the Star Wars universe, Starfighter is no KOTOR. It's a campy and basic flight simulator that lets you blow up robots. It's kind of refreshing in that it doesn't focus on Force-users for a change- you're just a normal guy who volunteered for the military and got sucked into a bunch of craziness and two freelancers who really aren't interested in anything more than getting rich and getting even with the Trade Federation.\n\nHaving said all of this, I did enjoy Starfighter for what it is. It's a nice way to kill some time without having to spend hours. You go in, blow stuff up, and walk away THE HERO. Just make sure that when you're flying as Nym, you remember to pull up after you launch the Havoc's energy bombs, or the only sha'buir that will wind up dead is you.\n\n7/10, would shoot robots again.","June 3","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
