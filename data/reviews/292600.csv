"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calistus/recommended/292600/","calistus","Calistus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calistus/","804 products in account","This game treads the line between puzzle and reflex-based gameplay. The gameplay is entirely skill, so any time you get sent back to the beginning of the level, it's on you. The difficulty ramps up a little bit slowly for my liking, but once you beat Story mode, you have the freedom to play some really tough levels. On the subject of Story mode, it may look a little short the first time you fire up the game. Make no mistake - it is, but that's not what you're here for. All of Story mode is essentially a tutorial for the Epilogue, Challenge mode, Encore mode, and speedrun mode.\n\nAs a speedrunner, I feel it necessary to comment a bit more on this game's speedrun mode. In this game, speedrun mode takes you through your choice of Story, Epilogue, or Encore, and you set the pace. You get to adjust what speed you play the game at on the fly. This means you can crank it up to 200% and blast through levels you're comfortable with, and perhaps even drop it down to 100% on levels you'd rather just get out of the way. The timer keeps going if you have to restart a level, after all. I'd like to believe this means no two speedruns will look the same, but I can't say for sure.\n\nThe art isn't flashy or mind-blowing, but it is absolutely fitting for what the game is. The music, on the other hand, is excellent in my opinion. It's definitely fitting, and while it's not crazy enough to be distracting, it's still good enough that I'd enjoy listening to it while not playing the game. In fact, getting to hear the next chapter's music felt like as much of a reward as actually getting good enough to beat each chapter.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game, especially at a discount. As a side note, if you've played and enjoyed the game 140, I think you'd really enjoy Duet. If you enjoy Duet, you'd probably like 140 too.","January 2","true","6.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Switch seamless between to whatever you prefer. (Movement is digital, meaning you turn at one constant speed). (Also includes touch controls which I can’t test). I've played the Android version briefly before this, and I find that best version is on PC. Blasting the amazing soundtrack loudly, get hypnotized by the visuals on the big screen and get addicted to the challenge. The added game modes to the PC version make this a very good purchase for just $5, worth the wait.","August 4, 2015","true","7.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/292600/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionEvery now and then you come across a game so unique and elegant that you think to yourself, why isn't this more popular? Duet is a highly simplistic indie game that combines challenging puzzles with an amazing art style. Indie games never cease to break through the boundaries of game innovation and this gem will be sure to give you one hell of a ride.\n\nGameplayDuet is a game where you have to control two blobs of colour, red and blue. Imagine if you will, an invisible ring and each blob is put on the ring at a position opposite to the other. You now have control of this 'invisible ring' which you rotate in order to keep each blob from touching any obstacles in the way. Obstacles come down towards you (or if you like to look at it the other way, you are moving towards the obstacles) and your job is to rotate the circle at the right moments, in the right directions to keep your blobs safe. I used an xbox one controller to play this game, however I'm sure a keyboard could work as well.\n\nPlaying this game requires good timing and a bit of memory, as the stages don't keep changing. Failure is highlighted by paint splashes on the objects you hit, and reminds you of areas you may have messed up on. I especially loved the fact that the game didn't go to some lengthy cutscene each time you died, instead, it pretty much "rewinded the track", and put you at the beginning.\n\nEarly levels were of course simple, and mostly forgiving. The story mode gradually teaches you how to adapt to varies types of obstacles, not by some intrusive tutorial or walkthrough, but by letting the player try over and over until they make it through that particular obstacle. And it is so satisfying, to finally beat a level that required intricate movements and an unbelievable amount of concentration. You'll soon discover that your skills grow rapidly as the levels become longer and harder :^)...and there may be times you're actually too mentally fatigued to continue. But we both know you'll be back real soon, trying to get that timing just right.\n\nVisualsDuet is a beautiful game. The simplistic art style of the foreground objects is complemented so well by the 'dancing background' elements that keep the stage feeling alive and active. In fact, if there was a motion-less background, the game would feel a lot worse to play, but that may be an issue of preference.\n\nAudioCombined with amazing visuals, the music in Duet is really impressive. It has an indescribable melody which varies per level and can go from calming to upbeat in seconds. Regular sounds are well done as well, and fit the style of this game perfectly. At no point was I disappointed by anything I heard, which is quite impressive for such a simple game.\n\nSummary & ConclusionDuet is an awesome game wrapped in a simplistic package. It can go from relaxing to mind-numbingly frustrating in just a few levels and it always keep things fresh. After playing highly competitive or mechanically demanding games, sometimes you just want to find something simple to ease your mind. Duet manages to find the perfect middle ground between these.\n\n10/10 - One of the best indie games out there\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/292600/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Duet is a minimalist game that will test your reflexes. You may think it'll be a peaceful experience with the given name but... it's hard.\n\nYou control a ring with adherent blue and red balls and you have to dodge obstacles. That may not sound hard, but you can't control the balls, all you can do is rotating (of the ring). Not all obstacles are just static blocks, but they can also rotate, move, or be invisible for few seconds.\n\nThe game has a pretty good feel with the atmosphere built of minimalistic design and trance music. You just have to take a patient step towards the levels full of possible anger. Anyway, it's good to mention the developers, with the difficulty in mind, made levels shorter. Expect levels usually shorter than 30 seconds, so losing near the finish line is not so much stressful (not like in Geometry Dash).\n\nDuet, with consider for the lower price, is a nice game with overall polished design that's worth recommending to anybody who want a challenge. Great mobile port!\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 16","true","4.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

And luckily the things that made it so compelling on mobile also work well when sitting at a desk.\n\nThe closest game I can compare Duet to is Super Hexagon. They both do everything a mobile game should do: simple controls, easy to pick up and put down quickly, and minimal graphics that still manage to be beautiful. Duet does a few more things to make it worthwhile to continue playing, and because of that I believe it is a better game.\n\nIn Duet you control the rotation of two spheres: holding down the right arrow key rotates them clockwise, holding down the left arrow key rotates them counterclockwise. The only task the game gives you is to avoid the white obstacles as they fall from the top of the screen. It is much easier to understand if you see it in action, so be sure to watch the trailer.\n\nUnlike Super Hexagon, which procedurally generates its obstacles from a set of patterns, each level level in Duet is the same each time you play it. If you hit an obstacle, the sphere that hit bursts and splatters on the obstacle. The game then rewinds to the beginning of the level, and you try again. The splatter stays there, reminding you of your past failure. Once you have completed a level there is a brief pause and the next level begins.\n\nThe levels are grouped into chapters, each with a title named after a stage of grief. The beginning of each level has a short quote pertaining to the chapter you are in, and it paints a strange story as you play. Each chapter is based around a new type of challenge. They start off simple and then start combining what you learned in past chapters with what you know now. The pace at which they introduce new elements is challenging, but reasonable. I would sometimes hit a level that seemed insurmountable, but determination and perseverance have won out in the end every time.\n\nThe game rewards you with achievements for each chapter you complete. More challenging achievements exist for things like completing a chapter without hitting a single obstacle. You can also comprehensively compare how well you have done to how well everyone else in the world (or just your friends) have done. I'm hoping that some of my friends on PC will pick up the game so I can crush them on the leaderboards.\n\nIf the story mode were all there was to the game, it would be short.

And luckily the things that made it so compelling on mobile also work well when sitting at a desk.\n\nThe closest game I can compare Duet to is Super Hexagon. They both do everything a mobile game should do: simple controls, easy to pick up and put down quickly, and minimal graphics that still manage to be beautiful. Duet does a few more things to make it worthwhile to continue playing, and because of that I believe it is a better game.\n\nIn Duet you control the rotation of two spheres: holding down the right arrow key rotates them clockwise, holding down the left arrow key rotates them counterclockwise. The only task the game gives you is to avoid the white obstacles as they fall from the top of the screen. It is much easier to understand if you see it in action, so be sure to watch the trailer.\n\nUnlike Super Hexagon, which procedurally generates its obstacles from a set of patterns, each level level in Duet is the same each time you play it. If you hit an obstacle, the sphere that hit bursts and splatters on the obstacle. The game then rewinds to the beginning of the level, and you try again. The splatter stays there, reminding you of your past failure. Once you have completed a level there is a brief pause and the next level begins.\n\nThe levels are grouped into chapters, each with a title named after a stage of grief. The beginning of each level has a short quote pertaining to the chapter you are in, and it paints a strange story as you play. Each chapter is based around a new type of challenge. They start off simple and then start combining what you learned in past chapters with what you know now. The pace at which they introduce new elements is challenging, but reasonable. I would sometimes hit a level that seemed insurmountable, but determination and perseverance have won out in the end every time.\n\nThe game rewards you with achievements for each chapter you complete. More challenging achievements exist for things like completing a chapter without hitting a single obstacle. You can also comprehensively compare how well you have done to how well everyone else in the world (or just your friends) have done. I'm hoping that some of my friends on PC will pick up the game so I can crush them on the leaderboards.\n\nIf the story mode were all there was to the game, it would be short. But there is also an epilogue, several challenge levels, an endless mode, and a daily challenge. At time of writing, I have beaten just over half of the static levels in the game. Even after I have mastered all them the endless mode and the daily challenges will keep me coming back for a long time yet.","August 5, 2015","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/292600/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","Probably one of my favourite mobile games ever has come to steam and it's better than ever. Duet is a very hard game that can induce rage into you but is also calming at the same time. The concept is unique and it even has a very nice story to accompany it.\n\nDuets mechanics are something of a uniqueness that is very hard to describe but I will try my best to. You take control of two balls. Your goal is to avoid the obstacles that descend onto you. The screen rises up at a continuous rate. Your only means of controlling the characters is to rotate them arround the circle. When you press left one ball goals left around the circle and the other goes right always keeping an equal distance apart from each other. It's a concept that I have never seen done before and it does it extremely well.\n\nThe whole experience is done with relatively few obstacles. You have a few different size and shaped blocks and that is it. The difference between them is the way that they are arranged. They are put in familiar patterns and you get to learn the best technique to avoid them as you go through the game. New arrangements and obstacles are introduced periodically at a consistent rate making sure you never get bored of doing the same again over and over. Beware it is very hard. It will take a lot of practice but you will feel very satisfied when you finally figure out how to avoid that one obstacle that you've been stuck on for like 20 attempts!\n\nDuets graphics style is minimalistic but it's something that I appreciate and really enjoy. The balls are red and blue and the obstacles are white. That's about it. The balls have a very nice trail that follows them when they move as well. The only other thing is the backgrounds. To make sure the screen isn't empty the game adds a nice moving background that goes along to the beat of the music. These are very varied and can sometimes create a trippy experience for you as your trying to avoid obstacles. Their put in properly so there not too distracting but are enough so you actually notice them. I absolutely love the minimalistic graphics style and I don't think theres anything they could do differently in this respect.\n\nNow the developers could have just created a rather stale experience on this small concept. But instead they decided to go all out on the project and add everything that a game should have. What is a real suprise in duet is how they implemented a story. At the end of every level you complete you get a short quote on the screen that is showed as well as read out. It's read out beautifully also! At first they seem meaningless to you, but after a while you slowly realise that they are actually piecing together a story. It seems to tell the story of a persons life through stages such as anger, depression and then hope. It is amazing and really does give you a reason to continue on and finish each level. Some quotes are even very motivational and make you want to carry on!\n\nA good soundtrack is key in games like this. And boy does it deliver. The soundtrack is a pleasure to listen to. It's very varied sometimes being rather slow tunes and other times being upbeat and fast tunes. I believe the soundtrack is varied throughout the game to represent different moments in the story. It works really well and really makes you feel for moments of the story. Therefore the soundtrack isn't repetitive and I would love to listen to it even off of the game.\n\nMost things you would want in the settings menu are present. There are fully rebindable keys with secondary inputs as well. There are a huge variety of languages to select. In the graphics section you have resolutions, fullscreen mode, Anti-aliasing and v-sync. Only a yes or no option for Anti-Aliasing though. In audio you have options to turn music, voice and sound effects off or on. The only things I think that is missing that it truly needs is seperate audio sliders for each of these.\n\nWhat is new in the PC version though? I hear you mobile veterans of the game cry! I did a comparison on this and the only thing I could find in the PC version that isn't currently in the mobile version is speed run mode. So if you already have the game, unless you really want it on PC there might not be much of a reason to upgrade.\n\nSo what actually is in the game? Will it keep me occupied long enough? Yes is the answer to the second question. There are three different campaigns, story, encore and epilogue. Each having enough levels to keep you playing for at least 5 hours probably. You then have a lot of different challenge modes to try. These include an endless mode, daily and nightly challenges and then what seems to actually be another small campaign. Finally you have speed run mode. So yes there is a lot to keep you occupied and 63 steam achievements. So it definitely doesn't lack enough content.\n\nOverall duet is a minimalistic beauty that presents a concept and builds on it as you play to make for a fun and calming, but also rather rage inducing experience. It's a mobile port so people might take that into consideration. However it isn't noticeable that it is and it translates very well to PC. It is currently on sale for £3.99. An extremely reasonable price for the amount of content that is present. I would easily recommend this to anyone that is a fan of similar games.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system\nDon't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided a free review key by the developer to make this review.","August 5, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/292600/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Duet is a reflex arcade-style game based around a simple premise – you are two glowing spheres of ink on a circle, and you must avoid hitting any walls as you move through a level. If you hit anything, with either orb, you must start the level over – and leave a spatter of colored ink behind on the obstacle you struck.\n\nIt seems very simple. And it is.\n\nIt isn’t easy though; in fact, the difficulty rather quickly ramps up, and by the end, you’re dodging vanishing, moving walls and navigating through narrow gaps almost automatically. And still dying a lot.\n\nThe game is very much about flow – that is to say, the sensation of getting drawn up into the action of the game to the point where the game feels like an extension of you, and everything becomes focused on the game.\n\nAnd the game is very good at invoking this sensation.\n\nAfter beating the main set of stages, the game offers a variety of optional modes – including a daily challenge, as well as an infinite arcade mode and a number of additional sets of levels to further challenge the player’s ability.\n\nThe main set of levels takes maybe four hours to beat, but you can spend much longer with this game if you choose to complete all the unlockable levels as well.\n\nAll in all, the game is quite good at what it is, but it isn’t the most ambitious thing in the world; it is a very simple game, though somewhat more complex than games like Super Hexagon. Still, it does what it is trying to do.\n\nEDIT: Note that some of the optional levels are kind of a drag. In particular, resilience is a great example of what NOT to do: make an extraordinarily long level with no checkpoints which must be done in a single sitting. However, many of the other optional levels add new mechanics on top of the original ones, which adds to the interestingness of the game.","March 8","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think it is a piece of art. When you play in story mode, the levels are grouped in categories; categories with topics such as denial, depression, guilt, anger etc. In the beginning of each level, there is a little phrase about the topic of the category.\nEvery level, I thought about the levels phrase while playing. I know this will sound pathetic but it makes me think about aspects of life, as if it was a piece of art trying to tell me something. It feels like the phrases comes from a person in the game, who I am together with and converse with. Those half- philosophical conversations (which I’m making up while playing) makes me feel like I’m building up a kind of a relationship with the person – just as I would with anyone who I had such personal conversations with. After completing story mode and I began playing challenges, I actually began to think that the game became a little lonely to play without those phrases. Then I found out that there’s also phrases when playing in epilogue mode and encore mode. So there’s still good stuff to come for.\nI think this game is fantastic.","August 5, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The entirety of gameplay involves controlling 2 dots, one red and one blue, that spin in a circle while blocks fall from the top of the circle of the screen and you have to dodge them. As the game progresses, the block behavior changes; some come spinning at you, some shake violently side to side and you won't know what position they will be in until it's too late to change your trajectory, and some even go invisible a second after being on screen so it tests your ability to memorize patterns on the fly. After the main story is complete, there are two alternate "stories" to be played, one that has blocks falling at a wonky angle (it's really hard to describe, you just have to see it for yourself) and one that places you at the center of the screen with blocks coming from above and below.\n\nThe "story" moved me more than i expected. The different chapters follow the stages of grief, and the narrator is like a psychologist or best friend trying to let you know that everything will be okay. As somebody who has formerly suffered from a rather debilitating depression, this was unexpectedly moving, and quite a welcome idea in this pure of a form.\n\nAltogether I would greatly recommend this game. I got it through a humble bundle that I purchased for other games, and this was a very nice gravy addition that is well worth the full price ($2.39 is an absolute steal!) It's very clearly a small indie game, but still a fun and interesting little game to play for a handful of hours that gives a sense of satisfaction for having completed.","May 13","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tight two-button control scheme stays satisfying from beginning to end to however many extra challenges you want. Visually simple but quite nice. Music is pretty good. The "story"/narration is pretty cool, imho. It's lowkey. Probably about 2 hours to complete the game first time.

I actually had to cap my framerate at 120fps on a laptop that can just barely play TESO...I had to CAP Duet at 120fps. It was originally rendering at 400fps.\n+Beautiful and minimalistic, with optional visuals.\n+Every win feels like an accomplishment.\n+It will change your way of thinking in a beneficial manner.\n+There's more than Story mode. In fact, there's daily challenges (new levels).\n+Gamepad!\n\nMids:\n=VSync doesn't noticeably do triple buffer. You'll want VSync turned OFF.\n\nCons:\n-With VSync enabled, I noticed my music wouldn't play. Minor sound bug, and will probably be patched.\n-I beat my first run of Story mode in 20 minutes.

One mistake and you're jarringly whipped back to the beginning of the level and forced to replay it while looking at paint splatters of where you died to remind you how much you suck.\n\nIt's not a music/rhythm game as the soundtrack, which is actually very good, has nothing to do with the puzzle unfolding before you or story. Each level has a random quote that is supposed to make a "story", but it's completely incoherent and sounds like they just pushed a random button on a Dr. Phil sound board to generate each one.\n\nEach chapter adds some new gimmick "mechanic": invisible blocks, moving blocks, spinning blocks, blocks coming in at a 45-degree angle, etc. None of the new mechanics feel integrated with the music, story, or have any logical sense of progression.\n\nThe fact that there is an achievement for watching the credits succintly sums up the "not recommended" rating. If I didn't get this game as part of a Humble Bundle, I would have returned it.\n\nNote: I didn't suffer from the motion sickness that other negative reviews have commented on.","April 15","false","4.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I don't dislike minimalist styles, and it's not BAD looking, but when you only have two spheres and 3 types of rectangle in your game, I would expect them to look at least a little bit interesting. Not to mention how the constant blur effect makes it surprisingly difficult to see what's going on sometimes, especially with spinning blocks. The visuals are actually detrimental to the gameplay. The pulsing background effects are cool.\n\nGameplay: Memorize sequences of left and right presses. There is some skill involved, but it's basically just remembering how long to push left or right for various combinations of blocks. It's very unrewarding. It is an interesting rotating concept, but it doesn't deliver. Every time you mess up you have to restart the level. Levels are short and the reset takes only a second so it's not a big deal, but it's not fun. That is how I would describe the gameplay here: not fun.\nIt has a minimalist narrative which is pretty cool.\n\nAudio: This game actually has a great soundtrack, I really like the background music and when it gets going it starts to tie the game together and make it almost enjoyable. The in game sounds are lackluster. The "narration" is a nice touch.\n\nIn short: It's not terrible, not the worst thing you can buy for sure. If you just want to pay £2 to kill half an hour then it's not bad, but I wish it had been so much more. It could have been with just a little bit more time/effort/money.\n","August 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 7 of 37 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","7","37","0","0"

It sets out to do one thing, and does that incredibly well. What that is...well, check a video. That's all the game is. But trust me: it's deep.  It has a good and decent amount of variety (falling blocks...tumbling blocks...dissapearing blocks), and while all that may sound very familiar, the game is all about settling into a groove.\nThe game certainly gets hard, but it's always fair. And this isn't as much a game of getting to the end but more the experience of playing in itself (meaning: it's just as fun playing the endless mode or the daily challenges over and over again).\nMy minor gripe would be - sort of ironic - the story mode. The narrator makes it sound pseudo-psychological, but it's really just tacked on if you think about it.\nOn the other hand: the major plus: the music. It's just perfectly fitting, and probably even better than the minimalistic games I mentioned at the start.

I have found myself to like the obstacles in this game and get frustrated when I keep failing, not to say that its a bad thing. I like the game so much that I really enjoy it even when I fail, (Im terrible at games) The music is devine and sits perfectly with the game itself. It is sort of a calm tune that goes with crazy obstacles and if you were do play this in a calm mood rather than be rage quitting, it can be really fun! I recommend playing this game, even just casually as the music is relaxing for the type of game this is!

All of them had big flaws. Among those I quoted, the first one has way too hard levels and expects the player to replay a level hundreds of times. The last one is somehow stressful, and has only random levels.\n\nThis one has all the qualities any of these has, the random levels are present if the player wishes, the music is good, the controls are simple, etc. But, additionally, it has a basic story, it has lots of hand-crafted levels, and in general lots of game modes, the levels are short so that not too many attempts are necessary, some ideas seem very smart.\n\nIn all, I strongly recommend this game. It is a quality abstract game, which is quite unique.","March 23","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have absolutely no trouble with head-bob or camera-roll in FPS's like Mirror's Edge, but with all the visual effects turned on, Duet's later levels are about as nausea-inducing for me as reading a book in a car traveling on the highway: both make me a little queasy after about an hour. Obviously, YMMV, but if you're a hardcore binge-gamer that has to take dramamine to sit in the passenger seat of a car, this probably isn't your game.\n\nFor everyone else, however, Duet is a remarkably well-crafted game. In particular, the first collection of stages (called "story") is a masterpiece of minimalistic game design. The difficulty-scaling is probably the smoothest of any game I've ever played, and the length of each stage is almost perfect: just long enough so that when things go right, you can get into a groove and stay in it long enough to enjoy it, but not so long that you start to loathe returning to the beginning when you make a mistake.\n\nThat's not to say that it's never frustrating, because it certainly can be. As block arrangements become more complex, you'll sometimes find you have to rely on memorization instead of reflexes and wit, so the process of passing a stage sometimes bears a strong (and a propos) resemblance to the process of learning to play a piece of music. I sometimes wondered why I was putting up with it only to remember after watching the last red-and-blue-spattered block of the stage fall from view.\n\nAgain, however, YMMV.\n\nPersonally, though, even if I didn't find the game entertaining, it would still be worth the price. I've spent twice as much albums half as good as the OST, and the game's craftsmanship is fine enough that it can be admired even if it can't be enjoyed.\n\nEDIT: I should add that the replay value of the game is quite high. Daily/nightly challenges offer a good 15-30min of completely new material each day, and there's "endless" and "speed run" modes, as well.","March 15","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get two rotating balls through a maze of blocks. Sounds easy, right? it's not[/i]\n\nTake my word for it. This game is possibly the most testing game I've ever played. As the levels progress, they seem to get, in the words of Daft Punk, harder, better, faster and stronger. By the end of the story, blocks start disappearing before they get to you.\n\nAnd that's just the main story...\n\nThere are other modes that you might find far better. Encore (your two balls are placed in the middle of the screen and you must dodge obstacles from all sides) Endless (the game never stops, endless waves and if you die too many times in too short a time, you lose) Daily Challenge (a group of three waves that's changed every day) Speed Run (blow through the whole story as quick as you can.) and that's just like half of it!\n\nAll that said, this game isn't without it flaws. The backgrounds are EVIL. They WILL get you sick. You always have to remember that you will be looking at a row of things coming down whilst already watching a a rotating circle. Add on top of that pulsating, monochromatic, psychedelic squares and you've got a recipe for motion sickness. These can be disabled so please do that before starting.\n\nOverall, the game has more content than you think but the its not for those that get sick easy.","March 11","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sets out to do one thing, and does that incredibly well. What that is...well, check a video. That's all the game is. But trust me: it's deep.  It has a good and decent amount of variety (falling blocks...tumbling blocks...dissapearing blocks), and while all that may sound very familiar, the game is all about settling into a groove.\nThe game certainly gets hard, but it's always fair. And this isn't as much a game of getting to the end but more the experience of playing in itself (meaning: it's just as fun playing the endless mode or the daily challenges over and over again).\nMy minor gripe would be - sort of ironic - the story mode. The narrator makes it sound pseudo-psychological, but it's really just tacked on if you think about it.\nOn the other hand: the major plus: the music. It's just perfectly fitting, and probably even better than the minimalistic games I mentioned at the start.

There was no rage throughout the entire game despite numerous failures. Success felt like nothing more than a try that went on longer. The music was charming to the ears and complimented each stages tone and atmosphere, even if the stages weren’t majorly different. I found myself enamored by the words of advice before every level. Everything just came together to make a wonderful adventure.\nDuet isn't for everyone. It’s got one type of gameplay with a few gimmicks and modes, its story mode is rather short and its graphics while pretty, are very simplistic.

Playing it boosts your reflexes greatly. Narration and music, along with changing background, create unique atmosphere.\nPlayed it a lot on the mobile and now tried Steam version. And it came out that the game is very easy for me, probably because of previous "mobile training" and knowing what to expect.\nHowever, no-wallhitting achievements and perfect completions (green triangles) are taking even more effort of hands and mind: they are making you tired and require quite a lot of thinking and sometimes improvisation.\nChallenges are special levels here. Unlike story levels which get randomised only when you restart the game, these ones are randomised every time you restart a level. So going for "challenge perfect" achievement require a lot of improvisation. I think I spent about 2 hours yesterday completing trancendence II and III and thought that going for trancendence perfect was totally impossible. However, just now I began it and did it in about 20 tries, it happened to be not that hard after all. And I was rewarded not only with achievement, but also with Trancendence-IV extra hard level (a hybrid of Quickening-VI and Trancendence-III), which was totally awesome (maybe it appears when you complete Trancendence for a second time, not with perfect run).\nAlso there are time and score challenges, but I'm not really into them, so I can't say much.\nThank you Kumobius for that great game!","February 17","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have absolutely no trouble with head-bob or camera-roll in FPS's like Mirror's Edge, but with all the visual effects turned on, Duet's later levels are about as nausea-inducing for me as reading a book in a car traveling on the highway: both make me a little queasy after about an hour. Obviously, YMMV, but if you're a hardcore binge-gamer that has to take dramamine to sit in the passenger seat of a car, this probably isn't your game.\n\nFor everyone else, however, Duet is a remarkably well-crafted game. In particular, the first collection of stages (called "story") is a masterpiece of minimalistic game design. The difficulty-scaling is probably the smoothest of any game I've ever played, and the length of each stage is almost perfect: just long enough so that when things go right, you can get into a groove and stay in it long enough to enjoy it, but not so long that you start to loathe returning to the beginning when you make a mistake.\n\nThat's not to say that it's never frustrating, because it certainly can be. As block arrangements become more complex, you'll sometimes find you have to rely on memorization instead of reflexes and wit, so the process of passing a stage sometimes bears a strong (and a propos) resemblance to the process of learning to play a piece of music. I sometimes wondered why I was putting up with it only to remember after watching the last red-and-blue-spattered block of the stage fall from view.\n\nAgain, however, YMMV.\n\nPersonally, though, even if I didn't find the game entertaining, it would still be worth the price. I've spent twice as much albums half as good as the OST, and the game's craftsmanship is fine enough that it can be admired even if it can't be enjoyed.\n\nEDIT: I should add that the replay value of the game is quite high. Daily/nightly challenges offer a good 15-30min of completely new material each day, and there's "endless" and "speed run" modes, as well.","March 15","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I beat the whole story mode in little over an hour so it’s not the longest game. The visuals are simple and the gameplay centres around one thing: don't get hit.\nThat being said though, I played the entire game in a trance. There was no rage throughout the entire game despite numerous failures. Success felt like nothing more than a try that went on longer. The music was charming to the ears and complimented each stages tone and atmosphere, even if the stages weren’t majorly different. I found myself enamored by the words of advice before every level. Everything just came together to make a wonderful adventure.\nDuet isn't for everyone. It’s got one type of gameplay with a few gimmicks and modes, its story mode is rather short and its graphics while pretty, are very simplistic.

But until we're done, these things are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these levels are not ready to be finished.

Yet their strength and their speed are still based in a world that is built on rules. Because of that they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.\nNeo: What are you trying to tell me?

Now that I've picked it back up on PC, I can say that I enjoy the additions. As for the game as a whole, it was impressive back then, and it's still impressive now.\n\nIn this game you pilot two circles that travel around a ring avoiding boxes that fly down at them. It's kinda hard to describe how it handles, but it's still easy to wrap your head around. The "story mode", if you want to call it that, is based around the stages of grief, starting with Ignorance and working your way to Acceptance, with a new challenge thrown in at every stage. The story itself is told only through the level titles (named after the stages of grief) and a narration that follows you through each stage. It can elicit some feels when it all comes together at the end, but the story isn't that important. What really makes or breaks this game is the gameplay, and after beating the story, the epilogue, and the encore, I can say it's very solid.\n\nIf you've played Duet before, you'll probably get back in the saddle pretty quickly. What's new to me is the achievements and the encore stages. My only gripe is the achievements that require you to do the daily challenges a lot. I'm okay with the "not dying" achievements, even if they're a lot harder. It's just one of those challenges to hone your skills and push yourself, which is really the best use of achievements aside from suggesting alternate ways to play.\n\nAlso, the soundtrack is like audio syrup. If a difficult game (like this one) has a sweet soundtrack, that soundtrack can be the thing that keeps you from rage-quitting. Luckily, it's free on Bandcamp, so go get it, even if you don't want this game. You'll thank me later.\n\nI recommend trying the demo first. Using that to wrap your head around the movement mechanics will help you decide whether to buy it or not. The ultimate factors deciding whether you'll like the full game are whether you can figure out the mechanics and how easily you can give up in the face of a difficult challenge, both of which you'll figure out by the end of the demo. It's not Super Meat Boy difficult, but it does have teeth. Patience, hand-eye coordination, and a little determination are all you need to have fun with this game.","May 29","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
