"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/316810/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","There's two big reasons, two different types of people who play games. There are people who play video games to unwind, because they had a hard day at work and they want to let loose and not have to think, people who want to have fun without the worry of being stuck or presented with obstacles.\n\nThen there are those who love punishment, people who live to play games like Journey to Silius, I Wanna Be The Guy or the more recent Dark Souls series. Diehards who don't want their hand held and want to be beaten mercilessly over and over until they finally learn what they've been doing wrong this whole time.\n\nShadowcrypt is absolutely a game for the latter, and I'm proud to say I'm one of these deranged masochists. This is a game that presents players with a big question; are you in touch with your roots?\n\nAs the torches of the title screen begin to flicker around the ominous skull decorating the entryway the haunting chants of the intro music beckon you to the dank and dark depths of the most brutal arcade platformer I've had the pleasure of playing.\n\nShadowcrypt is all about the combat. The bleak and claustrophobic level designs of the game only lend to your unbridled focus on the task at hand. All of your attention will be drawn to the beautifully crafted sprites and their precise animations as you slash and bash your way to the heart of the Crypts in pursuit of the wicked Necromancer.\n\nOnly 4 rooms into the game my mysterious cowled hero crumples to the floor dead..again..for the third time. "I-I'll just try this again later.." I whimper to myself, tucking my gamepad away and walking away to make a sandwich to hopefully forget about this brutal game that just made me it's slave. Not even a minute later, I toss my condiments to the ground and declare "Eff that, I can do it!" and find myself rushing back to the computer where I give these beckoning crypts another go. I feel that same kind of determined spirit I held in the Famicom days.\n\nThe gameplay with it's visceral combat and the insane amount of concentration needed exceed my expectations, it's almost a little overwhelming. I've heard people call other games "the Dark Souls of 2D gaming" before many times in the past but Shadowcrypt is probably the first title I've played to actually match and truly capture the punishing and calculated approach to combat Dark Souls has, where every little move you make has a huge impact and consequence.\n\nEven more-so are the striking similarities to what seems to be the developer's hugest influence, Zelda II, from the candle finding objective needed to progress to the highly memorable and iconic shield-wielding Iron Knuckle battles that the combat here seems to inspire from heavily. It's the refreshing change of pace I've been waiting for since the golden-era of games.\n\nWhile I can see a lot of less patient players outright quitting in frustration the moment they die and are reduced to the starting 3-7dmg sword prior to a strong foe, the more retro-minded of players will remember this sort of challenge from our earlier and most important days of gaming. We'll stick with it and experience something exceedingly rewarding. You'll die often, but everytime you start again you'll feel better, stronger, and make it a little bit further. And when you do finally beat those rooms? Holy crap, it feels good.\n\nThough the system of losing your only reliable weapon will feel almost too brutal for newcomers, it's what gives Shadowcrypt the refined gameplay it has. To give a sense of real distress in every confrontation and to make death that much more consequential.\n\nThe punishing nature is extremely familiar to the first Castlevania titles where dying would lose you your chained whip, sticking you back with the puny leather alternative in the midst of a tough level. Konami in general were masters of this formula, as my other favorite series Gradius was very similar in nature with deaths reverting you back to the almost useless pea-shooter.\n\nThat fear of losing what was making me do better in those classics caused a much higher level of awareness and addiction to the game. To succeed in Shadowcrypt you will need to adapt and get into the motions of the combat. You will block, dodge, and bash your way through enemies, you will learn to stand face-to-face with your most feared adversaries. Eventually, things just start to 'click' with the player.\n\nThe game is certainly short and decidedly so. It requires a level of focus that if prolonged would just cause player fatigue on unmanageable levels. The short, sweet, and very to-the-point approach gives a lot of breathing room for the hectic and chaotic nature of the player's progression.\n\nShadowcrypt is composed of one lengthy stage or "level" roughly the size of the original Castlevania, but the amount of practice and dedication required in order to pass even a small section will have most players retrying for days before they're able to conquer nearly all of the evils within.\n\nYou will get no breaks nor will you receive any hand-holding, it's a game by the hardcore for the hardcore. Unfortunately that may drive the less strong-willed of players away, but it's that determination in presenting the game how the creator intends which is extremely admirable and is exactly what draws me to the titles I have the fondest memories of.\n\nWhen video games are developed by people who genuinely love the culture and obviously grew up with a passion for them it's always a breath of fresh air, and Shadowcrypt is the kind of game I and probably many others have wanted to play since the late 80s as kids.","September 19, 2014","true","2.9"," 62 of 76 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","62","76","2","7"

There's a subtle beauty to the game but whether or not it's worth $10 is questionable.\n\nIt's a great way to waste an afternoon but it relies heavily on the nostalgia that many indie-pixel games do, expecting players to find their own fun in a rather simplistic game is a tough call. Each room is similar, often too similar or out-right copied, flipped and filled with different enemies making it difficult to really discern where the player is going, a problem that's exacerbated by the slow movement in the game. Combat is also a slow dredge but very rewarding as each enemy has the capability to kill the player who in turn must rely on quick thinking and a few simple moves to over come a single or multiple enemies. Puzzle rooms are cleverly designed with a few simple pieces working together to create a real challenge, and the timer is a unobstructive and positive addition for potential speed-runners.\n\nIf $10 isn't a huge price tag to you, the it's a good game.

So 8-bit at its core that it takes either a very old person or someone with an aquired taste for oldschool gamedesign to really appreciate the perfect simplicity of it.\n\nHere is the deal: fight through a bunch of rooms and corridors and kick some evil necromancer in the skull. Basically, it is a sword & sorcerey short story turned game. The game itself is about the same level as first and second generation NES titles in terms of complexity. Possible actions include: attacking, jumping, shield-bashing, hanging on ledges and spear-throwing. You use this to overcome a clone-army of undead skeleton warriors and wizards, spike pits and pointy sticks on the ceiling.\n\nSounds rather sparse, right? It sure is, but being so limited also makes the game feel pretty "on point" in delivering that oldschool flavor that I still crave today, 20 years after these kind of games were dying out. You see, most games today seem to cram everything and then some into their gameplay - so much that they feel overwhelming and I end up growing tired of a game that only does everything and tries to please as many types of gamers as possible. Shadowcrypt on the other hand has super-limited scope (survive till the end, kill necromancer) and the few mechanics implemented in this game feel natural and fitting for the task at hand (basically, they help you kill stuff). There are no hidden secrets or complex mechanics, you can pick this up right away and get it. There is no meta stuff - you fight, you kill, you overcome or die trying. I just love the purity of it - this is a proper videogame! A videogame the way I remember them, not what they are now.\n\nHowever, there is a price to pay for being proper oldschool. In this particular case, variety is severely lacking and the skill-ceiling is rather low. You basically get a bunch of same looking rooms that you can learn and that won't provide much of a challenge once you figured them out. The same goes for the combat, while the shield bash seems nice - it is actually too slow and becomes somewhat unsafe if you don't have the timing down, as mentioned by other reviewers it is best to do hit and run attacks instead, rendering the shield mechanic somewhat useless. With that in mind, both shields and swords that have the ability to stun or knockback are considerably better and much more worthwhile than the types that only do damage. Yeah, there is a bit of a random element here, you get weapon drops (easily the worst part of the entire design as far as I am concerned) - I would have much prefered to get a choice of weaponry at the start of the game and fixed amounts of swings certain enemies take before being destroyed. The way it is now, you can occassionaly have a bad roll, resulting in more swings needed to take out the tougher enemies.  But once you figured that out, the only way to actually lose HP or a life is by getting impatient and not taking it slow. Since the doors of rooms only unlock once you killed everything, you can't really rush through the game either - which makes the the first ten or so minutes of the game REALLY tedious after a while. Which is actually quite horrible if you consider that game lasts about 30 minutes in total.\n\nStill, I couldn't really stop playing it and kept coming back until I beat it (which took about 3 hours in total), it's limited size really helped me getting into that "okay, one more game"-mindset and makes it a perfect oldschool-snack.\n\nTo counter the fact that Shadowcrypt looses quite a bit of appeal once you learned most of its tricks and got the layout of the catacombs memorized, the game offers a bunch of challenges/achievements that might change the way you play this game or at least make you try some stuff you wouldn't bother doing like killing wizards with deflected fireballs. Nice addition, but also very grindy and at times questionable (die 100 times in a session? Why would I want to do that!?).\n\nI think you really need to enjoy to master a game and go for the crazy challenges like not getting hit and not loosing a life to get the most out of this, otherwise this quite playable piece of software might turn stale rather quickly. I certainly wouldn't mind this being something of a first part in a series of connected snack-size retro-adventures and would recommend it to like-minded retrogamers. But heed my warning if you cannot live without customization options, desperately need RPG-elements and level ups, hate losing progress or generally do not like the idea of memorizing a game - Shadowcrypt isn't for you.\n\nFor me it is a nice addition to other excellent games in my library like Völgarr the Viking or Oniken and something I will probably return to every now and then.","September 17, 2014","true","8.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","2"

For example, one of them complains about backtracking, which was not only a minor part of the game, but is also very easy since the enemies remain dead. Is it overpriced for what it is? Sure. When I sat down seriously with the intent to beat it, I completed the game in 40 minutes. $10 seems a bit much for that, but it was a good time. The controls are simple, and they are tight. If you died, it's completely your fault. There isn't much healing, so you need to be on point. It is hard, but fair, and if you don't like that type of game, *that's fine*, but that doesn't make it a bad game.\n\nReally, the price for the amount of content is the only valid complaint. The game can be grueling and stressful, and this is completely intentional. It feels like Dark Souls when you're out of Estus and have no idea how far away the next bonfire is.

Understanding that this is by design and is meant to be adapted to is essential to enjoying and completing Shadowcrypt.\n\nThe description may sound like the game has procedurally generated levels, but it does not. This isn't a bad thing though, once you get into the game you learn to embrace it. The levels are technically non-linear, but at the end of the day, they're linear. They just involve exploration and remembering where to go; the crypt is confusing and a bit maze-like, but that's a part of the game. Getting lost in the crypt is also part of the game. You'll see.\n\nYou get three lives, and when you lose them all you start over from the beginning. A complaint I hear a lot is people saying once you lose your first life you're screwed because you lose all of your gear (which is an important part to progressing). To these people I say: Don't get discouraged! You can beat this game with the starting crappy weapons, as impossible as that may sound. If you're good at fighting in this combat-based game, you will move forward. And there will most likely be a weapon or shield drop or a treasure chest. Just keep going, don't give up!\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nThis is one of the BEST games I've played this year. It took me a long time to beat it and I appreciated the mood, the music, the excellent character animation, the sound of the dungeon doors opening and closing, and especially the challenge. It's old school and feels like you picked it up from the SNES bin at the local game store, and I love that.\n\nI'd love to see another game like this from One-bit Punch, or a sequel. I'd love to see more weapons, more levels, and more boss fights. I couldn't tell you how much money I'd pay for another, longer, more expansive version of this exact game.\n\nIt's grindy, it's retro, it's moody, it's a real challenge. I'll be playing it more in attempts to get the ridiculously challenging achievements. I highly recommend this game. 10/10\n\n","February 6, 2015","true","15.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Unfortunately it is missing a few things that would make me recommend it.  The lack of content for the price is the biggest issue here and if the game was a quarter of the price then I would perhaps look at the game differently.\n\nLike arcade games of old, death will put you back to the beginning of the game.  The dungeon is not procedurely generated, so death will mean you will be playing through the same dungeon over and over.  This isn't a problem if the level you are forced to repeat is enjoyable.  Unfortunately in Shadowcrypt, many rooms are empty and encounters are separated through backtracking which becomes tedious very quickly.  Most of my playtime was spent jumping through empty rooms that look almost identical.  More encounters and some new designs to make areas fresh would have worked wonders.\n\nCombat is quite enjoyable, certain enemies require patience and if you try to hack and slash your way through everything then you will most likely die.  Again though, lack of content means that the combat isn't as good as it could have been.  Swords and shields are great, but to limit combat to only these weapons with some slight variations based on damage is just poor.  I would have loved a staff with limited usage or a slow and heavy battle axe to crush certain enemies under their shields.  The lack of content just pops up time and time again.\n\nRepetitive encounters, environments and a focus on backtracking just make Shadowcrypt more of a chore than it should be.  At the moment it is too expensive for the content and you will be able to find much more enjoyable experiences for less money.  If you are a fan of classic arcade platformers then maybe put this one in your wishlist and wait for a massive sale.","September 9, 2015","false","12.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","2"

It has potential, but as it stands, I don't think I'd recommend to anyone.\n\nThe combat is supposed to be tight and unforgiving, but without a dodge-roll/active block, you're pretty much stuck doing hit & run/shield bashing tactics. Enemies can take upwards of 20 hits each, and are bound to hit you a few times in between, taking off precious health, which is almost impossible to replenish.\n\nYou have 3 lives to beat the entire game. Lose em, start over from scratch. Also, whenever you die, you lose all of your upgrades/pickups. It kinda sucks, especially later on.\n\nThe animations & visuals are pretty decent, and I'd have loved to see more out of this game, but it feels like the potential here is wasted a little.\n\nOverall, the game isn't that fun, and without a serious overhaul of the combat, probably never will be.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/9YsL0XDXWrY","September 15, 2014","false","0.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

It looked precise, fast, and not too complicated. I was not dissapointed. Everything in this game is very precise; jumping, attacking, ducking, and bashing. To put it simply, this is very much a game where you will only die if it is your fault. So far the game has been very fair, but still difficult.\n\nThis game is not randomly generated rooms. It does not advertise randomly generated rooms. Every playthrough will have the same rooms with the same enemy and trap placement. The only thing random about this game is the item drops and on-hit modifiers. Some people might want randomly generated rooms (and it is appealing to subsequent playthroughs for some games) but this game is in the mindset of Legend of Zelda II, Castlevania, and classic arcade games. Every encounter is carefully crafted, not generated.\n\nThe combat is precise, simple, satisfying, and difficult but fair. When you are not moving or attacking, your shield automatically blocks hits. Enemies can do damage to you with attacks or by walking into you. If enemies didn't deal damage from walking into you the game would be very easy. Some enemies have no good way to counter you if you just duck and stab. Ducking doesn't let you shield bash, but dodges high attacks and blocks low ones, making you extremely defensive. If they couldn't walk into you to deal damage, every encounter would end with you ducking and stabbing their ankles to death while taking no damage. Doing hit and run tactics by constantly running and stabbing is sort of viable, but not nearly as fast, satisfying, or viable as just keeping enemies back with a shield bash. It's the superior tactic. The javelins help in terms of dealing damage from a range, but you have a limited supply and they don't deal a lot of damage. Attacks and shield bashes hit all enemies in front of you which helps make groups manageable, though so far I haven't had more than two people attack me at once. Again, if you take damage in combat, you only have yourself to blame.\n\nThis game does not advertise itself as an RPG or a rogue-like. It is very much an action game, and a very tactical, precise one.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice, but nothing special. You trek through a fairly standard dungeon with nice pixel graphics and a fitting soundtrack. It's decent, but nothing to scream about. The pixel lighting is very nice though and adds a whole lot, though.\n\nEDIT:\nSimply playing the game for a bit longer showed me what each element and shield does. Fire for damage, ice for stun, and lightning for knockback and piercing javelins. Defender has a chance to stun, Avenger for damage, and Hammer for extra knockback. It is a fairly short game, but a fun one that I can see myself replaying a lot. The only thing that takes away from this game is it's relatively short length and everything that comes along with that. The story is minimal, but not really important in this type of game. If this game was ever expanded or used as a basis for another game, I would like to see pretty much more of everything. More kinds of enemies, more traps, more weapons, more elements, more shields, more rooms, and more areas. The number of these things in Shadowcrypt itself suffices for its scope, but there really is only room for improvement.","September 16, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

Buy if you're into skill games or games with character. I love that the enemies are random in their attacks. That makes the combat fresh every time for me.

I played it a little before getting a refund for it.\n\nI like the difficulty and the general idea of the game, but the advertised non-linearity, as said in other reviews, just leads to lots of running around aimlessly. Which is even more awful given the repetitive design. It's not like you're aimlessly wandering around through beatiful and unique landscapes. Which makes it even harder to remember which door you took last time and which you have not tried yet.\n\nThe combat is ok. I really hate it, though, when I am locked into an animation in a game where very quick reaction times are asked of the user. If I cannot attack because I might have to block an enemy attack which may or may not come, all the while the enemy moving in on you (which is bad because you lose health if an enemy runs into you without even attacking) makes for some really frustrating experiences.\n\nThen there is the absolute randomness of drops that may make the game really easy or really hard, purely depending on your dropluck. You can get a 12dmg sword off the very first super easy enemy and then breeze through the game for quite a while or be stuck with your starting sword, finding it almost impossible to beat harder enemies who have absurd amounts of health. Which also ties in with the terrible decision to make you lose any swords/shields you have picked up when you die, basically dooming you.\nItem drops should get progressively stronger as you progress through the game and you really should not lose the items you gathered when you die. That's just a super bad design move as it leaves you with barely any damage on enemies with extremely high health later in the game.\n\nI may pick it up again when it's a lot cheaper than the 5€ I got it for on the sale, but I'd really appreciate some changes to the game to make it a little more friendly. The game is hard enough through the combat patterns and limited lives. You don't have to ♥♥♥♥ people over even harder by stripping them off their gear on death and way too slow attack/shield bash animations.","June 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A good retro feel, but in no way low budget.\nGameplay: Combat is quite simple, but overall extremely challenging.\n\nThe multitude of weapons with different effects, aren't always just "better". This forces you to choose between them, which is nice.\n\nSo... what is missing? Oh yeah, I'm not having fun! The extreme difficulty means you will go back to the beginning a hundred times at least. This would be fine, if not for the fact that the levels NEVER CHANGE. You go through the beginning stage again and again, and after a while it just stops giving you any satisfaction.\n\nAlso, you have three lives, and you can pretty much die four times before getting a game over and going all the way back. But you know what? You might as well just have 1 life. Because the fist time you die, you immediately lose the weapons you picked up thusfar. And when that happens, your (ahum) butt is grass. You might as well restart. The further you got into the game, the more this is the case.\n\nI've heard someone say to not be "discouraged by this", but honestly; the ONLY way you can beat the rest of the game is by killing all the enemy in extremely cheap ways. Waiting instead of skillfull fighting, and some room lay-outs make even THAT impossible. That, I'm sorry, I cannot see as a good gaming element.\n\nIn the end; this game, I feel, does not use it's full potential. It would do the creators very good to take a page out of the "Binding of Isaac" game mechanics, where every time you restart the game a new stroy is ahead of you. Intead of what i can only discribe as a tedious waste of potential.\n\nI will not recommend this game, BUT if you are into hardcore challenges, like retro games and don't mind the repetition, I would tell you to buy this.","June 19, 2015","false","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Speaking of slow moving, your character barely has a brisk walk going on which draws this game out.\n\nCharacters are overpowered for just being skeletons, and the game repeatedly gives you items you do not need.\n\nWhen you die, you start with basic equipment, meaning you'll be stabbing an enemy over 30 times just to kill it. Shields aren't explained as far as their abilities go, and the repetative enviroment dulls the entire experience, not to mention the lackluster music and sound design.\n\nSave yourself some money and skip on this poor excuse of a platformer.

Your ability to progress is at least somewhat tied to what drops you're lucky enough to get. And then when you ultimately die (which will happen a few times, the game isn't straight up pick up and play), you have to trudge through the exact same corridors.\n\nThat aside, the game has great atmosphere, and the combat is quite rewarding, in a similar way to Dark Souls. Perhaps the enemies could telegraph their attacks a little bit more, but if you mess up it's usually the player's fault (except that their power is tied to the RNG gods).\n\nLuckily the game is quite short, so it's not as if you'll lose hours of progress upon death.

It's like standing on trying to reach a nice bowl of ice cream at the other end of a room that has lego scattered all over the floor and you left your shoes in some highly inconvenient place. The only difference is that I'm entirely sure what flavour of ice cream is at the other end, if there even is any ice cream there. I'm endangering my poor little feet purely for the hope of ice cream that might not even exist.\n\nThis game is ♥♥♥♥ing punishing. It's difficult for the sake of being difficult in an attempt to be a throwback to the years of the NES. However, is the pain you're putting yourself through really worth it? That's hard to say.\n\nShadowcrypt is stupidly difficult but also rather addictive, if you enjoy a challenge. You'll get a few rooms in and die on your last life, so close to the door that could very well be the last room in the game. I haven't finished it (I played mostly on the exe before realising I had a Steam key), but I keep coming back for more, hoping to strike lucky and get to the end. The problem is that while there is skill involved to beating it, there's also a desperate need for luck. Swords and health drops are rare and I pity the poor soul who's sat next to me whenever I end up getting spears instead, which seem mostly useless bar the odd situation or two.\n\nThis game is punishing and it's difficult to recommend as it does feel pretty unfair to play at times. The enemies take way too many hits; too few wouldn't make for much of a challenge, and the high health certainly does create challenge, but it feels very artificial. I think that maybe enemy health has been nerfed on the steam version in comparison to the exe version I played, but it stills seems a little too high to feel comfortable with.\n\nRegardless, I would recommend this to fans of Dark Souls and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who enjoy a challenge. It was fun to pass this around to my friends and see who could get the furthest, but it loses its appeal when you die for the 500th time by being knocked off a tiny ledge by an archer whilst dodging pike traps.
