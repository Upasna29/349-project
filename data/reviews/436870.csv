It‚Äôs a fun shooter with plenty to offer. It‚Äôs ‚Äòinspired‚Äô from NES classic ‚ÄúBattle city‚Äù, even though it‚Äôs different it still has elements from that game. It has some RPG elements too in which you can upgrade certain things in your tank. These upgrades really do matter and can be used strategically to win a certain level you‚Äôre unable to beat. Power-ups, hard levels and bosses will keep you coming back for more and more. Game can also be played in co-op mode locally\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game looks gorgeous and colorful. Different stages have different themes like Jungle, Sahara etc. The game is based on Unreal engine. There‚Äôs not many graphic options to configure, only ones available are post processing (includes anti-aliasing and depth of field toggles), resolution and fog. Considering this is a top down shooter that‚Äôs not really a problem.\n\nSound:\n\nThe sound is average in this game, the soundtrack wasn‚Äôt too amazing but it was not boring by any means as well. The sounds for explosions and hitting enemy are spot on. Overall not too bad sound though lack of sound adjustment sliders is not good. You only have the option to turn the music on or off, there is no slider to adjust volume which can be a pain as I had to alt-tab out and lower volume from windows.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThere are 23 total levels In the game and they get harder as the game progresses. Later levels can be really challenging but not too hard as to discourage players. Each level you beat earns you a point which you can use to improve your tank. There‚Äôs 5 upgrades in total which are tank speed, damage, bullet speed, life and point rewards. The life and point rewards become useful when you hit a certain number of upgrades invested into them e.g the life upgrade will give you an extra life when you have 5 points invested into this tree. Same with Rewards if you invest 5 points you‚Äôll gain 2 points instead of 1. The other upgrades however can be incremental in each point. Though they still have perks or reaching a certain number of points in the damage, speed and fast bullet upgrades. If you upgrade speed with 10 points you gain a frontal crusher. If you upgrade damage with 7 points you will gain explosive ammo and if you upgrade fast bullets with 7 points you will gain a rechargeable beam-like power shot.\n\nYou can customize this upgrade tree at anytime and this is where the strategy part comes in. Being able to adjust your tank for each level you can easily customize your tank according to that specific level. Boss too fast? Just upgrade your tank speed for that level, Boss is a bullet sponge? Simply upgrade damage or bullet speed. These upgrades come very handy for later tougher level.\n\nEach level requires you to kill off all enemy tanks and in some levels you have a base which you must protect. If the enemy destroys your little base you‚Äôll have to restart the level. In my opinion those levels can get annoying as later game can become a bullet hell with lots of tanks shooting at you. You have to protect yourself and your base which can sometimes cause frustration. The levels also have destructible environments, these blocks can be destroyed and a path can be made, enemy fire also breaks these blocks. There‚Äôs also a death meter which tells you how many times you have died.\n\nThere‚Äôs many types of enemy tanks, your good‚Äôol pawn tank which can be killed with one bullet, the stronger armored tanks, the speedy tanks and faster bullet tanks, super fast tanks with spikes etc. As the levels progress these tanks also get stronger and require more damage to be killed. The bosses are also interesting and require you to be patient and make a strategy to kill them.\n\nThere are in-game power-ups and weapons. One such power-up is bombs which can be picked up and thrown and can be exploded on demand. Although when you have placed a bomb you cannot shoot as the bomb explode button is the same as your shoot button so when you press the shoot button the bomb will explode and then you can shoot normally. Another power-up is these tiny friendly tanks which can tag along you once you run over them. They follow your tank and shoot randomly in any direction they want. Sometimes they can also get you killed as they open up these destructible blocks where you intended it not to be opened. There are also pick-ups, one of these pick-ups is the bullet time effect where time slows down for the enemies but you carry on your usual speed. Another one is the shield. These run out within a few seconds.\n\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 6/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nVery fun arcade-type tank shooter. It has some RPG elements and overall a very fun experience. Fans of Battle City on NES should like this, it‚Äôs sort of a different approach to the genre but very fun nonetheless.","April 30","true","1.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

This is just a generic tank shooter. It doesn't even have the power ups from the original or the fun level designs. Instead you get to upgrade your tank stats by 1 after every fight, amazing.\n\nAlso I have a feeling these other reviews which are praising it are made by the developers or their friends, they don't seem geniune or don't make much sense because this game is absolutely nothing like the original, Battle City\n\nDo not waste your money on this if you think this is like Battle City","April 25","false","0.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","10","15","3","0"

So far I've beaten the campaign and I must say it's quite a challenge! I find some of the bosses pretty tricky to beat but I like their design! The graphics are pretty decent! It's like you guys took the original Battle City and ramp up the graphics, music, and gameplay up to 11!  I also love the upgrades and those pick ups! There's a lot of variety with each new level and the customization is really cool! I recommend this game to those who love those classic games like Battle City and Tank Force! I'm currently doing survival and see how far I can get! I'm also looking forward to the customizeable level editor! That would be so cool! It would be like the classic Battle City! This game took something I like and brought something new! So it's like nostalgia but also a fresh new take on it!","April 28","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Updated gameplay with upgradables, tougher enemy and good graphics.\n\nTougher enemy towards the later levels, and tougher map situation too will surely give you a challenge.\n\nI tried Survival too and it's harder than you think. Haven't found any glitch and exploitables yet though :) Game is also stable to run.","April 22","true","5.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
