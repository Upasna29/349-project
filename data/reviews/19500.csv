Sure do wish I could see more of it.  Unfortunately, the cursor that is used for shooting on the only available level does not respond to the mouse movements;  it merely jitters about while the character moves back and forth.  I dig the painted, whimsical art style.\nThis should not be for sale anymore.  It's been out since 2008, and hasn't had any fixes (that I'm aware of).  I just tried playing it again, to little avail.  Fell through platforms and couldn't hit much with the shoot-wherever-lady.\nEternity's Child is truly broken, and could not only use a re-visiting by the developer, but it probably needs to be taken down entirely from this and any other store.  I can't believe the $4.99 price tag on it.  I highly recommend you don't, either.","June 29, 2014","false","0.6"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","45","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/19500/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Eternity's Child is an indie platformer made by unknown studio Silver Sphere. The story revolves around... I don't know. The game starts with an intro in form of wall of text that is scrolling, and it's scrolling pretty fast, you won't get enough time to read it.\n\nSo, let's speak about the story as how I felt it through the gameplay. You're something between bunny and elf, with emo bat-elf friend who is shooting laser balls. You are jumping through unique grotesque world full of weird mechanical enemies that are evil. To save the world, to get a heart of your lovely bat-elf and... whatever, you just collect gems with your girlfriend and shoot at mechs.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's praiseworthy the developers put their time into their own engine but it's not much praiseworthy that it plays terrible. You control movement with keyboard, shooting with mouse, nothing surprising, but the whole movement and jumping feels bad - you are now sure of platform edges and objects react with a lag.\n\nThough the game is not even finished (and don't expect it'll ever be), it offers several levels that will make you ask your conscience for not doing anything else. It also has a level editor (beta), but I must admit, I didn't dare to try it.\n\nIf Eternity's Child was supposed to be an art project (with removed gameplay), it could end up being pretty nice and interesting "experience". The environment feels weird but that's definitely something positive I can tell about the game. Sadly, there is also some confusing visual design on places - there'll be too many things on the screen and you won't be sure what's supposed to be platform (to jump on) and what's just on the background.\n\nConclusion:Overall, this is one of the worst platformers I've played lately, it has terrible gameplay and unfinished content. Unique visual style can't save it when everything else is bad. Don't even think about buying it.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 26","false","0.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Don't let the fabulous artwork fool you, this game will bore you, infuriate you, or both, depending on your patience level. Also, if you're like and thought the story sounded intriguing, know that it's barely present and features deeply pretentuous, unengaging writing that will have you ignoring it pretty rapidly.\n\nIt's rare to see an indie game this disastrous actually get released. What's galling is that with a lot of polish it could have been something special, but it feels like the designers ran out of time, money, or patience and just threw it into the marketplace.\n\nNo matter what you're looking for, this game will disappoint you.","December 8, 2013","false","0.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

First: Who are these characters? What is going on with the story? IS there a story?? I found there is supposed to be a plain text crawl explaining the story & characters of this game (a lazy move on part of the designers there, one of many), but when the game starts, there is no such thing. Everything you do has no context as to why you're doing it. The bubbles that slowly describe the game's few controls on the first stage are so slow that you're trying to read these things as you're endlessly shooting stuff that wants to fly right into your face and at weird angles, even for a platformer.\nThe controls are a total mess, you slide off platforms if you don't angle your blurry jumps just so, if you can see where you're jumping that is. The camera likes to stick on your character's position in such a way that you are often jumping blindly into who knows what, more likely than not, it's something that will kill you. Jumping is iffy at best with having to learn the trick to getting a decent jump without slipping off edges or even getting to a higher up platform. This would be fine if there was a way to grab platform edges, there isn't.\nI don't understand the point of having two characters to worry about if the one you actually move doesn't do anything else but that, the flying girl shoots at enemies & nothing else. This is really unnecessary & could have been done better with just one character doing these things.\nMany, many sections of the game, both while playing & in the menus, appears to be either really buggy, unfinished, or both. I'm betting on both. Even for an episodic game (which I can see why the sub-sequent chapters never saw daylight), there should have better effort on cleaning this game up, at least so someone knows wtf is going on when they start playing. Again, an intro would have been nice here. Another odd happening is that I got a totally different level 3 on later playthroughs, sometimes happening before I was done in the last area. No warning, just a new level out of nowhere. I even fell through solid walls a few times.\nI can say good things about the art style of this game, it's vibrant, pretty to look at & a gothic sort of cute. It's pretty much ruined by the camera motions & animation style they used in this game; very bland, lifeless & marionette-like. Plenty of other games pull off a 2-D world with life & emotion, why didn't this game?\n\nSeriously, save your money. Maybe buy this as a gag gift for a friend if it's on sale for $1. Try the buggy demo, but do -not- pay money for this disappointing and unfinished fragment of a game.","January 3, 2014","false","1.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The enemies are very overwhelming and hard to kill which is only more frustrating when you have to worry about dificult platforming. The level sometimes glitches out and doesn't end so you are stuck there until you lose all your lives.\n\nI would have liked more context. Every level seems to be be "collect 2 gems" having no idea why collecting a gem is worth risking your life against a hundred enemies. It's a very pretty world made with a lot of care but I would apreciate it more if I felt I was doing something there.\n\nIt's also impossible to tell if you are damaging an enemy or they are immortal. Some enemies will follow you forever and take about 30 seconds to kill so you are forced to shoot anything you encounter for at least 30 seconds to find out if they can be killed. It is also very unfair since enemies will pop out of the ground beneath you making their attacks undodgeable and the platforming often has very little logic to it meaning a lot of trial and error and cheap deaths.\n\nIt's not unplayable but there are too many issues for me to recommend it.","September 3, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The jump physics are floaty and hard to control. The camera is sticky and often forces you into leaps of faith. Platforms are arranged with no rhyme or reason, and it's often visually ambiguous where you can stand and where you can't. Enemy AI makes no sense: sometimes swarms of enemies will gleefully dive-bomb you from off screen, and other times the same enemy types will sit perfectly still, ignoring you as you shoot them. You have health, but levels are mostly made up of insta-death pits. The story mocks itself and the game's arbitrary mechanics right from the first level. Even more embarrassingly, the first thing you see in the game is the fact that two-thirds of the game's content (the second and third acts) are listed as "Coming soon!", despite the game having been released seven years ago (as I write this). It doesn't matter what price point this game is offered at, there is no enjoyment to be had here.","March 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
