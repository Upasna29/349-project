"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/421040/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Plantera is a casual clicker game that was released in January 2016, being developed by VargatP. You build your own garden and watch it grow before your own eyes.\n\nGameplay is really simplistic; you grow plants and reap the rewards by selling the crops. You get a bit more money, so you grow another plant, so on and so forth. You collect your crops by clicking on them, hence why this game is classified as a clicker.  The gameplay may sound quite boring to most, but it is strangely addictive. Not only do you have the option to grow plenty of plants, but you can also raise life stock to grant you additional funds as well. This life stock will also attract predators to your garden; you can either deal with the wolves and such on your own by clicking on them to make them run away, or hire guard dogs to do the deed for you.  As you grow more and more in your garden, you will eventually run out of space; meaning you need to expand your garden.  Your garden doesn’t stop growing and making you money when you quite the game though – you have helpers that will gather your harvest for you, meaning the majority of your money will come through downtime. Personally, I load up this game on a daily basis, to collect my gold, build a few new plants and then log out again.\n\nDo not let my play time deceive you; I have been playing this game every day since it was released in January, but only for five minutes a day. That is all you need to get your fix and to continue growing your garden.\n\nGraphically, Planter has a cute look to it, with some childlike character models in the farm animals and predators that break into your garden. The animations are simple but so beautifully done as well. This game is so colourful. The sound track is also one of the most gleaming features of this game; it’s so beautifully crafted and horribly catchy that you’ll be whistling the tune all day.\n\nThere is no difficulty to this game, you cannot fail and there is no real win state either. The aim is to simply grow your garden at a pace which suites you.  The majority of the achievements don’t really require any skill; you will unlock them with time and patience.\n\nPlantera is a simple, yet brilliant game. It holds a special place in my daily Steam routines of loading it up and harvesting my crops, along with a handful of other clicker games such as Adventure Capitalist.  It is so perfectly priced too at a measly £1,99. You have nothing to lose by picking this game up!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/perrydotto/recommended/421040/","perrydotto","Perrydotto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/perrydotto/","815 products in account","I really wish I could give this one a neutral rating or something, because it's certainly not a bad game, it's just not exactly good, either.\n\nI generally enjoy cute clicker games and this one comes with legitimately lovely graphics and music. The production value is very decent for a game of its price, and I had my time of clicking and looking and just generally enjoying the adorable atmosphere.\n\nThe real issue is that even for a clicker game, you just don't get anything out of it. There is no sense of progression and no rewards for longterm play. I like seeing numbers go up, but even for a skinner box it feels barebones. No additional mechanics are introduced and no new exploration can happen. Once you've seen the basics, you've seen it all, because there is nothing really beyond basics. And for a non free to play game, that just feels too shallow.\n\nI think the developer is worthy of support and clearly knows how to make a cute, pleasing game, but it just ultimately fails at really being much of a game. Unless this gets some substantial expansion to the gameplay, I can't really recommend it as a purchase. Keep an eye on the developer, but definitely be critical with your purchase. With this game, you're not getting a whole lot even for the low price of admission.","March 8","false","2.7"," 50 of 64 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","50","64","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinkfiree/recommended/421040/","pinkfiree","PinkFire :3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pinkfiree/","985 products in account","Published by: VaragtP\nDeveloped by: VaragtP\nGenre: Casual, Indie, Simulation, Family-friendly\nRelease Date: 29 Jan, 2016\n\nCreate, expand and watch your garden grown in this super addictive and totally adorable casual clicker game.\n\nIntroductionPlantera is a simple and highly addictive clicker game, where the basic objective is to build and expand your own garden. As your garden grows, you collect more coins which allow you to further boost your garden (and coin collecting efficiency). Boosters can be bought with the coins, which allow higher value of produce, collecting coins when the game isn’t running for larger periods (I can currently leave my game for 12 hours, and come back to a large sum of coins waiting for me!), and guard dogs and scarecrows to scare away the critters trying to steal your produce! Though I’m not generally a fan of clicker games, I have really enjoyed Plantera thus far.\n\nGameplayThe general idea surrounding Plantera is that you build a garden, collecting coins in order to buy more land, more plants, animals and boosters whilst warding off the critters trying to steal your produce. As you collect more coins you are able to expand the land, thus expanding your garden size and capacity. As you expand land size, you obtain more helpers; round little blue creatures whose job it is to harvest plants and collect said coins.\nPlants, bushes, trees and animals can all be placed in the garden to earn coins, and you can also manually click on butterflies and moles to gain even more (the helpers cannot collect these).\nLeveling up will unlock different varieties of plants, bushes, trees and animals to add to your garden, and with every purchase of these, the price of each rises.\n\nControlsThe controls are very simplistic. As it is a clicker game, you basically do just that; click. The only time you will need your keyboard is when your garden has expanded in size enough that you need to navigate from one side to the other.\n\nSoundtrackWhilst the upbeat soundtrack fits in very well with the game, it is very repetitive (it’s just the one song played over) which can get a little dull after a while.\n\nGraphicsI absolutely adore the graphics. The colours used and the cute little cartoon creatures all tie in perfectly with the game’s theme.\n\nReplay ValueThough I’m not sure if there is a maximum level (I’m currently level 67), I do believe the repetitive nature of the game may leave little replay value when a certain level is reached.\n\nDifficultyThere is no real difficulty in Plantera; it would be appropriate for all age levels and skill levels respectively. The whole expanding process is fairly linear, thus leaving little room for fail; ie, you will essentially just keep earning coins and progressing no matter how you play it.\n\nOverall VerdictA reasonable amount of interaction is needed when you first play Plantera, as you start with a blank garden and very few coins. Once you are able to build it up to a reasonably large size, you will be able to let it idle and check on your progress from time to time, which I think is a definite advantage for the casual player. How involved you wish to get is completely up to you; either click away and earn the coins yourself, or leave it up to your helpers, checking in from time to time to keep the progress going. There are limited variations as to what can be bought currently (4 each of plants, bushes, trees and animals), but that doesn’t affect the gameplay for me personally. The devs are continuing to add to the game which is fantastic.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10","February 8","true","13.8"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","39","50","2","5"

Yet this time, its spicier than any clicker game you have ever seen! It looks cute and it is!  Tho, what's up with those cyan purple guys? They look dead inside.  Haha, jokes  aside this is a really cute and addicting clicker game! All clicker games are addicting but oh man, this is by far the most addicting one!\n\nGameplay\nYou start out with one worker and start building up your estate with some carrots and the first critter you encounter trying to steal your carrots! Don't get scared.. you can bash that rabbit and keep it away from your carrots! An amount of interaction is needed at the beginning of the game as you start planting all kinds of fruits and vegetables, as you will attract all sorts of critters like the rabbit as mentioned, the crow and the mole. Once you reach the animal stage, you'll encounter the fox and the wolf, the point when you need to be really careful if you have no dogs to guard your sheeps and pigs. After you expanded the land enough and you have a nice amount of workers you should put a dog then some more so you can have them guard around while you are away.\nFurthermore, there are upgrades like idling and a multiplier for the cash. Both are really important and the base for your economy. Investing in those two will grant you a nice income and you'll get money in no time if you go away and idle.\nGrind all the cash and level up, you'll get stars to the plants and animals which will boost the economy some more.\n\nGraphics\nExtremely cute and detailed, aesthetics surely to keep you looking at them for a long time!\n\nOST\nThe soundtrack is as well cute and it fits exactly to the farm theme, while the sound effects are great too!\n\nPros'n'Cons\nPros\n\n+Cute take on the clicker genre\n+Addicting\n+Frequent updates\n+Le grinding\n\nCons\n\nAbsolutely none\n\nShould you buy it?\nIf you're a fan of the clicker genre and love cuteness, this is your cup of tea!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group","February 3","true","6.4"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","37","49","5","1"

Once the achievements are complete, there really isn't a reason to play. The game lacks customization features. I believe it could improve with having a quest system or more achievements. I know it's meant to be "casual" but it doesn't have to be a one time thing, especially when you pay for the game. The price is extremely fair for what you get, personally I wouldn't mind paying a litte extra because it is a unique game.  I feel it is fun when you are first starting out, but for long term no. I love the cuteness of the characters, the music is repetitve, but not annoying like other games. So, once I have all the achievements unlocked, I'll put my game down.  I  look forward to seeing more updates because  it has a lot of potential, I would love to see more content, so for now I reccomend it.","May 4","true","77.1"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

The game features cute music, cute animals and basically a well fun clicking game which can sort of get addicting.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game features sort of 8-bit type graphics with bright colorful art-style. No big problem with FPS and it was generally running at 60 FPS for me all the time. The game is not that heavy on the graphics so you can play it on even old pc’s or pc’s without the latest graphics cards.\n\nSound:\n\nThe game has a cute theme track though it can get pretty old. So some variety would be nice but it was happy cheerful music which goes well with the game theme of happy animal/gardening type game.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf like me you’re a fan of Clicker games, this game is very fun.  You start off with nothing on the screen except 3 butterflies which you (kill? I really hope our blue creature doesn’t kill those butterflies), so you get 1 coin from each butterfly. Once you have the 3 coins required to purchase your first plant you can start the game. You buy the carrots plants and your farming (no pun intended) begins. So basically you earn coins and build trees and plants and animals using coins.\n\nOnce the plants and trees are built the vegetables/fruits start to grow, animals start doing their thing which is laying eggs etc. When the fruits and vegetables grow full, you can go ahead and click them to either pull them from the ground if they’re a ground plant type or tear them away from the tree. A second click on the fruits/vegetable/animal products will collect them and give you coins. You gain levels by earning more and more coins and new plants/trees/animals get unlocked as you progress to new levels. All sorts of animals and plants and trees are available. E.g. apples, pears, carrots, pumpkins, turnips, chicken etc.\n\nEvery time you buy something their price goes up just like usual clicker games. There will be cute rabbits, birds and foxes trying to steal your fruits which you can prevent by clicking on them. Every once in a while a gopher will appear from the ground and you can click on it to earn a bit of extra coins, same with lady bugs which give you a lot of coins. There’ also a knight cameo and he runs across the screen and you can click on him multiple times to earn coins. The game also farms offline so if you quit the game and log back in later you’ll have a bunch of coins. The game will automatically save frequently so you won’t lose your progress.\n\nThere are upgrades available such as a scarecrow and guard dog which will help you get decrease the fruits/vegetable stolen by foxes, birds etc. Another upgrade is the alarm clock which will make your blue creature work faster. Another upgrade available is the multiplier which will increase your coins earned to double the amount and lasts forever, so this upgrade should be bought whenever you can. You can also purchase additional land and extend your garden. Though it’ll keep increasing in price every time you extend. A short gameplay video can be found below.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695454628\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nSound: 6/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nA very exciting and fun clicker game. Very casual, family friendly and fun game where and you don’t have to worry about a thing and just click away. This can also help if you’re stressed and just want to relax. I highly recommend this game, as a fan of clicker games this game is a must play.\n\n\n","June 1","true","22.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

My main complaint, is that its a bit too 'minimalistic', or maybe a better way to put it is that Plantera is very hands-off. A great majority of my time is just having it run in the background (like while I write this review). A good clicker game baits you in and gets you playing, like in the later stages of AdVenture Capitalist. Its fun, none-the-less.\n\nThe only caveat to my review is that you should know that I don't play free games (other than AdVenture Capitalist), so I can't compare to any of those. Three bucks is so little, that I am going to give this a thumb's up. Its polished and gave me at least an afternoon of entertainment.\n\nPros:\n+Cute graphics\n+Plays in the background\n+New mechanic of baiting you back - you purchase an upgrade for how many hours it will play before it stop and you need to come back to collect or production shuts down\n\nCons:\n-There is not enough dragging me into the game - I just need to let it run in the background after the first 2 or 3 hours of playing actively (I get that this is the basic premise, but it needs tweaking IMO)\n-Too simple like most clicker games; this could do with some complexity (see Idle Civilization for how this can be done)\n-Music is great, but very repetitive\n-Could do with a lot more content if it is going to be so simple (I know they are still adding, so good on them)\n\nNothing new here, but it is still a good deal of fun for three bucks.","April 21","true","8.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

It's a clicker game, for sure, but it goes a bit deeper than that.\n\nPremise: This is your garden (though I suppose farm is more accurate). You put down crops and the only thing you need to do to take care of them is sit and watch. That's it. You can harvest fruit, vegetables, and various things from your livestock, as well as shoo off wild animals, but that's all option. You could "play" this game by doing nothing more than plopping down plants and animals when you've got the coin for it, because you have Helpers who do everything else for you. Albeit, slowly. It's very simplistic.\n\nGame play: You can do everything I mentioned above with a click of your mouse. There's no need for your keyboard here.\n-You level up as your Helpers (or you) gather from your garden and it's denizens. In the typical iOS game style, you can buy little powerups with in-game coin that extend the amount of time your Helpers work when you're logged out and the coin multiplier for your profits.\n-You can also buy little, panting canines that bark at garden invaders and scare them off. These pests will disrupt your animals or steal your crops, but are otherwise harmless. The leveliling up allows you to buy new crops and livestock and, since the catalogue is rather limited, once you unlock everything (There's five options for small plants, bushes, trees, and four for animals) levels add stars to what you already own, therefore making them worth more.\n-You can also expand your land, allowing for more Helpers, plants, and animals. Your little garden can get very cluttered, very quickly.\n-You can't see your entire garden on-screen at once after you start expanding. You can click-drag to pan or use the arrow keys.\n\nGraphics: I'm a sucker for cute, cartoony graphics, so this is right up my alley.\n\nPerformance: The UI is a little wonky when it comes to selecting plants: they are each on three different planes, one behind the other, and sometimes it's hard to choose something on the first plane. After you start expanding your garden and levelling up, there's a TON of stuff on-screen at all times, but I've never experienced any sort of frame rate issue.\n\nSoundtrack: This is my one complaint. It's the same song looped over and over again. It was charming at first, but it begins to wear on you quite quickly.\n\nLongevity: At about 5 hours in, I'm level 55. Not sure what the level cap is. That being said, there was a patch released today that added 8 more in-game achievements and that's a definite thumbs up for me. I'm glad the devs are still adding on to this game because I enjoy it a lot.\n\nBottom line: Absolutely adorable. It's a relaxing game that you can play for a few minutes or even hours. It's worth the 2.99 original price tag, but getting it on sale would be even sweeter.","January 31","true","10.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","19","24","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/recommended/421040/","thecyberdruid","TheCyberDruid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecyberdruid/","4925 products in account","Plantera is a nice (and cute) twist on the standard clicker game that eventually (after two hours) just falls flat due to the lack of 'content'.\n\nThe idea of the game is really rather unique and the execution is solid. The music is pleasant (up to a certain point) and the graphics while being simple have a certain charm to them. The premise of the game is simply to build a garden/farm and harvest the crops. To do that you get little blue helper blobs that automate the process and have to fend off meanies that want to steal your crops. Otherwise it's the same 'click on something to get money' routine.\n\nBy gaining more money you level up and get access to more plants (and some animals). You also have to extend your garden to have more space to grow more plants. Alternatively you can also spend money on some extras like scarecrows, guard dogs or a permanent gold multiplicator. One rather 'unfortunate' update that you can buy that way is the time that your blue helper blobs will work while being offline. It's a bit like the game knows that it doesn't offer much and artificially makes you come back to it more frequently until you threw enough money at an otherwise completely pointless update...\n\nThe real problem of the game is the lack of variety. There are three categories of plants with five plants in them each and four animals that you can get. You unlock the lot within the first hour of play and afterwards you just deal with more of the same. There's one (overused) 'easter egg/cameo' special event, but there are no other specials to see or look forward to. The game play is bland even for a clicker. There no strategy or tactic at all. It's just waiting to get enough money to buy more things to get more money.\n\nIt's a nice idea, but it's worth a dollar at best. You'll get an hour or two of fun out of the game until it becomes utterly repetitive.\n\nP.S.: I'm grinding for the last achievements that's why I have way more than two hours playtime, but I don't recommend doing the same.","March 4","false","11.0"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","31","46","0","0"

I played a lot of them and I like when the game starts simple and as you play you unlock a whole ton of new features and mechanics so the game doesn't become repetitive and slowly turns into a complex game where you still have something to look forward to.\n\nThe start of Planetara\nAt first I liked everything about this game especially the awesome music, cute graphic design and also the simple mechanics. Everything was perfect for me and  I was really happy about this game. I was really excited what this game has to offer.\n\nGetting repetitive\nBut I was relly sad to discover that  after 3 hours of idle/active gameplay I still had the same features that were there from the beginning, well to be fair there were actually some new things but only 3 and they weren't even exciting at all, I am talking about: Offline time upgrade, Dogs and Coin multiplier. So because I still had the same things to work with and nothing new to unlock after lvl 20 (that's when you have all the plants and trees unlocked and they just get upgraded as you level up) It started being just repeating the same thing over and over (Plant some plants --> Idle a bit --> Plant some plants etc.) without any goal. So it kinda just developed into the classic watch the number and size of the farm grow.\n\nWhat does it need for me?\nSo I really hope the authors will update this game and start adding new features to it. I don't know how it works on steam but I hope I won't be in a form of DLC or even worse if the game just gets left in it's current state. I really think this game has the potential to be one of the best, but unless it gets a lot of new features it won't cut it for me.\n\nConclusion\nPersonally in the end I liked only the music and graphic, but as I read other reviews I think that people that haven't dived too deeply into the clicker/incremental games in general can really enjoy this game as well as casual people who like to relax and watch their creation grow in size.","January 28","false","3.2"," 61 of 102 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","61","102","2","9"

It has all the traits of a clicker but the advantages of clicking are very minor, it’s more of a sit it and forget it kind of game. This time around the goal is to make as much money as possible, this allows you to increase the size of your plot, get more and better fauna and flora and defend yourself from the pesky critters.\n\nPlantera is definitely more on the simpler size, and that’s saying a lot for a clicker game. While I have over 13hours played for the game I’d say only about an hour or so of that is actual gameplay. The reason for this is that while you gain full money while the game is not running, you can only gain a maximum of 1 level while the game is closed. Levels are extremely important as they are the main tool for progression, they unlock more farmers and increased fauna and flora quality and variety ,so they’re pretty much mandatory.\n\nSo what you end up with is a very simple clicker game that is defined by its medium, farming. Personally I love seeing my little garden evolve into something that I cannot manage without the help of the workers, but others who are more interactive with their clicker games might find it a bit shallow. It’s pretty cheap so it’s not a big risk, though I’m sure if you’re a clicker fan you’ll know exactly what you’re looking for.\n","January 28","true","19.7"," 32 of 52 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","32","52","3","0"

All kidding aside, these games certainly have found their place in the market. WHile I am not a big fan of this type of game, many people are. It is good, casual fun and a way to whittle away the hours. I nthis particular clicker, you expand and farm your little garden. All the typical clickey mechanics are present and done fairly well, including upgrades to your garden and the types of plants/animals/defenses you have.\n\nPositives:\n+ Cute graphics\n+ Great for filling little bits of time here casually\n+ So easy, kids can play\n-Consistently adding new content\n\nNegatives:\n- Standard Clicker game, nothing new\n- WYSIWYG. There are no quirks or surprises that hook you in\n\nIt's above average for a clicker in my book, but I am not a big clicker-game fan. To those who enjoy this particular genre however, I can see it being worth it's price. It is certainly adorable, so it has that going for it.\n\nVerdict:\n7/10 (If you like Clicker games)\n3/10 overall\n\nHappy Gaming!\n","April 5","true","2.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

You can also adopt cute animals, like a happy Sheep. All the fruits, berries and crops, and whatever the animals will give you, earns you money. With the money you can upgrade your things to become more valuable, like the apple tree is less valuable than the cherry tree. Every time you make a tree of the same kind, it will cost more the next time, and actually get really expensive over time if you plant the same tree. That goes for everything in the game.\n\nYou got happy little blue 'Helpers' that will help you collect all the fruits and berries for you, and they will also keep working if you're going offline. Expanding the farm will automatically hire another Helper, and levelling up hires a Helper too sometimes. However, some evil animals will try to disturb your Helpers! Rabbits will try stealing carrots, Birds will try stealing apples, Wolves will scare away your farm animals. You can counter them by clicking on them, buying guard Dogs that barks at them, and recently you can buy scarecrows to scare away the Birds!\n\nThere is no "end game", as you can keep grinding, levelling up and upgrading your farm to make more money. I got to level 100 and got all the achievements within a day, and I consider the game completed. But I still launch the game and upgrade things here and there.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/recommended/421040/","Borba","Borba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Borba/","1717 products in account","TL:DR at the end, scored 5 / 10 as of 18th April 2016\nBorba likes:Genre - A clicker game, sporting full autonomy for idling, only requiring the player to purchase and place upgrades. Players may still speed up progress by picking up fruits and animal produce, or scaring off critters.\n\nInterface - The interface is simple and functional, and was updated with button shortcuts to go to either extremity of the farm or to the center. The upgrades menu is toggle-able so we can appreciate all that goes in the background without having half the screen serving as a menu.\n\nGraphics - Cute, appealing and colourful. Borba would love to see some more detail, such as day and night cycle or weather, but as is it’s pleasant to the eyes.\n\nDesign - Plantera feels unique from the get-go, and the few features it brings to the table are good in this genre. While it may lack mechanics and content to make it feel more rewarding and to prolong its lifetime, it’s a solid clicker game on it’s own, great for all ages.\n\nPolish - No minor or major bugs were found, and no performance issues whatsoever. The game is still getting short updates so there’s hopes they might improve on some of its negative aspects.\nBorba dislikes:Replayability - There is little reason to play after unlocking the achievements and steam cards, since there seem to be no mechanics to reset the game while carrying over bonuses to a new start. The current content can be unlocked in a couple of days, although the achievements may take a bit more than that.\n\nNarrative - There’s no such thing in Plantera, yet Borba believes clicker games shouldn’t be an exception here, as it could add more value to the game itself.\n\nGameplay - As previously stated, players may purchase upgrades and items for their farms, despite being very limited in terms of variety. Fruits, vegetables and animal produce may be gathered by the player via clicking, or by automated workers that increase as the player expands the farm. Critters that may steal produce may also be clicked to scare away, although dogs and scarecrows may be purchased to help with that. Both active and passive progress don’t feel that much rewarding after a while, due to lack of content and features.\n\nMusic - The background tune is pleasant at first, but since there are no volume controls it will quickly become tiring and repetitive. Gladly, there is an option to mute. Volume controls and some variety in this field are a necessity.\n\nSound - The nature of the game makes it so that some of the sounds become too repetitive eventually and, if there was volume slider for sounds, this could be mitigated by having the sound low so players could still have audible feedback for their actions without being overwhelmed by the same loud sounds. Also, there are ambient noises that Borba only noticed when he muted the music, which would add a nice touch if everything else wasn’t so loud!\nBorba feels like as an idle clicker game, Plantera provides all the basics required for a successful game of this genre. It’s ideal to keep open on the background or second screen while multi-tasking, despite lacking a bit in terms of depth and content while compared with certain more complex idle games. Due to its price, Borba believes it to be a good pick exclusively for fans of this type of games.\n\n5 / 10","April 18","true","16.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

For $2.99 there really isn't much on offer that can't be found in a similar free title. The game feels incomplete and a quick browse of other titles from this developer suggests that is a trend in their games.\n\nThe plants and animals in Plantera can be unlocked within the first two hours of gameplay. All that remains beyond that point appears to be grinding achievements. Gameplay consists of planting an orchard and collecting gold by clicking on fruit, or by idling the game to allow workers to collect it automatically. The garden can be expanded but continues to get filled with the same plants and animals. It would have been nice to more fleshed out gameplay. Perhaps a greater number of units, or the addition of quests/daily goals to achieve.\n\nIf you like clicker games and have exhausted the rest, or you're looking for easy achieves, you could probably do worse than Plantera.

The first the alarm clock, which increases the amount of time your helpers gather resources while you are gone. The next upgrade is a guard dog that scares away hungry creatures. Lastly, you can buy manure to increase your coin production forever.\nExpansions: every time you buy an expansion for your land, you get an extra helper. Helpers are little blue creatures that collect fruits and vegetables that you miss, even when you are gone (for a certain time depending on how many alarm clocks you have). You also gain a helper every time you level up.\n3 types of things to grow: plants, bushes, and trees. Each of these can be planet on top of the other; the plants grow on the lower ground, the bushes are just above the surface, and the trees tower over the rest of the garden.\n4 kinds of animals to raise, each with different drops. Chicken lays eggs, sheep drops wool, pigs dig for treasures, and cows produce bottles of milk.\nThere are 5 plants, 5 bushes, 5 trees, and 4 animals that you unlock as you level up. Once you have have all these, you start gaining unlocks to increase the amount of gold you gain from the drops.\nAt a fairly rare occasion (~ every 5 to 15 minutes in my experience), the Loot hero will appear and charge across the screen with his lance. This scares off all hostile creatures in his path. You can tap on him multiple times to receive gold (based on your multiplier level) as he speeds across the screen.\nGameplay: Click, click, and click some more! That’s pretty much all you are going to be doing.\nNew updates being constantly added with more content\nCertain limited options and no ways to increase view of your garden.\n\nSummaryPlantera is a unique clicker game with a simple concept. Manage trees, bushes, small plants, and farm animals while defending your land from hungry creatures. The game is great for short, 5-10 minute sessions. You should check this out if you like clicker games with relaxed gameplay.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game’s rating: 7/10.

You can see the resultant gameplay video below - an export of a Twitch highlight that was cut, comprising a demo of this game. Note that this does not affect my review in any way as I try to review games objectively.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_aHpSIS5Nk\n\nPlantera represents developer VaragtP's third game released on the Steam platform. Like the developer's other game Tap Heroes, it is also a clicker game. This one is in a slightly different form, and that's of a form where you tend to a farm, buying plants and animals, picking up the fruits and loot that they give you, and scaring away animals that steal your fruits.\n\n(note - I'm trying out a slightly different review style here for the first time.)\n\nFirst, the good:* Cheery graphics, slightly close to, but not entirely, retro-style\n* Soundtrack (or rather only one song) fits the mood that the game is trying to project\n* There's been a few updates since the release, which adds a bit of content - it's a good thing and hopefully this continues. Adding Loot Hero as a cameo character was a nice touch, I liked Loot Hero DX even though it was short!\n* Compared to other games, the price point is relatively cheap!\n* And lastly, unlike other clicker games - NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!\n\nThen the okay:i.e. it might be a good thing, it might be a bad thing...\n* You won't take that long to get 100% achievements in this game, especially if you aim for the "plant 100" achievements specifically. It's really a few hours of active clicking, and after that more hours of idling.\n* No brain required to play this game, even though at the higher levels your plants and animals get upgrades - I mostly stuck with the most expensive plants/animals throughout instead of trashing them to plant the less profitable ones again.\n* You only gain a maximum of 1 level while the game is closed, which means you have to check in after a while to get the gained level and make sure the EXP gained does not go to waste.\n* EDIT: I completely forgot to mention that the sound cuts if you click out of the game. This explains why my video above loses audio all the time, since I click out of the game window to type in chat.\n* EDIT 2: The UI will take some getting used to, but after a while it's helpful for when you want to select a specific plant/animal to trash.\n\nAnd lastly the bad:* Unlike most other clicker games, you have to pay to even play this one\n* It definitely feels like a mobile port due to the nature of how you shift to look at the other part of the farm. It REALLY feels at home on mobile!\n* While the aforementioned song was nice, after playing it over and over it felt REPETITIVE! I wish there were more songs...\n* Honestly I'm not really compelled to continue playing it after 100%ing everything.\n\nDespite the flaws I can't say I did not enjoy this game - overall, it proved to be rather fun and addicting. :)\n\nWhen to buy: If you like clicker games and/or getting 100% achievements in games relatively quickly, this is worth a pick up due to the relatively low price as compared to other main games.\n\n7.5/10","February 10","true","21.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/recommended/421040/","abbydonprime","AbbydonPrime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/","515 products in account","This is a cute, psuedo-clicker that is extremely simple compared to many of the other titles in the Clicker genre. Everything goes together very nicely. The only problem is that it's mostly a quest to complete the achievements, and then there isn't much to do. The garden gets maxed out. The upside is that it doesn't require micro-transactions (I'm looking at you, Clicker Heroes, Adventure Capitalist, etc) to "complete" the game.\n\nThe idea is to build a garden with 3 layers of plants (trees in back, bushes in the middle, and vegetables in the front) to harvest, as well as animals to get "produce" from, such as wool, milk, eggs, and random stuff the pigs dig up. There are various critters that will try to interrupt the farming. Wolves and foxes will scare the animals, rabbits will steal vegetables, and birds will fly away with one produce item. Obviously this has minimal impact on the overall output, and they don't really add much except something else to look at.\n\nAs the garden gets bigger, and more income is collected, various items will unlock, and the plants and animals will upgrade to generate more income. More helpers will arrive with upgrades and level ups, too. Dogs can be bought to scare away pest animals, and scarecrows can be placed to scare off the birds. Helpers will gather produce for you. As your farm gets larger, there isn't really any point on clicking anything. The main task becomes replacing the lower income plants and animals with higher income ones. Land expansions are purchased to increase the size of the garden.\n\nAt the start, it may be helpful to click butterflies and ladybugs (one per level for those) to get some extra money. There's also the Loot Hero that will run across the screen. Keep clicking on it to get more and more money until it runs off the edge. It also will scare off any bad critters on its way across. You can learn more about these and other features in the game Announcements.\n\nUpgrades can be purchased to collect revenue while the game is closed. However, I've found that unlike other clickers, it's way more beneficial to just leave the game open overnight. With a large farm, I'd come back on a 16h harvest upgrade to find 30M. If I left it running instead, my helpers would collect 300M. This is mostly why I have 86.6 hours on record. It's important to generate greater sums as you progress because land expansions and items continue to get more expensive.\n\nSince it doesn't require in-game purchases, and it's only $2.99, I recommend it for people that like the idle clicker games and want a bit of variety. Casual gamers that don't like standard clickers may also find this one appealing.\n---\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/audioencoding/recommended/421040/","audioencoding","Tristan 못","http://steamcommunity.com/id/audioencoding/","297 products in account","Game: Plantera\nGenre: Casual, Indie, Simulation, Farming\nCost: £1.99 / $2.99 / €2.99\nSupported OS: Microsoft Windows\nDeveloper: VaragtP\nPublisher: VaragtP\nRealese Date: 28.January.2016\n\nPlantera is an afk farming game, nothing more, nothing less. What can I say about it? Not much, but frankly, this game isn't really worth your time. Yes, I enjoyed this game, but no, it's not a good one. (EDIT: Some people did not seem to realise how this is possible, so let me expand on what I said. The game is not a good game, but even so I enjoy it for what it is. If you cannot comprehend how I can enjoy a bad game, then so be it. Good day, Sir!) So, as much as I want to support this developer, I cannot do it through this game. I will continue to play this game for a while, at least until I have all achievements, but unless it's on sale or you have a bit of extra money to spend; don't buy it.\n\nThe game has a few basic mechanics and items for you to play around with and use to grow your farm. Among others, this includes: yards, bushes, trees, animals and various other "boosts" such as, dogs, and scarecrows. This game works on 4 simple rules:\nMake stuff\nGet money\nMake more stuff\nRepeat.What do these steps do? Make the game addictive? Yes. Make it good? No. All these features do is make an endless loop until  you max out everything and LITERALLY can't do anything. I just open this game now and then just to level up or get some money from the Loot Hero, or simply just to see how my workers are doing. If the only reason you open the game, is to check how the game's doing while it's playing itself, it can't be good.\n\nThis isn't really a problem with Plantera specifically; it's more a problem with farming games generally, and yes, I know there are ones which are done really nicely, such as Slime Rancher, but honestly, let's just look at what a farm really is. A farm is a self sufficiet way of making food or items to sell. Yes, I do realise it does require some help from humans for things such as feeding the animals or harvesting the crops, but let's face it; how many times are you going to somehow help the plant grow faster, or make the animals to mate? It just doesn't happen. Unless a farm game can actively engage you in doing something other than planting crops, or buying/selling items and animals, it won't be very interesting to the general majority. This is why you don't see many farms games and also why I can't recommend Plantera. However, if you do feel like you want to play an idle farming game, then by all means, buy it, but as said, most people aren't.\n\nProsNice Simple Graphics\nNice Casual Game for Taking a Break from More Competitive Games\nConsToo Basic\nFails to create compelling drive to play\nOne Soundtrack\nGets Dull Fast to the Average Player\n\n\n\nFeature        Score/10    	        Design        3       	        Gameplay        3        	        Graphics        6                Sound        2    	        Story        NA    	        Replay Value        NA    	        Enjoyment        8       	        Overall        4\nFor more reviews on all the best Steam games, please check out my curator pages.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/11680266/\n\nIf you're a developer and want your game to be reviewed; I accept keys for that purpose.","February 27","false","8.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

In the beginning you don't get a lot to work with, you can grow carrots and plant some apple trees and blueberry bushes. As you go along you can unlock more fruits & veggies to plant as you level up. There are also specials you can buy like guard dogs to chase away critters, a clock that lets you earn money for a set time while being offline (although it's more profitable to leave the game running) and a multiplier which increases the worth of everything. Later on you can also expand your property so you can plant more things. It's very simple and there's not much to it yet I found it addictive. I hope the dev has plans to add more in the future.\n\nThere's no microtransaction system in place which I find surprising for this type of game. For a casual time waster I'd recommend it for the $3 price tag. Even better if ya can get it on sale.","February 5","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This clicker game was different because instead of clicking in the middle of the screen the entire time; this game allows you to move left and right from plot to plot. This makes improving your farm plots more engaging. It's also sort of an innovation in the clicking game genre. I review games for the genre they are in, and not for the negative reviews that say, "you just click things." That's what this genre is.\n\nPositive:+ Innovative sidescrolling for the genre of clicking games\n+ Cute graphics which would be good for any age group (unlike some of the ones mentioned above)\n+ Achievements occur often and help keep you entertained\n+ Music was fun\n+ Trading cards\n+ Balanced, a lot of clicking games are not balanced in terms of leveling/achievements and time played.\n\nImprovements: (instead of cons because it's a decent game in the genre)\n- No menu / help, kinda have to figure stuff out on your own\n- No clear way to see how much gold you make for what type of plant you farm (edit: I found it, blue ? mark icon next to the count, adds to the first point of no help menu)\n- Zoom feature to see your whole garden\n- Add more types of plants and animals, maybe different buffs as well.\n- The way a lot of clicking games become successful is microtransactions. I know people hate them and especially if the game isn't free, but cosmetic changes could add flair into this game. If the cosmetic changes are going to be free, they could be based on level or purchase with gold.\n- Another suggestion would be to add seasonal events. Maybe even seasonal vegetables or animals. This would keep players playing even after the game has been resting in the library a few weeks. You could also add seasonal cosmetic changes (see above).\n- A way to see level up rewards. The reason this is important is players will have a reason to want to reach a higher level. Even adding in some cosmetic stuff.\n\nSlightly Above Average Game: 6/10\n\nOverall, this is a good game for the genre. I'm on the fence about the price of the game though, I usually treat clicker games as mobile game prices. So anything less than $2 is good. With some improvements, this game could become higher than a 6/10. The developer is very active on his/her game's discussion, which is nice.","February 7","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Such a small and simple game, and yet so deep in its details that I'm almost afraid I might miss something. Imagine if you will, Farmville squashed flat vertically, with all the artwork changed and rodents in the veggies. Then change the art to super-kawaii, and you get something that resembles Plantera.\n\nIt's a casual game with an eye towards making things as easy to operate but difficult to keep up with if you're going for the quick high-score. It's a frantic clicker game that starts out small and simple, teaching you the basic moves, and then begging you to get ahead of yourself. Not for the Carpal Tunnel crowd, but certainly worth a look if you have a few minutes to kill while you're waiting for your bus or as the not-driver on a cross-country road trip. It's cheap and easy, like most of the other games of its type, but don't let the kyute fool you.\n\nThis game is all about your mad clicking skillz, and if you don't have it, you'd better learn quick. The assets are numerous and varied, to the degree that nearly everything I saw is easily identified at a glance rather than a guess. The music is in dire need of an actual volume control, but it does at least have an off switch so you can use the rest of the sound design to tell you what's going on.\n\n65/100-- not for everybody, but it's an inexpensive and amusing way to assassinate the clock when needed. Should be a mobile port, and is not. I expect they're going to port it to mobile eventually.\n\nIt would do better on a tablet. Windowed mode looks like it set up for cell phones, and requires considerable precision to get anywhere. Fullscreen looks good, though. Your mileage may vary, of course.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9CT1OOypIhQ\n","May 24","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There is literally hardly any idle, until you get more workers/animals/multiplier increase, so you'll most be clicking until then. There is idling, but the rabbits, wolves, foxes, birds, etc will come eat your farm. You might also lose some Loot Heroes as well, so I recommend paying the slighest attention to it.\n\nThere is no microtransactions, no overpowered thing, it's just all in great fun.

Using this money, you can buy other things, that help you generate money faster, so you can buy more stuff that lets you generate more money, that lets you buy more things, ad infinitum, a la Cookie Clicker.\n\nThis game is indesputably more fun that Cookie Clicker - there's a lot going on, it's cute, there's actual graphics, as opposed to just clicking aimlessly, but it has pretty much the game gameplay. Or lack thereof. Just click things until you get bored, and then tab out and do something else, and tab back in when you want to play again.\n\nNot paying attention to the game doesn't mean that you're losing anything. Profits may go down, but you aren't missing out. This isn't a game you need to pay attention to to play. Idle clicker is pretty much the perfect thing you could call this game.\n\nIt's got cute graphics, and it's got nice sound, but that's about all I like for this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GaffiProg/recommended/421040/","GaffiProg","Gaffi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GaffiProg/","1420 products in account","I've played a few clicker/idle type games, and this one unfortunately is lacking quite a bit. As other reviews have noted, the game is not free, whereas the majority of my experience has been with free games.\n\nThat being said, there are a few I'm actively playing, with elements that keep me interested. Namely, Clicker Heroes and AdVenture Capitalist. Both have events which keep up the variety, and both have long term, difficult to reach (without a lot of play time) goals. This keeps me engaged and coming back for more.\n\nOn the other hand, Plantera has very low replayability. The review panel here is telling me I've clocked just under 50 hours. That is 100% actual game time, as I did not leave the game closed for any extended period. Sure, you can do that, and get your earnings when you come back, but there are achievements that can only be obtained while having an active window open. -- And that's part of the problem. With my ~50 hours of play time, I picked up every single achievement. That might be good if you are a completionist, but it was far too easy. There were no goals that I could see taking more than a month to complete (versus the previously mentioned titles, which have achievements that take a very long time to get to), and because of that, there's not much you're going to get for your money here.\n\nAlso, in the 'late game' (which is really no different than earlier stages), the building upgrades are all passive, based on your level. So on top of the fact that the game doesn't change much over time, thus making it boring, there is nearly zero strategy to employ with regard to upgrade paths. There are some strategic elements, like how many dogs/scarecrows to use, but I found these had very minimal impact, especially if you were actively clicking all the time.\n\nNow, that's not to say the game is all that bad. The animations are nice/cute, the expandable garden is a nice twist on the genre, and this game rewards active participation more than others. However, for the lack of content/total active play time provided, I would much rather have kept my money, considering the free alternatives available.","April 21","false","49.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

It feels very, very short for an incremental game and the amount of content is pretty much abysmal. You get 5 plants, 5 bushes, 5 trees and 4 animals. That's it. You buy more land and plant more.\n\nThe critters that try to steal your fruits/vegetables have basically no impact. I get maybe 2-3 critters per 30 seconds on a farm that produces way too much for it to matter at all, the few fruits they manage to steal when my dogs don't do their job do not reduce my profits in any way.\n\nThe automation (Star) tab doesn't do much, in my opinion. I completed the game with a 10x multiplier, 10 scarecrows and 8 dogs. There is an upgrade to increase the amount of time your workers harvest while you close the game, but it's nearly useless considering how little time it takes to complete the game.\n\nI don't think it's a bad game at all, and I think it does have potential. But the way it is right now, it's way too easy to finish it. It's not much fun in its current state, you just plant your things and leave the game running in the background. There's no point in clicking fruits or vegetables yourself, it honestly doesn't make much of a difference besides making the game even shorter.","May 14","false","20.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

For the amount of content this game offer, you can unlock all plants and trees in less than 2 hour even more so if you use auto clicker. There's no sense of progression once you unlock everything and that is ultimately what an incremental game needed.\n\nWith that said unless this game have more update to come and more content added. Theres really no reason why you you need to buy this. Just go and play clicker heroes instead if you want a good clicker/idling game (is free).","April 6","false","11.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

This game would be a 100% yes for free but as a pay for clicker game I gotta give it a no.  I myself will hold onto the game for a few more days before tossing it if the devs don't show that they have MANY more things coming for the game to help draw it out.\n\nPros: the music is lovely and if you tire of it there is a muti button for either sound or music, though sound helps you listen for bonuses and stuff going wrong.\nYour clicking is always rewarded, when fruit is ready to be picked you can click on it to drop early and in turn start the next fruit sooner making you money faster, as well as clicking to fend off foes giving you a reason to keep clicking in this clicker unlike so many other clicker games.\nEverything looks rather cute... other than your workers but still everything else looks cute in the game.\nNO IN GAME FEES!  I know it's unheard of and I don't know why it's not there but yes for once a clicker that doesn't look like it's trying to make it's game impossible to beat without paying 50 bucks to win, looking at you AC!\n\nThe cons: Level ups don't matter very fast, what happens when you get a new level but you've unlocked everything?  Oh they double the worth of your oldest plant, meaning the first plant that got  you one gold now earns you two but seeing as you'll have plants making about five gold at that point, there is no reason to enjoy said level ups anymore as your most expensive plant will still be making more.\nThe guard dogs, I do enjoy that we have them but they are not dependable.  You can place them anywhere you like at first but at times they may walk off the map or never simply there to defend your farm even if you have ten of them because they all thought it would be best to head left vs right.  I'm all for them having to patrol but it would be better if there was a reasonable set amount of ground for them to cover.\nPaying for a clicker game, Sounds stupid after the pro DLC bit I know but I myself just hate spending money on clicker games, maybe a buck or two, heck the 2.39 sale may yet have me keep it.  I just never feel it's right to pay for games like these.\n#1 problem!  It's too short.  In this small amount of time you see logged, 1.3 hours at the time of posting, I've more than beaten the game.  Everything is unlocked I'm getting stars for my plants already and there is nothing to do other then check in every 11 hours or so now simply because of another con, you have to, in game, pay for how long you can be offline and still make money.(I could be misunderstanding that but it sounds like that's what it is.)\n\nFinal verdict: I said it at the start I'll say it again this is not a yes review it's not a no review it's a middle of the road one.  This game just was released so I'm VERY hopeful that the game will fix it's largest problem, in which I'll be changing it to a yes review but till then it's a no.  Come on guys it's a clicker game with plant life I know you can find more fruits to add in, prep a valentines thing where you have to click flying babies, or even blue babies like your workers, away much like the crows.  I understand it's a better more complex interface than AC but it's still a clicker game you can give us a reason to push us to septillion other then achievements.\n*AC is another clicker game that I will not name as they are getting enough mud slung at them for poor choices in uploads right now.","January 31","false","1.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

The controls is simple, all looks like you play something mobile game. In a game you can buy for your garden/farm: 4 different animals, 5 different trees, 5 different bushes, 5 different plants. Also you can use 3 different boosters. All this stuff you can buy it with coins earned ingame. You can also expand your territory, adding +1 blue creature, what help collecting items. In a game you also have "enemies" like a birds , rabbits, foxes etc. They will trying stole your harvest or animals. Graphic has a pixel graphics style, but nice, and all looks cute. Music also trying to be cute.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+steam cards and achievements\n+simple to play\n+no premium\n+can be good for kids\n\n-not for all\n-after some time can be tiresome\n\nThis game does not want be more than what it is.

I'm a big fan of the incremental/idle/clicker genres. I'm happy to pay for the games. As it stands now, this game is not a strong contender in these genres. It does not compare strongly against similar games.\n\nAfter maybe 30 minutes tops of active play and a few hours of idling, it looks like I've seen everything there is to see. There are a lot of achievements for longer play, but the gameplay and content just aren't in place to make that remotely interesting to me.\n\nWhat's there is well polished. The graphics are decent, the sound is decent. The UI is decent, controls and interacting work just dandy, and the game runs well windowed. It is cute, and it could be a good game for relaxing. On those technical aspects, there aren't any problems. Most of the foundation for a great simple game is in place.\n\nUltimately, the problem is that there just isn't enough here. There is never any kind of "paradigm shift" that would help the longevity, or really even any strategy at all. You just plant the best things you have available.\n\n(If you aren't familiar with incremental games, this may be how all these games look to you. The difference is that better incremental games tend to give you more opportunity to make strategic decisions and strive for optimal play over a longer period of time -- choosing the buildings that give the best points per second for the cost, choosing when to prestige, etc. Plantera lets you make some small choices about what to plant, but ultimately those choices are inconsequential, because the game is so extremely short on content.)\n\nI'd recommend buying the game at a price that you find reasonable for 30 minutes of playtime. There are trading cards, so that could influence your decision.","January 30","false","3.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Good for any fan of Clicker or Idle games. Mellow music and steady paced gameplay make for a relaxing experience. Once you get far enough, the game can basicly run on it's own, but there are still reasons to keep actively playing. (Such as the Loot Hero, a little jouster who runs across the screen and gives tons of money when you click him.)\n\nIf I had to say something bad about it, it's that I wish I could zoom out and see more of the farm and any given time. The helper AI is also a little derpy and slow on the uptake at times, but it's nothing that really ruins my personal enjoyment of the game.\n\nAll in all, more than worth the pocket change I paid for it.","February 1","true","9.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everytime you level up, you get access to new type of crops and everything. When you have unlocked everything, every levels after that gives bonuses to the first type of crops so they don't become useless.\n\nThe game has a very nice cartoonish artstyle and some pretty good background music. There's only one track in the game, but it doesn't get on my nerve like other idle games, it's relaxing. You can sit in front of your huge garden and just spend your time watching your workers loot everything for you and upgrade whenever you need to!\n\nYou must also defend your garden from birds and other animals too! Otherwise, they will steal your crops. You can also buy guard dogs to defend your precious plants! The game features 20 achievements and trading cards, which is great! The game will keep you occupied for a good 10 hours at least, but it does get repetitive. Taking into consideration the low price tag, if you like Idle games or Clicker games, I think this is a good purchase after all.\n\nOverall, i'd say this game is worth it. It's simple, it's definately fun and really inexpansive! If you end up liking it, you should check out the other games from the same developer. He has tons of Clicker games on Steam and they're all fun to play!","January 28","true","55.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

The chicken and dog being personal favourites of mine.\nBeing able to walk away from a game but still making progress is an attratcive concept and one that many larger games have started adding into their games. If you have a busy life or can't really sit at a computer for long lengths of time I could see the appeal.\nI would recommend this game on that bases, if you like a game that you can just relax and slowly progress through without much involvment from yourself then I think Plantera is worth picking up.

The limitations on the game set by the dev (or incompetent game design) are just rediculous for an auto game. And therefore I simply can not recommend it."\n\n\nThe long, everyone is gonna disagree version.\n\n\nIt's a fun, charming, super cheap game and for that it's probably worth the money. And the music is nice. Shame the soundtrack (like 1 song as far as I can tell from playing the game) is $5, and it has more content than the actual game.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's even less of a clicker game, than clicker games.\n\nExamples:\n\nYour idle money caps out when the computer is off- you have an actual max money count, and going over that means you stop gaining anything.\n\nThe amount of content is extremely low.\n\nThere's almost no need to click outside of speeding up the early game. The rest is just letting it run on your computer in the background. Don't minimize it because it pauses the game. The game runs at half speed when not the active window.\n\nThe upgrades are basically pointless. Some to allow you to gain more money when the game is closed (except if you hit the cap none of it matters, and the cap is 100mil offline-money, and upgrades max out at 99mil a click, so you see the issue). There's a multiplier to get more money from each thing globally (click or not) but again, your max money cap is still a thing when the game is closed, AND there's still an in-game cap, so all this does it help you reach it marginally faster. 2x faster exactly. Which, isn't really noticable until you have 200x the money, 250, 300 etc. But it's still not SUPER fast by any means.\n\n\nThis game got boring, fast. The limitations on the game set by the dev (or incompetent game design) are just rediculous for an auto game.

Most of us don’t really think of games like AdVenture Capitalist or Cookie Clicker as core video games, or even really recognize them as games at all. They’re really just distractions, nice ways to pass the time and still feel like you’re accomplishing something thanks to ever-increasing numbers, enticing you to get the higher amount of points your heart desires while waiting for your download to finish or microwave to beep. Little distractions, usually cute, and always a good way to fight off the always approaching threat of boredom. The issue is when an idle game manages to screw up even those basic fundamentals and becomes a bore itself.\n\nPlantera has a charming aesthetic that makes for a nice screensaver and nothing much beyond that.\n\nRead the full review here: http://techraptor.net/content/plantera-review-garden-clicker","February 15","false","2.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

You also have to protect your garden from other animals like foxes, wolves and birds who want to steal your food.\n\nI think the devoloper VaragtP made a very good job in this game and it is defenetly worth buying if you like this kind of game.

As you can see from the screenshots it gets crazy. I was surprised how fast it happens though. One minute you're tapping butterflies and shooing away a rabbit - the next, you're swinging the camera wildly from left to right hoping that there's not a flock of rogue birds stealing your carrots. It's a very simple game, you collect money and plant fruit and vegetables. Your little farmers do the harvesting (you can too, by clicking on the ripe fruit/veggies) which nets you more money to buy higher grade plants which land you more cash. Will you buy an adorable (if extremely slow) guard dog? Speed up the harvesting rate? Or for the daredevils among you, buy more land to plant more things - AND DEFEND YOUR BIGGER FARM FROM EVEN MORE BEASTS??!\n\nI'll leave that decision to you.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608712491\n\nPros:\nNice, cute art style and animation\nPleasant music and sound effects\nSimple, fun gameplay\n\nCons:\nGets a bit frantic\nCan lose a lot of time, mesmerized by the game\nsometimes in the chaos you click outside of the window, even in fullscreen O_O","January 28","true","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You can click on the ripe produce to collect the money, or you can let your little blue helpers pick it up for you.\n\nThere are critters that will steal your produce, and you can buy upgrades like dogs that will chase away the critters, scarecrows to... scare crows away, etc.\n\nAs the game progresses, you'll unlock new bush and plot types, allowing you to grow produce that makes you more money per item, as well as expand your farm and increase the amount of blue helpers you have.\n\nThere isn't a huge amount of strategy in the game, so far as I've seen in my short playtime, but it's a satisfying experience, all the same.\n\nIt's an ideal game for people who like clickers, and or enjoy games where you can do some work on your farm, then let things play out for a while.\n\nPersonally, I quite enjoy minimal interaction games, that you can just leave running and enjoy the scenery, and this game fills that niche quite well.","February 19","true","12.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Plain simple.\nYou can try upgrade your plants but it will cost x2 each time you purchases.\nDogs can be used to scare the wild animals except moles. And it is useful because threats like fox tend to chase sheep/chicken, probably might losing animals if leave it unguarded.\n\nIf you are too lazy enough, you can just purchase the Alarm Clock, but its expensive, thats why you need Multiplier to earn more.\nAlarm Clock can raise up until Unlimited, but unfortunately, like counterpart Multiplier, it has limitation of earning, the maximum earning I can earn is $100M, nothing more.\nIf you purchase Multiplier for too much, the price stuck at $99M. Same goes with other item if reaching into this limit. Its not downside but only just a note.\n\nYour blue dude minions, will collect all of your resources so you can earn what you harvest. To get more, you either upgrade your ranch on end side of the game, or you can gain\nby Leveling yourself, which gains you more perks and new seeds.\n\nIf you unlock everything, your previous item will be upgraded, means x2 from previous item. Pretty hefty.\nMusic is just basicly looping 30 seconds song, but its a good soundtrack and the graphics was pretty clean and slick. only problems was its a bit basic, but not really complaining that much.\n\nSo after long played on this game, I think its addicting and very casual clicker game, and I`m pretty new in clicker genres.\nVery polished but only 1 Glitch that could ruin the purpose of this game, but this will be solved sooner or later.\n\nRecommended? Yes, its cheap and worth. Go grab it. (8/10)","January 28","true","7.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

In this game, you are able to build, and later on, expand your own garden. There are 3 different gardeny items for you to enjoy. The developer also included animals, which increases the cuteness level that the game already had to begin with! Plantera isn't like the other farm-type games. There are critters running amok just doing what critters do! Don't be bitter or a quitter because those critters have nothing on your gardening skills. So far I've encountered bunnies, moles, birds and foxes! When you build your garden, you also get a helper, your gardener in grime! Save yourself from spam clicking your mouse to death and let your helpers do it for you. You'll eventually get more as you progress in the game. So, what are you waiting for? Build your garden today!\n\nGameplay Review\nLet's talk about the art style of this game. I absolutely LOVE it! It's simple, yet cute. Vibrant colors but doesn't hurt your eyes. I adore the animals and critters too! The music is peaceful yet bouncy, which is an interesting mix btw :D\n\nNow let's talk about gameplay. I played for approximately an hour and was able to expand 3 times and unlock at least 2 of each item category. The gameplay isn't overly time-consuming as far as I can tell from my experience with it. I did lose interest about 20 minutes into the game because the concept of the game just isn't my kind of thing. However, it's a cute little game which is suited more towards a younger audience. I have to say that the art style is what really got my interest into trying this game out!\n\nI can't say that there's much replay value though. I don't think I'll be playing this game again but I know my younger cousins would love it!\n\nPros\n-This game is mostly suitable for a younger audience; (I am 22 years old but this game was cute and amusing for a while!)\n-Family-friendly\n-Cute art! Seriously who doesn't like cute art and vibrant colors?\n-TONS of items to unlock!\n-ADORABLE critters that sneak up on you\n\nCons\n-Super repetitive - "Grinding" = Time-consuming\n-It does take quite a bit of coins to progress in the game (especially for buying more items; the price increases after each purchase for any item)\n-I don't see it as having a high replay value mostly because the grinding of the game is time-consuming. BUT, you can definitely start over and play it through again\n\nHowever, what I've mentioned above doesn't diminish the quality of the game. This might be by design of the developer and it's pretty reasonable\n\nWould I recommend it?\nIt's tough to say. If you enjoy farming/gardening games or games that require tons of grinding, then yes!\nIf you have a younger sibling, cousin, friend's siblings, friend's cousins, etc. etc. let them give it a go\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nFun Meter: 6/10\nPrice: 9/10\nOverall Rating: 7.5/10","January 28","true","1.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Its a clicker game and good to look at.\nReview of Plantera : https://youtu.be/mSOLmP-epUA\nThe pros of it are-\n1. Very simple clicker game. By simple I mean its as simpler as it can get.\n2. People of all ages will enjoy just clicking their mouse all over the place and collecting foods from the   garden and keeping away birds, animals etc in their leisure.\n3. You don't need to be at full concentration always and there is nothing to loose.\n4. Loved the music.\n5. Finally refreshing.\n6. Really cheap. Only $2.99\nThe Cons of it-\n1. The game is too simple and will get boring after a while.\n2. Not much to offer as far as content is concerned. You are going to be clicking on some wild birds and animals and collecting food for all the time to come. These all takes place by just a matter of clicks. Unfortunately its pros is also its con. Nothing to be excited about and almost no sense of achievement.\n3. Game has no story.\nHow it could be better-\n1. Add more options or things to exprience.\n2. Add zoom in and zoom out options as its really annoying that you can't keep an eye on the full garden at a time. Also the scrolling was annoying.\n3. Add a rewarding feeling to the game and a story even if its just a point and click.\nOverall the game could have been far better by adding more options and things to do. But overall for $2.99 you don't have a lot to expect. I hope they keep on developing the game and adding small features or new things to do. But I will recommend it to people as its just $2.99.","January 28","true","5.5"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

I am not usually a "clicker" kind of gamer. I was given a review key for the game which is the only reason I even bothered at all. 3 hours later (2 1/2 hours after recording) I found myself glued to screen not realizing how much time had passed.\n\nYou and your little blooper friend start off with one plot of land. Every time a crop grows you earn a specific amount of gold for that crop. The amount of gold you earn will increase with the different "tier" of crops you unlock. You can upgrade the base amount of gold you earn by purchasing manure later on. In addition to basic level farm plots, you also can grow berry bushes, trees, and heard animals. All of these will yield gold for you, the farmer. Be warned however that other animals will try and steal your crops therefore reducing the amount of gold you collect. You can purchase an animal a little later on that can help defend your crops. The selling point for me about this game is that you really don't have to be too active for your farms to collect gold. The little blooper friend will collect all the fruits, veggies, and products produced by animals when they are ready for collecting. I actually have the game running in the background as I type this review. You also don't have to keep the game on overnight as there is an afk system built in that will last for about an hour (default, can be upgraded) where you farm will still continue to collect gold.\n\nPros:\n- Cute graphics\n- Easy to understand controls\n- Progression based\n- Afk system\n-  Extremely addicting\n- Soothing music\n- Very resonable price\n\nCons:\n- Can get too hectic if you are trying to be actively involved (very minor con)\n- Seriously...I can't really think of anything else.\n\nTL:DR Progression based farming clicker with an AFK system built in that can help you play the game.\n\nThis is my very first review so if it's a fail, I am ok with that. Will improve over time.","January 28","true","80.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While on its surface, it's a simplistic and gentle clicking game, it doesn't rely on the "button mashing" aspect most clickers have, and instead focuses on growth and expansion of your farm.  It's a ton of fun, even without the depth, and goes to show what can be done and enjoyed with even the most simplistic of premises.\n\nHighly recommended, and at this price, you can't really go wrong.

Also, the devs are still adding stuff to the game, it seems.\n\nIf you're looking for a min-maxing game to really tickle your dopamine glands and get you hooked on its layered progression, this isn't it. It's too one-dimensional to appeal to the hardcore idlers.\n\nIf you're not really in it for the number crunching and just want a pleasant idling / clicking game though, this is probably the best one on Steam in that regard.

But first small background; I am very impatient when it comes to games, especially retail I feel like hiding features behind a time wall is padding and a type that should really only be used in free to play games or games that actually have a reason beyond 'its just how it works' like plot or some crap, such as a prolog.\n\nClicker games aren't something I enjoy really, with few exception (Parodies and the like)\n\nBut I do enjoy (mostly) games like Harvest Moon, and Animal crossing where there's farming and more to do.\n\nThis takes farming and is the most basic of clicking games, with a graphic style that looks like it was made without much thought, and bores me to death.  The leveling system is poorly thought out giving you only one new item per level with few exception, also I'd rather a proper tutorial than be given a item from a catagory each level, in addition to level you need to use money to buy a item and every time you buy a item the price doubles all the way up to 99 million (I think)\nWhich needless to say doesn't make sense in a farming game, a genre in which the standard is fixed pricing.  I'd really rather have fixed pricing that you work your way up to rather than waiting for levels to get the item which I could afford to buy a year ago.\n\nSeriously feels like a free to play flash game would have more content than this, even for a price of three dollars off sale I'd avoid it.  If you're looking for a paid for farming game that's not only cute but is in a promising state for the future, I've heard things about Slime Rancher (Though I don't own it myself)  There also seems to be a good lineup for early 2016 as far as big budgets go, and hopefully a couple indie suprises so especially at this time it'd probably be best to save money.","February 1","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not usually a "clicker" kind of gamer. I was given a review key for the game which is the only reason I even bothered at all. 3 hours later (2 1/2 hours after recording) I found myself glued to screen not realizing how much time had passed.\n\nYou and your little blooper friend start off with one plot of land. Every time a crop grows you earn a specific amount of gold for that crop. The amount of gold you earn will increase with the different "tier" of crops you unlock. You can upgrade the base amount of gold you earn by purchasing manure later on. In addition to basic level farm plots, you also can grow berry bushes, trees, and heard animals. All of these will yield gold for you, the farmer. Be warned however that other animals will try and steal your crops therefore reducing the amount of gold you collect. You can purchase an animal a little later on that can help defend your crops. The selling point for me about this game is that you really don't have to be too active for your farms to collect gold. The little blooper friend will collect all the fruits, veggies, and products produced by animals when they are ready for collecting. I actually have the game running in the background as I type this review. You also don't have to keep the game on overnight as there is an afk system built in that will last for about an hour (default, can be upgraded) where you farm will still continue to collect gold.\n\nPros:\n- Cute graphics\n- Easy to understand controls\n- Progression based\n- Afk system\n-  Extremely addicting\n- Soothing music\n- Very resonable price\n\nCons:\n- Can get too hectic if you are trying to be actively involved (very minor con)\n- Seriously...I can't really think of anything else.\n\nTL:DR Progression based farming clicker with an AFK system built in that can help you play the game.\n\nThis is my very first review so if it's a fail, I am ok with that. Will improve over time.","January 28","true","80.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buy plants and animals to create your own farm and then have weird blue dudes pick your crops. I'm really not one for clicker games but this one is surprisingly addictive and not as mind-numbing as a lot of other ones out on Steam. No microtransactions, so that's always a plus. It could also easily be expanded in the future to include more customizations and animals, etc.\n\nMy only complaints are that it gets a bit repetitive after the initial unlocks and there's not much else to look forward to or work towards after that, that's why I think some more things need to be added eventually to keep people playing after the first few hours.

There we no bugs/glitches that i notest atleast and i am one of those people that does notest them (uselly in the weirdest of ways). at this point in time i played it over 100 min and i don't leave the game running when i am away. so the 100 are fully spent on upgrading and leveling. there are some upgrades that let your workers work for a longer duration when you are offline wich is a cool feature, unlike some other games where you come back and you have all the money in the world. but besides all of that this game looks good sounds good and is really cheap so why not get it.","January 28","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm really surprised at the ostentatious reviews.\n\nIt's a brainless game you can play while watching TV. Plant a tree. Protect your produce from the occasional baddie. Find that wily mole, and click click click...\n\nUpgrades are 5 tiers in each of the 4 categories of product, plus 3 special category upgrades (increased money basically). You'll run out of upgrades quickly.\n\nThe concept is cute (see the video). The music is nice, but redundant; the track in the video is the only soundtrack.\n\nI'd like to see:\n- More soundtracks (new upgrade maybe?)\n- More animations (The guys that collect the produce don't do anything besides collect produce... a day/night cycle would do wonders for the game)\n- More (varied) upgrades (I like the idea of the guard dogs that chase away bad guys. Can we have some silos, houses, fences, traders/visitors? Just ideas. The tiered categories are a bit redundant...)\n\nI was looking for a brainless game, and I got what I wanted. I'm disappointed at how quickly the game gets boring though. Thumbs up for getting what I expected and the potential of the concept.

While on its surface, it's a simplistic and gentle clicking game, it doesn't rely on the "button mashing" aspect most clickers have, and instead focuses on growth and expansion of your farm.  It's a ton of fun, even without the depth, and goes to show what can be done and enjoyed with even the most simplistic of premises.\n\nHighly recommended, and at this price, you can't really go wrong.

It's simplistic. It's an idle-game; you don't need to babysit the screen. You can click, but the benefits to doing so after the first few minutes are fairly minor, and at no point does the game try to forcefully keep your attention, or make you feel guilty about being inefficient, or forgetting you've left it open in the background. It will still be there, waiting for you. The local critters will help themselves to your crops (though you can buy guard dogs to help defend against them), but there's no need to be greedy. There's plenty to go around.\n\nThere's no need for complex spreadsheets, to minmax your way to lording your superior progression over the casuals. You won't find any bloated complexity here; though your blue helpers are fairly blob-like. Checking in on your farm is a relaxing, satisfying experience, that brings a smile to your face.\n\nAbsolutely worth the price.","January 29","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But first small background; I am very impatient when it comes to games, especially retail I feel like hiding features behind a time wall is padding and a type that should really only be used in free to play games or games that actually have a reason beyond 'its just how it works' like plot or some crap, such as a prolog.\n\nClicker games aren't something I enjoy really, with few exception (Parodies and the like)\n\nBut I do enjoy (mostly) games like Harvest Moon, and Animal crossing where there's farming and more to do.\n\nThis takes farming and is the most basic of clicking games, with a graphic style that looks like it was made without much thought, and bores me to death.  The leveling system is poorly thought out giving you only one new item per level with few exception, also I'd rather a proper tutorial than be given a item from a catagory each level, in addition to level you need to use money to buy a item and every time you buy a item the price doubles all the way up to 99 million (I think)\nWhich needless to say doesn't make sense in a farming game, a genre in which the standard is fixed pricing.  I'd really rather have fixed pricing that you work your way up to rather than waiting for levels to get the item which I could afford to buy a year ago.\n\nSeriously feels like a free to play flash game would have more content than this, even for a price of three dollars off sale I'd avoid it.  If you're looking for a paid for farming game that's not only cute but is in a promising state for the future, I've heard things about Slime Rancher (Though I don't own it myself)  There also seems to be a good lineup for early 2016 as far as big budgets go, and hopefully a couple indie suprises so especially at this time it'd probably be best to save money.","February 1","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very simple and straight-forward. If you're used to doing math for your incrementals, about what to buy to get the most income, or when to prestige/reset, this isn't the game for you. The grind for 100% acheivements takes a bit, and it seems like the dev is pretty active with adding new content and updating.

But even if a game is specifically not catered for me personally, I believe myself to have an open enough mind that I can see whether a game is good or bad based on its own merit and the market it is trying to appeal to.\n\nThe gameplay was surprisingly addictive, once I got the farm really beginning to take shape, leveling up and getting access to new items to plant/use.  I liked that there would be different creatures that would attempt to thwart my plans of growing a great farm.  Admittedly, when I first started the game, I thought again that I wouldn't like it and would be done with it right away.  And then an hour passed, and I still wanted to play.  And then two hours passed, and I was still playing.  It's incredibly addictive and easy to play.\n\nI enjoyed the music of the game as well.  Light in tone, it kept the right mood as you clicked continuously to earn that gold.  Granted, I believe it was just one song on a loop, but that's perfectly fine.  And who knows, perhaps there will be an update with more music added, as I see there are updates being added from time to time, including one recently.  But even if not, I believe it more than satisfies the mood within the game.\n\nAre there features I would like to see added?  Well, I didn't get crazy far into the game, but I would love to see perhaps a day/night cycle.  Perhaps some various weather patterns?  Maybe these things are in the game already, so I apologize if I didn't get far enough to witness them, but if I were to ponder on features I would love in this game, I think that would give it an added variability that might be interesting for the player.\n\nThis game is something that surprisingly gave me a good period of enjoyment, and at the end of the day, that's what games are all about.  Entertainment and an escape from the real world.  It accomplished its goal, and I think a lot of people could enjoy this game if/when they give it a chance.  My biggest suggestion is play it for an hour or so and then make a decision.  The beginning game starts off slow, but then things begin to pick right up.","February 10","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, once you unlock all the crops/animals (probably within the first two hours?) there's nothing to look forward to.

And welcome to an amazing Weston Review!\nThough I have received a early key for this game, this will not affect my review at all.\n[b1] Do not expect it to be harsh in anyway other than the fact that this game rips away my heart because it's a clicker game and forces me to continue on and play. [/b1]\n\nSo lets begins:\n\nPros:\nAmazing Gameplay\nCute animals\nAmazing elements\nOne of the best things I've ever played other than  Clicker Heroes  Which is another Highly recommended game.\nCons:\nThe Blue Creatures show no emotions  They look like they just want to stab me in the middle of the night, no offense to the creator, but emotion would be appreaciated.\nThe Loot Hero or as he is known in his Steam Achievement Cameo, needs to be more implemented into the game. I have read that he rarely appears for people that are even level 10 and I feel this should be upped just a tad bit.\nUmmmmmm, nothing else. Great job on making a basically perfect game :D :steamhappy:\nNow lets Talk. I feel like this is basically one of the best clicker implemented game that Steam has ever seen. No, I'm not saying this because I got a key, but because I feel this is that good of a game. If I could've made a game as good as this, I would've.\n\nI thank you all, and I highly recommend you play this game.

I'll probably play it a bit more later.. It's just so colorful and sweet. Also, the devs are still adding stuff to the game, it seems.\n\nIf you're looking for a min-maxing game to really tickle your dopamine glands and get you hooked on its layered progression, this isn't it. It's too one-dimensional to appeal to the hardcore idlers.\n\nIf you're not really in it for the number crunching and just want a pleasant idling / clicking game though, this is probably the best one on Steam in that regard.

You choose what to plant and your helpers will harvest for you or you can actively click to harvest for yourself. The money earned from harvest can be used to expand the garden, increase the value of your harvests and increase the time your helpers will harvest after you close the game. There are also various garden invaders that will try to steal your harvest, but you can hire guard dogs and place scarecrows to scare them off. The more of something you have the more expensive it is to purchase the next of that item which promotes diversity in what you put in your garden. You also gain experience from harvesting to level up and unlock more things to buy or increase the value of harvests along with getting more helpers to harvest for you.\n\nI loved playing harvest moon and always wanted to play it on PC, this definitely scratched the same itch and is a very zen experience as you tend your garden. There is a slight learning curve with having to use the trash can and click on the little plant sign and then click the other trash can in the top left corner to remove plants, but once you figure it out it's pretty easy to manage your garden. Once planted things won't die and the harvests will never rot so the only way to lose anything is from the invaders which can be defended against using guard dogs and scarecrows. I have really enjoyed this game so far and it looks like I have plenty of game left to play, at this price point you definitely get your money's worth.","February 17","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not usually a "clicker" kind of gamer. I was given a review key for the game which is the only reason I even bothered at all. 3 hours later (2 1/2 hours after recording) I found myself glued to screen not realizing how much time had passed.\n\nYou and your little blooper friend start off with one plot of land. Every time a crop grows you earn a specific amount of gold for that crop. The amount of gold you earn will increase with the different "tier" of crops you unlock. You can upgrade the base amount of gold you earn by purchasing manure later on. In addition to basic level farm plots, you also can grow berry bushes, trees, and heard animals. All of these will yield gold for you, the farmer. Be warned however that other animals will try and steal your crops therefore reducing the amount of gold you collect. You can purchase an animal a little later on that can help defend your crops. The selling point for me about this game is that you really don't have to be too active for your farms to collect gold. The little blooper friend will collect all the fruits, veggies, and products produced by animals when they are ready for collecting. I actually have the game running in the background as I type this review. You also don't have to keep the game on overnight as there is an afk system built in that will last for about an hour (default, can be upgraded) where you farm will still continue to collect gold.\n\nPros:\n- Cute graphics\n- Easy to understand controls\n- Progression based\n- Afk system\n-  Extremely addicting\n- Soothing music\n- Very resonable price\n\nCons:\n- Can get too hectic if you are trying to be actively involved (very minor con)\n- Seriously...I can't really think of anything else.\n\nTL:DR Progression based farming clicker with an AFK system built in that can help you play the game.\n\nThis is my very first review so if it's a fail, I am ok with that.

Yes your right this game is not my cup of tea, but it is well made and runs just fine, all contols of the game work the way they are meant to.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmileOnSpeedDial/recommended/421040/","SmileOnSpeedDial","SmileOnSpeedDial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmileOnSpeedDial/","628 products in account","Clear cut "clicker" game mixed with a Farmville theme. As expected you start the early game massively spamming your mouse button trying to collect carrots. After upgrading from carrots and gaining more "helpers" (the blue guys that are sorta aimless and don't help TOO much) you begin to realise that you don't end up clicking less but only clicking more. As the trees/bushes both drop fruit it will be stacked quite high on the ground while playing since your helpers are slow at collecting the fruit.\n\nGraphically this game is a sprite based 2D game as most clickers but it has a nice charm to it. The characters are quite cute and the sprites are clear to tell apart with colours being very vibrant. The music and sound effects though leave much to be desired. The same short music loop plays endlessly for the entire game so you will be muting that quite quickly and when collecting fruits and other things they make the same "clink" coin sound every time. This means by mid-game you will be hearing that more than 10-times per second.\n\nLike other clicker games (Sakura Clicker among others) while you're not in the game your workers will still collect coins. This is good but this system is usually easily exploited by changing the computers clock time (may not work on this game). Otherwise this game is a very app-like game with mass clicking which is no suprise since the developers last game was a mobile game.\n\nI'd say for $2.99 this game does not have DLC or any Microtransactions so you can get a full clicker experience here with a new theme and cute art design. If you enjoy clickers than this game will feed your strange addiction 7/10.","February 9","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It feels simple to start off, but as you progress through the game and your garden expands, there is more management and defence of your income that is required of you. It requires you to manage your money and security devices like guard dogs and scarecrows to protect your gardens while you keep the flow of income going. Ive been playing a lot of violent games and am a huge fan of the retro FPS genera, but I have to really say this was a great break in the carnage and easily ate up my time, I plan to keep playing this and see how deep it goes.
