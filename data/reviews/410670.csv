As there are many bad RPGMaker games and bad cheap games, that doesn't sounds much appealing, right? This game is actually a big surprise!\n\nBy the terms of gameplay, it's still the good old system we know from, for example, Final Fantasy. But what makes this game great is the ubiquitous jokes and critics that aren't just about business sphere - They have made jokes of almost everything! Undertale-like puns? Check. Gaming critique? Check. Culture references? Check. Political humour? Check. Controversial humour? Check!\n\nThis game is here for a price of a cheap coffee, offering few hours full of fun and entertainment. You won't regret buying this if you don't mind the gameplay and crazy graphics.\n\nPros:- Jokes in every corner.\n- Unique graphics style. It's lazy style but it perfectly fits the comedy that the game offers.\n- Very low price.\n- Steam achievements.\n\nCons:- JRPG grinding. Some places feel a little like a Zubat cave. But it's not that bad here as in other (serious) games of the genre. I was still missing something like Repel.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 11","true","6.4"," 51 of 55 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","51","55","3","0"

The battle sequence is the usual turn by turn RPG style, but that's certainly not a bad thing at all! In fact, I'm glad that the battles are like this, as it makes me nostalgic.\n\nThe writing, my GOD the WRITING! If you see this, TALK TO EVERY PERSON AND EXPLORE THE WORLD!!! The humor in this is glorious, taking its own environment and making little jokes about it (for example, a person very early in the game is called Loanrenzo)! not only this, but it references so many memes that are currently popular, such as Tai from Youtube (fuel units), Donald Trump (small loan of a million dollars), the clocks reading 4:20 and many more! Many a chuckle was had while playing this lovely gem of a game.\n\nI'm still not finished with this game yet, as I've only played for about an hour at this moment of time but my goodness it's amazing, I mean, why are you still reading this review?

It lacks nuance in its commentary and presentation, making for a drab, boring, and repetitive experience.  Yes, we get it, that's corporatism for you - but it's overkill in a medium where you need to hold the audience's attention.  Admittedly, this was accomplished well with the intial plot, but it couldn't make up for the rest of the experience, which just wasn't fun.  Again, perhaps that's the point - but this is supposed to be an interesting RPG, so there needs to be more redeeming qualities.\n\nThings I still liked: the plot, creative graphics despite budget art, the concept.","January 7","false","0.2"," 114 of 194 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","114","194","8","8"

I wanted to like this game, the artstyle and surreal atmosphere/setting drew me in, having thoroughly enjoyed titles such as undertale and LISA, I imaged I was in for a similar ride. Unfortunately this was not so, this game was generally not very enjoyable, simply due to how it was executed. I'll start off with what I liked first though.\n\nIf you don't want to read a wall of text, skip to the conclusion at the bottom\n\nThe artstyle is, very very interesting, it is something that has drawn alot of people in, it gives the game a unique feel, and enemy sprites were generally interesting to look at, surreal, pen drawn abominations in suits and political cartoons. Secondly, the music is another striking feature of this game. Like the art style, it is very atmospheric, and just fits very well with the setting of the game. There isn't loads of music, but there isn't a lack of it either. Another "strong" point of the game is the humour. I have mixed feelings about the humour, I did chuckle at the various references to modern politics and some puns did make me laugh, but at times the humour felt very forced, or just, didn't make any sense. Lastly, there is Jerome. Jerome is good.\n\nNow, onto the negative aspects, the first main issue is combat. Combat is extremely simplistic, you only ever have two party members (apparently there is a third somewhere?) with an incredibly simplistic and limited range of abilities. Fights mainly consist of stocking up on sandwichs, and just attacking enemies in a war of endurance. Sandwichs get you through this game, not any strategy. Random encounters are also extremely common and frequent. Secondly, there is plot, the game's plot is apparently a business man's descent into corruption.Well, not really, you complete a couple tasks for your capitalist overlords, and then, police attack you for some reason, and you somehow windup leading a revolution through a series of events that don't make sense. At the end of the game, the last boss decides to drop about 5 bombshells on you with no warning. Everything about the plot is dull, forced and just badly executed. Another strong negative point is the writing in general, again, everything is just forced. Some jokes, as stated did make me laugh, but there's alot of dialogue that, seemed to be a joke, but just wasn't funny. The last thing, is that, it just doesn't feel like there's any point to the game, it's wasted potential. This game is very quirky in some ways, with it's artstyle, curious setting and the fact that all plants have female names. There is potential here to make a really damn good and unique RPG. But this game fails to say anything about politics other than "Corporations are bad!" or really make you feel anything. The plot is just a series of events that happen.\n\nOh, one very last point, Jerome should say more, you don't hear a peep from him after he becomes a party member, he could've been a great comic relief character.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nPros\nGreat artstyle\nUnique music\nInteresting setting\nJerome\nHumour covers a diverse range of topics, seems to be based more on personal tastes\nExtremely cheap\n\nCons\nExtremely Monotonous gameplay\nHumour and writing seems forced at times\nPlot doesn't make any sense, just a sequence of events\nPoor execution in general, wasted potential\nNot enough Jerome\n\nAs a final point, other people seemed to have liked this game alot more, so it is quite possible you'll enjoy it more than me, plus the price is extremely low.","January 17","false","3.6"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","19","28","2","0"

Otherwise, pretty good.\n\nSuits is a short RPG maker game heavily inspired by OFF. As one can see by the other reviews, the game's main selling point is its dark humor and the references it makes. The game refuses to take itself seriously all the way to the very end, and that can actually hurt the game's story at some points, even though the plot itself is pretty simple.\nThe artstyle and the music are very unique and go along pretty well, strengthening the game's unsettling atmosphere.\n\nThe gameplay is alright, but could use some improvement. There's a ton of secrets and optional events to find in every single area, which gives Suits some replay factor, but the battles are a bit too simplistic. Even though each character feels very different from the other two, the entire game can be beaten by using the same combination of 2-3 commands, only stopping every now and then to heal your party, but thankfully the game ends before this can become too repetitive.\n\nWith all that said, though, this is definitely one of the most unique and interesting RPG maker games on Steam, and definitely worth every cent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arishako/recommended/410670/","arishako","Arishako","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arishako/","27 products in account","The biggest drawback to this game, in my opinion, is the combat system. I'm a fan of turn-based combat in general, but this was terribly monotonous. This was mostly because it rarely seemed good to actually use your skills. The main character's regular attack quickly started doing about as much damage as his lowest cost offensive skill, and fights were generally over by the time I'd saved up enough TP for higher leveled ones. The first supporting character came with skills to attack all enemies at once, but the vast majority of the time I was fighting single opponents. Buffs and debuffs also felt to me like a waste of a turn in this game, although I might have just not had the right strategy. Most of the time, this wasn't too bad, but it made any area with random encounters feel like a pain just to slog through.\n\nThe story is interesting enough to keep me engaged regardless of the combat. I'd say the writing can often be heavyhanded. There were times I got the impression that it was trying to hard to explain the joke/satire, which often ruined it. That said, there were also moments that worked really well and made me laugh, and also monsters that were unique. I'd recommend fans of RPGMaker-style games give it a shot.","April 29","true","4.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Plus, I sold the trading card drops for $0.52, I believe? So, it was kind of only $0.13.\n\nThat said, while the game has potential and charm, it's got plenty of very strange design choices and features that don't seem to work right. The most annoying of them being that interacting with objects takes place on the tiles around them, rather than the objects themselves. This means that unless you're standing in the right spot, nothing will happen when you search a crate, or look at something, which makes you think that nothing is supposed to happen. The art is pretty rough, but it's unique, at least. Anyone that avoids using RPG Maker's default assets deserves some credit. Soundtrack is wacky but enjoyable. Story is... something...\n\nOne of the game's stronger points is probably it's use of references and humor. There were plenty of moments that I had a genuine laugh at.\n\nI've seen people imply that it's on the same level as LISA, and that's not even close to the truth, but I did enjoy my time with it. I'd definitely check out a sequel, as long as the price was kept as low as this was.","January 11","true","8.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Very often indie game creators tend to dismiss negative reviews by saying that those are written by people who just expects AAA game quality or care only about graphics, while the truth is, many times their games offer absolutely nothing of substance. This one does. It's very unique. It has funny moments, it's engaging and can actually serve as a satirical commentary on many political issues. Graphic style suits it very well. There are few rather annoying moments, but other than that, I can't say bad word about it. And it costs only 0,99â¬.

If you don't enjoy it, you will after playing this game\n+ Subtle deeper message, that isn't shoved in your face\n+ Plays like a simple, oldschool, turn-based JRPG\n+ It took me about 4 hours to beat this game, so if you're looking for a cheap, little RPG to kill some time, definitely consider this one\n+ It has a feeling of a weird dev's childhood fantasy to it, which makes it really cute in my opinion\n+ General concept\n\n- The artstyle might not be everybody's cup of tea\n- I kinda found the endboss fight to be... lame\n- There is one sidequest where you have to wait 5 minutes and you can't be tabbed out of the game during this time frame because the ingame time won't pass otherwise\n- The core of this game lies at its hilarious dialogues, object interactions and humour in general. If you aren't into the game's kind of jokes, you possibly won't enjoy it\n- It may be a little difficult at some points, if you don't plan on fighting most of the enemies and rather skipping them\n- The general bossfight strategy stays the same throughout the game\n- Although the game's concept and story is great, it lacks in presentation at some points. You may not fully understand what's going on if you don't follow the dialogues attentively\n- If you are not into indie games in general, chances are you won't enjoy Suits. I've tried to come up with a better explanation for this statement, but let me just put it like that: Where Undertale is considered to be extremely "tumblr", Suits is tremendously "indie"\n- Aside from the humour, the gameplay itself is kinda repetitive. You run around fighting enemies, buying stuff, healing yourself, talking to NPCs and plants and finding yourself in odd situations\n\n=> To recap everything I've just said: If you enjoy experimental, indie rpg games that are comical and odd in their own way, you're most likely going to enjoy Suits. If you aren't amused by it's humour and feel bored due to the gameplay, you might wanna avoid picking this up.","January 13","true","4.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I'm very glad I did.\nSuits a business RPG is a role playing game where you take up the role of a businessman who just graduated from business school. Since cooperations rule the planet in this universe.\nFor me the humor was on point and reminds me a bit of Rick and Morty, just enough dark humor and unexpected twists in it that makes it funny for me. 4th wall breaking, Easter eggs, and dark humor.\nGameplay wise it reminds me of Earthbound. There is some level grinding and yes there is no free healing, however that is usually how this genre of RPG works. There is some grinding, but I never got tired of it, mostly because I kept wandering around into random peoples' houses.\nUsually I don't like bringing up the graphics since that is never the selling point for me, however I think it fits the dystopian 1984 vibe the developers were going for. The hand drawn backgrounds makes the game a bit more memorable in my eyes.\nHonestly the best part about this game besides the concept and humor is the exploration. I usually just wander around and loot everything in sight. Which leads me to discover things, I won't spoil anything since playing this game without knowing anything that pops up is satisfying.\nAlso it is not an Undertale clone, I know my Undertale playtime isn't much, but I have played on another friend's account quite a bit to understand the gameplay and mechanics. They are similar only because of the genre they are in. 2D turn based RPGs. It is like saying every tennis video game ever conceived is a rip off of pong. Or every FPS is a ripoff of Doom. (Note: Undertale is an awesome game, I still highly recommend it, I just saw people calling this game a ripoff.)\n\nMy final verdict:\nSuits is a good game, although humor is\nprobably going to fuel most of your enjoyment if you don't like the visuals or gameplay. So Suits isn't for everyone, but it is very lowly priced so honestly it is worth a shot. Plus steam refund exists now if you really really don't like the game that much.\n\nPros:\nGood humor\nNice visuals\nInteresting concept\nExploration\nGood sound (when there is any)\nIsn't an Undertale ripoff like many people seem to think.\n\nCons:\nLack of sound\nGrinding\nCan be difficult for newcomers to the genre.\n\n9/10","January 11","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In all honesty, I liked OFF a little more, but I did enjoy this game. For a dollar, it's totally worth it, even if it's only a couple hours long.\n\nThe gameplay itself wasn't very inspired. I found myself using the same three strategies the entire game: Use Staple Down to disable strong, single enemies, use Staple Storm to beat groups, and attack the rest of the time. Ultimately, you should sail through it, as long as you be sure to get the best equips at all times. One interesting note is that most of your funds come from doing optional things, rather than only battling. That's pretty cool, because it gives you a reason to explore a little, even thought it's not exactly a vast world.\n\nThe visuals are very unique and interesting, but if you don't love the general uniqueness, you'll likely hate it, because it's all drawn in black and white. The music is pretty good actually, though not good enough to go searching Youtube for it. Overall, I'd say these are both nice for what they are.\n\nThe most important thing is the adventure, despite everything previously mentioned. The story is an interesting social commentary, with witty bits of comedy scattered through the entire game. The generallly cynical atmosphere is a great change of pace, and the whole game experience is one huge satirical parody of the greed and corruption of those in power and the mundane lives people are programmed to live, working as small cogs their whole lives for these powers. It's really frightening to have to accept this reality, but it's unfortunately accurate. People are expected to live as workers. As for the corporate and political corruption, that's all true as well, just not to a degree where society is openly a place where justice is bought, the poor are used as spare parts and people are punished for not buying things. You cannot deny that there are scandals, however. I believe the CEO of McDonald's once stated that if any of his competitors were to drown, he'd put a hose in their mouth.\n\nTo wrap things up, this game is not expensive at all and a very unique experience, and I would reccommend it for those reasons.","January 12","true","14.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I stumbled upon this and simply bought it because I was looking to expand my library and it was dirt cheap. The real selling point for this game, for me at least, was the fact it was only $.99. If it were any more I probably would not have purchased it. Luckily, I did purchase it and i'm quite glad I did. Ill list some pros and some cons:\n\nPROS:\n- Simple\n- "Good" models\n- Somewhat simple story (can be a con aswell)\n- Cheap\n- Personally, I like the artists style\n- the jokes\n- Trading cards\n- Achievements\n\nCONS:\n- Not particularly long\n- Battle sequences could be spiced up a little\n\nGame was fun and could easily be worth $2-$5.

It may not have the unique high concept of To The Moon or the cleverness of Lisa but what it *does* have, in spades, is an understanding of what makes its genres work.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, it's straightforward Western-style CRPG lite: stat-based combat resolution, heavy on the optional sidequests, with lots of NPCs for fluff and world-building. There are random encounters but repetetive grinding is kept to a minimal. Leveling up is always secondary to moving the story forward.\n\nAs one might expect from the subtitle ("A Business RPG"), the setting is a corporate dystopia that's heavy on the dark comedy elements. It's decidedly more Gilliam's Brazil than The Hunger Games but the devs clearly know their stuff. There are playful nods to everything from Nineteen Eighty-Four to Huxley's Brave New World via Soylent Green and Escape from New York.\n\nThe hand-drawn aesthetic might not be for everyone's tastes but personally I dug it A LOT. In fact, between the scrawled graphics and the tongue-in-cheek vibe, it often feels like a campaign version of Kingdom of Loathing[kingdomofloathing.com]. I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nGranted, there are some minor bugs, like awkward sprite positioning when speaking to NPCs (who may turn out to be plot-crucial bosses). But it's nothing game-breaking.\n\nI'm unlikely to give this a repeat playthrough (I rarely do, in general) but the hours I spent finishing the game were more than worth the reasonable price.","February 3","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

OFF had a much better battle theme, and more pleasant backgrounds, and what felt like a more avant garde tone.\n\nI wish it could've had a deeper meaning, I spent the last half of the game speeding through trying to find meaning behind what was happening, and came up with nothing concrete.\nIn the game there are no women, I can't recall anyone being defined as a man either, but everyone is the same suited person, much like the famous anonymous avatar.\n\nSuits with it's references feels more like commentary on internet culture than it does on buisness/corporations.\n\nThe controls are slippery, interacting with objects is often iffy, in the combat most moves are completly useless, building up TP is near impossible, even at the final boss with the best gear I couldn't build up the TP to ever use the ultimate move.  Combat never felt like a challenge, I had one KO of a party member and it was a one hit kill move.\n\nIt's worth playing, if it's not a strain on your eyes, for a dollar on sale it's worth it.

While I didn't get many of the references/ jokes that were in this game, it kept me going as the plot was personally very interesting (Personally the game felt like earthbound while I was playing through it).\n\nThe gameplay is basically Turn based RPG (like Final Fantasy) where you select your character and he can attack the enemy/ boss. The other moves your characters can do are special attacks which use up a bit of your TP (Tech points) or FU (Fuel), which can either buff up your party members or debuff/ attack enemy's. Of course you can also upgrade your party members with equipment and also buy items to use in fights. Personally I enjoyed this style of game play as it allowed me to strategize a plan to beat the enemy or boss, as each one tends to have their own special move which you will need to work around in order to beat them.\n\nThe graphics I personally feel set the right mood for the game, as you are in a bleak, desolate world ruled by the corporation. The same applies to music as it is plays in all the battles that you have throughout the game but is rarely playing in the overworld, but it contributes the whole atmosphere of the world that you exist in.\n\nPersonally I would give this game a 9/10 overall.\n\nI mean come on its 79p, you could spend your money on worse things.","January 11","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/recommended/410670/","orpe11","orpe11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/","474 products in account","TL;DR: A decent RPGMaker game with a fairly unique art style and aesthetic. Nothing outstanding about it, but the low price point and short play time means it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThe first point of comparison to this game comes easily to OFF, an RPGMaker game made with a similar aesthetic style. The comparisons are really only skin deep though, as the game itself is much shallower than its inspiration. While the inspiration for this game is freely available and this costs about a dollar, it doesn't mean you should pass this up entirely.\n\nIt is clear that this is not a work of laziness at all. The art style is consistent and the enemies encountered tend to be fairly unique, with the exceptions of random encounter areas and a few repeated enemies. The sprites and hand drawn works fit well together, and nothing looks jarringly out of place. The only offense art wise is that practically all encounters start by talking to a generic looking suited dude, who turns out to be something far more interesting in the combat screen. Some of them could have used unique sprites, but that is a small complaint.\n\nGame-play is bog standard. You start with one character, and can acquire two more through a bit of exploration. Notably, the first party member is easily missed if you don't take the time to get him, and he can be lost forever, just like the second one. If the game suffers anywhere, it is that the game is exceedingly easy if you have a remote skill at RPGs. Every encounter, boss or not, can be solved by a combination of the second characters staple ability to paralyze them, and then wailing on them till it needs repeating. Some healing might be required, but the game doles out cash and healing/recovery items quite often. Any more complex strategies are not needed, and there are no elements or weaknesses to worry about, and very few buffs get used outside boss self-buffs or debuffs. No grinding is really necessary, but the game could have used some variety in the challenge, as there is really nothing to differentiate bosses from each other, other than attack animations and some spikes in damage.\n\nThe story is clearly trying to style itself after OFF, with that weird world-vibe, dystopian appeal, and twisted characters in battle. The main way it falters is that the game really doesn't build on the world at all. OFF has characters telling tales to you as you go through the areas, and its clear the place has a mythology. This game attempts that, but so much of its writing is spent telling one-off pop culture jokes and references that any potential world building is lost. Half of your encounters are jokes or references to something, when the game time could have been spent building the world. Where OFF tells a story of a world where everything is, well, off, this game tells a story about a world where everything is a reference that will become dated in time, with a vague plot about huge faceless corporations and drones beneath.\n\nIn summary, the game is short, cheap, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It hints at a sequel, and it would be nice if they built on what they have to be more than pop-culture references, but that is not in this game. Buy it, play it for four hours or so to fully complete it, and decide for yourself if you want to give the developers a chance to further develop it.","January 16","true","19.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/recommended/410670/","muenzz","Love9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/","322 products in account","The short version is: This game has a great concept but gets ruined by it's bland as hell Combat, Story and by it's downright terrible sense of humor which only consists of references to internet memes and jokes or puns which is so heavily forced the entire game that this was just painful in the end. I don't recommend it, even for this price.\n\nThe long version is: Suits is a RPG that sparked my interest, not only because of the visuals, but also because it seemed like  funny, kinda new idea in doing so. That the game would be a bizzare trip with dark humour mixed in it, i knew from the start, the screenshots kinda gave it away.\n\nWhat i didn't expect was, that the game accomplishes nothing throughout the entire 5 hours of my playtime. The entire game is heavenly inspired by Earthbound or in general the mother series, one boss battle even being a straight homage to one of the bosses in Mother 3. Even one of the companions you find on your way (which there are only 2 to find in total anyway) has a move similiar to the character Duster from Mother 3, even almost looking the exact same. The problem is, that every single battle feels exactly the same. There is no real strategy or no real difficulty, go with the same strategy as before and you are sure to win the entire game without a problem.\n\nLike mentioned before, the artstyle is what got me interested in the game, i really adored the mix of pixel characters and the handdrawn, clumsy, dark and gritty pen drawings. No enemy in this world looks normal, all of them take the form as some deranged and weird creatures and monsters.\n\nThe music score is nice and one of the stronger points, but one thing, ONE big thing that ruined the entire game for me:\n\nThe writing and the humour.\n\nThe humour is such pure and utter cancer it ruined every single serious, dark or good tone the game had for me, even the story. This game is worse with it's jokes than games like Borderlands and Undertale combined, that just don't manage to shut up with their jokes for even a second. But i think Suits takes the cake for me in this category. There wasn't one joke that wasn't a reference to an internet joke, memes, puns, selfirony (man this game sure sucks right guys??), current pop culture or video game jokes.\nSometimes the characters were talking downright jibberish or random nonsense, presented to you as a joke, that was unsuprisingly, not funny at all. On occasions, the game tries jokes on politics or, well, business, but they fall down flat on their nose aswell. They usually end up that both parties are dumb and thats it, there isn't much to it. There is nothing clever, nothing makes a statement about anything and so forth. And this goes on throughout the entire game, making you not caring at all for anything in this game. Because, well, everything is just a joke right?\n\nAnd if the point really just is "yeah it's supposed to be dumb because business is dumb and it's self irony" or similar, then sorry, i can't take your game serious in anyway, this has been overdone without end by other games and it will always just strike me as a bad excuse for your lazy effort.\n\nBut when i look at what Youtubers they put in for a gag, i'm not suprised the developers would find constant 420 jokes hilarious and what the final product looks like. It's just a shame, that such a good concept and idea gets ruined by such trivial needs of portraying yourself funny or witty.\n\nI don't recommend this, not for 1 dollar or for less. With that cash you can buy a drink, and that one is probably more refreshing than this game.","January 13","false","5.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","7"

Not-bad. The only problem I've been having now is that Esc is not working in the game for me. Outside of the game, Esc still works. Is it just me? If it helps, it only happens once in a while. Also, sometimes when I press down shift and the control button, the black background turns white and my screen shrinks, goes in the top left, and the main screen stays there. So I have to quit. Without saving. I would also appreciate if you could have a save before quitting option in the options. Cause you said you wouldn't remove the telephones. Overall, it still has lots of bugs.

It's a blatant attempt to capitalize on the success of Undertale, while completely misunderstanding why Undertale did so well in the first place.

I was able to complete Suits in about 4 hours, however those 4 hours were quite dense with content. The art style of Suits is akin to OFF, Space Funeral(2 tablets to paradise), and Thank God for the Rain(never completed). The gameplay is like a typical RPGMaker game, so it's not overly complicated in any way. You don't have to grind very much, and if you buy the equipment upgrades every now and again, you'll be fine. There's a handful of silly political missions to be done if you take up the jobs offered by the left and right wings in some areas, but what I found to be the most interesting political aspect of Suits is that the game seems to take a more bipartisan stance (well, okay, there WERE some marxist themes to be fair...) to politics and focuses more on The Guy's process of detangling the grip of an unregulated, dominating corporation(stick it to the man, man.) on Suits City. It seems to paint politics as a side issue to a larger one at hand, rather than weaving a less than subtle political agenda into it.\nI found the save feature to be amusing, but would've liked a health/FU/MP restore upon save like other RPGMaker games, but that's not entirely necessary as you can restore your health easily with some disposable income. You can also skip one of the tasks if you take the secret passage in one of the bushes to the left of the W. bank if you want to get into the bank in the Financial district faster.\nMy favorite songs (in the BGM folder) would have to be WallPuncher, AdvancedSharkness, and PainStation; each were catchy but unique while supplying the game's environment with an almost ambient sense of dread.\n\nOr maybe it's just Marxist overthrow simulator....\n\nLastly, check out the bushes on top of the office building for a fun little reference, go into the painting, and of course THANK YOU BASED MJ\n\n\n(I might go back and edit this eventually if I remember anything I might've missed.)","January 21","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I didn't regret - especially at its price it's a fairly enjoyable (although very easy) RPG.\n\nThe humor is quite surreal and the artwork is a pretty great black and white pencil style. I enjoyed the weird soundtrack as well (reminded me in part by the soundtrack for LISA: The Painful RPG... except perhaps for the dinosaur song).\n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means. The controls are a little buggy sometimes and the enemies are oddly unbalanced depending on where you are (although you're usually given enough healing items so it's not a big deal - I went through the entire playthrough without having a single game over). The story definitely has some great moments, although is somewhat incoherent in places. In my playthrough the F12 hadn't been fixed so trying to take a screenshot with F12 would result in the game going back to the main menu and me having to start again from my latest save - this should definitely be fixed.\n\nIn summary I found the game enjoyable for its price and found that the humor and art in itself was worth it. I spent roughly 5 hours to complete it (and it appears I missed a few things), but I took my time so it can probably be beaten faster than that,\n\nIf you like odd RPGs and aren't offended by the artstyle then I'll definitely recommend this for the low price.","January 9","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's start with the key point of any rpg the story at many points in the game you'll be doing some things that make you stop and say "why?". For instance at the very beginning of the game at the end of the tutorial you'll see a school full of kids executed and later you'll have a boss fight to get a man a rubber ducky. The humor is bizarre although I did chuckle occasionally but not enough to redeem it overall. The combat is reminiscent of Earthboumd though done less spectrally in fact early in the game you get a skill that lets you pay x amount of money to win. And then they die, yes literally die, this is so stupid and takes any attempt at tension out of boss fights. You just farm money for a while and then use it to buy off any challenging fights. "So the story is why and the combat is stupid so is there any good points?" yes actually the price is very reasonable and if you're looking for something unique then suits is definetely a fair purchase. Fair warning though you will need to turn off any system sounds because if you don't every time you press a button you'll be hearing the alert sound","January 9","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From going on an acid trip to beating up old ladies with super wheelchairs, this game never fails to amuse.  Many games attempt to be humorous and end up sacrificing the integrity of the story for a few laughs, however the humor in this game only compliments the story, emphasizing just how messed up the corporate world of the game is.\n\nBeing an rpg maker game, obviously this game doesn't have the best graphics in the world.  However, the aesthetic that the designers went for fits in perfectly with the game and the story.  If you hate games with pixelated graphics then this isn't for you, but it certainly isn't visually unappealing.\n\nThe music in this game is pretty good, but it's nothing special.  It helps to emphasize the mood of the game pretty well, but it's nothing I would ever listen to outside of the game.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's just a basic rpg.  You encounter enemies and fight them, but with a business twist to the combat.  Overall I felt the leveling system and the enemies were very well balanced, I didn't really feel the need to grind at all.  One unique element I really enjoyed was the ability to "buy out" enemies, where you can pay the enemies to lose the fight.  The more powerful the enemy, the higher the cost to buy them out.\n\nOne downside I've found is there are a few bugs and spelling errors, however the developer has been very active in the discussion boards, and has been responding to any bug reports or spelling corrections very actively, and the game has updated several times already since its release a few days ago.  None of the bugs I've encountered are game breaking, and the developer is in the process of fixing them.  By the time you've read this review, there might not even be any left to worry about, so I really wouldn't let this deter you from buying this game.\n\nScores:\n\nStory: 10/10\nDialogue: 10/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nMusic: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\n\nTL;DR: This game has hilarious dialogue and a pretty great story, and the graphics, music, and gameplay are pretty good.  It's only one dollar, so you should really just go ahead and buy.","January 7","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself sharing one of the game's jokes with a friend every five to ten minutes (it doesn't hurt that puns crack me up every time.) Juxtaposing this humor with the bleak atmosphere of the game makes for an interesting experience.\n\nI love the atmosphere and the delivery of the game's message (if one was intended to be delivered at all.) At first I was decieved into thinking the game would just be delivering a direct non-subtle anti-corporate message. It ultimately did deliver that message but it is pretty quickly tempered by some good old-fashioned moral ambiguity.\n\nThe internet seems to love a game that leaves you with questions and theories and if that sounds up your alley, look no further than this game.\n\nMy only issue with the game was the ability to find a dominant strategy that allowed me to beat every lone-wolf enemy with ease. I would have liked to have seen more groups of enemies as they forced me to think more about the battles and pay attention to what I was doing. However, this is small pickles in the grand scheme of things and is not enough to let anyone get away without buying this game.","January 10","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your classic black and white adventure, that really sets you in an empathetic mood with the protagonist, Phillip, (or whomever you decide to be) A great mood of crush oppression. You'll find yourself inspecting every element of the map to see what clever antidote you can find, even double backing just to make sure you didn't miss a crack in the wall! Love those cracks! The storyline is pretty straight forward, and the overarching point you realize at the end gives you reason to pause to think on how corporations come to be. (I mean wasn't Walmart once a young struggling CO trying to revolutionize its industry?)\nThe artwork, is well interesting :D a quick doodle scanned into paint then bam you have your texture!\nThe soundtrack is decent enough, I find no faults in it, except that it wasn't really rememberable ... (Except itâs a DINOSUAR!)\nMy biggest gripe would have to be its gameplay. It has almost no balance, you start off with T1 equip. and nearly get murdered by badies, but you get T2 armor and they can't touch you (NULL). Then you'll get dropped into a new area and your hero is now a zero, and you'll begin to calculate the risk and reward of the encounters ie, (this badie drops 150$ when killed but 3 sandwiches are required to replace life lost, and at 200$  a sandwich I'll be able to survive ... 12 random encounters ... dang...) Boss fights are rather easy just spam staple then just bludgeoned them until they become unparalyzed or die, easy, But those random encounters with multiple enemies, they suck... (but a better bomb will get the job done!)\nBut in the end I ended up wanting to finish it (which is saying a lot)\nSo in the end for the low low price of 0.69$ I give it 6/10!","January 10","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was good and there were many secrets. However, I did have a few problems with the game. The major one being events when I tried to interact with objects. Since the event was place in front of the object instead of being the object itself, these events sometimes got in the way when trying to interact with other objects or NPCs. The other problem I had with the game was that it was very quiet some of the times. I could barely here the music in some sections and that slightly disappointed me cause the music is really good.

The story was good and there were many secrets. However, I did have a few problems with the game. The major one being events when I tried to interact with objects. Since the event was place in front of the object instead of being the object itself, these events sometimes got in the way when trying to interact with other objects or NPCs. The other problem I had with the game was that it was very quiet some of the times. I could barely here the music in some sections and that slightly disappointed me cause the music is really good.

Now I know the game is actually way too cheap.\nSuits: A Business RPG is one of those video games I'd recommend to anyone who thinks all indie games are just gimmicky, cash grabs with minimum effort put into them.\nA lot of attention went into this game, from the NPCs to the turn based fighting system; I can't find a fault with this game. The turn based fighting system is actually very fairly balanced, and never did I find myself thinking the game was too difficult or too easy. Even the black and white, doodlish style that might turn people off works in the game's favor. It perfectly reflects the bland, mass produced dystopia of a monopoly controlled world where even human life is treated as nothing more than capital gain or loss. It also has a very neat, brilliant ending I dare not spoil. These were some of my highlights.\nCancelling that horrible show The Big BangTheory, I mean, The Huge Boom Hypothesis\nWent on an acid trip that taught me the meaning of life\nGot the Keys to Success\nFound a secret room full of shirtless men\nMet the very sexually attractive game devs whom were not falsely portayed in any way shape or form. Obviously. Only the most perfect men can create such a perfect game.Simply put, it's a fun game. Some reviews assert the game only mocks one topic and bashes it into the ground, but there is so much more to the humor than that. For example, every clock in the game reads either 4:20 or 7:30. You only find out why once you find a piece of paper in a cabinet on a left wing of a building detailing how scientists snuck something into the water supply so the populace would only see these two times. It was actually a very cleverly hidden joke making fun of conspiracy theorists on top of a 420 reference. Blaze it. I feel as long as you don't take anything too seriously and appreciate straightforward humor you'll enjoy the game for what it is.","February 4","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Upon playing it for about fifteen minutes however, you realize you've come across a gem. Suits: A Business RPG is a hilarious take on white collar culture in the form of a Final Fantasy 4-esque RPG. You'll do battle with demented coffee cups, evil corporate bosses (putting a whole new meaning on âboss fightâ), and other business-related denizens using staplers and other office supplies in a turn-based battle system. The game is divided into five main areas, and can be completed in about 2 to 2.5 hours if you stick to completing the main quest. Finding all the secret areas and cleverly hidden jokes within the game however, may take you upwards of 3 to 4 hours, due to the sheer number of Easter eggs included. The developers could have charged more for the game, and I would still feel like I got my money's worth, on merit of the game's humor, story, and Easter eggs.","January 28","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From going on an acid trip to beating up old ladies with super wheelchairs, this game never fails to amuse.  Many games attempt to be humorous and end up sacrificing the integrity of the story for a few laughs, however the humor in this game only compliments the story, emphasizing just how messed up the corporate world of the game is.\n\nBeing an rpg maker game, obviously this game doesn't have the best graphics in the world.  However, the aesthetic that the designers went for fits in perfectly with the game and the story.  If you hate games with pixelated graphics then this isn't for you, but it certainly isn't visually unappealing.\n\nThe music in this game is pretty good, but it's nothing special.  It helps to emphasize the mood of the game pretty well, but it's nothing I would ever listen to outside of the game.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's just a basic rpg.  You encounter enemies and fight them, but with a business twist to the combat.  Overall I felt the leveling system and the enemies were very well balanced, I didn't really feel the need to grind at all.  One unique element I really enjoyed was the ability to "buy out" enemies, where you can pay the enemies to lose the fight.  The more powerful the enemy, the higher the cost to buy them out.\n\nOne downside I've found is there are a few bugs and spelling errors, however the developer has been very active in the discussion boards, and has been responding to any bug reports or spelling corrections very actively, and the game has updated several times already since its release a few days ago.  None of the bugs I've encountered are game breaking, and the developer is in the process of fixing them.  By the time you've read this review, there might not even be any left to worry about, so I really wouldn't let this deter you from buying this game.\n\nScores:\n\nStory: 10/10\nDialogue: 10/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nMusic: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\n\nTL;DR: This game has hilarious dialogue and a pretty great story, and the graphics, music, and gameplay are pretty good.  It's only one dollar, so you should really just go ahead and buy.","January 7","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's start with the key point of any rpg the story at many points in the game you'll be doing some things that make you stop and say "why?". For instance at the very beginning of the game at the end of the tutorial you'll see a school full of kids executed and later you'll have a boss fight to get a man a rubber ducky. The humor is bizarre although I did chuckle occasionally but not enough to redeem it overall. The combat is reminiscent of Earthboumd though done less spectrally in fact early in the game you get a skill that lets you pay x amount of money to win. And then they die, yes literally die, this is so stupid and takes any attempt at tension out of boss fights. You just farm money for a while and then use it to buy off any challenging fights. "So the story is why and the combat is stupid so is there any good points?" yes actually the price is very reasonable and if you're looking for something unique then suits is definetely a fair purchase. Fair warning though you will need to turn off any system sounds because if you don't every time you press a button you'll be hearing the alert sound","January 9","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I didn't regret - especially at its price it's a fairly enjoyable (although very easy) RPG.\n\nThe humor is quite surreal and the artwork is a pretty great black and white pencil style. I enjoyed the weird soundtrack as well (reminded me in part by the soundtrack for LISA: The Painful RPG... except perhaps for the dinosaur song).\n\nIt's not a perfect game by any means. The controls are a little buggy sometimes and the enemies are oddly unbalanced depending on where you are (although you're usually given enough healing items so it's not a big deal - I went through the entire playthrough without having a single game over). The story definitely has some great moments, although is somewhat incoherent in places. In my playthrough the F12 hadn't been fixed so trying to take a screenshot with F12 would result in the game going back to the main menu and me having to start again from my latest save - this should definitely be fixed.\n\nIn summary I found the game enjoyable for its price and found that the humor and art in itself was worth it. I spent roughly 5 hours to complete it (and it appears I missed a few things), but I took my time so it can probably be beaten faster than that,\n\nIf you like odd RPGs and aren't offended by the artstyle then I'll definitely recommend this for the low price.","January 9","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This particular thing made me struggle a lot because you never know when you will need to use the money to win a battle and when to save it, because not only you need money to defeat hard enemies, but also to heal yourself, since there are no inns or similar ''healing centres''.\nThis ''The money is important and you use it for everything'' type of RPG is something I had necver seen before, but it doesn't really make up for the rest of the boring battles, uninspired combat (besides this P2W thing) and a lack of party members and items.\n\nThis said about the combat sistem, the visuals are boring and the music is terribly bland, attempting to recreate an office atmosphere, and it succeeds at it, wich isn't a actually a good thing, because it makes almost every scenario in the game look like the same and it creates a very tedious to explore world.\nThere are some exceptions, like  the drug trip  , but it doesn't make up to make an interesting world.\n\nA minor bunch of bugs and glitches, but nothing important.\n\nI give this game a 5.5/10 counting the humor (wich relies heavily on memes, but sometimes gives a good grin) and the price ( I mean, 1â¬ isn't a big deal).\nSo yeah, go ahead and buy if you have a couple hours to kill.","January 14","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyBones/recommended/410670/","CrazyBones","Crazy Bones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyBones/","822 products in account","Suits: A Business RPG is a new RPGMaker RPG designed by Technomancy Studios. That's the standard stuff out of the way, so let's get into the weird.  Suits starts you off as The Guy, another businessman in line to join the ranks in a world run entirely by corporations, built as corporations. The satire of consumerism and greed is done well, and helps to add to the game's very offbeat sense of humor. The jokes range from the clocks always set to 4:20 as it's simplest, to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a dinosaur's floor at its strangest. This, along wth the setting and atmosphere is what I think makes Suits such a fun game; it's absurd while still being relevant to modern times. The Payday 2 microtransactions joke is a good example, and is done well. The story itself is rather straightforward; notes are placed around to provide back story and clues and the ending sums up the purpose of the world itself and your actions nicely. Oh, and the art and music. Some people were put off by the crude sketch design and music; personally I found them both surrelastic, funny and disturbing enough that they made a perfect fit for the plot.\n\nTo sum it up, Suits is a straightforward PRG mechanically; there are some special abilities like a instant kill that only works 1% of the time, and being able to pay your enemies to lose. There's not much that changes the gameplay itself from other RPG's; instead the focus is on the creative art of the game. Whether you'll like this or not will depend on what you're looking for in an RPG game, but for it's price it's got a decent story length to it and potential for follow up.

Got the game for a song and I thought it was worth the price.\n\nYou play an all purpose businessman in an exaggerated black and white capitalist universe, where everything is a satire of everything that goes along with the nature of economics, politics, entertainment, etc. Enemies are hand drawn in a rough style, with some of them being parodies of real world people. There's a great deal of 420 humor, references, and some â¥â¥â¥â¥ jokes. I found a lot of it just blurred together.\n\nYou can control up to 3 unspeaking characters, although I was able to finish the non-joke ending with just 2, as the third arrives very late in the game. Outside of one or two moments, the game is not hard whatsoever. Combat is extremely simple and requires little to no resource hoarding, nor tactics. I wasn't a fan of that- it's a little too basic. I got through the entire game with just my main character auto attacking and my one side character doing an ability with a single crowd control effect, with the rare occasion of using an area effect attack. You don't really get interesting abilities and a LOT of what you have is too expensive to use more than one or twice without reloading resources out of battle, but you don't really need those abilities either.\n\nAt about 4 hours long, taking my time, but not grinding anything for xp, the game is of fair length for the price. It's not an amazing title in the sense of other really 'out there' indie games like OFF, Yume Nikki, or Space Funeral, but it's fair for what it is and I don't think it's trying to be anything more than that. And that's really just how Suits is. It's not terribly interesting to read the text in the game and the imagery is fairly dull, but it's not bad either. It's just average. I am, however, figuring the price of the game into this. You get what you pay for, and for that, it's quite fair.

But from an hour alone, i definetly recomend it to any RPG fanatic or person who deals with corporate bullsh*t.","February 13","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Inside its surreal atmosphere and surreal enemies (a stapler as tutorial boss, seriously?) you will find satirical--and also random--quotes and images about corporation, capitalism, the internet, modern life, etc.\n\nThe art style and the music go very well together in delivering the dark surreal atmosphere. The story, while might not be  entirely easy to follow (this is a bizarre and surreal world, anyways) is rich with message, though mostly subtle and open for interpretation.\n\nThe gameplay is also simple. The battles don't require much strategizing, which may not please hardcore RPG gamers. Even so, the bizarre enemy designs will not disappoint--where else can you fight lost ties, coffee mugs, loan sharks (yes, they are literally sharks), and Bustin Jieber?\n\nIn short, Suits: A Business RPG is quite a unique piece of art worth your time and money.","February 17","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are thorough, you can find all secrets in one playthrough of about 5 hours.\n\nI was disappointed that Suits: A Business RPG wasn't a satire on corporate America. I was expecting a fuller commentary on United States capitalism. Instead, Suits treats the corporation, capitalism, the judiciary, the bank, and infrastructure as ways to present a curious story. The fact that the main character graduates from business school is only relevant to the plot in that he is on the way to becoming the CEO (who is not really a CEO).\n\nDespite my mistake in expectation, Suits is quirky with some great allegorical content; certain parts of this game will definitely make you raise an eyebrow.","February 17","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This particular thing made me struggle a lot because you never know when you will need to use the money to win a battle and when to save it, because not only you need money to defeat hard enemies, but also to heal yourself, since there are no inns or similar ''healing centres''.\nThis ''The money is important and you use it for everything'' type of RPG is something I had necver seen before, but it doesn't really make up for the rest of the boring battles, uninspired combat (besides this P2W thing) and a lack of party members and items.\n\nThis said about the combat sistem, the visuals are boring and the music is terribly bland, attempting to recreate an office atmosphere, and it succeeds at it, wich isn't a actually a good thing, because it makes almost every scenario in the game look like the same and it creates a very tedious to explore world.\nThere are some exceptions, like  the drug trip  , but it doesn't make up to make an interesting world.\n\nA minor bunch of bugs and glitches, but nothing important.\n\nI give this game a 5.5/10 counting the humor (wich relies heavily on memes, but sometimes gives a good grin) and the price ( I mean, 1â¬ isn't a big deal).\nSo yeah, go ahead and buy if you have a couple hours to kill.","January 14","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The both games are a bit weird, that's why I liked Earthbound in the first place, too.\nI find the hand drawn dystopian-themed scenery and characters appealing and their designs inspiring. The gameplay is simple, and so is the story.\nYou traverse the Suits City to reach the top, going through it's every district.\nEach district has a certain theme to it, and loads of satire. The game is a satire to everything, and yet I found the satire a bit lacking. Don't get me wrong, it was fun, but I think it could have been a bit bolder with the jokes, especially at the Media District.\nIt's great for it's asking price, I just can't not recommend it.","June 3","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are lazy, every character in the game besides you uses the same sprite. The music is unmemorable, and it's hard to tell when its supposed to be playing. The story is generic garbage, that only gets interesting never. It never gets interesting. The gameplay is generic. If you've played Lisa: The Painful, you've played a much better version of Suits. This is also relevant for the humor. If you like humor that isn't just Reddit memes and references from late 2015, and lazy puns, then don't buy this game. If you do, just look up a guide. It doesn't deserve the $1 price point it asks for.
