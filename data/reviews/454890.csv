At least I think so. Now can we do something about the epillepsy-inducing flashing?"\nVertical bullet hell that looks like it was drawn in MSPaint and played to chiptunes made in FL Studio, and only takes 68MB of hard disk space. And you know what? IT WORKS. Classic frantic shmup fare with super-easy-to-see bullets against a pretty pixelated, simple space background, and a lot of random funny stuff flying eveywhere like someone dumped all their Garry's Mod addons onscreen at once with no lag and plenty of "lol wtf". I hope the soundtrack becomes available because dese are some good blips and bleeps for a good gaem!\n\nEDIT: Does Soudncloud have a Purchase and Download option? Because as nice as it was of the creators to note that the composer Forgotten Lords is on Soundcloud, I want dose trax for de car.","April 5","true","3.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","10","13","5","0"

Not to mention that it's awesome but that goes without saying - all bullet storm space shooters are awesome. You can thank me later cause I just saved your weekend(s)\n\n\nPS: Devs: I've got something to confess: I've robbed you.

If I knew it was so much fun, I would have payed this one euro immediately. You are this starship and kill enemies which mostly shoot bullets, you gotta dotch. I thought that would be boring but wrong. Although it is never impossible, it's really challenging. And later in the game you get this feeling of being unbeatable because of your powerful shots.\nReceiving some achievements for example after the epic boss battle with the epic music was so nice!\nI also think, players of the old arcade games will love this one because of its style.\nBUY IT","April 24","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The grafic style is actually very appealing and personal, as are the references to the fictional world created by Lovercraft, with a fair pinch of humor and goofiness. Plus, the retro mechanics and game type are assured to create nostalgia in everyone who likes an old-fashioned bullet hell game.\nTruly a solid choiche for its price. Would absolutelly reccomend.","April 14","true","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've played more than it appears in offline mode, and must say it's worth at least 5 times what they charge for it. serene music, delightfully weird bosses, cool powerup system, an element of randomness, and the mspaint vibe calls to mind another hidden indie shmup gem which sadly hasn't appeared on Steam, the aptly-named Mother â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥er Galaxy. I really recommend Project Starship as an inexpensive diversion for vertical shmup fans; it outclasses several games that cost far, far more (like, for example, buy this 15 times rather than Hurricane of the Varstray once :p ).","May 12","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
