Regicide has two main game modes in it as well as several ways to enjoy said game modes, I'll briefly explain those now. First off, we of course have classic chess, there's not much to say about this one as it's literally just chess with Warhammer pieces. The other 'game' is Regicide, Regicide is chess where you're allowed to use weapons and abilities on top of normal chess rules, making the game a more traditional TBS game, these weapons and abilities are used in a separate 'phase' to movement and everything costs action points so you have a limit to what you can do each turn. Regicide can be enjoyed in a Campaign mode as well as online and offline Skirmish battles while Chess is only available through online and offline Skirmish.\n\n+It's a very nice looking game and the character models are all very detailed\n+Both game modes are thoroughly enjoyable, I for one prefer the chess mode since I loved playing the regular game and haven't really been able to find a good alternative in the gaming world\n+The pieces/characters are all well animated, particularly in the brutal mini-cutscenes that play when you take one of the opponent's pieces\n+As well as providing you with some basic abilities for Regicide, you can unlock more by spending the experience points you earn by playing\n+There are several different difficulty levels for the offline skirmish mode bots, particularly helpful if your chess skills are a bit rusty and you want to ease yourself back into the game\n+The Regicide campaign provides some fun levels, usually with a small number of enemies and obstacles etc. The campaign does have a story to it but I didn't pay much attention to it\n+The soundtrack is great and fits nicely with the game as a whole, particularly the main menu score\n+As well as abilities, your experience points can be used to purchase cosmetic changes for your teams, e.g. different skins\n+Excellent voice acting\n\n+/-A lot of people have been complaining about the RNG in Regicide. Personally I thought it worked perfectly fine, those complaining probably just got very unlucky or aren't completely aware of how probability/percentages work\n\n-Currently the game only has two races, Space Marines and Orks\n-Currently there's no way to change the map layout. Why is this an issue? Playing Regicide with the board layout of regular chess feels like you're just playing a broken game of chess, there needs to be the option of having layouts such as the ones you find in the Campaign mode where units are more spread out and there's far less of them\n-Regicide only has three maps. Admittedly they each have three variants (for different times of day), effectively making it nine maps but I'd still very much like to see more variation\n\nWorth Mentioning:\nYou have to create an account to play the game and multiplayer is done through that account rather than through Steamworks.\nVerdict:\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nIf you're a fan of Chess, this game is an absolute no-brainer with its great graphics, RPG elements and its brutal execution animations. Even if you aren't a fan of Chess but you do like Warhammer 40k, chances are you'll enjoy the Regicide mode even if not the classic Chess mode.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","September 12, 2015","true","4.5"," 168 of 188 people (89%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","89","168","188","14","15"

Chess classic is, well, the classic mode of chess.\n\nI bought this game to play chess classic with neat looking 40k chess pieces, and I think it's a good game to play if you like chess. The AI is actually difficult to play against on higher difficulty settings. Most new to chess can probably start at intermediate. Regicide chess is an entertaining (and sometimes a RNG infuriating) bonus.\n\nIf you don't like chess, then you've not got any business buying this game. If you want a cheaper chess classic game without the bells and whistles Regicide provides, there's a free chess game on steam and a pretty good Amazon app called ChessGenius. So largely buy this if you enjoy 40k or want to play chess with a twist.","September 10, 2015","true","11.6"," 96 of 106 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","96","106","8","0"

Quite an interesting premise for a game: Warhammer 40k Chess! Yet it's much more than that!\n\nThere are two main modes for this game: Classic and Regicide mode. Classic is basically what it says on the tin: Chess with a 40k skin (and awesome killcams and animations.)\n\nRegicide mode, however, pretty much only keeps the movement and "capturing" of pieces chess-like. In this mode you have abilities, unit actions along the lines of snapping off some shots at an enemy unit, throwing grenades, or going to ground. Also including amazing animations and badass killcams! (Watching the Librarian turn an enemy unit into a fine red mist never gets old.)\n\nThe graphics and audio are top-notch, each unit has it's own unique lines and actor and the models themselves look exceptional!\n\nIn all, I could probably continue rambling on an on, but, to sum it up?

Long Live the King’\n‘Warhammer: Regicide’ is a gloriously bloody reimagining of one of the world’s oldest turn-based strategy games - Chess - set against the violent backdrop of the Warhammer:40K universe. Gorgeous visuals, tactically diverse gameplay and unapologetic violence elevate a classic board game to quite something else entirely.\n\nCampaign: Act 1 - consisting of 10 playable missions - is currently active in Early Access. Act's 2 and 3 are to follow shortly. (This section will continue to be updated)\n\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: Developed by ‘Hammerfall Publishing’ and released in May 2015, gameplay currently consists of two additional Modes beyond the main Campaign: 1. Classic and 2. Regicide. ‘Classic’ Mode: is simply traditional ‘Chess’ but one where your game pieces come to life and engage in brutal combat during movement and capture phases, much akin to the legendary ‘BattleChess’ of yesteryear. ‘Regicide’ Mode: is a different animal altogether - and while the game-board, pieces and traditional movement phases are unchanged from classic Chess - each move is subsequently followed by an ‘Initiative Phase’ where players can use a multitude of unit-and faction-specific weapons and powers (to include: Shields, Psychic Storms, Frag Grenades, Melee assaults, Life-Leeching Powers etc) to attack enemy pieces from range. This opens up a whole range of tactical gameplay options whereby players not only have to consider traditional points of focus such as ‘Protecting the King’, ‘Developing the Center’, ‘Point Values of Pieces’, ‘Combination Plays’ etc, but also contend with the realization that exposed pieces can be quickly cut down from distance. Losing your ‘Queen’ (from an uncaptureable chess position) to a barrage of ranged fire quickly reinforces the point that playing this mode as you might regular chess is suicide.\n\nThe game currently includes two playable factions – Imperial Space Marine’s and Orks (each with 3 Clans/Skins) - and each army is brought to life with richly detailed 3D models, varied and visceral battle animations, and atmospheric sound, making for some of the most satisfying and gloriously bloody battle sequences in recent memory. Additionally, 360-degree rotatable cameras, adjustable height settings and 5 ‘AI Difficulty’ levels (spanning ‘Novice’ to ‘Veteran Master’) allow for a user-customized and scalable experience.  Finally, a serviceable Multiplayer component allows you to matchup with players from around the world or ‘Play a friend’ with local Hotseat functionality, and an 'XP'-based Armoury system allows players to ‘level up’ their game pieces, earn customized load-outs and bag unlockables through a progression system as well.\n\nFlaws: While I am generally loathe to criticize such a well-refined and model ‘Early Access’ experience, featuring user-centric | responsive Dev’s as well as regular updates, it should be noted for purposes of informed choice that Act's 2 and 3 of the Campaign  and 8 out of 12 (~70%) of the aforementioned Weapons | Powers, while in the works, are not active in the current build. Additionally, being restricted to only two playable factions and game boards | environments does dampen overall replayability. While much of the above will be addressed in forthcoming updates, a broader concern is the title’s overall focus on casual players – while largely ignoring both newcomers and experienced chess players. A side-by-side comparison with the standard bearer of chess titles, Ubisoft’s ‘Chessmaster’ or even the ‘Fritz Chess’ series, highlights the lack of both tutorial and learning options to wean in newer players, and progressive | varied AI | swappable chess engines, databases | analysis of classic games, strategies for openings, mid- and end-game, replay options etc that experienced players will look for to constantly improve. The inherent risk then is that without a broad userbase of enthusiastic newer players and a dedicated community of ‘pro’s’, the group in the middle will hit a ceiling and have nowhere to go.\n\nOverall, ‘WH:Regicide’ is a fantastic update of a classic game and nearly 25 years on, and after many a charlatan and imposter, we have finally found the rightful heir to the ‘BattleChess’ throne - fans of Chess, Turn-based Strategy and/or theWarhammer:40K universe, will find a lot to love here. While the lack of tutorial and continuous learning capabilities do hold back its longevity, - stunning visuals, tactically-varied gameplay, an engrossing Campaign and multiple game modes make this a title you will find yourself returning to time and again. Very Well Recommended – Rated (8.7/10)\n________________________________________________________________\n\n[Note:] Review based on WH:Regicide – (Early Access) Release Version 1.3 | Will be updated for major Updates","June 26, 2015","true","139.8"," 67 of 71 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","67","71","8","5"

Meet Battle Chess?\n\nCan this work at all? Surprisingly it works very well indeed!\n\nHammerfall Publishing managed to keep the Warhammer (Strategy) feeling and atmosphere, while using the basic rules of the game of kings.\n\nThe real plus though is, that they added another one and a half layers of gameplay, which enhances Regicide from just being another Battle Chess clone. So, you have a kind of second action phase, after the normal chess moving, where your units can execute different actions, which can have a great effect on your chess strategy (kinda sucks if the chess piece, with which you wanted to close your trap, get´s shot down by the orc boss and so forces you to quickly adapt).\n\n\nThe graphics, animations and sound/music are well done, while not necessarily impressive. There is also a nice single player campaigns with different scenarios, while of course many possibilities for multiplayer.\n\nConclusio: Warhammer 40,000: Regicide can offer fans of Battle Chess as well as Warhammer fans a nice variation of the genre.\n\nPoint Scale 6,5/10","September 16, 2015","true","6.7"," 78 of 89 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","78","89","6","1"

While it takes the basics of chess it has none of the balance nor rules of play. In fact if you try to play regicide mode as a straight up chess match it’s likely you’ll lose. With the ability of gunning down pieces from afar it forces you to adapt on the go and make sacrificial moves. What I like about regicide from a critique standpoint is the way that both rulesets blend and creates a new experience that combines classic chess with more modernized turn based strategy games that in turn creates a fun, enjoyable chess variant.\n\nThe single player campaign is fairly enjoyable for the story and mixes things up in terms of missions. Each mission is not simply a game of chess instead you’re given scenarios and objectives. An example of one is several pawns and knights facing down several enemies and the objectives being not to lose any of your knights as well as killing all the enemies. Maps are also changed for the campaign and will feature impassable objects that can be used as cover. I like that the developers tried to create something different for the campaign and while some missions are fairly enjoyable and keep you employing fresh tactics, some missions are repetitive and outright frustrating.\n\nThe multiplayer on the other hand is the games stand out feature. Facing down friends or strangers with 40k chess pieces never really gets old. Both classic and regicide modes are fun and there’s of plenty of settings to fine tune your game for things such as speed chess. Like most chess games, Regicide does feature asynchronous matches, so you can play several opponents at one. Multiplayer is really where the longevity of this game is at, while the computer AI can be fairly challenging and brutal, it still doesn’t compare to the feeling of a real person on the other end.\n\nThe art style of the game is great with the whole aesthetic really paying attention to the grimness of the franchise. The character models are what stand out the most and each model looks as good as the real life miniatures. What makes the visuals great to look at however is the character animations. In particular the kill cam animations when a piece is taken. The animations are wonderful, gory and outright packed with 40k brutality, they alone make the make the game enjoyable to watch. I however experienced some problems visually, for example the kill cam camera would often fly through objects making the whole experience poor. The game does need some serious optimization in places, on some matches I would keep a steady 30 to 40 FPS range and then on other maps it would consistently tank to as low as 19FPS which frankly for a game that doesn’t have that much going down on the screen at any one point is pretty bad. There are bugs in the game as well as some long loading screens which will all hopefully be addressed in coming patches, however be warned.\n\nOverall Regicide is a great digital Warhammer 40k Chess variant. It has a high standard of quality and is packed with content to the point that for its 15 dollar price tag you can get a ton of value for money out of the multiplayer alone. While little fixes are needed here and there and I would certainly like to see more maps and free additions such as more chapters and clans, there’s very little to complain about in this game. Hammerfall have done a good job with Regicide and while the regicide mode may not be everyone’s cup of tea, classic chess certainly will.","May 5, 2015","true","9.7"," 57 of 70 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","57","70","5","1"

I totally recommend it to everyone! Not only to the players that are Warhammer maniacs but also to every who loves good and unique games!\n\nTo begin with , the game is more than a simple chess game. Chess is more or less predictable but in Regicide this is not the case. With unique set of abilities and choices... you will not be sure what to expect from your enemies and until the final move everything is on!\n\nAnother thing i love in this game for sure is the environment and the graphics that are simply amazing. The game also offers both single player and multiplayer action with a lot of modes and  aspects that will sure keep you busy and can satisfy even the most demanding players.\n\nFor an EA  title the game is really stable  and it will receive regular updates and more content.\nCan't wait to play the campaign as well!  I can see all the hard work of the devs and as a black knight i couldn't be more proud of this game and its release! The price is also really reasonable for what it has to offer.\n\nAnother thing that it is  worth mentioning is that every chess piece has its own unique voice and lines which is really incredible.\n\nIf that was not enough the game features a set of killing moves/finishes of your enemies and the camera close up is really really astonishing.\n\nAll the models are really high detailed , the environments are really vivid  and it is incredible that as close you get with the camera the details remain high and this aspect left me speechless!\n\nThe AI of the enemy is really amazing and even on normal it will be very challenging to beat it so don't expect a easy fight!\n\nThe UI is really good, clean and with a lot of details and helpful tips that introduces the players easily to the game\n\nThis game is the evolution of chess and a great introduction to the Warhammer universe!\n\nThis is not war...THIS IS REGICIDE!

For less than 15 bucks, you get a pretty neat rendition of chess, AND a re-imagined version of chess (Regicide), too.\n\nWhile you can't go wrong with chess in the first place, this game supplements it with some pretty brutal kill scenes, hell, watching an ork get vaporized is rewarding enough for the price tag of $14.\n\nOn top of that, you have Regicide. Regicide follows by the same rules as chess, but with the twist of each piece having various attacks it can perform at different ranges across the board. So, not only can you get an instant kill by jumping on another piece on the board, but your piece can shoot up other pieces if it's within range and has a clear field of view. Again, kickarss kill scenes to be had.\n\nA campaign mode is on the way, but for now, you can play online or with a bot. There's some progress to be made yet, but as it is right now, I'm extremely satisfied with where this game is at!\n\n4/5 would praise the Emperor again.","May 25, 2015","true","3.9"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","34","35","7","0"

(I turned the voices off, cos there are like 2 samples repeating and it drives me nuts...)\n\nI've only played a few hours of the game, and I really like it!!\n\nRegicide incorporates two different rule sets and strategies into one (awesome) new game. It does it seamlessly and in a way that makes both the Warhammer and Chess elements more fun to play!!\n\nThe new rules are very well designed, and it encourages taking risks with your Chess play. You will quickly learn that, in Regicide, any Chess gambits or strategies you usually practise will no longer work! Both the different plays, Chess and initiative, are equally important if you want to win.\n\nClever use of initiative can turn a few cowering prawns into a deadly band of fearless space marine, accompanied only by their captain, that somehow manage to stay alive long enough to brutalise everything on the gib-strewn battlefield... I mean Chess board.\n\nBeing able to remove a piece without capture can lead to a lot of extra strategies - and the AI appears to take account of these and sometimes compensates. Pretty neat.\n\nA game versus the AI on Expert level lasts around 15-20 minutes. That is a challenging, but winnable level for anyone who can't remember what it is like to not know the rules of chess.\n\nDon't bother "warming up" with lower difficulty levels than you plan to start off with - it can feel like a slog and the step up in difficulty and thinking required per level is quite a lot, so it almost made me feel unprepared after facing only the easier difficulties first.\n\nWhether you play orcs or space marines does make a difference - there are slight advantages to both, any they require subtly different tactics to get the best out of the %'s and power-ups.\n\nThere are a few things about the game software itself that let you know it is in development, a few bugs and glitches, but nothing major.\n\nIf the game never had another keystroke of work done on it, I'd think I spent £10 on something that is decent enough already. It is very original and has a good, leisurely action movie kinda pace to it.\nYou don't have to be good or bad at Chess to be good or bad at this - it's Regicide.\n\n\nA 3-4-player team/vs. version of this game is TOTALLY POSSIBLE!!\n\nI hope there will be more races and an army painter, perhaps.\n\nIf there was some scenario or level or board design option, like with Shadowrun - I would be very happy.\nMan, you could even make Space Hulk like levels, or make levels around pieces movement, so that they had to travel a little to reach objectives - you could have movement puzzles, Chess puzzles (but with guns!), intiative puzzles, combinations, chasms, switches, geometry and rotation puzzles... man... I would LOVE a level editor for this game.\n\nOk - decent game, original concept, really awesome! Hope it takes off!\n\nReply value feels like it depends on mood phases, as there are many other multiplayer games i'd choose to play if I only had 1 hour to play... and number of friends that also play the game will probably be low as it's something you either are into, or you are not, I guess... Chess and Warhammer - Who isn't?\n\nFeels a bit like it might go the way of Gauntlet and Space Hulk, where sometimes you don't get a good public game going, because after a short while - people move on to another £10 game.\n\nI will probably be playing it - it is a good end of the day game to wind down :)\nHopefully there will be different and darker coloured maps.\nAnd Chaos Marines and Demons and stuff... And Genestealers. And Harlequins.","May 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 52 of 64 people (81%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","81","52","64","12","0"

I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nWarhammer 40,000 Regicide contains Classic mode which is a normal chess game with Warhammer pieces and Regicide mode where you have a movement phase followed by an initiative phase. Elaborating more into Regicide mode you can still destroy enemies just like in a normal chess game, but the addition of the initiative phase requires a whole new strategy as different units have different abilities, and you are limited to a sense action wise. It will have you adopt a brand new strategy to defeat your opponents. You can unlock more abilities as you play and can choose between the space marines and the orks. You can choose to skirmish or play multiplayer with either gamemode or play the Regicide campaign. There are double XP weekends, daily bonuses, skin for space marines or ork, and fun to watch execution animations.\n\nGraphics/Sound\nThe graphical aspect of this game is highly detailed and well-made and the music helps you focus on the task at hand while you play. The executions are definitely a factor within this games appeal, but I found execution animations only worked with certain characters on certain characters.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Two different ways to play\n+ Great for chess and have the option to disable the executions if you want\n+ Librarium will help you identify roles of each units and the basics or chess\n+ Reskin of pieces are well made and maps/chessboards are detailed\n+ XP boosts, ability to get more abilities, and daily rewards\n\nCons\n\n- Execution is limited to certain characters\n- This in the end is a chess simulator, nothing more\n- Chance aspect in initiative phase of Regicide can be highly frustrating\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile I may not know the Warhammer 40,000 universe that well, I am happy to say this has become a great chess simulator which I will be able to play whenever I am bored, or want to play chess with a little bit more.\n\nTL;DR\nWarhammer 40,000: Regicide is a great chess simulator with added aspects to add to its charm. Regicide mode is fun although the chance aspect of it can be quite frustrating. The execution animations are beautiful, the music helps you keep in the game, and it’s very well developed. In the end it is simply a chess game with some added features in the Regicide versus the Classic mode, but overall very enjoyable and recommendable to anyone who likes chess and the Warhammer skin it has.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","January 5","true","6.6"," 47 of 59 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","47","59","0","2"

While the game is based upon a chessboard, the game has tactical, strategy and some luck in the gameplay.\n\nIf you dream for a Dawn of War, keep dreaming......... or wait for Total War Warhammer, like me.\n\nI don't understand why people expected an Hammerfell Studio build a Dawn of War while this game not only played significantly better but also far closer to the tabletop version of the original game. I am a Dawn of War fan but I won't shy away from a innovative concept in using the Warhammer license.\n\nBefore I get into the content review, i need to inform this: I am also one of those rare players who prefer playing hotseat game and this is one rare game indeed to offer hotseat multiplayer. So my personal opinion will heavily favor hotseat multiplayer rather than online multiplayer.\n\nPresentation vs Performance => 9/10\nYes, this game scores very high in the presentation and performance aspect. Even though my 4 year old laptop could run relatively decent on Beautiful settings, the game keeps its awesome presentation even on low performance settings. Though removed some ambient lights, fog and special effects, it keeps the game well presented and appealing to look at. Yes, on Low the game still look great. I generally run the game on Normal and it look good, really really good. Hammerfell Team handled the Unity Engine with great care and knowledge. This game scores very high in the presentation vs performance aspect.\n\nGame/Graphic/Control Settings: 7/10\nAside the realy really sparse Graphic settings available to the player, the game got a good majority of the required settings available for the player to tweak and adjust, just wish the Graphic Settings is a little more than the current version.\n\nSound: 9/10\nThe audio feels like Warhammer 40k, the game audio was impressively done. It feels like you are into something really epic, serious and get this feeling:\n===================================================================\n\nForget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war.\n\n===================================================================\n\nYeah, that sort of feel. Brutal animation fitting with brutal sound, chainsaw slashing through ork, bolter and shootas blasting each other and psychic energy turn body into goo, heaing it makes my heart feel good :)\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nREGICIDE MODE: My initial thought of the Regicide mode was very close to a tabletop game( yeah, cause is CHESS!) You play like a normal chess game, but you are given 3 points each turn, you can use points to perform snap fire, tossing grenades, assault, pinned, lifesteal and many special ability to damage your foe. The game also have a RNG system, you might missed or score critical hits upon your foe and your foe can do the same. I enjoy the apsect of having special abilities, however sometimes I felt the AI can be very punishing if you halfway beating it, the AI will suddenly score multiple critical, while you suffering missed shot more frequently, thus ruining the core aspec of the game.\n\nCLASSIC MODE: Surprisingly, I spend more time playing classic mode than I played regicide mode. Simply because this mode rely on skill and tactics, and completely remove the element of RNG. You play chess but the chess piece are now Space Marines and Orks and they tear each other apart. This is where the hotseat multiplayer comes in. I play with a friend of mine who play Chess game and solitare, he was incredibly impressed by the game (yeah, he beat me 5:0). He told me he was thrilled seeing an Assault Marine (Armored Dude with Jet Packs) use chainsaw to mow down Lootas Boyz(Orks with laser gun). He ask me how to get such a game, I showed him and he bought the game in a heartbeat, remind you that he never played any of the Warhammer 40k games.\n\nRegicide mode, the core game is fun but sometimes kinda punishing to play, but the side Classic Mode is where the game stands very strongly, cause if the AI or a person beat you, cause you need more practice (Yeah, i suck compared to my pal).\n\n\nAethestic: 9/10\nYeah man, the sheer carnage of the game is what make Warhammer 40k Regicide so great. Nothing beats than seeing Space Marines and Orks smash each other to bits. Chainsword, Bolter, shoota, Assault Cannon, Loota Kitz, Waaarrrggghhh and For the Emperor! I know some people might find the animation repetitive after a few playthrough. I can generally enjoy this aspect and not hit the space button as I play this game in between working on my laptop and checking files or websites.\n\nPrice: 10/10\nWhile certainly not the cheapest game compared to sales games. At RM 30.00 (14 USD) this game is very affordable. The graphics, the sound, the game. Is all milk and honey to me, thus I am happy to said is one hell of a game to have to play on free time and with your pal and siblings.\n\nCampaign: 7/10 Early Access (16 August 2015)\nThis part s probably is weakest part because so many of the good aspect is offered. The campaign is about the Blood Angels investigating an unknown distress relay that led them being trap by orks. The campaign offers a simpler aspect by removing a good majority of the units and putting obstacles that get in the way.\n\nThe intro before each mission pretty weak, still potriats and voice overs concerning the situation. I understand the lack of budgets to do lip sync animation, but still......\n\nYou will be leading a few chess piece with abilities against overwhelming foes. You will on rely on trial and error and surpsisingly less about luck to even the odds. My strategy is to fortify/hunker down and wait for the AI to make an unavoidable mistake, and it works, a lot. Not because of the poor AI but because the set up can be easily exploited if you is first dnd formost a chess player. Snap Shot, supression and bombardment are there to force the AI to come forward to the slaughter. The campaign only become difficult in the later stages, where the above strategy is a literal must.\n\nIf you never played the the early access AND had no experience in Chess than the campaign is a good place to start. But for an early access player who played and understood the gameplay, the campaign serves as the side dish of the entire game. But with Hammerfell going to update up to 3 acts and 50 missions, this side dish is definitely worth checking.\n\nThe bread and butter is still the hotseat, skirmish and online multiplayer(which I not really into).\n\nBugs: 9/10\nThe developer is quick to fix the game. Initally I encountered animation bugs and graphical glitches, in July, the game is nearly freed of bugs and glitches, NEARLY is still the word, and has yet to be seen.\n\nOverall:8.0/10\nHere is some warning, if you are looking to play long hour, total time sink hardcore video game. This is not the game as you are playing chess and tactical turn based strategy game. Or if you dislike AI using international Chess playstyle, you will hate this game. Or you dislike playing hotseat game, avoid avoid avoid......... (what a pity, cause this is a truly great game)\n\nThe campaign will be huge, but is not going to be flashy :(\n\nIf you are a fan of Warhammer 40k or like Sci-fi games, if you like Chess with a lot of violence, if you like incredible challenge and play at busrt from time to time, this game is a simply must have.\n\nIt offers a different dimension for both Chess and Warhammer 40k, and best of all, you can actually play it Hotseat with your family and friends(prefer guys or don't mind violent animation) Time to call your borther you have not been talking with.\n\n\nMy Thought\nIs kinda sad that this game has not a lot of exposure :(\nIs a truly fun game even if you are not a fan of Warhammer 40k :)\nIt has incredible replayability :D","July 18, 2015","true","11.3"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","3"

Hammerfall Publishing is in effect re-inventing chess by adding a whole new aspect to the well-known game of chess. It's basically 50% classic chess and 50% Warhammer 40K all in one neat mix.\n\nIn addition to the classic chess aspect you can also shoot, make close combat attacks, throw grenades at your opponent and even call down a Thunderfire Cannon or Mek Gun bombardment on your opponent - how cool is that!\n\nThe animations, visual effects, sound and game concept etc. is very well done indeed, Here are a couple of links to some neat in-game video so you can see for yourself:\n\nHammerfall Official Youtube Trailer:\nhttps://youtu.be/CC5871U4E4o\n\nUnit Lost Game Review (Quite a long video but it really shows how the game works)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2097&v=crLnoUoheGk\n\nThere is not currently a free Demo and they don't plan on making one at least until final release, but I have no reservations recommending buying access. Though the game is still in Early Access meaning it is still under development, it is already at a stage where I surely feel I have gotten my moneys worth and then some.\n\nSo far the most notable available features are playing either the Orks, Blood Angels or White Scars either vs. the AI in skirmish mode or against other players online in multiplayer mode.\n\nHammerfall publishing are adding new stuff all the time as the development progress. The team is doing a great job especially when it comes to responding to and meeting the request and suggestions and critique from the user.\n\nThough at first glance it may seem a little daunting understanding the game mechanics, the learning curve is not as steep as it might seem. The Regicide Forum is full of helpful information and the users are very friendly and happy to assist, there is even a subgroup called the Black Knights dedicated to helping others with the game.\n\nI hope you give it a try and have as much fun playing as I do.

The UI's not very intuitive and it's quite clear in the presentation that this has long term intentions to primarily be a mobile title, controls wise it works perfectly with mouse and keyboard and touches such as keys to move the camera and multiple mouse buttons affecting camera movement are great additions.\n\nOverall a great title if you feel like playing some 40k themed chess or diving into the more tactical regicide component which adds an interesting spin to it, and the cutscenes from the campaign are enjoyable and add a bit more fluff to your experience.\n\n","September 9, 2015","true","4.0"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","0"

I am a massive old school Games Workshop fan.\n\nThis game is chess with the added abilities of space marines and orks. You play your normal chess moves with auto kills for taking pieces through the usual methods. However, you now get three initiative points, which allow you to fight as if you are on a 40K battlefield, hunker down, throw grenades, activate shields etc.\n\nThis means that the usual boring game of chess (sorry chess heads, but I grew up on computer and war games with dice), is now replaced with a much more tactical battlefield experience. However, you can always just use this game to play to standard chess rules if you want, ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....\n\nAn example would be - oh no I have ended up diagonal to a Space Marine pawn, but have two Orks adjacent. They use initiative points next turn to shoot him up close once each, they pass their hit check and there is one dead space marine. The chess nerd sitting opposite cries into his chess book.\n\nAt the moment we only have skirmish mode with two factions to choose against various levels of AI or human players. However, a campaign mode is planned where you can level up your pieces, and I can only assume that other factions will be added at a later date to spice things up (maybe as paid DLC though).\n\nI think this game is definately going to be worth the current asking price. However, as it is only an early access game, there is always a risk involved. As long as they add what they have promised, then I think the risk is worthwhile. I might wait for the campaign mode to be finished before playing it heavily myself though.\n\nThen it will be...For the Emperor or Waggggghhhh depending on which way I decide to swing.","May 4, 2015","true","7.1"," 55 of 75 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","55","75","8","0"

Thankfully the higher difficulties scale drastically to be a good challenge.\n\nI have played several 3D chess games in my time, from "Battle Chess" in 1994 to "Battle Vs Chess" currently on steam, and I have to say this is my favourite, it could be my love of Warhammer 40k, but I think it is more to do with the fluid gameplay, amazing animations, and great interface with lot's of info, combine it with the Regicide mode, the soon coming campaign mode and this is well worth the £10.\n\nHighly recommended to strategy-game/chess/40k fans.

You can play in a classic (chess) mode, or in Regicide mode, which incorporates unit abilities, skills, strengths and weaknesses. In the latter mode, it becomes like a turn-based battle from any TBS WH40K game (like Chaos Gate, etc.) but with a chess overlay (you can queen your pawns, if your king dies you lose, etc.). What this means is that you can kill enemy units even though you've already made your turn during the chess phase.\n\nFrom what I can see, this game holds a lot of promise and can be great fun.\n\nWhat I think would REALLY make it fun would be (and this may already be in the works) persistent troops (that improve with battles won), equipment and armor upgrades, maybe even some RPG elements, and perhaps some sort of overarching storyline to tie everything together. These are the things that made the Dawn of War franchise great.\n\nMore variety in enemy units (other than Orks) would be nice too.\n\nFor now, I'm recommending this game, and will update my review as the development progresses.\n\n7.5/10.0\n\n","June 4, 2015","true","2.5"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","0"

While the classic mode is a great form of "Battle Chess" and with every piece taken in a typically gruesome 40k style explosion of viscera this is a must for the budding Grand Master.","May 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

Heads and organs flying, and bodies instantly exploding into bits and pieces. I saw a random spleen just lying around on the board at one point. My favorite unit is the Librarian, lifting enemies with psychic powers into the air, and then exploding into a bloody fireworks show. I think I have a problem.\n\nThe game features 2 main modes, Chess and Regicide. I love chess, and I enjoy the battle chess mode immensely.\n\nThe second mode, Regicide, has an XCOM-battle style with units having multiple abilities and %-chance to-hit. There is a unique kill animation for every unit against every other unit, so it keeps it fresh.\n\nPOST-LAUNCH FEEDBACK:\n\nMy main gripes about this game is that it takes too long. One match usually lasts 40-1 hour. Most of this is due to the slow walking animations, kill animations, ability animations (all of these are skippable by pressing spacebar, but you'll have to click spacebar 100+ times a game, which is so tedious). I'd like to see a quicker game mode with less units, maybe secondary win objectives. That'd be awesome.\n\nThey are in the process of adding another race, which is good news. I think for the longevity of the multiplayer pool, they need to add more multiplayer options, game modes, things to spice it up; this game, like TotalBiscuit said, lives and dies by its multiplayer base.","May 7, 2015","true","19.8"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

So far the game is... interesting. An interesting take on chess.\n\nI thought it would be a tactical strategy game, limited to a board game field. Meaning that, there would be more strategy involved with less moving around.\n\nBut its not quite that.. Its chess, chess with the warhammer 40k universe and really good animations and graphics. Remember that chess scene in harry potter 1? well its just like that. Pieces have good animations and graphics.\n\nThere are a couple of extra things, like pieces can shoot and use a couple of abilities to deal some damage and whatnot, but the thick of it, is chess...\n\nThere is alot of potential here and its visible that they will add features. However, i must say that, right now its mainly graphics and chess, a slow chess due to animations on every move.\n\nI recommend sure, specially if you like chess...

An unlikely duo but oh my goodness, so beautifully brutal. Its very similar to Battle Chess where the rules have been modified to allow units to fight in a variety of ways rather than just regular chess movements. All your standard chess pieces are here, Space Marines and Shoota Boyz as pawns, Terminators and Nobz as Rooks etc etc. Every differing unit comes equipped with special abilities (such as frag grenades, snap shot, only in death, etc etc) and comes with multiple visceral executions that literally make you giggle with bloody joy. The first time you watch a Librarian turn a Shoota Boy into a giant pile of organs and blood, you'll probably feel the same way. Furthermore, the graphics are quite beautiful and there is some considerable detail in every model and the maps. From my time spent so far, I do wish there were more maps, though.\nUnfortunately, the game can get sort of repetitive unless you are a diehard Chess player. But the campaign definitely breaks up the monotony of just playing chess with modified rules. All in all, for only 14.99 (12.74 right now) this game is great value and I definitely recommend it to my Chess/Warhammer 40,000 fans out there.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsdJ_1Rt8Os","September 8, 2015","true","4.4"," 48 of 68 people (71%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","71","48","68","11","0"

The idea is pretty simple - after you move your figures, you can spend action points to attack enemy figures or defend yours (this includes buffs/debuffs).\nYou'd think this won't affect the game too much and a good chess player will still win every time.\nWell, that's not really true. Regicide mode is quite different from chess and playing it as if you were playing chess can make you lose.\nMoving into the middle of enemy figures, even if your figure cannot be captured, can be a terrible move. Simply because you can get shot in the face.\n\nThe game features 3 game mode - multiplayer (which is aimed to be the main mode), skirmish (harder levels of AI are pretty good) and campaign with small pieces of story, nice voice acting and basically chess puzzles.\nEven though I'm not a huge chess fan, I had my share of fun doing campaign and skirmishes (with novice AI, because I'm terrible :D)\nAnd, of course, you can always go for "classic mode" and just play chess with sweet WH40k figures if you don't like the idea of regicide.\n\nDoes this idea excites you? Then go for the game, it's very well built and does not have any major issues (at least I haven't noticed any).\nMinor issues for me included two small things:\n1. There's no way to disable all animations. It's nice to see all those moves at first, but after ~10 games you just want to skip them all. And the only way to do this for normal moves is to hit "spacebar" which gets slightly annoying.\n2. Novice AI sometimes does VERY strange things (like moving to the position where I can easily capture him), but the next level of AI is too good for me. But that's more issue purely because I'm too terrible to compete with harder AI.\n\nMore detailed look in the video here:\nhttps://youtu.be/CX0KHxL1-dY","September 13, 2015","true","3.1"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","0"

The attraction to this pc version of the game however is the fact that the theme is warhammer 40k (which is fricken fantastic) and it also has its own twist on the rules. "Regicide" mode is classic chess but after a movement has been completed you are given an additional phase. In this phase you use initiative points to activate different abilities (snapshot for concentrated damage, krak grenade to lower a pieces armor value, etc) and this completely changes the strategy you need to employ, because pieces can be removed from play without being taken by other pieces. In other words, this is no longer an average game of chess.

The requisition system can also allow you to unlock other skins for your army, and you can gain that by just playing.\n\nIf you like the warhammer theme, and the thought of playing chess with a twist against other individuals by all means it's worth the money.

You can play Regicide, which is their version of chess or you can play normal chess with just the WH40k characters as chess pieces. The Regicide game play is actually very challenging once you learn the special abilities and traits of each race. I still think there are a few balancing issues, as Space marines in my opinion die too easily against Orcs. They could have addressed this by making the space marines more powerful but limiting their numbers. The whole feel just doesn’t seem right IMO, but this is still in early access stage, so I expect a lot to change.\nThe UI was a bit confusing to start with, but I managed to find the exit button for it. There is no unit customisation or modding option for this game, which I think is a shame as it would be great to see units that have been customised by each player when you go on MP.\nI haven't played MP yet, as I prefer SP games and modding my own maps or missions, so I can't really day anything about that aspect of this game.\nAt the time of writing there are only two Race’s, the Orc’s and the Space marines. They do however have some selection within these Race’s, but I am not sure if they have any impact on the gameplay or are just purely cosmetic? What would be good to see, is if you choose to field, let’s say the White Scar’s Chapter, then you will be allowed to field fast attack units etc. The different chapters need to reflect their different fighting styles and abilities.\nWould I recommend this game? Sure if you are a fan of the WH40k universe and like challenging tactical games that are turned based. This is as close as you’ll get to the table-top version of the game. The graphics aren’t out of this world, it’s more in keeping with the DOW series rather than cutting edge, but I think that this is a small development team so their resources are going to be tight. I am hoping that this game is developed further and they make available some customisation or editing tools for the community.

The rank and file of pawns in chess are defined by their restriction to forward-only movement.  Making them able to fire 360 degrees means that a lot of chess-based maneuver tactics are removed, and almost any movement results in being shot to pieces.\n2. Pawns are for shielding and pinning, and rarely used offensively.  They are the major paticipants in the current game, a switch which I don't think works very well.\n3.

It also allows stratigic powers that subetily change the battlefield while not (currently) being over powered.\n\nA quick example is thus. Pawns cannot attack going foward, however in regicide they have the ability to "shoot" targets of oppertunity within 3 spaces infront of them. This allowed my pawn to shoot the enemy king until death. This may seem abhorant to normal chess players but I found it exciting.\n\nWith more updates, a campaign, and new races Regicide could be the PC Warhammer 40k fix many of us have been looking for.\n\nStill with the RNG type weirdness where a unit could be safe and at other times completely boned. But with a stratigic sensibility that I believe Dawn of War could never offer(because of spam of certain units types or nerfs, etc).\n\nKill Cams are satifisying,\n\nVery decent hardrive space.\n\nAltogether a wonderful game that anyone could enjoy\n\nIt can only get better!","May 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","0"

PRAISE THE EMPEROR.\n\n(and forgive me for my bad grammar)\n\nFirst things first - Please DO NOT LISTEN to those people on the interwebz that say this game is another W40K trash game like that heretical Storm of Vengeance. Or those people that aren't satisfied because its just a CHESS game with W40K skin. NOOO. Warhammer 40000 : Regicide is more than chess.\n\nAt the point I'm writing this review I played a short session of Regicide before going to sleep and HOLY ♥♥♥♥ BISCUITS I am amazed by the quality of graphics and animations. Take note that this game is still in early access, so it still got many bugs here and there and some features locked for now. So far it has two game modes - classic chess (no need explaining this one, it plays just like real life chess except the pieces are W40K characters) and Regicide mode.\n\nNow ladies and gentleman, Regicide mode is where things get interesting. Ever played XCOM : Enemy Within? Regicide mode has that game's feel. It's still chess (with the usual piece movement and kill the king rule) but throw in some XCOM strategy elements and voila - u get Regicide mode. During your turn, you get to move a piece first (using standard chess movement rules) and after you move a piece, you can spend initiative points for your army to execute various orders - like shoot, hunker down, use an ability etc. After u ran out of initiative points then its your opponent's turn. In Regicide mode each piece have stats (like HP, attack etc, the usual stuff) so it's quite different from your usual chess game.\n\nThe main piece of the cake IMO is the kill animations. The devs really put in some good effort into animating those miniatures from Games Workshop into awesome 3d models that kill each other in gory, violent and khorne-approved ways. And surprisingly enough the graphics are quite demanding, which means that this game, with its high-quality graphics - proves that the devs didn't make this game just for fast cash grabs or to spit in the faces of fans - they are really making a high-quality, high-production value W40K game, which is what we fans been craving all these years (after the destruction of THQ). Give these guys from Hammerfall a chance (its their first project!) and I'm sure we will see MOAR good W40K stuff in the future. Plus the devs are really friendly and respect their customers!\n\nBeing a W40K fan, not buying and playing this game is just HERESY.","May 4, 2015","true","8.2"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","24","30","4","0"

When I first heard about this I was a bit sceptical if Games workshop was messing around with their licensing again. But this took off as a positive surprise, even when it's not fully complete, the main game is very playable.\n\nThe good:\n- Graphics\n- Gameplay. both in regicide & classic. Simple to play, hard to master\n- Finishing moves\n- Stays true to the Warhammer 40k universe and it is a proper title, unlike the few other titles that have come to steam recently\n- Stable release for an early access\n\nWhat could be added and will be added:\n- More races & Different skins, but that's being planned for the future.\n- Option to have corpses & blood stay on the chess field\n- Campaign will be added in the future\n\nCons:\n- Needs tweaking, bugs and all of that sort exists on a minor level\n- In my opinion the Multiplayer menu needs rework, it was a bit confusing at start to use. because when the match history gets flooded with previous old matches, your current round online can be lost due to the fact the list is somewhat random in it's sorting\n- Chatting isn't possible, so probably it will be done later so we'll have one at main menu & in-game. Assault attack on some units doesn't feel right in some occasions. An Assault Marine at close range shooting with a pistol, when instead it could be just swinging it's chainsword :D\n\nBut this is the short list of the things I've come up with playing with this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/322910/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Warhammer 40k Regicide can be easily summarised as Battle Chess set in the Warhammer universe. It follows the basic rules of Chess while expanding on these with other tactical mechanics to mix up the game play.\n\nAlthough there is a classic mode (more like traditional chess), my play time primarily consisted of the single player regicide campaign which includes three acts of 50 tailored scenarios (taking approximately 20-25ish hours to get through). These offer specific challenges which are made interesting by specific board obstacles & unit layouts - no two levels play out the same. There is an overarching story played out with voice acting between scenarios, but personally I didn't find it all that engrossing so usually found myself skipping these sections to read the primary & secondary objectives.\n\nCampaign levels are more strategic or puzzle like as they play out, with many needing multiple attempts to conquer. This can simply come down to poor choices, but can also be due to 'bad luck' (which I will discuss further later). Each turn allows you to move one unit on the board, plus an initiative phase where you can use points to activate special abilities. These are mainly unit specific, offering both offensive & defensive abilities depending on your situation. Points are limited so you need to use them wisely in order to win. This double mechanic works rather well and for the most enhances the usual chess rules. Most of the basics are explained in regards to the mechanics & abilities, but found myself with a bit of a trial-by-fire often making stupid moves because I didn't understand all the possibilities until I reached around Act II. Some may find this frustrating.\n\nSound quality and graphics both are good, UI can get in the way a bit sometimes unless you move the camera or zoom out. Once selected, applying an ability to a specific square on the board can sometimes miss click and hit an adjacent square if you are not careful. The executions are certainly a highlight offering the expected brutality & bloody finishing moves you would expect from a Warhammer game. Regrettably, these are rather limited only offering one variation per unit combo, with some not seeming to have any! Entertaining for the first dozen times you see it but quickly found myself mashing the space bar to skip and speed up the game. Barriers also tend to get in the way blocking your vision of these animations due to the fixed camera angle. Being a strong selling point of the game I would have liked to see better camera work and much more variety.\n\nThe strong puzzle like nature of the campaign kept me coming back regularly to play this through, the challenge was well balanced on the difficulty scale, although the random nature of the rolls often frustrated the hell out of me! As I mentioned earlier, what seems like bad luck rather than good strategy more often than not can ruin your game. Each action has a percentage chance to hit, with a number of modifiers such as critical hit chance playing a role. This probability means you can get a string of bad rolls that devastate your squad, regardless of how good your overall strategy is. This takes the skill out of the game in my opinion & just leads to rage-quitting.\n\nThere have been many times where I felt like I was playing with loaded dice, where one unit regardless of the number of times you use their attack will miss vs another specific unit/square. One recent time in Act III (mission 15 I think), I experienced 23 misses in a row trying to kill of the final Meganobz (rook)! This highlighted clearly there is some issues with the randomness/chance element of this game.\n\nOne other limitation I found was that the AI will always follow the same moves based on the board & unit layout. This makes it predictable on multiple retries of a scenario.\n\nAn online external account is needed as it doesn't use your Steam account to track progress. This is primarily for the multiplayer aspect of the game, so if you want to only play the campaign you can still play without registering, but regardless something people should be aware of (& something I generally dislike). As of the time of writing this review the devs, Hammerfall, are still updating with balance changes & improvements, along with community 'Double XP' weekends to encourage replayability.\n\nA few improvements in the chance rolls (perhaps even an option to disable all together if you choose) would be great along with an option to play the game in 'fast mode' avoiding the animations instead of having to mash the space bar (especially on your 10th attempt trying to beat a scenario!). Likewise, I would love to see a simple scenario editor included with Steam Workshop support to share your own challenges with the community once you have got through the included campaign. I think that could add much more replayablity in the long term.\n\nDespite its few detracting points & some room for improvement, I still found Regicide to be good fun, & something I regularly picked up for a quick 30-60min session over the past few months.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","January 23","true","20.5"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","4"

I love this game, but in order to give a proper and fair review, I  must issue a BIG WORD OF CAUTION! The "regicide" mechanics of the game throw an inspired and interesting twist on top of classic chess, but it also throws in the element of chance. In order for your soldiers to shoot, use abilities, or do any of the cool stuff added through the regicide game mode, you must do battle with your true enemy in the game. That enemy is, of course, the percentage counter. Due to the unspoken rule that percentages in a video game will always fall in favor of the computer player, this enemy is a scary one indeed. Fans of the tabletop game will already be used to even thier best plans falling apart due to poor dice rolls and this game is only different in the sense that you will have a lot more games like that than not. Playing the campaign requires a great deal of tenacity as you will find that every ork is an expert marksman while your space marines shoot like star wars storm troopers. This wouldn't be as bad if your troops were any good at CQC, but the orks gain an even larger advantage in that respect. So, the orks have more health, better CQC strengths, and the dumb luck to shoot you off the board when shooting is allegedly the only thing your marines are good at... what does that leave you with? Well nothing really. You just have to be tenacious and wait for the enemies lucky streak to run out. But once it does, all the tactics you've created by playing the same level over and over again will come to light and you'll swamp those fools! So essentially my word of caution is that you've got to be willing to accept that regicide is as much a mix of skill and luck as a poker game. The odds are stacked against you, but it's good fun all the same. If you can accept that and want one of the coolest reskins of chess to ever hit the market, this is the game for you.","September 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","25","32","5","0"

The game runs and looks phenomenal, especially if you are like me and was sick of the generally low-quality graphics of many 40k games. This may be the best looking warhammer game to date.\n\nI've had my ♥♥♥ kicked while playing chess before, but with all the shiny new graphics and visceral kill animations I sort of forgot how to play chess. Luckily, you can modify how the game looks in many ways, including transforming the game board into a regular chess board (except you are still going to be playing chess on a snowfield).\n\nRegicide mode completely made me forget about chess, and really does a good job of capturing the violence of 40k, with the strategy of chess. However, the computer player wasn't so lenient, and kicked my ♥♥♥ in both chess and regicide mode.\n\nThe game is in early-access, so it is rather bare-boned at the moment. There is no campaign or progression, but the devs have stated they are going to only have a 2-4 month EA period so fingers crossed this content is quickly added.\n\nVoice-acting and music is suitably awesome, but some gun-fire sound effects seem muted and dull in comparison. Space Marine (the game) this is not.\n\nFor 15 dollars, its a 40k-themed battle chess with awesome presentation value as well an additional game-play set of rules. If that doesn't interest you, you can wait for a persistent gameplay mode (leveling up your army and upgrading them) or play out the campaign, which should hopefully be coming soon.\n\nIf you just want a new battle chess, this game may be perfect for you.","May 4, 2015","true","5.3"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","31","43","2","0"

While only skirmish and multiplayer are available, the fact that there will be a Campaign mode and the ability to equip unique skills to your soliders, I feel like this is way more than a chess game, and so far I have enjoyed tearing apart the Ork horde, or more often then not, me watching my boys get decimated by the Orkz.  Great animations, kill scenes, and pretty damn good graphics I feel like people should at the very least give this game a shot.  You might want to wait till it is fully released, since there is not too much to do right now, but is a worth while game.\n\n*Updated:\nAfter playing a few more games I would say that this game is much better than most people may think.  The chess aspect of the game is present, and you can try to play the game as a typical chess board game.  However after moving your piece you then get to initiate what basically comes down to range combat.  Your typical have 3 initiative points that allow you to attack the other players soliders, or to use skills to either boost the effectivness of your own troops, or damage and weaken the enemy.  This adds a whole new layer to the game, as you could have a sound "chess" game strategy, but even when a peice is cornered, you can still fight and potentially turn the battle around in your favor, without even ahving to move a single peice.  Played a game where the Space Marine Commander was the only one left, but I couldnt corner him, and he was slowly tearing my boyz apart.  In the end I won but how qucik was able to turn around with only one piece made me rethink some of my strategies for future games.  Overall I still believe that this game has a ton of potential, is fun and enjoyable, and is worth at least trying.  Again you may want to wait till later once more content has been released but it is worth getting.\n\nAt the moment I give it a 7.5/10.  At the moment.  This may change with more content.","May 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","25","33","4","0"

Can play normal chess or regicide.  Regicide is modified chess where the pieces still move like thier chess counterparts and still "capture" or actually kill like normal, but also have abilities, health bars, etc...  that can damage, buff, or defend other pieces, so you can still kill a piece with abilities .\n\nThey plan to give other objectives/missions such as survival, take and hold, etc.  The game even in early development has some great visuals and sound.  REALLY like it!!  Especially for the price!\n\nUpdate: 3/16/16\nThese guys are still very active with the community by hosting events and giveaways.

However, it needs a few more features to make it worth 13$.\n\n*my personal bias*\nI was in chess club as a kid, and always was excited for my churches chess nights. I have grown up around chess. Recently I have fallen in love with the Warhammer 40k universe, although I cannot play the table top game as my friends are gold fish that are terrified of anything more complex than monopoly. 40k would just spend them into a spasm.\n\n*Gameplay*\nBasically this is chess. The units are the same as in chess, and the movements are all the exact same as chess. And any chess captures(like moving a knight on top of a pawn) are always insta kills. HOWEVER, what sets this game apart is the second phase of your turn. There is the movement phase, and then the cool second phase. In this phase your units can do various different abilitys, like shooting, throwing frag granades, and other ablilitys. Although these are not insta kills, they do damage to a unit and overtime the health reaches 0 and that unit is as dead as any captured peice. I think I have killed more orcs by just shooting them then actually capturing them. Also, this is where the sides differ, The pawns of the Space marines have different range, health, armor, and so on than the orcs. I cannot remeber the actual numbers, but Im sure that you are capable of googling that. The AI is very competant. The novice AI will let you win, and the Veteren AI will rip you to shreds...But that isnt very impressive because computers have been good at chess for ages. The last thing that really sets this apart is the graphics, which just make the game feel much more intense.\n\n*what this game needs*\nAs I mentioned earlier, The 2 races differ, but there are only 2 races. Orcs and Space Marines. They hinted on the forums of the offical game website that more races are to come, so I am not really holding that agaisnt them. There is no reason that the Tau, Sisters, Chaos, Eldar, and Dark Eldar cannot join.(The Imperial guard I understand because in chess you cannot have 50 pawns against a standard army, and really the IG is just a infinite amount of pawns).\n\nAlso needed to be added, but very much hinted at is custom maps. Maps with walls, and custom army set up. The campaign has this, and if there is a map maker which allows for this it would really be awesome.\n\n*conclution*\nThis is for you if you are a Warhammer 40k fan that likes chess. Because it is basically 40k themed chess. The shooting and the powers really set this apart from standard table top chess however. I personally found it really enjoyable, and if other races are added(PLEASE ADD TAU, give them range adv. and low health it would be sweet!) and a custom map maker is added in, then this game would really be a worthy addtion to any tabletop game lovers steam collection.","August 28, 2015","true","12.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

Each individual unit is well nuanced and varied, even when theres multiples of the same unit e.g. there are 8 pawns in a standard game of chess and hence there will be 8 tactical marines if  you're playing as Space Marines.\n\nAnd though they are almost carbon copies of one another, there is enough variety to their vox responses and battlecries that no two marine will repeat the same lines one after the other. Giving the pieces on the board that much more personality. As it stands, I cannot wait to see where the campaign will take us in regards to story and lore.\n\nIn short; a true to heart DoW40k experience with excellent design and visuals with equally top notch voice acting makes this a 8/10 for its price.","May 5, 2015","true","39.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","21","27","3","0"

The AI is laughably bad, often throwing away units by moving to undefended positition where they can be captured without any threat of recapture.\n\n2. The combat animations are repetitive.  There is only one animation for each possible capture, and only one animation for each attack.  Some skills don't even have animations.\n\n3. The tooltips for the skills and stats have very little information.  They don't say what the duration, cooldown, or damage done by each skill is.  Damage and hit chance are somehow based on unit strength, toughness, weapon skill, and armor, but there is no explanation of how these work.","May 22","false","9.4"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","27","39","2","1"

I see no sense in using a skill over 5 or more rounds until I shot down a single Grunt when I just can "move" over them(the Chess part) to insta-kill them.\n\n\nSo in short: Nice idea but badly done so far.

And the Orks are a definate plus!\n\nIf you hate the fact that knights and pawns can't smack the enemy piece sitting directly in front of them in normal chess (like I do), then you'll love Regicide. Classic Mode is included for sticklers, but I can't imagine going back to bland old regular chess ever again!\n\nIf you play chess because you're a strategy addict, Regicide will feed your craving for an even more complex version of the age-old board game. Now you don't just capture. And now your King has something to do besides run away!\n\n"I'm da Boss, an' I seyz I can dakka yer gob if I zoggin' watz ter! WAAAGH!"\n\nThe graffics are stupendous! The kill animations are worth watching even if it's your guy getting butchered.\n\nYou'll hear some complaints that there are only two factions (Orks and Space Marines) from people who are ticked that their favorite table-top army isn't included...yet. There's a good deal of customization in that you aren't stuck playing only one Clan or Chapter, and all of the most popular ones are in (except Blood Axes, unluckily) and it's cool that your dudes get more Flash as your profile levels up.\n\nI haven't figured out the army abilities upgrades options yet. You need "Skill Points" but I haven't found a way to get them yet. But I'm not holding that against the game.\n\nIf you played the Dawn of War series, you'll hear lots of familiar voices. That's a plus for me since I'm a nostalgia git.\n\n8.5/10 (put in Blood Axes and it'll be a solid 9!)\n\nI my humble opinion, it's much more satisfying to play as the Orks. It makes more sense when your Boyz miss with Snap shots than a Tactical Marine, and you can laugh at your enemy when the "Emperor's Finest" flub theirs from 2 squares away. Plus, Orks are just awesome and hilarious.","September 8, 2015","true","23.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","17","22","5","0"

It's a great mixture of strategy and... well... Chess! Yes, yes I know Chess is a strategy game, but the added abilities of your 'pieces' AFTER moving really add another layer on top of this classic strategy format.\nFor example:\n\nIn one of the earlier missions I had to get 1 of my 3 Assault Marines (Knights) to 'Point A' , with the secondary objective to achieve this within 5 turns. 2 Turns in I was in position to do this with a turn to spare, however, an Ork Loota (Bishop) had positioned themselves so that if I moved to the point from which I would leap to victory, the Loota would move and take me, like in normal Chess. So I was forced to re-evaluate my strategy and my life, meaning I would achieve the Primary but not the Secondary Objective of the mission.\n\nBut then, during the enemy's turn, the Loota moved into the square I was planning to eventually get to! I smiled deviously, smugly moving my Assault Marine to destroy the Ork Scum, "Stupid AI", I chuckled to myself. Ending the turn after healing (an ability) and presenting this pinnacle of human achievement an Iron Halo (a shield ability) I ended the turn, preparing myself a triumphant Nutella Sandwich. I then proceeded to watch a Storm Boy (Knight) move next to me, and I, like a plum, watched with triumph as the Loota shot at me futiley, taking out my shield. "I'm still alliiiive" suddenly stopped in my throat as the chant turned to an anguished groan, as the Storm Boy, the Knight, then used his Orkish brute strength in Assault to take the exact amount of health I had left, away, with a single denying swipe.\n\nCurses.\n\nCampaign is good, the Skirmish function is also good, as you can play against AI OR Human, and you can play Space Marine v Ork, Ork v Ork or Space Marine v Space Marine. Plus it's Warhammer 40K! I haven't tried multiplayer yet...\n\nIt is true that you have to pay for skins other than White Scars, Blood Angels or Raven Guard on Space Marines, and vice versa but for 3 clans for the Orks, but it doesn't really matter to me.. those skins/Chapters are cool enough and the skins don't change the gameplay.","September 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

In "Classic" mode, you can just play chess against the computer or another player - using your Warhammer characters. Each piece is taken rather violently with whatever weapon the character has to hand. To be honest, if you enjoy chess, this is a lot of fun.\n\nThe "Skirmish" mode is similar, except each piece has weaponry and can take a certain amount of damage. It's not chess, but it does add a new wrinkle to the game, which makes for some interesting play.\n\nThe campaign mode has a lot of playability. You progress by completing chess-type scenarios, with warhammer characters that correspond to chess pieces. They can, however, capture pieces through moving, or damage/destroy them with weaponry. The board also has barricades on it to spice things up, and there are different victory conditions which alter how you play.\n\nI'm really enjoying this game... but you probably need to have an appreciation for chess and, at the very least understand how the pieces move.\n\nIf you go into this game thinking it's a regular turn-based strategy game, you may be frustrated at not being able to move your tactical marine (read: Pawn) to the left, or capture the piece in front of you... and you may be annoyed that the heavy-bolter marine (read: Bishop) can only move diagonally.\n\nIf this isn't a problem for you, then this game is a great addition to the Warhammer 40k universe.","November 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

If multiplayer actually found me a match I'd also be more enthusiastic and perhaps have a more positive take on the Regicide gameplay spin.

Maybe the game went out of access a bit too early.\n\nThe game also has a campaign which provides several scenarios you wouldn't encounter during normal skirmishes and has some quite challenging side missions.\nOverall however the game is fun and if you don't like the new additions you can always play it in classic chess mode.\n\nI do recommend playing this game\nI don't quite recommend buying it for over 10€, maybe wait till the price drops some more in future sales","September 12, 2015","true","2.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

I hope that I get to see Tyranids as well and even the tau and eldar. I even play the ordinary 40 k game it is the best game I have ever played and it is the boardgame.

It is very slick.  It seems to be utterly bug free.  And it runs really quickly even on my worst PC, (I find this supprising because the graphics are very nice).\n\nThe game is like Chess.  The peices move like in chess.  And you do the fancy kill animations if you kill an enemy with a classical chess "taking" move.\n\nHowever the game also allows you to use your abilities after the move phase as well.  Like shooting or the magic abilities.  So in this regard the game plays a little like a King's Bounty battle. . . but with the movement phase also allowing you to "take" (kill) enemies as per Chess.\n\nThis adds greatly to the game.  I have only played a couple of hours.  I will be enjoying a lot more of it I think.  The game is early access - they look like they are adding loads more to it.  But at the moment - you get the complete chess game with multiplayer support.\n\nVery excited about this!","June 10, 2015","true","9.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Regicide adds a level of variety that I find intriguing. The option to capture pieces using traditional chess movement and/or fight using classic 40K skills makes for a whole new set of strategy. Sure, your queen (Librarian) can take a piece but is then open to be assaulted or shot-up by the enemy. Can't catch the enemy king (warboss)? Shoot him to death.\n\nI can't wait to see this game after early access.

Either normal chess with Space Marines / Orks pieces, or more tactical chess where pieces can shoot each other. Sounds weird, but somehow works quite nice.\n\nWH40k Regicide can be played in two modes - chess or regicide. You should know how chess works, nothing shocking on that front, can be played vs AI or other people. The regicide mode is used in the campaign - which is basically a series of puzzles - and can also be played vs AI and other people. Regicide is your basic chess, but the pieces have special abilities and can shoot each other. Fun stuff.\n\nVISUALS\n\nFor a chess game it looks great. Pieces are detailed, the kill/capture animations are pretty fun to watch. Yes, they become boring after a while, but you can both skip them or switch them off. The only problem I had with the graphics is that the animations for melee and ranged attacks are the same. Basically each unit have only one attack animation.\n\nAUDIO\n\nBoth background music and sound effects are ok. Nothing groundbreaking, but it's perfectly sufficient.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe three campaigns take quite a while and getting all primary and secondary objectives can take a while. Chess with wh40k pieces is fine if you like chess. Regicide mode is quite fun, especially since you can play Raven Guard. Several other chapters are also unlockable. The campaign can be a little bit too much luck dependant at times, but maybe it's just me.\n\nIf you like chess and wh40k definitely give this a try. If you like wh40k and feel like something chess-like might be fun for you, give it a try also. If you're looking for the next Dawn of War or Space Marine - pass.\n\nWarhammer 40000 Regicide Random Game Footage :\nhttps://youtu.be/jnBJzkp94J4","September 13, 2015","true","9.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Additionally they can make an option to give the player/players a choice to end the game in a draw, also end the game in a draw IF THERE IS REALLY NOTHING TO DO TO WIN, not draw the game just because there is 1 pawn instead of a queen when the pawn actually can become a queen and change the game. Also I want them to remove health and energy bars from Classic mode since it is not necessary to have, just visually annoying in fact.\n\n\nApart from this, I will recommend this game because its not broken to the point of not being playable, I've reallye enjoyed it, its chess but with awesome gameplay, but I do want more in-depth animations and gore along with more races/chapters and maybe an army customization option, if I see someone get killed with a sword I expect it to be a wound where the sword penetrated/slashed. Also I want Necrons and Tyranids, I would love to play Necron.\n\nIt has still some distance to go before you can call it a "great" game, but for now I give it a 6/10 due to current lack of replayability.\nWhen the game is fully optimized and has 100% chess mechanics and more depth I will give it 8/10-10/10 depending on added features and tweaks.","May 11, 2015","true","2.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Is the game chess based? Yes. However, even in Early Release, there is much promise that the game will be much more than that.

It's a 40k experience I've never had before. I'd you're a 40k nut, like myself, it's worth the small amount of cash.

The first is because I love the 40k universe, and the second is because I want to support the devs (Straya represent).\n\nI wouldn't say I'm disappointed but I definitely was not grabbed by the game.\n\nYes, the game is more or less chess with Space Marines and Orks, with light turn based tactics gameplay sprinkled on in the Regicide mode. If you don't like chess then you probably won't like 40k Regicide. Fortunately I do enjoy chess (not as much as I used to though, chess club kid here, no really) and I can't wait to play this with a friend or two.\n\nThe visuals and audio are nice and hit all the right 40k notes, but otherwise aren't spectacular, the gameplay is, as previously mentioned, chess, but the light tactics gameplay (which takes place after your chess move) allows you to change up the game in ways that might pull you through if you suck at chess (chess club kid who never payed attention here, no really) which is nice, but it's not enough to make the game stop being chess.\n\nIf you like to play chess then pick up this game, if you're a big fan of 40k then I'd recommend waiting for the campaign to be released in its entirety (not out yet, and the first injection will be 15 out of the 50 promised missions) because from the teasers and interviews it looks like it's going to be pretty cool. If you fall into both of these camps then you can safely grab the game now, and if you fall into neither then just give this one a miss.\n\nFor what it's worth you are getting your money's worth here, and even more when the campaign releases.","May 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I figure i'd do an RPG or something along those lines for my first review on here, but this one stood out for me for some reason. I've been playing games all my life, both board games and video games. I play everything and anything in my collection, which isn't limited to those on steam. I probably have about 20k+ games under my belt, in some form or another. I stream video games to twitch regularly, and do my own reviews on a seperate site. This isn't to brag or anything, it's more to give validity for this review in that i know at least something of what i'm talking about.\n\nWhen i bought the game, i figured this would be another virtual knock off of chess. There must be at least a few dozen out there that i've seen before. The only reason i picked this one up was for my love of the warhammer 40k franchise. I figured screw it, if nothing else it should have at least entertaining visuals even if it brings nothing else to the table. I was wrong. For an early access game, this is increadibly well polished. It's one of those games that ends up surprising you when you actually buy it. What i expected was a pretty form of chess. What i got was a different thing all together. It does have a standard chess mode for those of you who enjoy the normal layout and playstile that is the oldest strategic game known on earth. What i enjoy the most is the nonstandard mode, known as regicide. It brings an entirely different dimention to the game of chess. You can use many different abilities - from shielding, to healing your pieces - that make it much more indepth than the standard game of chess. It can be a bit more polished, but this is in early access so i have no doubt that overtime this game will continue to shine more than i's somewhat dreary competitors out there. For the first time in a long time, i found a game worth supporting in the early stages of development. I'm really excited to see where this game goes in the long run, and look forward to the new updates as they hit. To the developers, thank you for bringing another great game to the Warhammer 40k franchise, and i wait excited to see what new developments come to what i expected to be a game much less than what you've created.\n\nTL;DR version:\nA game that brings something new to the table that's reletively well polished, especially for an early access game.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\n~Daxx Alabel","July 11, 2015","true","3.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","6"

The graphics is what you imagined form an Wh40k RPG or what Dawn of War 3 should look like.\n- Great animations\n- Great sound\n- massive potential\n\nCons:\n- It´s only chess (Slightly boring after a few games)\n- The regicide gamemode does not differ enough from chess\n\nPotential:\n- Skills:   Experience bars for single units and profile are already in place but not working. So high hopes here.\n- Armory:   An Armory button exists, so I expect you can equip troops in the full game.\n- Maps:   There are barricades in the tutorial, but not in the skirmish yet. So in full release it might become creative.\n- Campaign:  Not yet in game, but there is a button. Should give you a goal to aim for.\n\n- Mods:   My biggest hope! Make the map bigger and give every unit the movement sheme of the queen and you got a full fledged mini tabletop simulator.\n1. There are already values for armor, health, skill, stamina in place.\n2. There is already a system to calculate hit chance (with indicator in %)\n3. There are close combat and distant combat in place.\n4. Already a full fledged ability system in place for each unit type. Already race spezific abilities in place.\n5. Cover mechanics are in place\n6. Six classes, with animations, abilities, values are already in place.\n\nSo, thats my two cents. If you are interessted I would suggest to you to wait a little for more updates, but definitely keep it on your radar. If they add mod support... buy it!\n\nEnjoy","May 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

Played through a game and won with just my king left. There is a campaign mode (currently not playable), skirmish and online modes. I imagine that later they will add more backgrounds and units. I wouldn't be surprised to see other chapters appear as DLC's after the main release as this seems to be the norm with 40K video games. There is currently no save game during a battle. Although this adds to the tension I would like some kind of save feature as a battle can last quite a few turns. The animations are great and pull no punches with graphic gore. The units are nice and detailed. I'm not so sure on the voices though as I miss the deep metalic terminator voice. Again this maybe something they will polish towards release.\n\nA great start and already very playable. I hope they bring out a ton of different pieces for this game as that will just add to the longivity.  I await with eager anticipation as to what they will add next.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate on Released Version 08/09/15\n\nI liked this game right from the start of the early release. Chess has never been so much fun. The completed campaign adds an interesting story element to the game with different primary and secondary goals for each mission. Chess fits in well with the 40K universe as both involve risk taking and sacrifice. Its very satisfying when you lure a more powerful piece into a trap. My compliments to the devs for a great game that will keep me coming back for more.","May 4, 2015","true","14.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The concept of chess where the pieces do more than just capture one another has been a very interesting idea to me. I have thought of it a lot myself. The way Regicide is so far is excellently done. Also, the fact that it is set specifically within the 40K universe is awesome! I personally love the fact that the tactical marines can throw grenades. Too cool. I also appreciate that you give the option to play regular chess as opposed to "Regicide" mode. I cannot wait to see what else the creators are going to do with this game. The only recommendation I would make would be to utilize other races from the 40K universe, but I'm pretty sure that's a given.","May 6, 2015","true","5.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

The game really rubs it in when a marine or ork gets killed.\nThe voices are AWESOME and the Orks true to their way, are HYSTERICAL in what they say even though they are not trying to be funny.\n\nThis all combines to an emotional game experience, where you really FEEL for your losses....as I found myself saying out loud to the Orks:\n\n"oh I can do that to you too!"\n"Oh you want some?"\n"I freaking hate you"\n"Yeah, how does that feel?"\n\nSince 1992 when I first started PC gaming, I have never done that!\nMan, I was really getting into it.\n\nAnyway, please remember this game is in Early Access, and will get more to it, but even now just playing Regicide is FUN!\nHowever, there are some bugs regarding multiplayer where you try to start a match and instantly die.\n\nBut  despite that, its a fun addicting game, and even for people like me that are poor at chess it is so COOL to just say "Heck with it" and start firing weapons to make up for your lack of chess skills.\nHowever, you are constantly trying to balance your chess strategy with a Warhammer 40K Squad Strategy (Firing Weapons etc).\nFor too much of one or the other will result in your defeat.\n\nCase in point, my last opponent was first pwning me in warfare, i.e. shooting etc, so I played chess to make him nervous and break his focus, but then he outmatched me chess wise, so I resorted to weapons.\nThus, you have to be on your guard for chess moves AND Warhammer 40K squad tactics.\nIts an awesome combination.","May 4, 2015","true","28.4"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","20","30","0","0"

But with awesome kill animations and of course the Warhammer 40k vibe. Pretty standard but refreshingly artistic.\n\n- Regicide mode\nIt's chess. With Blood Angels. And Orcs. Chainsaws, Grenades, Lasers! And the best is: For every single unit matchup (Pawn vs Pawn, Pawn vs Bishop, and so on) there is a new "fatality" animation if you kill the unit with a regular chess move. Pretty fun and can be really tricky with all the skills and player abilities.\n\n- Campaign\nThe Orcs are spreading like a disease. You are the cure. I don't want to spoiler anything so let me just say: You kick-♥♥♥ and live a story while doing so - what's not to like?\n\nPros:\n+ It's Warhammer 40k!\n+ It's Chess!\n+ No seriously, the combination is absolutely fantastic.\n+ A lot of animations for each piece matchup (Pawn vs Pawn, Pawn vs Bishop, and so on).\n+ Gameplay is great, tutorial does all it should. I think it's fairly easy for chess newcomers to get used to it.\n\nCons:\n- The biggest con for me (have been playing chess for 20 years now): the AI sometimes do stupid mistakes that make a game ridicilously easy. At least during the first 10 missions of the campaign. But I hope the difficulty grows with the story.\n- Campaign story is (so far) only told in text and voice. I would've loved some cinematics or more animations. (Just did the first 10 Missions, I'm sorry if they come after those!)\n- ...I love tyranids (insert random other Warhammer 40K Faction besides Space Marines & Orcs). I need them. Hoping for an addon!\n\nConclusion:\nI say the 15€ were well spent on it. I didn't regret it so far and I cannot imagine that I would regret it later on.

As seeing the potential of what is to come, the small battle stage(s) so far are small and limited towards the type of battle that can occur. I am a long time fan of warhammer 40k, however i was never able to afford all the figurines and battle pieces to forge wars and battles against other players. This game seems to be the possible link between the worlds without the largely dedicated wallet. Now don't get me wrong going with this possible idea leads to many avenues of pay to play/ pay to acquire other armies and even seige armaments, just as long as the campaign  congratulates the players who fully play and beat it on multiple difficulties can then unlock those same purchaseble items. other such things like account player levels can open up menial things that entice the players to keep playing within reason of coarse. Then being able to create our own maps and scenarios for solo players and/or if possible groups can play vs like pvp or even pve in scenarios created. the ideas and possibilities are endless, i just see given the right tools provided by your developers and creative team we the players can then in a sense create our own game but with all the pieces you provide. i guess in a close likeness taking the table top to the pc. Now this is where the controversy would possibly come from your long time table top players, however in reality i don't see many of them complaining about wanting to go from one to the other.\nafter all this rambling, i go on to say i believe i am not the only person who would play, invest and replay as well as invite many other friends and family to enjoy such a game. this game is still in its early stages and to see it continuely evolve to the epic possibility would be greatness only i think warhammer 40k has been waiting for and now can ascertain.","June 10, 2015","true","5.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I really wanted to like this game, but it's just rubbish.\n\nYou get shoved with a login screen each time you start the game. No, I will not register to anything, thank you. So that's multiplayer out the window, onto the campaign!\n\nTake the tutorial first, but...oh dear. The 3rd thing it asks you do is select an 'ability'. The tooltip header is "** ABLTY_NO_NAME_SM" and the description for this ability is "** ABLTY_NO_DESC_SM". This is within the 1st minute of the tutorial. This is promising, can't wait to see what else is missing. This is definitely a finished game...right? The tutorial soon after states that you can hover over enemy units for details on them. Nope, you can't, you have to click on them. Tutorial is rubbish, quit it and go to the campaign.\n\nEach campaign level starts with a couple of voice actors shouting about orks. It's unpleseant, but can be skipped. You're then presented with a chess board-like level with a few units. These units are chess pieces (pawns, bishops etc). Each level has an objective (kill the boss, for example) and a secondary objective (lose no units, for example). To achieve this, you have to actually play chess but with the addition of 'abilities' after each move. Abilities are shoot, defend, support type things and have a 'chance to hit' rating. Now, having a chess game, which is based on skill, mixed with chance, may sound like a good idea on paper, but in reality, it's crap. After you've carefully made your intelligent bishop 5-steps-ahead chess move, it's then ruined by and ork SHOOTING AT IT.\n\nYou're forced to make a chess move when it's your turn, so you are forced to 'chess think' and then your pieces just get shot at afterwards. To me this mix doesn't make sense.\n\nThe pace of this game is slow. Really slow. The animation is half decent upon first viewing, but gets old really fast.\n\nThe UI is nice looking, but lacks in information. Want to know the attack range of any units? Nope. Want to know the exact stat changes from using abilities? Nope. Want to even know what the stats do in the first place? Nope. Want to read an ability's description at any time? Nope - only when you've met the criteria to use it at this moment can you read that.\n\nOnce you've laboriously completed a level, you get XP. Yep, it's one of those games. You have to unlock stuff to get the most of the game's content. There appeared to be payable DLC content on day 1 launch, which is a big no-no in most people's books for obvious reason. Since I'm disallowed from playing multiplayer, I have little interest in this area anyway and can't tell you if it's pay to win of just cosmetics. At this stage, I don't care.\n\nThere is a skirmish mode, which gives you the option to play normal chess. This is fine if you like both chess and Warhammer, plus you have £10 to spare, but did you really get a Steam account for that?","September 13, 2015","false","1.4"," 76 of 135 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","76","135","8","11"

You could say chess with blood and every kill animation are quite satisfating (sorry for my spelling). but there is one thing that im quite disappoint is that if im offline the game kick me out of my acccount and it doesn't save the units that i earn or brought plus the score and campaign. So if u are offline well tough luck you start from the begining until you sign in, but over all it's worth every money for this game. My friend and i have are having a plast and we...well i try to beat him and he kepts winning god damnit. so the final review of this game is 8/10 with badass seal. i recommand to give it a try and who knows u might enjoy chess and with killing animation.","December 19, 2015","true","32.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Animated chess that can and will blind side you for certain errors in judgement.  Especially once Regicide mode is on, which enables the pieces to not only move about as chess peices but battle each other as well in ranged combat.\n\nThis game ultimately caters to those who favor strategy and more importantly those who have the patience for the game of chess (again, it will blindside you at times for those minute errors in judgement).  It has great graphics, a moderate story, but I personally recommend waiting for a discount to hit it to range of five dollars.","May 27","true","23.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The fact you have abilities and stats for each unit (Orks being more offensive, while Space marines defensive.) and being able to attack pieces at range / if they are a terminator or assault marine they can melee adjacent units. I found some of my strategies failed because they would be bombarded by units. If this was the final game I admit I would be unimpressed but the fact there are plenty of other modes coming and a campaign and more. I think its worth it.

If you love chess and remember the battle chess from back in the day when your eyes lit up from watching the Castle piece devour the other pieces on the board or any of the other cool animations when you took an opponents piece for the first time, then youll love this game. This is still in early access, but still fun as all hell. I cant wait for the other modes to be unlocked upon later versions and then final release. There are many fun modes you will be able to play, so it goes beyond your normal gameplay and strategy of regular chess, it doesnt get boring and replay value is great! I found that to be key in this game.. Other chess games get boring after a while and you get a "meh" feel about them after seeing all there animations. Not in this game though.

I feel extremely tempted to request a refund.\n\nNot recommended.\n\nedit:\n\nFollowing a reply from one of the developers, Daniel Todd (which is, I admit, much more than I expected, so points to Hammerfall for that!) I will add some further points and clarification...\n\nFirst, I'll add some positives!\n\n+ Graphics rather good.\n+ Skippable animations (for when you've seen your Tactical Marines open fire in the exact same way for the thousandth time...)\n+ There is an Offline Mode\n+ It's Warhammer 40,000\n+ It's also Chess\n\nNow, perhaps I'm naive, as I'm fortunate enough to have a system to game on where I don't really need to worry about "minimum" specs... so I don't tend to check that area of the Store Page. Where I do check is the bar on the right-hand-side (the one that lists "Single Player", "Multi-Player", "Steam Achievements", "Controller Support" etc...) because many other games list there if they require a "3rd Party Account" - Uplay, for example.\n\nSo fair enough; I can see the appeal of a centralised account for some, however I rarely if ever play multiplayer in any game... I was more surprised to find that Achievements weren't unlocking with my Offline campaign. While I don't "chase" Achievements (if I get them I get them, if I don't I'm not too worried) that really confused me for a while!\n\nI may yet make a Regicide account to play online, as I will admit I've been having fun in the single player.","May 21","false","0.9"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","33","56","2","13"

I got Regicide in hopes of being able to teach my young son how to play chess in the same manner I learned so many years ago.\nRegicide is sound in its mechanics and modes. While it's not a game I'd endeavor to climb leaderboards, the online component is there for those who enjoy it. It's also nice that the game is not simply chess with pretty graphics--the factions and modes add a hefty level of depth to the game, despite some balance issues that need addressing.\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that there is not a gore filter. I asked about it in one of the developer live streams prior to the game's release where the devs recognized the issue, but as it stands, you still cannot turn off the gore. You can turn off the execution/battle cutscenes, but even in the isometric view, you can see the bloody carnage taking place during the match. That alone puts this game on the digital shelf for me, as I cannot use Regicide to teach my kiddo how to play chess, and I have no desire to go online with it or play agianst AI endlessly. I realize my situation is unique, though, so I still recommend the game. Just be forewarned that if gore is an issue, you may want to read up on patch notes to see if a content filter has been added after this review.\n\n-@MeefJ from the @EverydayGamers podcast\nwww.everydaygamers.com","November 28, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

There is a fairly sizable campaign along with skirmish mode for classic and the Regicide game modes. However there are some fairly annoying flaws which really knock it down a few points. Mainly the "RNG" which, as many people have seem to have noticed is quite clearly rigged. I personally missed three 95% shots in my first game and many since then along with many other seemingly statistically improbable outcomes. e.g  consistently missing 8/10 75% chance shots.  Also alternate chapter skins need to be unlock through ingame points or bought, not something i personally have an issue with but i can see how it may be annoying for some to be stuck with yet another Blood Angels game as chapter choice is something that is pretty inheretly central to all Space Marine games no matter the medium. Finally the camera, this game includes limited number of death animations for piece capturing, (many of which just revolve around person X walking up to and shooting person Y) which again I have no complaint with, but very often these arn't viewable as the camera is lodged in someones torso or lump of concrete.\n\nOverall i would recommend this game but only to those with patience and preparation for being screwed by janky RNG.","October 11, 2015","true","7.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

Lower goes my review of Regicide-gameplay.\nIf you've had enough of this RNG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in X-COM or other turn based games then this one is definitely not for you. I only played Regicide mode to unlock new skins my armies and bought this game only to play Chess with badass bloody executions. If you seek something more than just chess-experience you better stay away from this game, or else you're gonna get butthurt a lot.\nHere is a simple example. You play space marines campaign. Your units have mostly >64% hitting ratio and orks (your enemies) have <58%. But in reality they they hit the target more than your troops. My knight didn't hit the target in CQC while given hit retio was 95%. Instant rage quit. Combine this with higher enemy HP and enemy's 2-shot ability and you get one huge explosion in lower back area.\nRNG ruined this game. Other than that it is very good.

If you're a fan of 40K and you quite like chess, you can't go wrong. This can be played as classic "battle" chess, simply playing using the usual rules, but using the animated pieces. Honestly, your opponent's piece is so much more satisfying when your units fight to the death, claiming a square on top of their disembowelled enemy!\n\nOn the other hand, you can play with the actual Regicide mode. This is broken down into the "movement" phase, during which you play a move much like standard chess, followed by the "initiative" phase, where you will follow up your move by spending initiative points to perform actions such as shooting another piece at range. This adds a whole new layer to standard chess, and any usual chess strategies quickly get blown out of the window when your pawn (marine) gets annihilated by a group of orcs!\n\nIn addition, a storyline has been added, with the board set up in various ways in keeping with the scene. This is enough to keep the games interesting and varied, and I like the addition.\n\nWhile Regicide may not be for everyone, I personally love it. It's one of those combinations that sounds like it should be terrible, but turns out to be a real gem. I paid the sale price, (which is actually why I took the risk and gave this a go) so it's safe to say I'm more than happy with the value. That said, having now played and had great fun, I think I'd also have been happy if I'd taken  the original £15 price tag.

I think it’s got potential.\nIt looks good, animations are nice, only some minor bugs noticed. Kinda game you’d really like a holographic version of.\n\nIt’s like playing chess, but then having the ability to take one of your opponents’ pieces off the board after your move. You can’t do that in one go as it takes time to damage a unit, but it adds another layer to it.\nIf you consider pinning a piece to its king, there might be none of your  pieces which can “take” that piece and result in a check, but with combined fire it could die, and on your opponents turn the check would happen. Give it a go you’ll see.\n\nThings I’d like to see:\n1.	I wiped every opponents piece off the board, I should get a bonus for that.\n2.	Bonus for the amount of pins you do with a knight or skewers with a bishop/queen, to be rewarded at the end of game.\n3.	I’d like the piece which actually caused check mate to do the execution, rather than the Captain all the time.\nI’d almost expect scouts to be pawns and dreadnaughts Rooks, but it doesn’t really matter.\nI don’t believe you have any rules which stop normal chess moves, but that’s probably a good thing.\n\nUpdates later.\n\n=====\n2nd update\n\nRamped the difficulty up to intermediate and 3 games in it’s apparent how much more of a war game it is. Your units can die before they get into a good position to act (occasionally surprising), so in that respect jumping a lone unit in to a bunch of them isn’t great unless you use other abilities which freeze their action points, which requires timing.\nSo tradition chess play might not be best, and it’s a question of adapting. Kings aren’t so weak when they can kill anything in 3 spaces from them. Bishops seem to do a lot of damage too.\nIt was kinda a fools mate, what’s interesting is that had I killed one of their units in the subsequent action, I would have allowed an exit for their king and it would no longer have been check mate.\n\n===\n3rd update first multiplayer:\nNow playing Skirmish on Master.\n\nFirst multiplayer, awesome. SM vs SM, really thought I was going to lose at one point but came back. In this game it's not always obvious to do the obvious takes, and even a blunder can be turned to an advantage. It quite satisfying setting up a skewer, and then finally knocking your opponents guarding piece out the way from afar, so he doesn't take your vulnerable piece elsewhere.\n\n\nBugs and requests moved to here:\nI've not had any game stopping bugs until now, which was a multiplayer one so I moved the bugs section to the forum, it's early access so it's to be expected. http://steamcommunity.com/app/322910/discussions/0/613957600530851251/","May 5, 2015","true","57.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I tried too. I'm a sucker for all 40k related, so that was an automatic buy for me. I'm not particular fond of chess, but i know the rules. I hoped maybe Regicide will help me get into chess more. That was a mistake, because this game is a weird combination of ideas.. and i can't really say i enjoy this mixture.\n\nMain mode, so called "Regicide" consists of two phases. In one, you move your pieces, like in a standard chess game. Moving, capturing - the same. Next is the Intiative Phase. Now things get messy. You can use initiation points to ... shoot enemy pieces or use skills. Every piece has its HP and Armor, so if you can't capture it by standard means, you can just kill it from a distance. To add insult to injury, every action in the Initiative Phase has percentage of success. So... you can for example - miss every shot. Not mentioning that two pieces on both sides can be diffrent in stats. Assault Space Marine (Knight) will have other stats than Ork Rockteer (Knight). Which is obvious within the lore, but ... it's CHESS.\nWhy that bothers me? You have a SYNCHRONIC game like chess, in which luck is not a factor... and you add to it - ASYNCHRONIC elements and luck-based mechanics. I does not work for me. For some people, it's a new level, a new challenge. For me it's just ridicilous.... and i really tried to like it. I forced myself to play it, but every time results are the same. Above that game feels very sluggish, probably due to two phases which every player must go through.\n\nWhat else? Graphics are fine, music is ok, but it feels like one track repeats all the time (maybe it's just my ears decieving me). Voice-over work is pretty decent, props for that. Overall, it's hard for me to recommend Regicide... Is it for chess players? Not really. Maybe for 40k fans? Maybe, but if you're not familiar with chess, you will feel completly lost.\n\nSo, its for Wh40k fans who enjoy chess? Such a weird focus group.  I'm a 40k fanboy, i do enjoy a bit of chess... and i don't like Regicide.

Like any grid-based combat game, you try to advance your squad across the board and dispatch enemies.  Each unit is assigned a class based on the traditional chess pieces, which determines their movement.  You can also instantly eliminate an opposing piece by moving onto its space in a traditional chess capture.  It is not simply a 40K reskin of chess, however, because each piece has unique abilities and added attacking options, allowing each piece to attack at a range from its square.  In all, I find it to be a delightful merger of two different, yet compatible games.\n\nAnd in keeping with the grimdarkness of the 41st Millenium, there is a delightful number of over-the-top execution animations and blood-spilling.","October 4, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As I state in my first impressions video, this is basically chess on crack. Good graphics, solid gameplay mechanics, and decently voice acted paired with my not finding any bugs makes me feel very confident in recommending this game to others.\n\nThe only drawback that really stuck out to me was the lack of rebindable keys. This game doesn't really NEED key rebinding, but in 2015 I feel that is a baseline capability which should not be overlooked.\n\nDespite the small issue with the key rebinding being absent, I found little else to fault with this game and at $15 it is definitely worth your money and time.

What I thought would merely be a simple chess game in 40k attire was actually far more enjoyable than expected.\n\nThe first thing that is immediately apparent is the sheer presentation of it. Animations, sound effects, music are all fantastic. The interface is sharp and responsive. Each race and unit has their own animations, sfx, and voice-acted banter of what you would expect of a 40k game. Such as always amusing ork slang and banter. Can never have enough dakka dakka.\n\nIn addition of the traditional chess mode, called 'Classic', the meat of the game is definitely in the 'Regicide' mode. Essentially, 'Regicide' adds an action phase after movement where units can use range, melee attacks, or use special abilities at the expense of action points. All of the conventional chess moves and attacks are present, of course, in the movement phase of your turn. With the addition of ranged, special attacks/abilities you definitely have to consider strategies outside the chess norm. Which is quite refreshing.\n\nIn addition to conventional play, I was astounded to find that a voice-acted campaign mode was in the game. It's certainly presented simplistically, namely voiced transmissions before each mission and a smattering of cutscenes, but definitely a welcome feature. The devs could have easily just made a chess game, dress it up in 40k skivvies and kicked it out the door.\n\nUsually, when you encounter games like this they are cobbled together with little concern other then getting it out the door to capitalize on the brand. You just really don't expect this level of quality. While it does have a few wrinkles, such as questionable AI at times, and my want for quicker gameplay, I am hard pressed to find negative aspects or faults with the game.\n\nHopefully, whatever wrinkles exist will be ironed out and we'll see more additions to the game such as armies(tau pls), features, Definitely worth the price of admission.","October 20, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

What I thought would merely be a simple chess game in 40k attire was actually far more enjoyable than expected.\n\nThe first thing that is immediately apparent is the sheer presentation of it. Animations, sound effects, music are all fantastic. The interface is sharp and responsive. Each race and unit has their own animations, sfx, and voice-acted banter of what you would expect of a 40k game. Such as always amusing ork slang and banter. Can never have enough dakka dakka.\n\nIn addition of the traditional chess mode, called 'Classic', the meat of the game is definitely in the 'Regicide' mode. Essentially, 'Regicide' adds an action phase after movement where units can use range, melee attacks, or use special abilities at the expense of action points. All of the conventional chess moves and attacks are present, of course, in the movement phase of your turn. With the addition of ranged, special attacks/abilities you definitely have to consider strategies outside the chess norm. Which is quite refreshing.\n\nIn addition to conventional play, I was astounded to find that a voice-acted campaign mode was in the game. It's certainly presented simplistically, namely voiced transmissions before each mission and a smattering of cutscenes, but definitely a welcome feature. The devs could have easily just made a chess game, dress it up in 40k skivvies and kicked it out the door.\n\nUsually, when you encounter games like this they are cobbled together with little concern other then getting it out the door to capitalize on the brand. You just really don't expect this level of quality. While it does have a few wrinkles, such as questionable AI at times, and my want for quicker gameplay, I am hard pressed to find negative aspects or faults with the game.\n\nHopefully, whatever wrinkles exist will be ironed out and we'll see more additions to the game such as armies(tau pls), features, Definitely worth the price of admission.","October 20, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

And I even like both the idea and the game. It's very fun and I will keep playing it.\nHowever, after playing for some days I can not recommend this game at least at full price. If they make some changes I will edit my review, but for now it is what it is. And it's a pity, because I love the idea, and somehow I even like the game, and many of its features.\n\nSo, why am I giving a negative review even when I like the game —and a lot—  you may ask? Continue reading the long review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort review:\n+Very good strategic game overall. Some deep tactics involved\n+Campaign is fun and even some missions are hard\n+Nice graphics\n+Game is really cool\n+Developers are really friendly, nice community also\n+DLC chapters can be obtained playing the game\n+Cross platform multiplayer\n\n\n-AI is sometimes a bit silly\n-Enemy AI cheats you with RNG hehe\n-Lack of information, ingame Librarium (help info) bugged, skills not well explained\n-Hard to find a match online because few people; sometimes more than 40' and no player found...\n-Multiplayer does NOT work, it's currently a crash fest, unplayable (bad servers).\n-They introduced an async mode, but you can't watch enemy turn in any way, so pointless\n-Cutscenes and intro don't have subtitles\n-No borderless windowed mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong review:\nGame was released months ago, but is still lacking some features. Let me explain a bit. There are two modes, CLASSIC and REGICIDE. Let's talk about Regicide:\nGameplay consists in two phases. First is similar to chess: you make one move and capture an enemy piece, and that is. Pieces are WH40K based, so you will see a marine killing an orc, or the opposite. Some movements doesn't have animations, and some are repetitive, but anyway it is a lot of fun. If you played Battlechess you know what I am talking about.\nSecond phase is what makes Regicide unique: consists in a very interesting tactical turn with shoots that involve armour and chance to hit, toughness, weapon strength, each unit also have a different life, etc. So it's very fun and well designed, I must say even brilliant. Also, each piece have different skills and the faction you are using also have some. You can use them depending on your total available points to use each turn, the cost of the skills, its cooldowns, range, etc. Also, some of them affect other units, some give buffs, debuffs, area damage, shields, etc.\n\nSo the system looks awesome, and indeed it is. You move one piece, and after that, use some points to use skills with some of your pieces (even the one that have just moved), shooting at enemies, etc.\n\nHowever, UI is a bit clunky, and the game presents an alarming lack of information. For example, you are not able to look ingame at the skills if you have used them this turn or if they are at cooldown, or if you can't use them this turn, or if you don't have line of sight, or in the main menu, etc. Example: it is your turn and you have to move. However, being a deeply tactical game you would like to know which skills you can use after the move and plan accordingly. Well, you can't do it, because some skills will not show up until you move. And even then, not every skill is shown, only the ones available. So you can't plan like 2 or 3 turns before.\n\nOf course, you can ALT+TAB and check all the information in the internet. Because the ingame Librarium (help menu) is also bugged and doesn't show almost anything properly. So be prepared to alt+tab a lot in middle of the game, each time you want to know a skill or that. And enemies doesnt show ANY skill. So when an enemy uses a skill, it says what it is, but you won't know exactly what happened. So you must alt+tab, look and search in the Librarium in official site. Same at the start of the game for EACH enemy unit, because if not, you don't know how to protect against each enemy piece.\n\nBad part is not that. Bad part is that the forum Librarium (aka manual) is also a bit crap, because most of the information is missing: some skills say "heal a bit amount", but don't say HOW MUCH. Same with plenty of skills, cooldowns, damages, buffs, etc. So you will play the game mostly blind skill-wise.\n\nEach unit has also 5 attributes. And game gives no proper explanation about what are they for. Good luck trying to learn combat mechanics and discover things like "armour is reduced each time weapon strength of the attacker is higher than armour of the defense unit", "each 2 armour points reduced 1 damage", "toughness reduce damage" and some things like that. Because neither the game nor the manual talk about that. You just know each piece got 5 attributes, but not how they work.\n\nAlso good luck searching information about line of sight and skill related ones.\n\nMore things... Well, game provides experience points, skill points, pieces have some tiers... and if you check forum and that you will discover soon how they function, but game doesn't show the minimal explanation about them, so be lost for some time.\n\n\nYou can buy DLC with money or playing time for more factions (well, mostly variations of the 2 main factions, marines and orcs), so chapters. And they are fun because some of them got different attributes and skills too (which are NOT explained unless you check the bugged librarium). However you can't buy it through steam, only ingame.\n\n\nOther than that, the game got some bugs, more of them minor. And not fine UI, for example when you want to learn the units, there is a hotkey that lets you use an overlay for chess pieces over them. Well, it disappears each time your turn ends AND each time a death animation happens. So you must click 3 times that hotkey at the end of each turn, and after each death animation. Ugly.\n\n\nCLASSIC mode is Chess with warhammer pieces.\n\n\n\n\nConslusion:\nThis is why I can't recommend this game —at full price—, for now. Game got potencial, is really fun, but the lack of information and some silly decisions added later, make this maybe doesn't worth your buy until they change some things and improve other ones. And multiplayer server looks bad, too many crashes at the start or at the middle of the game that make this game doesn't worth your money even in a big discount until its fixed (if someday it's fixed, which I start to doubt).\n\nHowever it is somehow fun, and chess+WH makes it a must for some guys like me. So read some information about it and maybe you can enjoy it just for the campaign even with their problems if you are a fanboy like me. But be warned if not because multiplayer does NOT work.","May 25","false","25.3"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","16","26","2","0"

The objective as always is to kill the king.\n\nThis game is great as it is and will be getting more features soon such as:\n\nA campaign split into 3 parts (complete with full voice acting)\nMore maps\nMore factions\n\nand i'm sure much more as the devs continues their process. It is a labor of love from the developers side and it shows.\n\nTHE CODEX ASTARTES APPROVES THIS GAME!","May 5, 2015","true","13.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The twist being the game having an action phase where you have a couple turns to do a multitude of actions. These actions can range from damaging enemy peices to increasing the defences of your own piece as well as other things.\n\nLike chess, This game will test your mind and it feels great. The gameplay is simple. Pick a piece, move it and begin action phase. If an enemy piece is within kill distance, you can instant kill that piece like in real chess. Overall, very well done mechanics and adds interesting things to a board game that I used to play as a child.\n\nSpeaking of the old board game, There is a classic mode in Regicide as well. It's classic chess with a brutal look at taking pieces. The animation on the kills are nice and violent. Each kill is satisfying.\n\nAs far as graphics go, The game looks pretty nice. The boards are interesting and of course, the armor on the characters looks amazing. This goes for the Space marines and the Orks. Overall, a nice game to look at as well as play.\n\nWhen it comes to sound, I'm a tad iffy on it. I've had a couple sounds cut out consistantly. The sound of Rook's Gattling gun seems to have an odd cutout. Music is nice but in the heat of the moment, I don't really notice the music and just want to focus on the game at hand.\n\nOverall, This game is brilliant. If you want to test your mind or just have fun playing a strategy game, get this one.","September 19, 2015","true","7.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

In a classic game of chess every piece will have its set movement and attack pattern giving both players the idea of what and when to move and can predict how the opponent will react. In the Regicide game mode, no piece will feel redundant with the addition of the initiative phase giving different stats (e.g. health, armor, weapons damage, accuracy etc…) to each piece which give players an opportunity to react differently and engage the opponent’s pieces or protect your own (to an extent) outside of the standard rules, ultimately changing the course of the battle and making you think twice before moving or engaging an enemy piece.","May 6, 2015","true","14.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

It can be played campaign or skirmish (AI or human player).\n\nThe campaign which can be tricky depending on difficulty, uses pre-arranged boards (some pieces missing and placed in strange starting positions) with obstacles and a generic space marine vs orc storyline.\n\nIn skirmish you can play classic mode which is chess or you can play regicide mode which adds some special abilities to your pieces that can be frustrating if you're expecting a clean chess game. Took me around 2 hours to utilize these abilities more wisely and stop getting stomped so hard. Important lesson: If you are playing marines, be aware that orks have a nasty assault ability that allows them to dish out heafty damage if adjecent to your piece. In many cases I found it wiser to hang back and just pepper them with bolters (snap shot) unless they opened themselves up to stupidity and checkmate. More replayability if you are really into chess and see yourself playing more games against randoms and skirmish AI.\n\nIf you dislike such games and are just looking for a 40k title, I'd ignore this game or wait till a sale. I consider myself not that grand a chess player but I love 40k and I do enjoy chess so I give it a 7/10. Would give it higher if it had different factions other than just orcs and space marines but it does the trick when the craving hits.\n\n(Edit: It is worth noting that the different chapters/orc clans have different stats in regicide mode.)","May 31","true","9.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The content of the game is still severly lacking with only two playable factions and one map this makes it hard to come back to and play again.

Yeah, there's classic chess if you're a fan of that and 40k, but where this game really shines is in it's campaign and regicide modes. They really do add a whole new layer of depth to an old game, and are thouroughly enjoyable. Also, if you're a fan of 40k, this game absolutely nails the atmosphere of the 41st millenium. The music is possibly the best I've heard in a 40k game so far, and all of the voice actors who did the Space Marines and Orks in Dawn of War are in this one, so of course that part of the game is excellent. I'd heartily recommend this game to any fans of chess or strategy games, and fans of Warhammer 40k in particular.","July 1, 2015","true","15.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

In the new WARHAMMER 40000 series Regicide, I equip my knights into the midfield of battle and into reaching range of the boltguns carried by my pawns to cleanse, purge and kill the orcs.\n\nRegicide is a two in one game. First is exactly is a chess game (as for players that don't know how to play chess, don't you worry the tutorial will teach you the basic and it's easy) but, try switching all the chess pieces from the chess board a chess game usually used to Space Marines and Orks characters from Warhammer 40,000 world, awesome right?!\n\nNow.. let us talk about the modes available in Regicide shall we.\nClassic Mode: lets you play normal chess against the AI or other humans, and while it might not be the best chess game ever made, like Battle Chess for example, the pieces animate into entertaining miniature duels that make up for basic features.The animations itself as brutal as you will expected that has been given in the setting. While playing and watching pawns blast to pulverize each other into chunks of meat plus the gore had livens up well... boring moves.. at least until you've seen them all.\n\nRegicide Mode: This mode keeps the regular chess rules, even advanced stuff like castling and 'en passant'(in passing) captures, and adding a slice of light strategy. After each turn plays out, like in normal chess, you'll enter the initiative phase by spending points to activate special abilities. A players unit piece might gain a defensive shield, shoot at an enemy, use a psychic power, or throw a grenade. Each piece has hit points to be chipped away or reinforced it by using these abilities, but the initiative phase initially seems less decisive than in the movement phase.\n\nThe last two modes will be the Skirmish and Campaign Modes:\nYou could play as a stand-off skirmish against the AI with different difficulties or a human opponent online or hot-seat. Through a single-player campaign with a surprising amount of good narrative development by opening the story with a cut-scene. Each of its 50 levels has an intro, as the Blood Angels chapter of Space Marines strive to take Hethgar Prime back from the Orks of the Goff clan. These levels are like puzzling chess books, that will give you a set of pieces in an unusual way to let you find out as a challenged for you to take the queen without losing your own, or preventing your opponent promoting a pawn.\n\nAs a 40K fan recognizes Regicide as the chess variant had been played in one of the official novels while also realizing that this game doesn’t resemble the descriptions of it, but who knows the Blood Angels sometimes got into blood-drinking frenzies and maybe eat brains. As I played the campaign to see how its story going out to be the weakest part of Regicide, but even with nicely done voice actors from the Dawn Of War series would not be enough to convince the nerds that had known more about the 40K universe. Skirmish mode had it good, whether against an AI with harder difficulties or an actual player, where it feels more like Chess+ mode.\n\nTheGameSelectionz final verdict for this game is 8/10(Great Game).","September 26, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

VERY INTENSE IN MULTIPLAYER REGICIDE (in my opinion anyway i dont know how you might think about it). Seriously when i won my first battle in regicide it just felt so much more rewarding than i thought it was going to be. Pretty much a must-buy if you like chess like myself.\n\n\nafter a recent patch they adjusted the AI so the hit percentages now seem like they hit and miss as they should now, and i can tell easily since the orcs have a 52% chance to hit my guys in the campaign\n\nso after that patch i say it is now 8.5/10 :) (i feel like putting decimals on things today for some reason)","September 18, 2015","true","19.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","3"

It is important to clearly underscore that the Regicide graphics are the finest representation of space marines and the Warhammer 40K universe ever presented within video gaming.  While the game is very tightly assembled, the game does lack a significant amount of depth.  A game with vehicles, and multiple upgrade options, as well as races would do a lot to justify its 30-40 dollar price.\n\nStill, for a chess-TBS hybrid set in the Warhammer 40K universe, Regicide is a worthwhile diversion.\n\n7/10.","March 18","true","8.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

There are no complaints this kind of system.\n\nRegicide, on the other hand, allows you to bypass maybe an hour or two of game time to unlock a cosmetic by spending 99 cents. Whooboy, that's crazy talk. Actually it isn't. This is what people are talking about when they want microtransations done properly.

I was expecting 40k Battle-Chess, and indeed the Classic mode is exactly that. Regicide Mode, however, is actually a properly clever, inventive meld of chess and an Action Point system similar to the one from Space Hulk. There's even a Campaign-mode with small-scale set engagements, specific victory and defeat conditions, and a reasonably well-scripted voice-acted narrative that ties the campaign together.\n\nThe movement rules come more-or-less directly from Chess, with one move per turn, but after moving your piece you can perform a number of other actions with any of your pieces, including the one you just moved. Pieces can either be 'captured' (like taking a piece in Chess - an instant kill) or damaged and killed over a series of turns or attacks by ranged or melee attacks from nearby pieces. Some pieces have less health, making them more susceptible to ranged attacks. Such attacks have a percentile chance to hit, modified by range, taking cover, aiming etc, and inflict varying amounts of damage depending on what weapon and how many points of armour your piece has.\n\nOn the more critical side, the interface system is mostly good except for some irritating details - for example there's no clear way to deselect an action if you decide you'd actually rather not (although clicking on an empty tile does the trick, it's not intuitive to click forward to go back). Also, optional vanity sales and paid-for content once again defile the game industry, with this offering including a range of 'unlockable' alternate Chapter liveries, and (assuming Regicide is a moderate commercial success) will probably eventually include DLC packs for Chaos Marines and other Xenos species (at the moment it's just Orks and Space Marines). The good news is that if you play enough, you can earn enough experience points to unlock most of the vanilla content anyway, and playing daily boosts an XP multiplier - but only by 0.1x per consecutive day. Considering all you're really getting for your efforts is a custom aesthetic option, if you're like me, you'll probably just ignore these options until you happen to notice one day that you've accumulated enough XP to unlock something. On the other hand, if you're wealthy enough to throw money at games developers for what ought to be included in the retail price, I suggest you donate your wealth to me instead - it's a better use for it, plus it makes me happy and keeps me in cookies and cola.\n\nTo sum up, this game will teach you the basics of chess while also showing you what happens when a Librarian explodes someone with his brain, and if you play the campaign it'll tell you an interesting war-story too. Since a decent tabletop chess-set will set you back at least £20/$30, the store price for Regicide isn't too steep - but God-o-God do game developers need to stop demanding we pay for the privilege of opening the 'options' menu.","February 1","true","10.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zwanglos/recommended/322910/","zwanglos","zwanglos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zwanglos/","273 products in account","Very pleasantly surprised with this title. I thought I'd pick this game up, maybe convince a friend to get it, and it'd be that '40k chess thing' we'd sometimes play now and again.\n\nThis game has me hooked, though - I have absolutely DEVOURED the campaign, and playing in multiplayer is a blast. I would favorably compare the Regicide mode with a good turn-based tactical game along the lines of the battles in King's Bounty or Might and Magic (though it's a chessboard, not hex tiles), though battles take significantly longer (avg. 1 hour to complete a match, I had one last night go for 2 hours)\n\nThinking of Regicide as '40K Chess' is a completely inadequate description. If this had merely been Chess with 40K units (and there is a 'classic' mode that is just that) I wouldn't be able to recommend this title over, say, just getting a free or paid account at Chess.com.\n\nBut the titular 'Regicide' mode is its own unique creation and plays completely different from how you would expect a chess match to go. During each turn, there will be a Movement Phase and an Initiative Phase - the former is what you'd expect, with pieces moving and being able to capture like everything you know in standard chess.\n\nHowever, the following Initiave Phase allows you to spend Initiative Points:\nYou can use abilities for ALL of your pieces, not just the one you moved. Examples include the self-explanatory 'snap shot', to melee attacks (which all units have in one form or another) to more specialized abilities such as artillery strikes, krak grenades, or Terminator shields (just to name a few)\nThere are global player abilities you can also spend points on, such as giving a shield to any of your units, healing them, giving them buffs, cloaking them, etc. You are limited to four abilities in a match, but you can customize these from a list of around 8 or so, and they are unique to either the Space Marines or Orks.\nYou generate 3 initiative points per turn, but can save them up as needed (a common thing in turn based tactical games), to a maximum of 5 points.\nIf you play in a chess mindset, this can have disasterous results for you. Want to take a pawn with your queen, pinning an enemy rook for capture next turn? There is a very real possibility that all of the surrounding enemy pieces will shoot your queen into slag on their turn, so be careful.\n\nPro +\n\nGraphics and kill animations are impressive. These are skippable if you want to speed things up in-game\nSound effects are good, voice acting for units/campaign has quality similar to Dawn of War (yes, orks sound orky)\nSoundtrack has a solid 40K/Space Marine feel to it, glad I picked up the OST when it was on sale.\nCampaign is quite fun, and I enjoyed trying to get most of the secondary objectives. Think of campaign missions sort of like the 'chess puzzles' you'd see when opening up a newspaper, though in the game's Regicide mode, and often there is debris and cover strewn about that limits line of sight and impedes movement in particular ways.\nThe multiplayer mode is very enjoyable.\nNeutral ~\nHave to register for an account in-game, and in-game friends list is separate from your steam friends list. Minor annoyance.\n[Note: third race is planned eventually] Only two races, choosing between various chapters only changes the colors. I'm wishing space wolves had crazy beards and wolf helmets, rather than just being a different color scheme. Devs hinted they might look at that, but no guarantees.\nAdditional race colors require unlocking with requisition points, or buying them outright for something like $1.26. Adds a grind I didn't think was necessary. Playing through the campaign gave me enough points to unlock two colors, though. Only other way to accumulate points is with ladder matches.\nRNG: Most unit abilities have hit/miss probabilities, as do some offensive player abilities. You either think this is okay, or you're the guy who misses 10 shots in a row.\nCons -\n[Note: devs have told me this is a planned feature] Currently lacks any kind of map maker or workshop support, so multiplayer match layouts are limited to the standard chessboard setup, with none of the cover or debris you'd see in the campaign. Different maps are currently just different visual environments.\nDoes not currently seem to be any way to save or view replays, unless I missed that somewhere.\n[Note: devs have told me UI upgrades are planned] There is no public chat lobby, no player counts along the lines of 'x players queued in ladder' etc. If you sit there trying to find a match against a random opponent, you're currently going to be disappointed and waiting in vain. Best practice is to search out and add friends via steam groups, game forum, have friends that are interested in playing it, etc.","February 2","true","75.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are no complaints this kind of system.\n\nRegicide, on the other hand, allows you to bypass maybe an hour or two of game time to unlock a cosmetic by spending 99 cents. Whooboy, that's crazy talk. Actually it isn't. This is what people are talking about when they want microtransations done properly. So no, you can't play as the Space Wolves immediately, but that is simple progression.

Well, it finally paid off!\n\nWarhammer 40K: Regicide is heavily based on chess but offers a variety of chance based skills and attack options after every regular move. And this extension works very well. The single-player campaigns alone make it worth your while, since they offer hours and hours of different chess problems (with the extended rules set).\n\nThe competitive multiplayer is fine too, but it does require more patience than regular online chess. Matches in Regicide tend to take even longer, partly because of the fancy move and kill animations. Also expect the ultra violence and over the top tone of any other WH40K video game, which is a good thing. Just by looks and style this game fits right into some niche between Dawn of War and Space Marine. So, yeah, it’s awesome too!","June 3","true","26.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The visuals are amazing, it's just addictive. Includes a story, easy multiplayer, cross platforming, universal levelling up system so you don't have to lose your progress. Not that the levels matter, they just unlock new force colours, so it's still all down to you as a player. You can play regular chess, without the Regicide extras, and you still get all the gripping visuals. It is well worth a buy and you can visit the Regicide forums and become apart of the community! All the staff are easy to get along with people who respond to everyone (given a little time, they are busy you know).\n\nMy advice is to get this game and get your friends to get this game!

So far they seem very communicative and responsive, which is a rare breath of fresh air these days.\n\nThe two different game modes have already been explained so I won't bother. I'm just going to tell you why I like the game and the devs: even if the Regicide system may not be entirely to your liking and you just want to play 40k skinned chess with friends (which you totally can, it's great), I recommend you also try the campaign (especially the new one with the orks) - it's worth it not just as a challenging game, but the ork dialogues are worth it in and of themselves.\n\nAnother nice touch is that the unlockable content (new chapters for marines and orks, new map, new campaign) can all either be purchased liek DLC or unlocked with Requisition - a resource you obtain playing the game.\n\nAnd now that chapters each get their own quirks, being more than just different skins, the game has grown quite a bit in complexity.\n\nEspecially on sale, I wholeheartedly recommend getting this game if you like chess and 40k.","May 19","true","27.8"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","10","17","2","3"

If the King is taken it's a victory/checkmate.\nEach campaign mission can feature varied side objectives and main objectives,\nsuch as "capture all enemy pawns" or "Have your knight reach the objective".\n\nI found myself getting bored of the repetitive gameplay after a while but stayed\nfor the great story and dialogue between missions. Each turn you can move\none unit (piece) or if an enemy is close enough you can also instantly kill the enemy\nduring the movement phase then comes the initiative phase, where you\ncan choose which unit abilities to use, for example, the Librarian unit\ncan use life leech to steal health from an enemy unit to replenish his own.\n\nEven tho it seems nearly identical to chess you can play it as if it were a turn based game.\nWhen you move onto an enemy occupied title it will activate a "Killcam" a fancy cutscene showing your unit slaughtering\n(or being slaughtered by) an enemy unit.\n\nI found the tutorial extremely helpful and managed to pick up the gameplay\nreally easily.\n\nGRAPHICS/TECHNICAL DETAILS\n\nThe graphics are similar to most of the 40K games but aren't bad by any means.\nTextures appear sharp and clear, environments are somewhat bland as to keep the chessboard\nappearance. I noticed the occasional missing special effects, such as when certain units fire their weapon,\nthe muzzle flash fails to appear. I kept a constant framerate and didn't notice any slow downs,\neven during action sequences. Load times appear to be nearly instantaneous.\n\nSOUND\n\nOverall sound quality is fantastic, the developers really put a lot of work into the sound effects,\nvoice acting is top notch and really give the marines and Ork their well-known personalities.\nWeapon effects are great and you can hear iconic weapon sounds from many forms of 40K media,\ncharacters speak and react to their actions and the actions of the enemy.\n\nThe game features full English audio with subtitle & interface support for the following languages.\n\nEnglish\nFrench\nItalian\nGerman\nSpanish\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nRegicide features Multiplayer, Local Co-op and Cross-Platform Multiplayer\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMy final verdict is, it's worth the asking price for the amount of content you are getting,\nthe game is frequently updated, you can buy the game on steam for £10.99.\n\nIf you are a fan of Warhammer 40,000 you won't be disappointed.\n\nPROS/CONS\n\n+ Great CGI intro sets the mood\n+ Good voice acting and music\n+ Good graphics\n+ Informative Tutorial\n+ Dialogue scenes for each campaign mission\n+ Well written campaign\n+ Fantastic Killcams\n+ Great environmental audio\n- Repetitive gameplay","September 18, 2015","true","4.8"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","14","26","0","2"

This is the same as Blues Brothers 2 in the sense that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n* No varying animation for CBC/ranged attacks, checkmate or any other unit action in the game (it's the same thing over and over). It becomes a stale repetition of semi-skippable unit animations and gunshot sounds,\n* No thought into animation camera angle (it's locked to something that often means what is occurring is not visible)\n* Stupid SP AI, often you could just move back & forth while shooting at range - would take 50 turns but would win you the game. With 3 critical strikes per move, any strategy is thrown out the window.\n* Stats linked to an account is a stupid idea when no-one is playing. I could hardly ever find a human player who did not quit after 2 moves.

More a proof of concept that slowly developed over time but it was playable. Now it's not even that.\n\nI love the idea of 40k and chess. I enjoy both the concept behind regicide and classic chess with all of the wonderfully violent executions when pieces are taken.\n\nHowever as of the date of this review the only recommendation I can make of this game is to stay away. I've tried close to 20 different games of both the campaign and skirmish regicide against the AI (Not a fan of online play and from the bug reports I've seen online is plagued with its own issues) and every single time in classic mode the following happens:\n\nThe weird boy makes a leaping move animation and then freezes before landing on the square he's supposed to land on. Sometimes I can move, sometimes it's stuck on the AI's turn until I give up waiting and end the game.  Or sometimes my librarian or assault marine will make an attack and then freeze there after the animation not allowing the AI to move. These aren't issues of the game crashing and sending me to my desktop as I can pull up the menu and reset the board and it all goes fine until one of these happens again.\n\nEvery single time I down the first ork in regicide I'm stuck unable to do anything and the game is over. I have to quit and start over and kill the first ork again.\n\n\nThis breaks the game and makes it unplayable and it is NOT acceptable for any game that proudly proclaims it has launched.\n\nThe sad part is I really want to like the game. It looks beautiful the textures are nice the view surrounding the board is very enveloping enough to were it almost seems like the perfect balanced version of 40k tabletop everyone wants to have. I've even recognized GW terrain pieces. But if I can't play the game then no matter how good it looks or sounds I can't judge the rest of it. I don't know how the rest of the campaign progresses if I can't get past killing the first ork. I don't know how good the AI is if I can't get past barely devloping my board before the game gets stuck in a bug again and i have to reset the board again.\n\nIf you want a 40k themed chess set buy a tac squad some boys and look on ebay for the remaining pieces and throw them on a chess board. At least you can play the game to its end.\n\nAvoid Warhammer 40,000: Regicide until it can fix the key bugs that make it unplayable.","January 21","false","4.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I like the idea of chess+warhammer, and you get this blend that works really well, with one aspect that pretty much ruins the whole game for me.\n\nEvery action you perform is subject to chance, so in short you can take your strategy, and flush it down the box, because nothing is certain to the point of becoming entirely unpredictable. Its not uncommon to play two rounds, perform 6 actions, fail at performing every single one, while building up some real world aggravation everytime it happens.\n\nI'm not this incompetent in real life, so why does this game let me play like a blubbering idiot? Can you imagine failing at least 1/3 of everything you do in life? Go ahead, grab a glass of milk, i dare you, go see what happens.\n\nPsychologically, it just doesn't work. Winning is a relief, and losing is a pity, neither are satisfying because its not really in your hands. Its just this one little element from the tabletop i think that should have been left out, or within (severe) limitation.\n\nThey should take this game, fix it, expand it, and re-publish it, because there is something really cool there, but for now its only provoking potential homocidal tendencies wich i think are never good and should be avoided at all times unless you have low selfesteem issues because then it simply wouldn't matter and its all the same to you.\n\nBut really, this could have been so much more and better, and i dont think i will be spending a whole lot time on a game that's quite discouraging.","June 2","false","21.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

They are trying so damn hard to sell you a chess game for $15. The in engine scenes you see above grossly overhype the act of capturing a chess piece. The animations I saw in game were for the most part not as interesting.\n\nIt's my opinion that those who want to play chess are better off not spending extra money for blood, gore, and a Warhammer 40k skin.\n\nThe "Regicide" game mode is obviously a slight improvement, as it offers gameplay that you can't necessarily find for free elsewhere. However, the limitted board geometry and the usage of chess captures detracted from the experience for me. I feel that this is a real shame, as the developers of the game have clearly invested a lot of work into making nice character models with live motion captured animations. But the gamemodes don't do it justice. It's clear that the devs are HUGE Warhammer fans, so I'm dissapointed that they didn't make a game that stands up to the legacy of the epic tabletop game.\n\nThe cutscene at the beginning of the game is intriguing, and very well done. I would have very much enjoyed seeing it evolve into a more plot driven strategy game, but that is in no way what it is.\n\nYou may dismiss me as someone who doesn't like chess enough to justify buying this game. I suppose you would be right, but it's not that I don't like chess. I like both chess and Warhammer 40k, I just don't feel like the luxury of having the two combined (at least visually) is worth a premium. Go ahead and call me a cheapskate too, but there are free chess games available, and other Warhammer games to spend money on.","October 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

The death animations are cool for a bit, but they grow tiresome quickly as there aren't all that many, with most of them just being shooting bullets till the enemy falls or explodes.  The graphics are alright, but not particularly impressive, especially considering how feel animations they seem to have.  The animations are also painfully slow.  Luckily you can skip watching the devistator trooper lumber along for 30 seconds to get from one side of the map to the other, but the fact that you would need to skip it in the first place is a telling sign.\n\nThe abilities are an interesting twist on the classic chess, but ultimately most people like chess because it is a game of absolute strategy, no luck involved, and the abilities throw in a massive dose of luck.  Kudos for shaking up the normal strategies by adding abilities, but less props for doing it by introducing random luck into the game.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest downfalls of the game is how terrible some of the UI and general information on the game is.  Finding out exactly what an ability does, how likely it is to work, how far you can use it from, and so on is nearly impossible.  You can't even see what an ability does or how to use it, unless you can actually use it.  Want to know how far your troopers can shoot before you move them into position?  Hope you've memorized it.  Want to take a quick glance at what an ability does? Hope you're in range to use it, because the ability won't even show its name unless it is available, in range, and use conditions are met.\n\nSimilarly, there is virtually no documentation on what any of the stats mean.  Strength seems to mean how much damage a unit does, and might somehow be reduced by toughness, but I'm not entirely sure, as no where in the game or the 'manuel' (which only lists half the units, and is poorly laid out where there isn't simply a void of information) is any sort of explanation given as to what the stats do.  In one fight for example, my armor kept getting ignored by the enemy shootas.  No idea why.  Nothing in the manual indicated it should be happening unless they were using psychic attacks.  I don't think ork bullets are psychic weapons, but I could be wrong.  I have no way to check anything after all, since getting information from the game is like prying teeth.\n\nThese last bits give the game a very 'lets rush out something with Warhammer 40k slapped on it for some quick cash' feel.  I think it recently got out of early access, and it seems like it could have used another week or two there to do some polishing on little things like a manual and proper UI.\n\nOverall I don't think it is a game that chess people will like, because the animations are slow, the additions are luck based (though there is a classic option that removes them), and the space marines theme isn't likely to appeal to them.  I don't think it's something Warhammer 40k people will like because it is chess with fancy figures.  If you happen to like both, it might be a decent buy, but I'm very fond of both, and feel there are much better places to get my dose of 40k and of chess.  I don't need to get them together.","September 11, 2015","false","1.0"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","7","20","0","1"

You simply need to play the campaign mission often enough, to know how to win by anticipating the AI movement.\n\nCorrection: The campaign cannot be finished because the "shockwave" ability of your scriptor is buggy too and won't work.\n\nUpdate: 1st none campaign game, just one more move to victory -> Game Crash.... wonderful game indeed.

(I've been working on a 40k Chess Set for some time and I can say that these units do not do a good job of communicating what piece they are.)\n\nIf you play the regicide version, it's just boring. In all honesty chess is more exciting than the regicide version because at least chess makes sense. In regicide its like playing a crappy form of xcom except that your pieces can only move the way normal chess pieces move. The fact that in one mission I had 2 bishops and 4 pawns against only a single bishop and still had to spend a number of turns to wrangle the bishop in while he pinged away at my units just felt stupid and clunky. I would reccommend that you save your money and buy something else.","May 29","false","0.7"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

It does have a different game mode called, funnily enough Regicide which is still a chess based game and so follows movement and piece taking rules but also the pieces have abilities and combat actions.\n\nPros\nThe game is reasonably good to look at and is faithful to the warhammer 40k.\nEach piece is well fleshed out but only has a few combat animations such as attacks, kills and death animations. Cons\nThe game is quite limited and will generally play out the same, which got a little stale after less than two hours.\nRNG plays a significant part of the game.\nOrks have a lower chance to hit but score hits and critical hits more often, probably a cheap fix to make the AI harder.\nDespite being the Imperiums finest, Marines are noticeably weaker in armour, fire power and toughness. Although stats say differently.\nThe campaign mode is lack lustre. Essentially a brief story element  then in the game. Much like Space Hulk there is little feeling of immersion or actually comprehension of what is going on.\nAlternative factions are behind a paywall or can be unlocked for a grind.  I believe 10K resources are needed to unlock a chapter, each Skirmish rewards around 100 so you are looking at 100 games at base Requisition gain to unlock a chapter. I don't know if they give special abilities or not.\nConclusion\n\nI can only recommend this game to those who like chess, and 40K. As a title I find it lacking, like many 40K games recently and especially in the mobile market the games feel like themed cash cows. For being a release, and a game that was Early Access for sometime there are still issues with the game. In the main the game itself lacks substance, the tutorial was very basic and had some errors. The campaign, something I always want in 40K games is less of a campaign but more of an excuse to stick the two sides against each other on a lack lustre and uninteresting back drop.\n\nUnfortunately due to Games Workshops falling revenues at the moment they are throwing licenses out for games in an attempt to claw back royalties from publishers. The quality of earlier THQ and Relic games and if you go further back SSI are long forgotten.","September 13, 2015","false","1.8"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","1"

Sadly it's something that probably looks good on paper but is not as fun as you'd hope for. Regicide mode makes the game of chess so much slower than it has to be through initially fun though eventually slow animations. The UI is buggy with a particularly large number of problems with cursor raytracing. I've seen my king attempt a melee attack but miss with 100% hit-chance. The regicide abilities make winning a game almost more chance than skill. There is a mode to play conventional chess though you'll soon be wishing you had a simplistic chess game minus the unskippable animations and without cluttered/confusing view of the game. So the conventional chess mode is more annoying than a free online chess alternatives, and Regicide will only ever annoy you with its chance-based ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The raw-chess mode might be more fin if devs can patch up some of the more annoying bugs, optimise code that causes the obscene loading times, and make gameplay much more fast-paced. The regicide-mode could only be improved my making all chances to miss <5% and drastically lowering the damage being dealt by all units.","September 12, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 15 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","3","15","0","1"

Sadly.\n\nOn paper I liked the idea of this.  Basically, chess, with a shooting phase after moving a piece.  A chess-style capture is an automatic OHKO, while attacks gradually deplete HP on a unit (or multiple units with AOE abilities).  You have three initiative points per turn (which can roll over to later turns) to have units attack or use various unique abilities.  Terminators, which stand in for rooks, can generate a protective shield, tactical marines (pawns) have grenades, Librarians (queens) can heal themselves by stealing enemy HP, etc.  There are also global player abilities.\n\nThe dealbreaker for me here is that most attacks and abilities have a chance to hit, and the RNG is a steaming pile of AI-biased bantha poodoo.  Now, if you're about to tell me to "git gud" and "learn2turnbasedtactics", my response is that that is generally my line, so you KNOW it's bad.\n\nNow, I COULD soldier on regardless, but I had no real motivation to:\n\nTwenty missions into the 50-mission campaign, I have killed a lot of orks, including a weirdboy, and seized a communications relay.  I fought a warboss, but he got away, and the scout squad that got to the relay before us is dead.  There we go, summed up, by the numbers, 2/5 of the story for you. My squad is not persistent or customizable, no character has a personality, and although I'm supposedly the Blood Angels, there is nothing distinguishing me from generic space marines but one mention of the Red Thirst and the paint job.  Perhaps there's a shocking twist lurking.  I doubt it.\n\nYou might say this is irrelevant, since the real draw should be multiplayer.  Maybe, but I can't find any matches, literally zero.  Now, I freely admit this may be an issue on my end.  On any computer I've owned, some games just can't seem to do this.  The problem is, most DO, and I can't be bothered to search forums and forward ports and make firewall exceptions and a lot of other stuff that generally, speaking from experience, doesn't actually help when I could instead just play something that works out of the box.\n\nSpeaking of which, the last few other turn-based tactics games I played and liked that coincidentally address something I complained about above:\n\nInvisible, Inc -- no chance-to-hit whatsoever, your agents and the enemy guards are perfect shots.  All about cover and thinking ahead.\n\nThe Banner Saga -- has a free, separate multiplayer mode, Factions, which has at the moment an extremely small community (probably will go up whenever TBS 2 releases and there's a new surge in interest) but at least, if there's a game to be found, it will be found.\n\nFire Emblem (pretty much the whole franchise) -- the Random Number Goddess reappears and smirks deviously at me, but I shall know no fear, for I am fear incarnate...or perhaps because here, unit stats change over time, weapons can be switched, and different terrain exists, meaning it's actually pretty easy to get a 100% or 0% that even she wouldn't lie about.  ALSO, there's actually characters and plot worth caring about even when I want to tableflip my emulator.\n\nHey, at least the animations are pretty cool, and from what I can tell the devs are too.  In fact, apparently they're considering removing the RNG.  Perhaps in time this review will become anachronistic.  Until then, if you want strategy play chess or something above; if you want to watch space marines stomping xenos skulls into the dirt, Dawn of War I & II and Space Marine exist.

This goes against what you would expect especially when you see bishop units carrying more armor than the pawns seem to do.\n- Taking advantage of an opening in the defence by moving a bishop far behind the enemy line will immidiately be punished because no piece is hindered and can fire weapons in any direction, including behind them.\n\nThe game currently feels very unbalanced for the moment and I hope they fix this up once they finalized the early access. At the current stage I do not recommend the game.\n\nStill some minor bugs in game, i.e.\n- seeing the blood from a previous game still in your new game.\n- Buffs and area effects sometimes become the same thing.\n- Be very careful what move you want to make.

Well heres a nice summary to help you decide if you want to or not.\n\nWhat is this game? In a nutshell this game is chess with warhammer figures (but you can turn on the standard chess piece icon above their heads if you get confused) AND a chess LIKE game called regicide, but each piece has stats and abilities (which let you shoot, throw grenades,heal, shields, etc.) after youve made a standard chess move, (letting you alter the chess part greatly by killing pieces without making chess moves) which is cool to some and some hate it. I personally prefer standard chess, however regicide mode is fun and im glad they chose it for the single player campaign.\n\nSo this game is Chess with warhammer skins and an alternate chess-like game mode.\n\nOverall the game has some pros and cons.\n\nThe pros\n\nare that its chess with a warhammer skin and it looks very pretty both graphic and animation wise the sync kills are amazing when you take an enemy piece. It has a nice online community with match making, lobbies, ways to check stats, leveling up your army, the look of your soldiers, and even battle abilties to unlock for the regicide mode and entire army chapters for space marines, and clans for orks (so basically a different color scheme).\n\nSo the game works an runs very pretty and if you like chess its great. However...\n\nThe cons\n\nare that there are some VERY infuriating bugs and even a design flaw or two. So the way you unlock stuff that was ALREADY IN THE GAME ready to go on release is done by either two ways, with real money cash shop (calm your p2w alarms) or you can unlock points per campaign mission, skirmish vs the ai, and mp matches. Sounds cool right? The problem is that right now you can easliy complete a mission and its secondary objectives and not get any points at all or credit, there have been MULTIPLE TIMES I have WON a mission and did not get credit for a the PRIMARY objective (aka winning the match!) or done the secondary objective MANY MANY MANY times and not gotten credit, since these points for completeing said things are used to purchase things that are also purchaseable with REAL money its like your being stolen from, and it happens WAY too often for them to not have noticed it. That does two things, leaves a REALLY bad taste in your mouth (unless you like seeing $ taken from you after you have earned it) and forces you to replay mission OVER AND OVER until you get credit which is annoying to say the least. Another HUGE gripe I have with this game and even consider a design flaw as other game give xp for hotseat matches, is that hotseat matches with friends gets you nothing! No cosmetic army experience or anything, this game was gifted to me because they new hotseat games were a HUGE thing at my house, and because of a few losers who might exploit it, we are being penalized and the only way to level up and make your army look cooler is to be forced to play against the AI or random people on the internet, call me crazy but I like social interation with the people I actually INTERACT with in real life, since this game doesn't seem to support that our hotseat game of choice will remain RISK II, or HOM&M # over this ANY DAY.\n\nIf you already know what regicide ( the game mode) is and its rules and like it's spin on chess and like playing chess vs ai oppenents or random people on the internet this game is for you and has potential, however if you had any hope of playing and earning rewards IN A GAME DESIGNED to be played by two people in chairs together (aka hotseat on a computer) you can't enjoy it with friends sadly as while the match may be fun, but the fact you didn't progress anything together instantly removes all fun in quite a demoralizing way. The game was gifted to me and I'm greatful for that, however I could not recommend this purchase until they fix the currency bugs, or enable cosmetics to be earned in hotseat.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nAll in all I'd wait for a discounted sale unless your friends list is packed with friends that own the game and youd want to play with because any form of chess against an AI is just really boring, and (to me) playing chess against random people is no where near as fun as friends on skype or heaven forbid in person.\n\nIf you plan on playing this by yourself and never hot-seat with anyone, the game is good and i'd normally recommend it, but I still won't recommend it until they fix the in-game currency bugs/ issues as they happen WAY too often, especially for content that was in the game at release. Once they fix those bugs I will change from negative to positive.\n\n","September 9, 2015","false","28.6"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","2","17","0","2"

There was day 1 DLC skins in a game with only 2 playable races (fine for the price, but not with paid skins). Mechanically there are bugs all over the place (% hit is wildly broken).

My refund request has been turned in at 2.2 hours. This review stands until then.\n\nUPDATE 9/16/2015: I got my refund. A developer posted on this review asking for feedback. I found out that they did not delete the thread (although STEAM said it had been) as I thought and it was moved to the Feedback section.

Plainly chess. Chess with a warhammer 40k look and your chess pieces have abilities and guns. The campaign might differ a tad from normal chess. But everything else I've played is chess. Which kinda disappointed me because I expected more. I enjoy chess but I do not have to get into the detail and tactics of it. Thus I won't get that much better at it. Also if I ever play chess I play speed chess. I hoped this was something new I could pick up and start to learn from the ground up. But anyone who is good at chess will have a huge advantage.\n\nThe animations are cool but that's about it. I would guess that there is more to unlock if you play more of the game. But it's so slow paced that I could not stand playing 1 game of multiplayer less suffer through the campaign.\n\nI was lost getting into it and even more lost getting out of it.

The tutorial, which you can't skip, just points you to a bunch of confusing on-screen icons without explaining what they mean or what they do. When you finally get to play a game, you find that the rules of chess sometimes apply, but sometimes not - one of the biggest flaws is that putting the enemy leader into checkmate doesn't actually do anything - the Warboss, despite being in checkmate by a Terminator, was perfectly content to sit there, gunning down my Librarian and Assault Marine until I finally felled him with a sustained barrage of bolter fire.\n\nYes, the cathartic joy of perforating Orks with rocket-propelled rounds is obtainable here, and the graphics are excellent. But the voice acting is minimal - I think they have two, maybe three people doing all the voices.

Overall the kill animations and finishers are a spectacle, the first 10 times... After that I found myself skipping the limited number of animations to just save myself time, maybe I'm impatient? But seriously anyone who finds the same repetitve kill sequence entertaining, after a dozen times, might actually be the perfect target audience for the game, clearly i was not.\n\nTo sum up REGICIDE mode, it is chess, however while playing chess at the end of a 'movement phase' players can use abilities which impact their own, or the enemies pieces. For example using a shield on your own piece as defensive play, however the introduction of the ability to attack at distance (up to 4 tiles) and kill other pieces, TOTALLY RUINS THE GAME. I understand this steers it away from the normal rules of chess, but seriously any chess player who plays this game is going to flip out, after pieces which are perfectly SAFE, are removed from the board by some random pawn a few tiles away getting some lucky shot.\n\nThat is exactly the problem with REGICDE mode, it takes the game of chess which is a game of total skill with no RNG involved. To a game of "well I might as well just charge my pieces forward since i can just shoot the guy, and hopefully not miss".\n\nA funny experience I had was when the enemy king shot and killed my piece, this piece just so happened to be obstructing a Rook, so the king put himself in check. However because the move phase was finished the king was stuck, so I entered my move phase with the ENEMY KING ALREADY IN CHECK! (I don't have to insult your intelligence to explain how bad that is).\n\nOverall I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you play classic mode without all the extra added BS, then you might have a fun experience for a few games, until you realise that you might as well just go and play chess online!\n\nAs a whole the entire experience becomes mundane after literally a few games. You would probably get more enjoyment by spending the money to go see a movie, because this game will gather dust in your library.\n\nIf you're wondering why I even bought this game, well i was curious to see just how fun it could be. It wasn't very much fun. I have been curious so YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE. I feel that having chess at the core of the game, only deepens my hatred for Regicide mode as it tears apart a game I love.\n\nLike I say this is only my opinion, so if you are still compelled to waste £10, then crack on. If even one person reading this who is on the boarder lineto buy this, is swayed not to buy this game, then that's good enough for me.\n\nBecuase even if you are a hardcore fan of both games, this game is seriously just not worth your hard earned cash.\n\n","May 5, 2015","false","2.5"," 27 of 82 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","27","82","3","0"

I do like chess and warhammer, so naturally this should play into my favor. There are deal breakers and other less area that need improvement.\n\nPositives: Nice environment. Battle chess redone, and can be fun. Graphics are good enough but wont blow you away by any means.\n\nCons:\n- Could not find one multiplayer game. This is a deal breaker. I dont know if this was just me, or maybe the game is too new. Either way its not fun by yourself\n- Added "attacks during each move" essentially detract from the game, inserting element of chance, which is exactly what chess is not. Additionally the moves are repeated, and I quickly found myself wanting to fast forward all the talk and show. This was during my first game!\n- Only one animation per kill, on particular unit vs particular unit!? Battle chess from 1990 did that. They could have expanded\n\nI quickly found myself playing classic mode with superimposed chess symbols over the pieces. So, basically you can play against a chess engine to get that experience.\n\nAny way, I wanted to like the game. There are too many flaws at this point to recommend but if your dying for modern battle chess, this might hold you over.","May 17, 2015","false","2.3"," 4 of 32 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","4","32","0","3"

As an avid Ork player I'm extremely displeased at the modified version for their chess game. I'm glad it's in alpha because they need to make Orks stronger. In the past 2 games I've destroyed their queen, in my first game I had multiple pawns, and 4 special units left against 2 space marine pawns, a rook, and a king. Think you could win that right? If you're an Ork playing against a CPU you're always going to lose because Orks are severely underpowered when it comes to initiative. I've lost almost all my special units not to movement, but through initiative phase. Where as an Ork I only kill most units through movement and not initiative. I know Orks have sh**ty aim, but this is rediculous. Orks will always miss their shots, Space Marines will always hit and win their shots. Also another bug - SQUID BOMB DOES NOT WORK - I used it, and literally nothing happened. This is a good game if it's Space Marine VS. Space Marines or Orks vs. Orks but they need to balance it for different armies to fight - I like this game, but can't recommend just quite yet.","May 10, 2015","false","5.2"," 6 of 37 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","6","37","0","5"

But gameplay is a bad joke.\nThere are to mode classic-chess and  regicide. Regicide mode is a mod where players have two phases at each turn. First one is normal chess.And second one is abbility: shooting,meele,special moves etc. The big problem with the regicide mode is that you are playing a game with no tactic. Its all about luck.

Let's see what it does right first:\nPROS:\n- Beautiful aesthetics. Seriously, this is a good looking game. The character models are well done, the animations are pretty damned good and the whole thing just looks great.\n- Takes Chess and adds a few features to it. Oh, and adds an awesome Warhammer 40,000 skin to it.\n- Allows you to play Marine vs Marine or Ork Vs Ork in addition to allowing you to fight against the opposite race.\n\nCONS:\n- The game is sluggish and slow. Seriously, most matches will take SEVERAL minutes. And that's because, while the animations DO look nice, they take for damn ever.\n- The game's combat system is just damned dreadful. I'm sorry, but it is. The things they added to the Chess mechanics are neat, but most of them are damned worthless. Grenades are weak, attacks feel powerless and, while I get that this is chess, you REALLY don't want to get your big and beefy Warboss or Chapter Master upclose and personal or else you'll lose.\n- The game looks great. It sounds terrible. The gun sounds are underwhelming, the explosions are very stock and run of the mill, the voice acting ranges from good to just god awful.\n- This game, in its current state, costs more than I really deserves to.\n\nThat's my review. Please remember though, this game IS in early access. It is subject to change.\nTotal score: 4/10 - Poor.","June 19, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 30 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","3","30","0","5"
