Cross Mario64 with the aesthetics of Zelda Wind Waker, would end up with something very close to resembling Poi. If more Early Access games were in this state, steam wouldn't have such a bad name.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W1APFjvFbU\nStarting off with a basic obstacle course to refine skills, immediately you should feel at home with the controls. All your favorite moves from Mario are here, walljumps, triplejumps, slidejumps, quickturn backflips, the works. Not only does it feel familiar but was very responsive as well. Didn't test keyboard and mouse as it's more a gamepad based game. After clearing the tutorial you progress into the main world, which currently consists of a 'hub' containing 2 full maps and an npc who sells unlockable mini challenges. All included global scoreboards for those adventurers seeking further glory. While Zelda had a boat, Poi has an airship and your character has a deployable parachute! Yes, you don't technically fly very far but effects are in place to make it feel both believable and magical.\n\nTechnically speaking, Poi should run a range of systems, supporting screen resolutions of 4k+ and toggles for godrays, depth-of-field and heat-haze, Controls were intuitive but unfortunately unable to be remapped. Probably the games biggest flaw at the moment is the lack of content, veterans could complete what it offers in under 2hrs. With that said for those 2hrs I had a smile from ear to ear, thanks to the devs for taking me back to my younger years in the best way possible. Look forward to seeing this wonderful game evolve further.

We already have great games like A Hat in Time, Yooka-Laylee, FreezeME, and more releasing soon, and this is the icing on the cake for me.\n\nI am also a speedrunner. I like to push games to their absolute limits, and see what I can do within the worlds they give me. Poi has some features for people like us, such as the in-game leaderboards and timer. These are very nice additions, and I am glad to see them incorporated within the game.\n\nThe movement feels a lot like Super Mario 64, and that's a very good thing. There are not too many cases where I lose a run due to weird movement, and that's good. The levels are also pretty good. They're a bit barren, but I assume that since it's in Early Access, that will change as the game evolves.\n\nI love this game. If you like speedrunning or collect-a-thons, I would strongly recommend purchasing this. I will update this review once the full game comes out.","November 12, 2015","true","33.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

It's got a lot of great mechanics from Mario 64 that you'll find familiar, such as the triple jump, but it also integrates in a lot of newer ideas.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ratsplat/recommended/401810/","Ratsplat","Ratsplat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ratsplat/","310 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPoi is a 3-D platformer that has you exploring various worlds looking for things to collect.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to collect medallions in each level. Instead of free roam, each level has you select a medallion to go for which can alter how the level is designed. An example is the Crystal Cavern level where the first medallion you collect will turn on the lights and power, which will cause all future medallions to be in a lit cavern with running machinery. Each level has six medallions to find, where four of them are in unique areas sometimes requiring you to solve a puzzle, while two others just require you to either collect 100 coins or 7 keys to make them appear. Each medallion will record how long it takes you to collect it, and this time can be used to compete with other players to see who can collect them the fastest.\n\nCollecting coins during levels lets you buy explorer tools and unlock challenge levels. Tools include a shovel that lets you collect fossils found in levels, and a compass that will show important objects in a level. Challenges are just short levels that have a unique set of obstacles and just requires you to reach the medallion at the end of the level. There are no coins or anything else in challenge levels, but competing with other players for the shortest time is what will bring you back to them.\n\nYour character is very simple, who can easily run and jump around. There isn’t anything special about walking and running, but jumping comes in a variety of styles. Your standard jump can be extended by double jumps, and jumping in succession after hitting the ground first will cause future jumps to go even higher. Wall jumping is also present, where you can jump back and forth between two walls that are fairly close to each other.\n\n\nShould You Play Poi?\nCasual(Easy): Quite possibly one of the easiest games that you can buy, it is an excellent choice if you don’t want much of a challenge. However, it may actually be too easy even if that is what you’re looking for.\n\nCasual(Quick Play Sessions): Your progress is always being saved and most medallions and challenge levels only take a few minutes to complete.\n\nHardcore: Even the hardest medallions and challenge levels require very little skill, so the only thing that hardcore gamers will like is speedrunning through levels to become number one on the highscores.\n\nChildren: Just the art style alone makes it clear that it is a game that children will enjoy. On top of that, the lack of difficulty also makes it a perfect game for younger ones to play.\n\nLongevity: Collecting most medallions and playing through the challenge levels will take you between 1-2 hours. Finding everything in each world can make the game last a few more hours, while speedrunning medallions and competing for high scores can make the game last even longer.\n\n\nState of the Game\nOptions: The settings menu is very simple; with basic volume sliders, graphical options, and camera sensitivity. While it does show controls you aren’t able to change them, but the game is simple enough that it isn’t a problem.\n\nOptimization: Poi has simple cartoony graphics and runs well on any modern computer. Loading into the hub and levels happens almost instantly so you never have to sit and wait to play.\n\nAudio: The level selection hub and levels all have their own unique music to listen to. There are characters in the game but there is no voice acting of any kind.\n\nOperation: You will be controlling your character in third person while you are exploring levels. The camera can be freely moved around as you explore and can also be zoomed in and out, but it will sometimes be controlled automatically in some areas and may cause the camera to be in a bad location. Jumping can be a little odd at times, especially when you are in areas with walls and slippery slopes. This is especially noticeable when you miss a platform or something and as long as you simply touch something, you regain the ability to do a double jump.\n\nCompletion: The mechanics of the game appear to be complete, which means it's just content that needs to be added. There will be additional explorer tools that can eventually be bought in the store, allowing for more things to be collected in the levels. New worlds and challenge levels will also come in future updates.\n\n\nPersonal Thoughts\nI grew up playing many of the collect-athon platformer series including Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Banjo-Kazooie, Jak and Daxter, and many others. You very rarely see games like them these days which is a shame. While there are still many platformers of all kinds being made, Poi is probably the only current one in 3-D that focuses on exploration and collecting objects. Unfortunately, there are big things keeping it from being as enjoyable as the classics.\n\nThe main thing is that it is simply too easy and simple. Most medallions only take a few minutes at most to reach, and the paths and "puzzles" needed to reach them barely require much thought. Being easy is one thing, but the game is riddled with tons of hints on top of that. There's even an item you can buy that will show you where most stuff is hidden, making exploration almost pointless. Combat is non-existant(which isn't a necessity) and you will almost never die in the game. Even if you do happen to die, checkpoints are located right before "hard" areas so you're right back at the spot.\n\nThe older games had tons of other mechanics besides jumping around and gathering items, which is pretty much the only thing to do in Poi. It's not that collecting items is boring, but having them do something or have meaning is very important. Collecting coins lets you unlock challenge levels and buy explorer tools, but you can buy everything very quickly and coins become pointless afterwards. It would be nice to see more of what was in platformers of the past.\n\nWhen I think about it, just a single level from a classic 3-D platformer, such as the Bob-omb Battlefield from Super Mario 64, had more depth and entertainment than the whole of what currently exists in Poi, and that is saying something. The first star that you go after requires you to climb a mountain and defeat a boss, all the while you are; exploring a battlefield that has a variety of enemies, cannons that shoot you into the sky, wing caps that let you fly, secret areas to find, rolling balls that need to be avoided on the climb up, and more. Yet in Poi, the first medallion just requires you to barely travel into the level and simply flip a switch, which causes platforms to move and you're already at the medallion.\n\n\nWhen to Buy Poi\nPrice: Poi currently costs 15 dollars on Steam, and is likely to increase as it nears completion. This is a lot of money for the amount of content currently available in Poi, and if you're looking for a game with some kind of difficulty or depth, then it definitely isn't worth your money.\n\nInvolvement: As there is very little story, there is no problem at all to get involved in the game while it is still being developed. It is very unlikely that your progress in the game will be reset, and if anything the time highscores on each level will be reset if big changes are ever made.\n\nConclusion: You should only consider buying Poi if you're looking for a simple platformer game and don't want much else.\n\n\nRead more reviews like this at http://www.ratsplat.com\n\nFollow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/","March 30","true","1.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Right now there are two fairly simple worlds, but the foundation is there for a solid game.  You can choose to play as a boy or a girl, and after a short tutorial level you take a ship into the sky.\n\nThe sky hub world reminiscent of Zelda: Skyward Sword with various floating islands.  World selection is done by rotating the ships wheel, which takes you to a select screen like Mario 64, though like Mario 64 you can find the medals out of order.  Medals are their version of stars, keys are their version of red coins, and there is a medal for collecting 100 coins in a world.  The only downside is, like Mario 64, the game pops you out of a world each time you collect a medal.  There are no changes between "acts" like the 3D Mario games, so there isn't a compelling reason for this.  Collectibles and objectives for medals reset, so if you prefer to explore at your leisure rather than following the objective the game sets for you, you may find yourself partway through earning multiple medals as you're exploring only to have to choose one and restart the others.  I would prefer it to be more like Banjo-Kazooie and leave you in the world to keep exploring.\n\nYou can also spend time exploring to fill up the journal with locations and fossils. Doing these things gets you experience to level up, which is the way this game opens up new worlds.  In the hub world you can use coins to purchase special abilities.  There are is also a cannon in the hub world that can take you to special linear challenge stages sort of like Super Mario Sunshine.\n\nThe moves are familiar, from triple jumps to wall jumps to double jumps.  It's not quite as tight as a Mario game, but it controls well.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone yearning for a return to the N64 platformers of old.  With time and more content, it promises to be something special.","December 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

To get medallions, you need to complete different types of objectives like obstacle platforming, or exploration.\nBy grabbing medallions, digging up fossils, or finding secret locations you gain xp and level up your character in order to gain access to the next level.\n\nThe gameplay borrows a lot of abilities from many old platformers such as double jump, timing your jump as soon as you land will give you a higher second jump, you can wall jump etc.\nThe controls feel very tight, which is very important for a game like this. Whenever you die, it's your fault.\n\nThere are a few "challenge" levels that you can play in addition to the main levels. Things like obstacle courses and timed challenges, they're actually very fun.\n\nMy main issue with the game was that after collecting a medallion, you're taken back to the hub world, and thus lose your progress on any other collectibles you had been collecting in the levels. I'd love the option to teleport to the hub or stay and continue clearing out the level if I'd like to.\n\nOverall, it's a great game!

The game is clearly still early access, some textures look weird here and there, some glictching and even annoying gameplay elements. However this hasn't crashed even once and there haven't been a single one gameplay ruining bug or glitch. So overall the game works surprisingly well on an older laptop, full controller support is nice and the graphical style is kind of okay. Can't really tell until developed further.\n\nThe stuff I don't like are that not all the things you collect aren't persistent. When you go back to a map you can collect the same coins again and again. The thing that made me play all the Spyros to the 100% (or to 120%) was that there was a ♥♥♥♥ load of stuff, but all that stuff could be collected leading to some of the most amazing adventures in gaming I've had. The second one is the speed of the character's movement and falling down. I'll use Ratchet & Clank as another example, the movement of the character is extremely smooth all over wich makes even the most intense moments feel good to handle. And the "jump after you hit the ground" seems just unnecessary, I would prefer a some kind of powerup for the higher jumps than just walking for a few meters up and down. Final thing I don't like is that when you complete a mission you have to leave the map. This gets very annoying when wanting to get a map to 100% before advancing (there are over 5 missions per map).\n\nI would love an answer from the developers regarding the stuff mentioned above, is there any major changes or improvements coming?\n\nOverall seems to be going in to a great direction and I had fun with it so I'll definitely recommend it, however at this moment I'd give it something like 6/10.","December 5, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","1"

I expected the levels to be a lot shorter, but it's much more fleshed out than I thought. This game is hopefully the beginning of the 3D platforming renaissance I've been looking forward to for so long. You'll be retreading territory several times in each level to get all the collectables, but it's done in a tasteful way with mutliple paths through the levels. The collectables don't overstay their welcome, while still having a good amount to collect. If anything, I think the purchasble item prices need a buff. The "overworld" is also fun to explore, even if you don't spend all that much time there. Controlls are intuitive and some moves that aren't explicity explained come naturally. The graphics may not work for some peoples' tastes, but I like it. The music and sound effects are also very nice.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that only a couple medallions can be collected while being able to coninue in the level. Some medallions (the 100 coin one in particular) can be picked up with the option to continue, but others force you to the overworld. I understand that this is to facilitate barriers, but if I can see three medallions in my current area (100 coin, keys, and objective), I'd like to pick up all of them in one go.\n\nPros\n+Level design\n+Music\n+Graphics\n+Controlls (finally a game that's not super floaty!)\n+Fun challenges beyond the core gameplay\n+Reasonable camera - I don't find myself fighting it like in so many other games\n\nCons\n-Multiple objectives in the same area can't all be collected at the same time\n-Some people may not like retreading old ground, though I'm completely fine with this implementation\n-Doesn't play nice with antivirus programs yet\n\nThis is still early access, so anything could change. As it is now, this game is worh every penny and then some. There's so few games in the vein of Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie on PC that this is a breath of fresh air. I haven't run into any enemies yet, but this game ticks all the other boxes so I'll live wihout the action part of an action-platformer. I've only written a few reviews, and I'm super in on this game. I'm looking forward to continued development. As heavy handed as my praise is, I'll revise this review if, for some reason, the devs go off the deep end and turn this into some crazy MOBA or something.","February 24","true","4.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Anyone who has ever loved a 3D platformer, especially Super Mario 64, needs to play this. It nails the joyful whimsy that made Nintendo ten years ago so special. The mechanics are great except a few minor issues like being set on fire just feels weird, especially since your character is silent the whole time, and the rope jumping doesn't feel nearly as good as Super Mario Sunshine. I hope someday it will, that's definitely a fixable problem. It looks wonderful, it runs wonderfully (2160p highest settings on a midrange system), the music is a perfect compliment to the game. Everything here is just sheer delight. And you can play as a female character which is a very appreciated choice.\n\nThe only thing that is really holding Poi back is how far it is from being content complete. It's about one tenth of a game with two worlds containing six objectives each and a bit of side content. One of the worlds is very complete, the other feels barren and I hope is not considered complete because it definitely doesn't live up to the first. There's less than two hours of content at the moment but it's fantastic content that you'd be hard pressed to play without grinning. Sure, all of it's basic cues are taken from other games, but they're fantastic games that have been missing from the scene for years and this is an incredibly welcome return of that style of play. Poi is lovely and you should buy it, at least if you're a fan of the style that it's going for.","December 23, 2015","true","3.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If you liked mario 64, banjo etc you should check this out. Beautiful level design, love the artstyle. There's collectables and areas to discover, and some sort of leveling-system. You can also buy items with the coins you collect in the levels.\n\nonly minor gripe I have about the controls is it's a bit hard to gauge if you're running or not, and that roll you do before running can make you fall off all sorts of things. If you played mario 64 you'll recognize a lot of the moves (Triple jump, wallkick, quickturn-somersault thing).\n\n\nFeels pretty solid for an early access alpha, if the developers keep at it this will turn out great.","November 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The levels are pretty well designed and fun to explore. The music is fun and always fits the levels, but after a while it gets repetitive. Poi has a lot of potential and im very excited for further updates. I put 2 and a half hours into it and perfected it, so in its current state there's not a lot of content.\n\nThat being said, the content that is in the game is very fun. The game is very heavily inspired by games such as Super Mario 64 and Spyro. All in all, its a great beautiful well designed game with bursting with potential and I hope with updates this game becomes even better. It gets a 8/10 from me.\n\nEDIT: The new update added LOTS of content. New characters, medals, locations etc. The content they added is challenging, but for the most part its fair.\nThere are still things I would change from the game, as an example: when you get a medal, you are forced to leave the level, this can be annoying if you want to get all the medals in a level, but it just gets annoying sometimes.","February 6","true","5.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm happy I did. This game brings back so much nostalgia from Nintendo 64 days and I can't seem to put it down. It reminds me a lot of Super Mario 64 and Zelda's Wind Waker.\n\nThe gameplay controls are pretty intuitive and I didn't have a problem figuring out how to move around. I did, however, feel like the keyboard controls were a bit tough when trying to jump wall to wall but that might be personal preference. Switching to a controller helped a lot.\n\nThe music is pretty and fits the levels, and you can actually jump off the boat and explore a bit. You can't explore TOO far but I'm thinking they are planning on expanding the map eventually. There's so much to do in each level, and similar to Super Mario 64, you go back each time to collect 1 goal.

The hub of the game sees you on a sky ship able to visit different worlds that contain a number of different medallions to collect. If you replace stars with medallions, red coins with keys and coins with… coins you pretty much know what to expect.\n\nCurrently in the early access build there are 2 different worlds to explore both of which have 6 medallions. Cozy Canyon is a forest mountain level and Mount Magma is a lava style volcano level. While there is currently nothing super original this is most definitely one of the best 3D platformers I have played in years. After completing the 2 worlds I was left desperate for more and cannot wait for the game to reach further in development.\n\nEarly in the game you also meet a passing ship that can transport you to challenge levels that really kick the difficulty up a notch. There are also other things to do such as dig for fossils and with other detours looking to be added soon there is a bright future.\n\nVisually the game looks like an early Dreamcast title but do not let this put you off. Steam is flooded with 2D retro platformers as the moment so to have a 3D one that captures the spirit of platformers from the N64 era so very well is an exciting prospect.\n\nIf you yearn for a N64 inspired 3D platformer the Poi is definitely an early access title worth keeping an eye on.\n\nCheck our video review here: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-examines/151108_game-tutor-examines-poi\n\nFor the Purpose of Disclosure the Steam Key was provided by the developer.

Currently the game is quite short and still in development but I can highly recommend the purchase as the foundation is solid and can only improve from here.\n\nThe format is similar to Super Mario games, enter a stage, collect the star, rinse and repeat. They do mix it up a bit but it’s only for collecting, your movement options are very grounded compared to some of Super Mario’s more recent titles. In saying that the movement flow well together and it is what makes the Poi experience that much better.\n\nIf you’re a fan of games like Super Mario, Banjo Kazooie, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot I can highly recommend this game. If you're on the fence I suggest you watch the gameplay above, it gives you a very good idea on what you can expect when purchasing Poi.","January 31","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

I figured, for $10 why not? The creators have put in a huge amount of work on their own to get it to this point and i'd be happy to help them on their way. I played the very initial Early Access version and it works really well. The controls are smooth, like really really smooth. Although the camera could have a bit less momentum. I didn't run into any glitches aside from some missing textures and camera collision which is expected at this early stage. The biggest problem I have right now is that the artstyle seems so bland. I feel like they could keep a lot of what they have now and just spruce it up a little bit, but it's so simple and basic that I can't say I'm that inspired.

I didn't come across any bugs in my playthrough as-well which is nice for an Early Access title.

The navigation in the hub world is amazing as-well.\n\nI am super excited to see what else they will bring to the game.\n\nI only have a few gripes with the game; those being that once you get a medal (which acts as experience to level up) you get ported back to the hubworld and have to replay the level again to go after the other collectibles - having the option to switch between them would be nice.

Thankfully there has been a resurgence in that genre among indie developers. I had been somewhat patiently following the development of games like Clive and Wrench, Freeze Me, A Hat In Time and others but none of them had a release date. I searched the Steam Store for 3D platformer, but couldn't find what I was looking for. Then I decided to search YouTube for Steam 3D Platformers and Poi was one of the first entries. I noticed that I missed the Kickstarter and that it hadn't reached it's funding and I was worried that meant I would never get to play it and it looked gorgeous. I decided to try my luck searching for it on Steam and found that it was available in Early Access. I bought it immediately.\n\nI've been burned by games before so I was cautiously optimistic as I was loading it up, but thankfully this game was everything I was hoping for. Not only is art style gorgeous, clean and bright, but the characters I've met in the games seem like they would be right at home in the best first party Nintendo games. Their animations and way of speaking appear to be heavily influenced by Zelda.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any enemies in the game, and yet I don't miss them. This game is a 3D platformer in its purest form. All of the thrill and the challenge comes from traversing the detailed environments which have several paths just like Super Mario 64. In fact, one of the first things I thought when I began to play the game was "I have been waiting for a game like this since Mario 64." As much as I love the Mario Galaxy games and the 3D Land/World games, none of them managed to recapture the feeling that I got when playing Mario 64. Poi has managed to recreate that feeling almost perfectly.\n\nI haven't completed the game, and it's early access so for all I know there is no end yet (I don't really know how early access works as this is the first time I've bought a game in early access) but I have faith that they will deliver one of the best 3D platforming experiences since the glory days of the N64.","December 29, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The Old Man's Airship, and the sky around it, acts as your "hub" - you use the giant compass onboard to aim at an island and then set course to travel to that level. Polykid has been regularly adding in new Levels since launching this on EA too.\n\nAlso of note, in the immediate airspace around the ship, there are a few floating points of interest; when this popped up on EA, there was just one guy with a cannon who could send you to challenge courses. Since then, the devs at Polykid have added Snowland, home to some delightful penguins, as well as a second explorer girl who will give you tips and pop up in levels for a game of hide n' seek.\n\nOnce on the ground, your explorer controls fast and precisely. You're able to do a Super Mario 64-style triple jump (NOT jumping three times in the air), a backflip jump, a roll, a rolling jump, wall- and triangle-jumps, etc. They control really well; it's very responsive and they transition between animations - like going from running to balancing on a beam, climbing on a ladder or grabbing a ledge - super quickly and smoothly. Like a great classic 3D Platformer, it's a joy just to move around in these levels with these characters. Beyond the platforming, you have a few gadgets that can be purchased from the Old Man, like a telescope or a shovel. They're nothing earth shattering, but they add a little bit more to the levels, and help drive home that sense that you're exploring these locales for items and points of interest.\n\nThe levels are large, wide and totally open - this is not modern-style super linear "3D Platforming" like Mario 3D World or Ratchet & Clank. No Point A to Point B, follow the path, "nothing to see over here"-nonsense. Go wherever you want, explore! You don't even have fall damage, because that would just get in the way. Find medallions even if they're not for the mission you've selected! Hit switches you find to open up a new portion of the level! There's a lot of verticality to the levels, for lots of climbing opportunities. There are also stage hazards like moving platforms, bounce ropes, climbing walls, etc. The way everything's laid out, it's all just very engaging to traverse.\n\nWhen the game launched, there were no enemies, so it was purely just a platforming challenge (barring the occasional rolling boulders or electrified gears-on-ropes). Since then though, the devs have started populating the levels with simple little baddies and NPC's, so levels are even better now. They're starting to feel less barren and more of full of life in general. The enemies are extremely simple to take out - without any combat moves, you just jump on their head - but they add to the experience all the same.\n\n--\nThe whole game feels great, is super charming & whimsical, and is just plain fun - everything a great 3D Platformer should be! It may not have the looks of something like Yooka Laylee, but it definitely deserves your attention if you're a fan of the genre, especially for this price. If you're worried about it feeling incomplete or not ever getting finished due to it's status in Early Access, I wouldn't worry about it - there's plenty here already to entertain for hours, and as I've said before, Polykid has been updating this pretty regularly. There's a sense of progression in place already and it's clear there's an endgoal in sight (literally; one of the updates has introduced a mysterious island with 4 locked doors that we'll eventually gain access to through a future update).\n\nPick this up; it's an absolute joy to play that you're guaranteed to have fun with!","May 30","true","4.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While I feel certain area's are traversed, let alone finished far too quickly, there is a good sense of flow for each area to travel to. I do have a minor complaint with the feel of jumping, especially concerning interacting with other surfaces, as it feels so sudden and with so much weight, it almost goes against the light jump before it. Complaints aside, I would recommend Poi even in it's early access state.

Remember when platforms like Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie became popular, and how every company tried to capture a piece of that market? Ty the Tasmanian Tiger and Vexx. Remember licensed platformers after popular TV shows?\n\nDo you remember their clunky, floaty controls that glitched out and got stuck in the wall?\n\nWhat about the camera that you could never get to point where you want, and clipped through the world half the time?\n\nOr how their haphazard "cartoony" art style made it difficult to platform because the flat shading made it hard to perceive depth?\n\nWhat about when they tried to turn on fancy realistic shadow, but then you couldn't tell where you would land, so they just made your character have both a realistic shadow, and a dot shadow under you?\n\nHow about when they just copied another game's levels directly, because they didn't have any ideas of their own? Except it somehow looks worse than the original, despite the near-15-year difference between them. No? Because none of those old games did that, and yet Poi did.\n\nPoi brought me back to the golden age of platformers, by reminded me that these existed, and that they were not good games.

The overall feel of the game is not unlike that of Super Mario 64 however this game controls significantly more smoothly. On the subject of Mario 64, the jumping mechanics come mostly from that game, but with the added double jump for an extra layer of precision added to your platforming. The worlds are all fun to explore, and, to add a little icing to this cake, the game rewards said exploration with its experience system used to progress the game. Your goal in the game is to become a master explorer by leveling up your character by exploring levels, finding collectables, and completing miniature challenge levels. The main collectable of the game being Explorer Medals, which there are six of per level and worth 100 EXP apiece. Getting these explorer medals is done by completing missions within the levels, but, on top of these, there are also hidden fossils that you can dig up for 50 EXP apiece, treasure chests with many coins hidden within little secret caves in the levels, and several points of interest to be found within each level that are worth 25 EXP for finding them. EXP is, of course, used to increase your explorer level, and, as your level increases, your mentor will allow you to enter more dangerous levels within the game. Unlike most platformers, your common coin collectable actually serves a purpose beyond collecting them for the sake of collecting them as they allow you to purchase explorer tools and can be spent to unlock miniature one-off challenge levels such as going down a huge slide where you need to collect seven keys or reach the explorer medal at the end of a series of falling platforms. As for problems I currently see, I hope future levels have more hazards within them. With the exception of the fourth level, Crystal Caverns, I didn't really find the main levels to be too threatening. On top of this, I feel as though the main character will ready a wall jump no matter what angle you jump towards a wall at which prompts some saves from falling that, really, should NOT have happened (Particularly when following up this wall jump with the aforementioned double jump). Another thing, while this isn't necessarily a complaint, is that I hope that the explorer tools can be more incorporated into the levels more. Among the three explorer tools currently within the game, I only found myself using the shovel with any form of frequency. Overall, this game shows a great deal of promise as a return to 3d platformers of old, and I looked forward to future versions of this game. As this early access version stands, I'd give it an 8/10\n\nPros:\nFun, explorable levels\nEXP system promotes not just collecting the medals, but also finding secrets, and rewards exploration\nMini challenge levels are all enjoyable\nCoins have a purpose beyond a collectable for the sake of a collectable\nControls like a dream for the most part\n\nCons:\nLack of difficulty\nTools could be more incorporated into the levels\nWall jump feels broken","March 6","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was growing quite tired of all the sidescrolling "retro" games. There's plenty of good titles in that variety, but I feel like the market is getting oversatuated with those. I've been itching for a game that's more remniscient of Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie, and that is the direction Poi is taking. The objectives, for the most part, focus more on platforming than exploring....very welcome in my book. I hope that we see more enemies/hazards in the future, however. It's a bit on the easy side and feels a bit empty with no monsters walking around in the environments to challenge me.
