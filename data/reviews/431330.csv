So close to being a real gem here.  They need to really polish it up.  The graphics look great, the animations are fantastic, and the concept is amazing.  Everything seems to work, it does have random dungeons, and they are all very unique.  The inventory system works well, the stat levelling up appears to be functional, and thank F$^%K you don't run out of arrows with the bow.  Also, the music is great.\n\nThe game's issues are ones which can be fixed.  They can adjust the movement speeds of the bats to be a little bit more reasonable, make the bosses run slower, make the zombies run faster, etc.  Fix the typos.  It's HIGHLIGHTED, not Highlited, and you even put "reccomended" and "completeing" in the store page description -- let's use spell check when trying to sell something!  Oh I found another one, you wrote "expreince" instead of "experience" on one of your signs in the front area but it was written correctly a few words previously.  Go take every word of dialog in this game and triple check them.\n\nBut the main issue is the melee weaponry.  Developer: go play Zelda: A Link To The Past.  Notice how far the sword swings, how quickly, and how smooth it is.  You would never swing a sword in that game and have time to turn around mid-swing, but more often than not I don't have time to finish a swing in Dungeons Are Random.  It's like the swords are wet pool noodles.  It's basically unplayable like this.  You have bats that can run at almost the same speed as you and you have to stop, turn around, swing your sword and just hope it hits.  Thankfully you can run around and run away before the weapon strikes.  It's actually one of the weirdest things I've seen.  The bow and arrow is perfect, however.  Does just as much damage, infinite ammo, and can reach them from far away.  I was not able to figure out how to use spells, the signs were not immediately clear.\n\nYou require a login and password, set up externally through your website to track high scores.  Why?  Steam leaderboards would be the professional way of doing things, and it sounds like the way you are doing is harder to achieve.\n\nWhen you level up and are assigning your strength, agility, and whatnot...  It isn't clear what does what.  Only later I realized that I had to memorize the sign at the front.  Why not display a hint when you are levelling up?  Also, you start off with 1 point in each stat.  When you level up, you get an additional 10 points.  I put all 10 in strength to have a total of 11 there..  But it didn't seem to make any difference?\n\nMinor complaint, when reading the controls, you have to read the sentence several times to understand it.  "When using a controller A, RB, X, B and Select buttons are for attacking, blocking, using item, pickup and opening inventory."  Maybe you might want to make that more clear.  Just show a picture of a controller and point to the buttons or something.\n\nAnd lastly I will add that the block system is entirely broken.  You seem to state that while holding a shield it will reduce the damage taken by a set amount.  Well, if you are not holding a shield, you block 100% damage.  With a shield it is the same thing.  So you can just stand there and have 3-4 enemies attacking you for 20 minutes straight and you will not be hurt.  That's when I turned the game off.  Go finish your game!  It needs a lot of work, but I am very impressed at what I see so far.","January 5","false","0.6"," 91 of 111 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","91","111","13","1"

"YOU DIED" will appear on your screen more than you're willing to admit. Doesn't matter how much you try, how skilled you consider yourself to be, you'll die a lot. The main reason for most of your deaths will probably be buggy controls and even worse enemies. Simply said, this game doesn't feel right at all. Nor finished.\n\n======OVERVIEW======\n\nYeah, dungeons are random. Completely. It'd be a good feature, if it just wasn't so terribly executed. Visuals aren't that bad, sure, but controls? Awful. They don't make sense either (F for inventory, CTRL for attack, like.. why?). However, it has a nice idea. UI is kinda bad, sure (specifically the "HP" and "mana" candles). But honestly, game has a nice variety of enemies. If only they weren't so buggy. It kinda goes hand in hand with controls though so I guess if they fix this problem, they'll have easier time with fixing enemies. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem like developers care about Dungeons Are Random that much. Last update, which fixed just few of the worst bugs, was in January. Which makes me sad because this game could be a nice little gem.\n\nPROS- variety of enemies\n- decent level designs\n\nCONS- gameplay/controls\n- visuals/UI\n- soundtrack\n- lot of bugs (hitboxes, etc.)\n- missing achievements/trading cards\n- devs seem not to care about this game anymore\n- price tag\n\n======RATING======\nLet me start by saying that the price is too damn high for this experience you get. Props to guys who managed to actually play this game for more than 20 minutes, it's just too self-tormenting. There's so much work on this game yet it doesn't really seem we'll ever get to the point where this game will be playable.\n\nFor recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","March 1","false","0.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Would have stuck with this if it was in Early Access. I love the genre of RPG Roguelikes, as this type of game happens to be my favorite. I've never found myself having to figure out button mappings and being one hit killed at full health on so many different occasions. I read the sign and it didn't say anything about "Y" on the controller being the interact button for Enchanters. I was looking forward to playing this game and have been checking the store for it everyday up until it came out to see if the Dev said anything. It's just simply not finished and I wish there was any sort of mention as to whether or not there will be any further updates anywhere on the store page because I can't seem to find one. I understand one hit kills and everything after having played games like Spelunky and Nuclear Throne and games of the like, but this is absurdly unplayable. I'll keep checking back in on it to see how it does because I really wanted to have another game to constantly do runs and level characters in. It's not the time waster that I was hoping for. All negatives aside, the game is charming in its artstyle and could be really fun with a little more polish.\n\nEDIT: Good on the dev for adding the interaction button to the list of commands so soon after this review was written.","January 5","false","0.3"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","0"

I will go through the game in as much detail for the sake of you the buyer and the developer so that in the future he can hopefully make updates to take this game and make the overal reviews to positive, and the buyer can see if they buy this now or wait till later. Let's begin.\n\nWhen you enter for the first time you might need to familaiaize yourself with the controls and stuff. All pretty self-explanatory, although a controller would probably be heavily recommended as the keyboard controls feel a little uncomfortable sometimes. Anyways controls aside let's talk about the gameplay, the gameplay itself isn't exactly the best. When weilding a handed weapon it takes way too long for the weapon to make contact with the enemie to kill it. The attack should be almost instant, with a small animation for the attack. The bow and arrow is the only real weapon that you will be able to use in order to survive this game for the time being. As for the enemies there is small variation in them and they are just basically follow you or go off in a random direction until they see you and then they follow you. It seems that sometimes you do get stuck, as in the enemies just keep hitting you if your stuck in the corner and you're just instantly dead because of this. Maybe add a small damage boost so that you can get out of these situations. In the way that the randomly generated dungeons are isn't very varied that much for the diffrent types of rooms.\n\nYou the buyer can decide from this if you want to buy it or not, but for the time being I wouldn't recommened buying it until some of these features have been finished.\n\nThat's all I have to say about this game for now. Please developer look at these reviews and do once massive update for your game so that we can improve it and hopefully pull the reviews up out of negative :)\n\nThat's all for now! Will do a new review or adapt the review when there is a new update for this game. (depending if the next update is a big update or small fixes)","February 11","false","0.1"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","14","26","3","0"

If you would like to go full melee then prepare to die a lot. If you would like to play ranged and happen to get a lucky drop of magic missile rune then you're home.\n\nReally, having a magic missile rune and increasing spell power and MP makes this game easier a lot.\n\nIt's not overly complicated, graphics are as good as you can see on the screenshots in store page of this game. But it's fun, at least to me.\n\nControlls seems very crappy and random at first, but when I plugged the controller and figured out what's what then I feel like the controlls (at least when using a controller) are fairly good.\n\nIn conclusion - if you like dark mood, random drops, seemingly endless dungeons and an arcade approach to gameplay then go and try this game, especially when the price goes down at sales.\n\nThumbs up from me!\n\nP.S. This game is better played when using a controller.\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 17","true","1.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Also, enemies don't hit you by touching, they rather all have an attack animation which must clip with your character to hurt you.\n\nThere are a few issues with the inventory system and the enemy AI gets stuck from time to time, but for a low budget title from a new developer, it is a lot of fun, especially when you got friends to compare score with!\n\nOver all, this game might be a bit behind of what it could have been, and you see potential in every corner, but I believe it's worth to pick up for the price to support the developer, this might be his first Steam entry, but it shows that there might be coming better games by him in the future!","March 7","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The bad stuff is probably the control. I could not do much with melee weapons while I was able to make my way with a simple bow.  Hence if you don't get a bow at the start, you sort of good for a quick death.\n\nFrom what it seems this game seems to be a single person project.  I could say kudos on that but with many games of the same genre  available with better playability and implemented ideas in the same Steam price range, Dungeons Are Random lacks of the little extra notch, polishing  and a serious dose of playtesting that will make it a great or at least good game and not looking like some game prototypes or school projects.\n\nFor a low price or in a bundle, this is a good game to get when you have to kill 10-15 min in a rogue game. For the current asked price, this is way too much to pay for the fun the game creates.\n\n\n","April 22","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
