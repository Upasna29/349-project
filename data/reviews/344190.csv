Especially for it being free. Dont let the tutorial fool you. You dont just right click enemies 5 times per turn. Those are level 1 characters with 1 ability and no mana/mana regen.\n\nGauntlet mode is insanely fun. 4 player Co-op survival against waves of enemies.\n\nI played this game SOOOOO much on kongregate back when I was like 16.\nThis is a REALLY REALLY good turn based strategy game. Its kind of simple at first, but the levels later on will have you trying multiple times to beat them because they can get hard. And not artificial difficulty. I mean you actually have out play the enemy. Despite alot of the classes being unlocked, you CAN earn the ingame currency to unlock them through challenges in missions and achievements. Or you can be like me and sell items from other games to not actually pay money out of pocket to unlock stuff anyways. On my Kongregate account I'd already bought 2 extra character slots and had about 250 Radiance left over. I dont think there were achievements before, and it reset the campaign progress for me, so I can just earn that Radiance over again and keep my old stuff B)\n\nThe story seems to have been updated and the UI may have seen some work, but the UI is still a little bit weak and all of the menus are a bit much to take in all at once, but it's still being updated after all these years so that's a major plus. Enemies I'd never seen before have been added to geh game, as well as some new story stuff I dont remember probably got added, though that's just because its been so long since I'd played this. There is a handfull of bugs and performance issues that I dont remember having when I played it in my browser, but this could just be the steam release having problems. The devs have patched a few things and I assume the other issues I've seen will get patched, but they dont cause the game to not work for me or anything. Just some FPS drops.\n\nI always really like games where you can build your character in different ways. I have a Valkyrie that is built for tanking even though it's 'supposed' to be a dps class. I have a Priestess that can burst/buff rather than being a boring healbot. And I apparnetly bought a Paladin for something before I stopped playing before. But he was level one and I dont really know what I wanted to do with him. But I always enjoy games where you arent restricted to make your character 'heal bot' 'tank machine' and 'killy mc die in one hit' because thats what they're 'supposed' to be. Freedom to build your character however you want is a major plus from me.\n\nI'm currently not constantly playing this because I'm waiting for my account to be transfered to my steam account. That and Warhammer + KF2 just updated and all my friends are sucking me into that. But believe me, I probably have ~100 hours in the game from like 2011. This is a fun game if you like any of the tags: Turn based / RPG / Party based / Strategy, you'll enjoy this game if you play past the tutorial.","December 3, 2015","true","7.5"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","41","50","5","0"

In Immortal Empire you play as an immortal or party of immortals and fight your way through the campaign alone or with co-op. So far the story seems to be primarily about riding the world of this corruption that its found itself in, as of me writing this review I have not progressed very far in the story.  The immortals themselves are your playable heroes who respawn after death, there is a pretty decent variety of immortals to chose from, the majority falling under standard RPG class system, dps assassins, melee tanks, healers, supports and even a few immortals who have hybrid skill sets.\n\nThe combat is turnbased and functions around a unique resource called time, not only does movement and attack run off of this resource, so do most ability cool downs, so when running a large party its always good to have an idea what order you should use your skills in. When it comes to game modes, aside from the campaign, there is gauntlet mode, from what I can tell you try to survive with a group of co-op players against waves of enemies for increasingly valuable rewards. I have not played much gauntlet as of this review.  Immortal Empire also has PvP or some sort, but I have not seen or tried PvP at this time.\n\n\nOverall I feel like Immortal Empire balances RPG gameplay and strategy in a way that makes it a fun co-op game, and would recommend it to people looking for a combination of co-op, strategy and RPG in some way, shape or form.","December 6, 2015","true","3.1"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Perfectly playable without spending money but like all FTP it's a question of how long you can resist the temptation to splurge.\nThere are a couple of opening tips that the game doesn't make clear and you will want to take note of:\nEach time YOU level up you can only level a single skill/attribute/feature of a single character. This means you will be most useful if you only ever have one character. Your first character's name will also be YOUR name as far as your community presence goes. The first thing you should do when you start this game is hit the "?" and read the help notes. Or you will want to start over from scratch very quickly. Many players prefer to play with a single character as this provides the fastest way to create a powerful presence for gauntlet games. I have revised my opinion on this because making a party for your first account is more fun, familiarises you with hero types, and you lose nothing by it because you can still create "solo" accounts later and use your party account for farming. "radience" the in game currency is effected across all accounts linked to your steam acct and items can be passed down through other players. Given that it's "free" it's certainly well worth a look. But be prepared for some grind.\n((edited)) 11/12/2015","December 7, 2015","true","109.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","5"

Provides lots of fun! It has great potential. At the moment of the review there were not much of game content yet for a MMO. I really hope that this game gets futher development!\nPros:\n+ Many characters: some you can play from the beginning, some you will unlock by playing the game\n+ The "VIP" in-game currency is easily earned by playing the game, so you can farm it to unlock a new character, like, each day!\n+ Arena "gauntlet" system is really fun - facing waves of monsters with friends, and at higher levels a simple mistake may get the whole team killed!\n+ Nice plot\n+ No restrictions on player inteaction: free trade, free partying etc - play with friends or random people as much as you want!\n+ Your character is as powerful as you design him - how good you are at the game depends on your build, skills and choices - and not on random.\n\nCons:\n- Game is quite short, and mostly you end up farming gauntlet arenas, which become repetetive, as they are not randomized.\n- Again, lack of content: all items look the same with some little exceptions, monsters and player characters have all the same spells and skills. Hopefully it gets repaired with futher development.\n- It might be tricky to learn to play for new players: most likely you will have to start over after first attempt of playing, considering your past mistakes. Not sure if this is a con though.\n- Lack of players: there are probably not more than 100 players online at peak moments. This game deserves more attention, however, it should be filled with more content to get it.\n\nFor anyone who like RPGs and tactical games - this one will surely grab your attention for at least a week. It is worth time playing and getting more support and development!","January 8","true","27.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

You may get some extra from challenges (5 per) but these are doable only once per map unless you repeatedly create/delete character over and over.\n\nThe dev reply to this is that you also get 1 radiance per kill (my experience is that it's more like every 2 kills) but this is a misdirection play as it is valid only when the mob is within 5 levels of your hero level (total levels of all your chars in your party). You can't choose to not levelup your hero level (even when you choose not to levelup the individual immortals) - i.e. you'll quickly outlevel everything you fight just by playing normally and end up getting no radiance, more so if you play it typically and add in extra immortals in your party.\n\nAdd in other radiance sinks like runes/enchants/gear/respec (and even deleting a char from your party costs like 15 per level! ) etc.. and you'll quickly realise it's your typical cashgrab p2w game from a former flash/java applet game.","December 21, 2015","false","4.8"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","1"

All microtransactions can be done in reasonable time with in-game currency. (killing about 1500 monsters is a new character, you can kill several characters in one turn especially with the Assassin type heroes of which two are available for free and there is a total of 8 characters to be bought).\n\nOf course you can just solo through the game if that's what you prefer. The leveling system makes that possible. Whenever you level up, you choose which party members gain experience. So you can supercharge one character or distribute it on one group. Keep in mind that level difference is not as severe as in most games so 5 level 2 characters could beat 1 level 10 character.","December 4, 2015","true","8.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

As an example, already on area 7 there is a boss that can't be beat with 3 characters at avg level 5... even if managing to change the character tanking damage from boss. After the fight, it still has 30% health and requires leveling grind to overcome.\n\nSome normal encounters can be a bit unbalanced. Imagine controlling 3 characters with each having their own movement speed, then initiating a fight on one of them - the monsters attack that one character closest to them and sometimes there are too many, getting you low really quickly and making that one hero useless. This kind of aggression from the enemy can be frustrating on missions with a bonus objective to protect NPCs - but made easier by overleveling (grinding) your character levels.\n\nThe f2p model seems fair, but if you want to make a specific hero loadout, you have to wait and grind before you have enough radiance to unlock the heroes you want. Personally I went for a paladin, druid and dryad - but took the offensive and passive stat build instead of supportive.","December 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","17","26","2","2"

Back then I just took whatever I wanted into each game. Now I can look back and say holy hell, this is such a great game.\n\nThe combat is a turn-based tactics-style strategy with some rpg elements thrown in. While there is a 'cash shop' (by what I remember) as you progress you can get more 'radiance' (the secondary currency for buying more characters) by simply completing levels and by daily quests. With enough time you can get pretty far.\n\nThe web-based version didn't have voice acting, and while the steam version does, I think it was still well done though not the greatest in the world. The story was great back then and I hope it added more over the years (I'll update this post once I get a few hours in :P)\n\nThe animation is something I really liked about this game, at least during the combat. They are clear and readable skills and spells, even the passive buffs are easily read with distinct colors. Each summon has their own sets of skills, and while two or more can heal there is specialists-- the priest being the main healer, the tree-ent the best tank as far as I remember it, and the druid doing the best sustained field-control with her summons and rocks that stun things for at least a turn. I didn't get a mage type summon until later on, but the nukers were there.\n\nAll in all one of my favorite games of all time that ever came from the internet-- well done Tactics Studio. :)","May 18","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I've played 1.6 hours at the time of writing this.\n\nThis game has very beautiful art, the people and settings look so good. That is, when you're not actually playing the game. The cutscenes are gorgeous, whereas the game itself is a bit of a let down in the graphics department. It makes the game look much older than it needs to be.\n\nStorywise, it seems very intriguing, as you play as an "Immortal" a being that cannot die. In this game, you are not the caster of such creatures, instead you are the creature, which put an interesting spin on an old fashioned gametype. Other than that, the game is turned based, and multiplayer so its good.\n\nBUT THE BEST PART IS... ITS FREE! Well, at least most of it is... There are certain creatures that are only obtainable from irl money, but most of them can be purchased with this weird sun currency thing (which is earned in game).","December 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Before the details: the game feels very cheap overall, in all aspects.\nA little bit cartoon style, or 'simple' style - or 'lazy' style? Whatever. There is 1 texture for every ground tile, 2 images for trees, 4 images for heroes (1 for each direction, because game utilizes square tiles), 1 image for item type (e.g. all 'gloves' are just recolors of 1 picture), 3 animations for each hero (walk, attack, death (cast is the same animation as attack)), maps are filled with exactly same objects, etc - you got the 'lazy' point. Plus all the art in game is done in very simplistic style (it was supposed to be 'cozy retro' style I guess).\nSimplicity doesn't end here though. Each hero has 6 normal abilities and 2 ultimates - like in MOBAs, but more simple: like 'Fireball - deal 300 dmg to enemy', 'Meteor - deal 200 dmg in area', 'Heal - heal all allies in area for 300 hp', and that's it - they are all like that. Note: this is not MOBA, this is RPG. No skill trees or anything. All abilities cost mana and time - the resource you get every turn. When there is no enemy you regenerate rapidly, but still walk in turns - and when there is 'no time' to walk somewhere this turn, game displays this annoying message and doesn't 'catch' your click (pretty clutchy). There is also no arrow or anything indicating what and how my hero will do after I click, and you can only wonder how far and where you can go with your 'time' - and they sometimes walk in very strange pathes.\nThere are 13 immortals atm, and all but 4 are locked at start. You can buy them with premium currency Radiance, which is bought with money or grinded hard. That's not a big problem though, they are so typical I had no courage to try them (keep in mind abilities above) - Druid, Fire Mage, Paladin, Cleric, Dryad, etc. You can pack your party with up to 5 immortals per.. uhmm.. party. You can not replace heroes but can start a new party and level up it from zero. Party has shared level and shared loot across its heroes, each level you choose whos ability or stats to level up.\nInterface (except for being visually simple) isn't designed well, and is extremely poorly tutorialized. I spent a minute both trying to enter needed mission and trying to leave a mission. Level ups are unintuitive too, I wasted couple points not knowing that this yellow frame means "choose one each level: either stat or ability", because game never said that, and you can't respend points unless whole reset with premium currency.\nStats are just usual RPG stats, I won't even describe them. Damage system is physical = armor, magic = spell shield. Items are random generated like "+2 x-stat, +3 y-stat" but there's one thing.. they don't even have names! YES, just '[Rarity] [Type]' e.g. 'Divine Gloves' x3, devs seriously..? Year 2015..? And obviously (this should go without noticing in lazy-made games) items don't change immortals' appearance.\nThere is also 'complicated' element of enchanting items with gems (yellow gem - lvl 1 power, red gem - lvl 2 power etc, combine 3 yellow gems and get 1 red gem - something like that) and something similar to runewords in Diablo II - combine some letter-glyphs and get enchantment. Okay at least something to push game above 'primitive' level.\nCampaign really has 'fully voiced characters', devs didn't lie. But after things like 'stone giant is terrorizing nearby village, you gotta help', and 'ok now go kill another 3 stone giants in next level', I have absolutely no courage to go through it. Between missions there are dialogues (with 3 facial animations) and I once got +1 stat for 'right' answer.. sigh. 'Dialog choices matter'.\nI can not say myself, but from what other people are saying the game is grindy as hell. Repeatedly do same quest over and over to get gold and loot and complete daily.\nThere is also pvp and coop which I couldn't try for obvious reasons.\nGrind battles at low levels don't capture player's attention at all - click your simple ability, then right click this dude 10 times, pass the turn, watch how he hits you with fist 10 times (1 animation), right click this dude 10 times again, pass the turn etc. At least they allowed us to select all immortals and rightclick altogezer :D. I want to remind for dear developers: if the game doesn't capture attention in first 30 minutes people usually uninstall (and I 'survived' for an hour, though usually I go much longer even in bad games).\nClass: II - Crap\nVerdict: No\nReviewed: 1.10.2016\nApproach: Steam - PC\nTime: An Hour\nDeeds:\n1 Achievement","January 10","false","14.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","1"

I'm surprised that I came across this game.\nI have pinned Immortal Empire in a wishlist long time ago because how it catched my eye.\nAnd I have totally forgotten about it, since the Release Date: 3 December, 2015.\n\nStory is well done, I'm impessed how this game has voice actors for every storyline character and even heroes!\nStory part is +++.\n\nGraphically the game looks very old and unattractive, reminds all the games from 2000's Oldschool games. For someone that is Nostalgia!\nGraphics part is +.\n\nLack of characters... you start with 5 characters: Strong independent Valkyrie, Hunter Type Man, Druid Huntress, Priest and a Paladin. Other 10 characters+ can be bought fast with supporting the game with donate currency but that isn't a problem for each quest/challenge you earn the donate currency to later buy everything you want. The way that every immortal(so called every hero) has 6 skills and 2 ultimate abilties is AWESOME !!!\nCharacters part is ++.\n\nDesign is common, typical RPG game, trees, waters, might and magic etc. Gives the game that feel of oldschoolness.\nDesign part is +.\n\nDifficulty I like how hard this game is when it comes to first boss, I saw other reviews pointing out that they are physically unable to beat it, I somehow beat in by leading the boss into the respawn crystal and just figure it out then, luckily the second boss manticore was not that hard at all. Game really punishes you if you make mistakes skilling wrong skills or having underleveled characters, monsters will always beat the weakest one no matter what unless the characters are out of the attack range. You also lose gold per each character death, so be careful with your weakling and try to give them the most items/equipment you can get to keep them same lvl.\nDifficulty part is ++.\n\nContinue in comments.\n\n","March 27","true","25.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

I'm a big fan, of RPGs and I don't mind slow-paced games, so with the inevitable countless downvotes of *a* negative review, I'd like some feedback at the very least. I'd also like to point out that I don't necessarily hate the game, especially since it seems like it's a fully functional game but is still being tweaked and updated.\n\nFirst off, the combat/gameplay, the most important part. It's a basic RPG with action points required for movement, basic attacks, and skills/spells. Simple, so there's not a lot to explain but of course it's a bit too simple as from what I saw and experienced out of the basic free characters, a lot of the stuff is either useless in most cases (such as buffs, and I will explain why in a bit) or situational but will never be drastically required ( demobilitization, for example, and I'll explain that in a bit too ). A lot of the skills/spells are simply a hindrance at lower levels (you have to level up skills and there's naturally a level requirement for each "stage" of a skill) and simply isn't worth it unless it is, well, worth it. The Valkyrie's dagger ability, for example, is pathetically weak and honestly not worth getting EVER. Now, the gameplay works using time units aka action points, which means stuff like demobilitization(stun, slow, etc.) naturally will remove action points upon the afflicted's turn, and not simply stop them from playing that turn. Why is this an issue, as I am trying to imply? Well, let's talk about how enemies act in this game. First off, groups. Always a group. This means if you pull a single enemy(let's assume you only see this one enemy), the whole group will follow. That's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, especially if you can't SEE the rest of the enemies and considering the restriction of action points, you'll either end your turn in a situation where you'll get attack first or you'll try to run away and, chances are, you'll get attack first because - Oh, wait, I didn't mention this, did I? Enemies have drastically more AP than you, for example the spiders you encounter in the desert, area #2. Beautiful. If you're following my line of thinking, this means they attack more than you. Now, here's the obscure part that is overlooked in RPGs and the AI that controls the enemies - They will go for a SINGLE enemy and gang up on that single enemy until you either pull their attention (assuming there is such a skill or spell, I'm not entirely sure) or you kill them which is, well, unlikely since even the spiders are pretty beefy in this game. So, imagine this. You pull a group. A bunch of spiders rush to your party and... The first person attacked loses approx 50-75% of their health on the first turn. How do you feel? Well, not happy of course. It's something that ruined Neverwinter nights for me, as well as Baldur's Gate where the enemies would goose-chase your party members regardless of who it is. It's the lack of taunt-like skills but it's mixed in with a disgustingly high DPS caused by 5-ish enemies attacking a single party member, and that really stacks up. Now for the left overs. You lose gold everytime a party member dies, albeit the gold is, AFAIK, only used for buying equipment in the shop. They also never die permanently but they respawn after a few turns (it varies, it seems, as I've had 1 turn AND 2 turns for the same person on the same map, indefinitely) but they respawn at "spires" aka beginning of the map/spawn area, which will almost always be a far distance away unless you are getting destroyed on your first fight on a map, which is very plausible. Now, something I REALLY want to talk about is the bosses. The bosses are *absolute grindfests*. It's like making a mining simulator and it takes like 30 minutes to mine one rock. A boss that is specific to mention is the Wyrm(or whatever it is, but it's model is the 3-headed snake, previously seen to be used for a Wyrm enemy) which not only has a good 1500-ish HP on normal, but also has life-steal (was healing about 200 per turn for me). There's other bosses like this, like a manticore that you have to fight that is in the area after Beefy the SnakeEater aka BeefWyrm, that has about double the HP and somehow feels like it is the *exact same thing* except he's able to buff himself to take less damage and attack faster. REALLY has to be nerfed or at the very least, changed. That being said, HP, AP, and DMG definitely has to be adjusted to not feel like dark souls level of difficulty, especially on normal, which is the lowest difficulty. Also, the game is REALLY grindy.\n\nHow levelling works in this game is that your "summoner" or "main immortal" levels up and you distribute skill points among skill between your immortals, 1 per level, meaning your immortals don't get individual points.\n\nThe story is, sadly, pretty interesting. Basically, you start off in the game as a an "immortal", one that has been tied to someone else's being, perhaps soul. If they die, you lose your immortality. Interesting idea. Sadly, the dialogue feature(talking to people, making choices that give you misc. bonuses and apparently there is some romance in the game, of both genders too!) happens only when you beat a mission, so it's infrequent considering how long it takes to beat each map, generally speaking, about 20 minutes, depending on your pacing.\n\nSo, I mentioned that there are free characters earlier. The 5 free characters are the Dryad, the Valkyrie, the Paladin, the Priestess, and the Druid. Pretty self-explanatory classes except the Valkyrie is agility-based as well as the Dryad(it's like a centuar-thing) and the Druid is strength-based, so that's a bit odd. The non-free characters are the Ivory Sentinel, the Beserker, the Pheonix Mage, the Summoner, the Tigress(like a Khajiit ranger, basically), the Inquisitor, the Treant, and the Banewitch. Now, don't fret. The currency used for the in-game store("Radiance") is acquirable by completely achievements and challenges, as well as daily quests, so you can earn the Radiance as a F2P model but it takes a while. In a few days of playing, I only got about 250-ish.\n\nThe music is nothing special. It's mostly atmospheric / "just there" so I'm not going to touch on it that much. The least I'll say is that it's better than nothing but I never noticed anything specifically intriguing.\n\nThe graphics are... Well, I'm not sure what they're called but they aren't eye-hurting. Great amount of detail put into the models and maps.\n\nSo, one thing I also wanted to point out is that there IS co-op/multiplayer for every level that I had played up until. That being said, I wanted to play alone and loot(and presumably XP) obtained by other players isn't shared with you, or it doesn't show up and so isn't something that will be noticed. The game seems like it's best played with others, so that you can overwhelm the enemies on a map but then... Why have a singleplayer at all if the odds are stacked in the first place?\n\nThat's pretty much the majority of what I have to say. Is the game bad? No. It's just not very polished at the time of this me writing this review. I put in a fair amount of time to get past the first area of the game and get into the "real challenge" part of the game, albeit the obligatory tutorial area of the game (I'd say the first 4 levels being increasingly worse) did get annoying easily. I won't suggest this game because there are many flaws that apply to anyone who isn't a raging "game expert" that coincidentally knows EXACTLY how to play this game. Not worth the trouble for me, especially since I get VERY angry at games that have ridiculous situations as well as punishments ontop of it to add insult to injury. No one wants to waste their time playing against ridiculous odds only to die over and over. It gets tedious and monotonous.","March 10","false","4.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","5"

The animations are atrocious, though a fair amount of the voice acting is decent. My experience bar is full, but I cannot level. It took twenty minutes to find a Valkyrie name that isn't taken (had to settle for Solveig). Having open games means that anyone can join and slow or outright halt your progress on a map. Leaving a map is unintuitive, and never explained. The core mechanic of moving can royally (or mayhap divinely) screw you over, as a single, erratic hex shift from moving your mouse a millimeter in the breadth of a breath can have you move somewhere and immediately be surrounded. Many abilities are useless, if not a detriment, such as the Valkyrie's Fan Attack. You spend time and mana to modify your attack range, but are still required to attack in melee range. Utterly pointless. Enemies will teleport around in FOW, giving a very nonimmersive feel to gameplay, as wooden and painted-on as it is already.\n\nEven as a tactics game, there are no real tactics. Part of the extended tutorial teaches you to kite. You are expected to do this a lot, early-game. Every fight is a flurry of death-by-one-thousand-stings, as a single spell or ability can take more than half of your mana. You can add more Immortals, assuming you can actually name them something that doesn't make your eyes bleed, but it doesn't add complexity to the game. Every turn is an inconsistent duration, with no clear indication of time or even whose it is. To be clear, this isn't an early access review; the game had an official release.\n\nIf they were to improve upon these things, I still feel like there's no hook. No incentive to play. The story is beyond generic, as far as I've been, and the loot and daily quests feel like a dime-a-thousand mobile game. Certain Immortals are behind a daily grind/pay wall for no apparent reason, one of them being the only reason I was really interested in the first place. It's just a bland, ugly, boring caricature of Tales of Maj'Eyal.","April 9","false","0.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

Something. like how DOTA totally asks you for money but doesn't do it CONSTANTLY. this game doesn't have that. it feels... a little cramped the way they put up real life cash options everywhere.\n\nAnyways, aside from that I love it. I'm a huge fan of turn based strategy games and have never seen one done quite the way they did this. It's not exactly fully turn based in that everyone takes a turn at the same time on one team, then the other team. The limits are action points, called "time" in this game. you can only take so many actions/moves in your turn, though they may happen simultaneously and your friend might take the position you wanted.\n\n\nOverall I'd give it a solid 9.25/10  simply because i love the simplicity and execution of a game i can easily play with a friend and still feel like it's a tactical genre.  That rating is only for the lovers of tactics games, btw.  As far as objective game I'd say closer to 6.25/10  but worth a try regardless because it's free. Again: free in the same way league of legends is. all the good stuff costs a bit of cash or a LOT of grind.\n\nStill recommend it regardless! Can't beat free and it's fun. :)","December 10, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll update this at some point after I've played through it again.\n\nThis is a very good tactical rpg (same style of game as final fantasy tactics, xcom, etc.; in this one you control six characters if I remember correctly) but it also has multiplayer options (three modes last time I played, pvp, gauntlet (co-op arena style combat), and co-op campaign. It's a free to play, but legitamately free to play if you want (the premium currency can be farmed in-game at a reasonable pace with no limit).\n\nNow with that out of the way onto the review (I'll update this at some later time, for now I'm just giving the short version).\n\nThe short version:\nPros:\n-Excellent tactical gameplay\n-Can be competitive (and even the 'best/highest rank/however you want to phrase that' player) as a free to play player.\n-Diverse classes/characters (every class has their own set of abilities and plays differently from all of the other classes).\n-Motivated and active developer. He hangs out in the game chat now and then (sometimes he's on quite a lot).\n-At least reasonably good story (at least of couple of surprises and some decent replay value because you can go back through to get the dialogue options you didn't take the first time).\n-Fun single player (or if you prefer co-op) campaign and multiplayer options.\n-Probably several other things that aren't coming to mind at the moment.\n\nCons:\nNoteworthy:\n-In the past there hasn't been a large player basis. In part this is probably because the game was released in stages and by the time multiplayer and the full campaign were out most people had moved on. Hopefully the steam release has fixed that :)\n-Tournaments weren't built into the game and instead were run by the developer which sometimes lead to confusion about the rules/guidelines for tournaments. Hopefully this has been fixed or at least there is some pvp mode with built-in prizes now.\n\nMinor:\n-I wouldn't be too surprised if pvp still needs some balancing but it will probably take awhile to figure out in what way. That said I wouldn't be too worried about it, as said the developer is quite dedicated to the game and is willing to listen to the games community and incorperate suggestions.\n-The graphics weren't great but it looks like they have gotten a major update so that's probably less of a con than it was and honestly this is a game you play for the gameplay not the graphics.\n-Initial loading time: When you first load the game and the first time you load it after any major update it takes a long time to load. This was an intentional choice by the game designer and the pay-off for it is that subsequent load times are fairly quick, (a lot faster than most of the other games I have played).\n-Probably a few other things that aren't coming to mind, but there weren't any other noteworthy issues that I can recall.\n\nLong Version: (Coming in a later update to this review)","December 24, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it still is an excrutiating grind if you were setting out to get even one paid for character, assuming you play for 1 hour a day you can expect to make 150 radians on a good day. So it would take you 5 days to get 1 paid for character. Its not as bad as many games I've played but its still rather long and the quests get alot harder so don't actually expect getting it in 5 days.\n\n---Encourages Friendship---\nThe game as I've found it really encourages playing with friends, which is nice of course but I'm a lonewolf and if you are too then its gonna be a hard time leveling up. I made the mistake of using all of my 5 characters at my disposal and trying to level them up equaly, but you end up finding out pretty quickly that this simply won't work. The monsters get really strong really quick and will need to concentrate your fire into one or two characters but this leaves you unable to defend against enemies that have your weaknesses all figured out. So then you need a party that helps defend you.\n\n---Pvp---\nI haven't played much of this mode so you may have to hear someone elses voice in the matter, but what I could tell is its a small version of lol. Simply capture territories on the map to earn points for your team or for yourself depending on if you clicked 1v1, 2v2,3v3,etc. But It was oddly fun, but it may just be because my crew if characters was actually really well at handling these battles, because alot of people were just coming in with one or two super strong op characters,\nI could come in with one semi-decent character or two to distract him from 3 characters ready to take down the totems, ending the game quickly before he has time to recapture.\n\n---Storyline---\nI couldn't care about anything they were saying.\n\n---Overall & Verdict---\nIt was suprisingly fun, but it is a fan of microtransactions. I recommend it being played with a friend but thats usually said about every game isn't it? The artstyle is simple and clean-cut, the skills are limited if your playing with 1 or two characters it will feel, the game encourages making friends and punishes ones that don't want ones.\n\nFinal verdict:7/10 playing alone, 8/10 if your with friends.\n\nEither way, play it, you'll love it for either a few hours,or years.","December 30, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

In this mode you fight multiple waves of enimies in room with each wave getting stronger. in return when you finish each gauntlet you can get charms which you can equip to your immortal to make them stronger. I hope my review helped you on a choice to play this game or not. I thank you :3","December 22, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But it still is an excrutiating grind if you were setting out to get even one paid for character, assuming you play for 1 hour a day you can expect to make 150 radians on a good day. So it would take you 5 days to get 1 paid for character. Its not as bad as many games I've played but its still rather long and the quests get alot harder so don't actually expect getting it in 5 days.\n\n---Encourages Friendship---\nThe game as I've found it really encourages playing with friends, which is nice of course but I'm a lonewolf and if you are too then its gonna be a hard time leveling up. I made the mistake of using all of my 5 characters at my disposal and trying to level them up equaly, but you end up finding out pretty quickly that this simply won't work. The monsters get really strong really quick and will need to concentrate your fire into one or two characters but this leaves you unable to defend against enemies that have your weaknesses all figured out. So then you need a party that helps defend you.\n\n---Pvp---\nI haven't played much of this mode so you may have to hear someone elses voice in the matter, but what I could tell is its a small version of lol. Simply capture territories on the map to earn points for your team or for yourself depending on if you clicked 1v1, 2v2,3v3,etc. But It was oddly fun, but it may just be because my crew if characters was actually really well at handling these battles, because alot of people were just coming in with one or two super strong op characters,\nI could come in with one semi-decent character or two to distract him from 3 characters ready to take down the totems, ending the game quickly before he has time to recapture.\n\n---Storyline---\nI couldn't care about anything they were saying.\n\n---Overall & Verdict---\nIt was suprisingly fun, but it is a fan of microtransactions. I recommend it being played with a friend but thats usually said about every game isn't it? The artstyle is simple and clean-cut, the skills are limited if your playing with 1 or two characters it will feel, the game encourages making friends and punishes ones that don't want ones.\n\nFinal verdict:7/10 playing alone, 8/10 if your with friends.\n\nEither way, play it, you'll love it for either a few hours,or years.","December 30, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's great getting to play a turn based tactical game.  It's a genre that is seriously under represented on Steam and I am glad Tactics Studio brought this game to Steam.\n\nI also like that it's fully voice acted.  It's not very often that you see an Indie, F2P game that has that kind of production value.\n\nThere are tons of Immortals to unlock.  Don't worry, if you don't want to spend money you can always play until you have enough radiance (the game's currency) to unlock whichever immortal is the most interesting to you.\n\nI'm looking forward to putting a lot more time into this.  It's the rare F2P game that doesn't feel like a grind and has a ton of depth.  Definitely check it out.","December 4, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
