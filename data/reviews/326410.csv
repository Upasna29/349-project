Gameplay balance - Grog cocktail and the explosive shot that enemies get can OHKO you but good... If you run into grog fire even late game in a defensive build you are pretty much sunk\n\nDefensive skills are typically bad, with some rather obvious exceptions (speed and repair), support skills are generally bad with some rather obvious exceptions (100% luck, accuracy, range)...  Offensive is generally good,,, and completely necessary due to how much damage enemies do making the other trees a bad choice...\n\nFor special you are then forced into offensive as the others don't synergize with anything really useful.\n\n2.) Pirates - As they get less cities they begin to spawn rapidly, when they are down to one city they can be all but an endless stream of ships...  Pro side of this is lots of exp, lots of loot, downside is it makes capturing the final city a lot harder than anything else there...  This is also the end game farming strategy... The late end game farming strategy is heroic instances and siege tower swarms.\n\nCities should be able to make 1-2 ships each, and they should have a cooldown as they are constructed (possibly seen being build and bombarded to stop it)\n\n3.) Grindy - The game is quite grindy... the last ship costs 1,000,000 gold and then a bunch of materials... You can sell for 6k or so a pop of items from heroic instances, so maybe 60-120k per heroic go depending on how well you survive the mass swarm of pirates.  But its not just the last part that is grindy, most of the game is grindy...\n\n4.) Reward balance... Non combat rewards are worthless... questing = a few hundred gold, trading = a few hundred gold... sinking ships?  6000 gold half the time.  (basically 20-50x the reward of the others and its quicker and easier)\n\nSuggestions for improvement?\n\n1.) Towns build ships in the docks, they can be destroyed before being built\n\n2.) Towns have a cap of ships they can put out (the final pirate town shouldn't have access to 8 pirate ships that spawn endlessly)\n\n3.) Growing towns needs to be re-thought... It is terrible to do now...\n\n4.) Completely capturing regions should provide steady income to a player (more towns and level of towns more reward)\n\n5.) War instance - Just a stream of ships decking it out from each side... give a max # that can spawn... Maybe a DOTA style one...\n\n6.) Ships purchased and no longer used should be able to be assigned to a region to improve it... they just bounce around doing quests and trading in that area or whatever the town improvement model becomes\n\n7.) Unstack cooldowns... Right now fog is useless because it starts grogs countdown, its also bad because it has a delay...  Defiance is bad because of the same reasons and it doesn't really provide a ton of use... Hasty repair is good because it stacks with others... poison fog is bad because it starts grogs countdown... and while useful it isn't as good\n\n8.) Increase maps level caps (39 seems to be the max in maps, 54 in heroic instances... but I did have a 57 before it reverted next time) - Ok just clarify in game how to do this... as it isn't obvious\n\n9.) Make factions have more use... IMO they appear completely useless as of now...  Just more ships on the map that really do nothing different than yours (or pirates if you are default hostile)\n\n10.) Don't "Liberate" towns for other factions...  or at least allow the option... weird to help others for no reason in empire style games\n\n11.) Add heroic enemy ships...  Something only enemies get that are massive and deadly with good rewards and skill required to defeat","May 16, 2015","true","33.1"," 264 of 278 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","264","278","6","6"

Boom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spyfoxindrycereal/","183 products in account","Before we get into the actual review lets establish a baseline. There isn’t a story in this game, you just do quests, combat and trading to acquire gold and experience so you can level up, get better items and better ships. With that being said, once you discover multiplayer servers you will never do anything single player again. Multiplayer servers have much more experience and gold than anything you will do in single player from early on in the game. I am writing this at the start of the review so someone actually reads it and doesn’t waste their time grinding out single player – like I did. It took me a few days of single player to reach level 20 and buy a handful of ships. It took me one day of multiplayer combat instances to reach level 50 from 20 and unlock all of the ships. My first impressions were that the game was really slow because I was playing it alone and offline. This view gets completely flipped on its head when I discovered multiplayer.\n\nYou can log into a multiplayer server, join a heroic combat instance and just collect items in the sea that sell for a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of gold. While people who are of the appropriate level fight the pirates and you just soak up the map-wide experience. It’s pretty cheesey but a lot less dry than playing the game offline, alone. Also, the items you collect to sell take up your inventory rather than your cargo spaces which means you can collect a lot of them. I’ll address this point later on, but just be mindful of this – it’s huge. Once you get enough levels, gold and items from this scavenger type of play you can actually assist in the combat and drive out the pirates – which is good fun. Heroic combat instances are group oriented content so you can’t solo the ships very easily. You’ll need to work with the others on the server to defeat the pirates.\n\nThe combat is actually fun and quite strategic. If you have a fast ship, you can position yourself in the enemy blind spot while you pepper them with your broadside cannons. You can also just zip around pirates and capture unprotected towns. If you have a defensive, slow ship, you can ram pirates or just be supportive and protect the more fragile ships in your fleet. If you’re a low level ship and clearly under levelled for the instance you’re in – you can still play a role. You can scout the fog of war and locate towns that need to be captured and sometimes capture a town yourself while the pirates are distracted elsewhere.\n\nWith each level you get a talent point to spend on passives/abilities but the talent choices are pretty ♥♥♥. A lot of abilities share cooldowns with each other so you’ll mostly use the same ability over and over again because they’re not particularly balanced. In addition to this, it’s easy to get levels so you never really specialise. You’re only ever a support/offensive/defensive ship in the early game when you don’t have enough talents to fill out everything.\n\nOverall the game is really fun. I’ve found that the online community are willing to help people who have just started and get them to a point in which they can contribute to big combat instances and be useful – which is when the game peaks for me.\nFrom this point on, I’ll talk about the single player but the above is the best part of the game and if you’re debating whether or not to pick up the game – base it on the above. Multiplayer servers are fun and so much faster to get gold, experience and items that you’ll will never need to or want to play solo at all.\n\n==================================================================================\n\nSolo Play\n\nThese are your options for solo play:\n\n\nQuests\n\nYou can do quests to get experience and gold from each town dotted in the regions. Doing quests levels the town in which you got the quest (up to a max of level 10). Level 10 towns sell better items, more ships and reduce prices of the goods. When you start a quest you get given an item that occupies a space in your cargo hold – so in the early game you can probably do around three quests at a time. It takes a mountain of quests to upgrade a town, so, if you have a small ship with three cargo spaces you’re going to be questing for a really long time before you get a level 10 town.\n\nThe quests are pretty run-of-the-mill: deliver this, collect that, and kill this guy. They are fun while you’re learning the game but after a while they get stale. I think we can safely assume that if you’re questing it’s because you want a level 10 town. It’s a big grind. Alternatively you could just join a multiplayer server that already has level 10 towns and use those to save yourself a headache and a few hours.\n\n\nTrading\n\nThe trading was alright. You visit each town and it presents you with a list of what goods they have in excess and what they need – then you rearrange good between towns accordingly by sailing back and forth. We come back to this point, but the goods occupy the cargo hold (max of 5 spaces late game).\n\n\nThe Problem with Quests and Trading\n\nOverall they’re slow, make less gold/experience than multiplayer server combat instances and are less fun. Quest items and trade goods occupy your cargo hold, in which you can have a maximum of 5 slots. Items found from multiplayer combat instances occupy your inventory which has 25 slots, no matter what ship you have.\n\nI am level 64 currently and each quest gives me about 500 gold and a good trade can earn me 1k-2k gold after a lengthy bit of sailing and working out which town needs which material/item. So this means I can earn around 5k from a full cargo-hold, from quests and trading. Each item in the cargo hold is very unlikely to be destined for the same town so I’m going to be sailing for a while, back and forward to different towns.\n\nCombat instances regularly drop items worth between 2-5k and I can hold 25 of them. This means I can have an awesome time fighting pirates and conquering the region alongside friends before I sail to one town and vendor all my spoils and earn my payday. I can acquire items used for my ship or just sell them. I can pick up aesthetic items to change the way my ship looks or just sell them and make bank. The questing and trading isn’t fun enough to warrant losing that much gold and experience. Whereas multiplayer combat instances are great fun, great gold and great experience so I’m not sure why you’d play alone.\n\n\nExploring\n\nYou never explore in this game. Each map is made up of tiles that are covered by a fog of war. You sail around to reveal the fog of war and then take over the towns by sitting in them while pirates contest your actions. Each region is this, over and over again with a different spread of land masses. It gets dry pretty quick.\n\n\nThe Review\n\nJoin a server and never play alone.\n","June 8, 2015","true","25.6"," 213 of 233 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","213","233","7","3"

I'd say its worth 4-5$ for its singleplayer. The multiplayer part of the game is basically dead. There are about 10-20ppl playing this game. The admins, devs kinda ruined it with bad behaviour and using admin commands on the official server to give themselves advantages over all other players. There is nothing to keep you in this game for a longer time. After you have unlocked all perks (which takes a few hours) you beat the game. You can just grind more and more levels to get more and more percent more dps / armor... but it is really repetitiv and boring. Since you won't find more people in PVP with the little playerbase it doesn't even make sense at all. The game had a lot of potential and gets updated from time to time. The only reason not to buy this is because the best part is the multiplayer where you won't find any players and thus you might eventually find are on a extremly high level so you can't fight them properly.\n\n--- update:\nthey released an android version which is cheaper.... so....","September 1, 2015","false","58.8"," 408 of 500 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","408","500","8","16"

The sea calls to me, and I am eager to set sail, but before I head off, I ask a local clerk if he has any assignments for me to carry out. As it turns out, a few passengers are in great hurry to get to the town of Seatoncreek, and I am also tasked with pinpointing the exact location of said town.\nThis turns out to be easier than expected, as my passengers give me the location of their destination.\nAfter a few final checks, I finally set sail.\n\nMy humble sloop, its sailcloth embroidered with the fearful image of a lion's head, drift across the sea. The few islands that pass are blanketed with the snow that fall mercilessly from the heavens. The cold has caused small islands of ice to form on the water's surface, but that does not stop me from reaching my destination.\nWhen I reach the port, I say goodbye to my passengers, who thank me for my services with a purse of coins. Delighted with my day's work, I decide to stay in Seatoncreek for the time being.\n\nDay 2.\nA notice board in Seatoncreek tells me of a notorious pirate known as Rasnaris, and about a bounty placed on his head. I decide to take up the hunt.\nAs I travel south, I pass by a fellow ship of the Valiants. I travel with him for some time, and just when I am about to break formation, a ship flying black sails appears in the distance. I have found Rasnaris.\nA battle ensues, with my brave ally taking Rasnaris on head-on. I, on the other hand, unexperienced in battle as I am, decide to stay far away, firing volleys at Rasnaris from afar. After a battle that has us going back up all the way to Seatoncreek, Rasnaris finally begins taking in water, and sinks shortly after. Victory!\n\nDay 3.\nI pick up a few missions to ferry cargo to distant towns, and I get to know the local waters a bit better. I also come across a few pieces of floating cargo, that I greedily pick up. After some time, I come across another bounty, this time on a felon known as Kerhen. I decide to hunt him down.\nAfter some sailing, I find Kerhen. There is no time for proper introductions, as cannonballs instantly begin to soar through the air. This time, I am on my own.\nMy vessel proves to be more well-equipped than Kerhens. He sinks to the bottom of the ocean, and I claim my reward.\n\nDay 4.\nI recive notice that a nearby town, Waber, has been capruted by pirates. I head towards it in order to investigate this matter further, and most of all see if I can attempt to recapture it.\n\nThe town appears to be unguarded, and I capture it without any interference. As I enter Waber as its saviour, I am told that there are two pirates in the area. For the future safety of the town, I hunt them down and bring them justice.\n\nDay 5.\nThis region is too peaceful. I crave for the screams of my enemies! I travel to one of the outer regions owned by the Valiant, which, supposedly, has a bit of a pirate problem. I am assured of this fact as I almost immediately come across a pirate settlement protected by a tower. I make short work of the tower and capture the settlement in the name of the Valiant.\n\nDay 6.\nI capture more of the pirate scum's settlements. None will stand in the way of the Valiant!\nAs I get close to yet another one of their pitiful hamlets, I am greeted by two pirate ships. In my hubris, I take them both on. The mistake proves to be almost fatal. I sink the first one without much problems, but my hull has taken quite a few hits, which the late pirate's mate takes advantage of. At first, I try taking him on, only to notice that my hull won't hold. I retreat, hoping that my ship is faster than his. I am in luck, as this proves to be the case.\nFate, however, does not favor me this day, as I run into a large island, preventing my escape. I have to face my adversary.\nI sail along the island's shore, hoping that I will, still, be able to outrun him. This time, however, he keeps up, and lines up for a broadside. I quickly and abruptly turn around and sail towards the front of his ship, moving me out of the line of fire. I fire a desperate volley at his ship, which proves to be more effective than I dared to think. The cannonballs rip through his sailcloth and puncture his hull, and he goes down to the bottom of the sea.\n\nDay 7. I have proven my worth to the Valiant. The region is under Valiant control once more. As I set sail for new waters once again, I gaze once more upon the mighty ships stationed in the docks of the more prominent towns. Huge vessels fitted with brass-lined cannons.\n\nCannons that I, one day, will fire upon the enemies of the Valiant. And woe betide anyone that dares to stand in my way.","May 13, 2015","true","20.3"," 216 of 270 people (80%) found this review helpful 100 people found this review funny","80","216","270","100","8"

The maps are randomly generated and well drawn, the music and beautiful and thematic, the gameplay flows well, it is fast paced and engaging. While the start might be a bit slow, the game picks up big time afterwards - e.g., in your starting area you might be facing only a few enemy or pirate ships, while as the game progresses, there might be nothing BUT enemies... Wowie, those are some nail-biting engagements.\n\nStill, one can't help but compare Windward to one of the best games of this genre, Sid Meier's Pirates (let's shorten it to SMP for convenience). So let's see what the games does well, and what poorly.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. Like SMP, you are free to do whatever and go wherever. Wanna be a goods trader? Sure. Wanna hunt down every pirate on the map? Go ahead. Wanna help your factions towns to grow, thus ensuring yourself more lucrative quests? Yep, can do!\n2. Like SMP, you can still upgrade your ship with better hull, sails, armament, crew, etc.\n3. Unlike SMP, you don't need to worry about food, crew morale and mutinies. This is a VERY welcome decision by the developers.\n4. Unlike SMP, there is a RPG style progression. As you level up, you can unlock talent points, which can be spent on various trees governing ship strength, durability, speed, shot accuracy, cargo, diplomacy, etc. Great addition, supporting all styles of gameplay.\n5. Unlike SMP, if you lose a battle on the map (and you will!), you don't get marooned on an island, rescued, and forced to start with a basic sloop. You get to keep the type of ship you last died with AND its cargo. All you lose are the active quests. In other words, you don't get to punch the screen cause you just found some OP item and lost it due to death.\n6. Unlike SMP, battles are engaging and dynamic, and may easily include up to 7-8 ships, both friendly and enemy ones.\n7. Unlike SMP, where you very rarely fight more than 1 enemy ship, here you could be facing a lot. At one point you are on the verge of destroying an enemy sloop, the next moment 4 more enemies converge on you and you blow up before you are able to say "oh shiiii..."\n8. Like SMP, there are factions who may or may not be at war with each other. This may turn a battle into an even bigger free for all fun time.\n9. Unlike SMP, your ship will fire automatically when faced with a clear shot at an enemy on any of the port or starboard sides. Like SMP, there are a few shot types, which can be manually activated - like chain shot for example, fired at close range to tangle the sails and reduce enemy mobility.\n10. Unlike SMP, you can have a bunch of followers (friendly ships) who actually fight at your side and don't brainlessly tail behind you to the next port.\n11. Unlike SMP, you don't get to keep the ships you capture, so no more skill-kills on stronger enemies just to give yourself some advantage. Could be considered a bad decision too.\n12. Unlike SMP, the quests are way more diverse - not constricted to ferry a governor, or some grain, or do stupid things to gain the favor of a governor's daughter just for the opportunity to look at her bosom up close.\n13. Unlike SMP, tactical thinking is the difference between spoils, life or death. Fight, run or tactically retreat for a while, repair and get back in? Up to you :)\n14. Like SMP, you can lose and (re)capture various towns and important map positions, thus gaining more experience and reputation with the various factions.\n15. Unlike SMP, hitting a shore actually damages your ship. In SMP; it used to happen only when you hit a reef or wade through a storm.\n16. Unlike SMP, followers can be commanded to do stuff for you, or protect various areas.\n17. Unlike SMP, you can purchase and build sentry towers and lighthouses to either give vision or defend a certain area, city or a bottleneck, which gives you time to react.\n18. Unlike SMP, this game actually has a decent multiplayer. What's even better, you can switch between SP, Co-op with friends and MP at will.\n19. Unlike SMP, this game can also be considered an MMO of sorts, as it has a very good number of populated servers, doing instances, fighting for sectors, and so on, and so forth.\n\nShort comment before we proceed to the BAD: the developers are committed and have already stated that they are working to improve the single player part with more quests, content and improved friendly AI.\n\nLong comment: At present, MP offers more than SP. Playing online will net you a better ship way faster than the do-it-yourself way. Everyone who whines and complains about SP should pick themselves a nice low-populated, built up server and go for it - why? Because it will still feel like you are doing SP, unless someone joins in. You will gain more money and you will upgrade your ships way faster.\n\nIn all fairness, the developers understand us and have said that SP will improve. However, only in SP and low-pop MP servers can you get the satisfaction of flipping a whole map all by yourself. Don't ever forget that.\n\nHaving said that, do not expect miracles in SP - it would be unfair if the devs bump up SP at the expense of MP, as any of the 3 aspects of the game (SP, Co-op, MP) must have some respect to the online part of the game.\n\n\nThe BAD:\n\n1. Unlike SMP, you don't get to keep the ships you sink, unless you do a quest, which turns the enemy ship into your follower. No more skill kills on famous pirates just to capture their well-built ship... Could be a good thing too.\n2. Early game requires some grinding until you buy a slightly better ship.\n3. To me it feels like the game sort of forces you into some grinding to get a better ship before entering the next area, unless you like respawning a lot. Very much noticeable towards the 4-5th maps.\n4. On quite a number of occasions you might get overwhelmed, especially when entering enemy-controlled territory.\n5. Unlike SMP, there is no romance or siblings saving here. Could be considered a bad thing, as some people like to see some heart in a game.\n6. Learning how NOT to run aground could be a huge pain, as it takes a good chunk of your ship's health.\n7. Fair is fair: single player is a little lacking in content right now, and doing-it-yourself takes a good chunk of your free time. It's easily remedied if you go do some MP, but I fully realize it may not be everybody's cup of tea.\n\nThe conclusion:\n\nWith the amount of stuff the game does well, at the current 13€ price it is a really good buy. Being a MMO of sorts, you will double or triple the money spent on it as gameplay hours, maybe even do a tenfold if you get into it big time. As I said, I am three hours in and I am already hooked. I can't wait to sail the seas, capture stuff, sink pirates, haggle with merchants and... ferry passengers, I guess...","May 16, 2015","true","21.0"," 100 of 110 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","100","110","5","8"

The combat and trading system is very well done.\n\nHowever, I cannot recommend this game. The game is a bit grindy and repetitive. My biggest problem with this game is that there are not enough options to defend the territory you have already captured. Once you conquer a region, pirates will continously spawn and take over unless you go out to meet them. And when you have 5-6 pirates all coming in at once from different parts of the map it can get extremely annoying.\n\nSure, some people say you can build towers, but you can't build them too close together, and one tower is never enough against a pirate, let alone a group of them. Essentially, guard towers only delay the inevitable. Also, you can't control how many ships are in the region to defend your land. Theoretically you should be able to hire more ships to patrol your waters, but such a mechanic does not exist.\n\nIf the issue of properly defending regions are addressed, I will recommend this game!","May 12, 2015","false","17.4"," 565 of 774 people (73%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","73","565","774","20","17"

This game isn't really bad, it's just not any fun if you play single-player like I do.  If there's anything to really describe it, imagine an endless game of Call of Duty or Battlefield where there are 10 capture points, and the game is only over once every one of them is captured. Then, you move to a functionally identical new map and do it all over again... Except it's not first person, it's overhead with poor line-of-sight, it's MUCH slower, and the controls are frustrating because clicking to shoot an enemy at the top-right corner of the screen instead opens up the map.\n\nI went into this game wanting to really like it, but I just can't help but feel like it lied to me about what it really was...\n\nFor example, the game says that you can trade, and it even offers a trading faction, but then, trading doesn't really DO anything.  The game only helps you understand what trades are available within one small map which usually only has 4-8 towns, and all of which generally use the same commodities.  Also, to get better trade ships, you need to sink ships, which means that to become a good trader, you need to find trading ships and sink them.\n\nYou can name your own towns, but as soon as you've colonized an area, and kicked out anyone else trying to take control of it, there's basically no reason to stick around, and it's time to head off to the next area, completely forgetting all those areas you tried to build up, before.  You COULD found your own town, and work on growing it by hand for hours on end... or just take over a fully-grown town for a hundredth of the effort.  Towns have zero customizability past what they are named and where they are located, so there's zero investment in any of them.\n\nIt's hypothetically capable of being played single-player, but there's very little reason you'd want to do so.  You move into an area, conquer it, then rinse and repeat the next island down the road.  Also, playing single-player, the instances, especially the combat instances, are nigh-impossible to win solo, as your side is outnumbered, the enemies tend to be stronger than your ship, so they respawn faster than you can sink them, and the main way to win is to simply grab what are overglorified capture points.  Without the coordination or intelligence of a human team, any time you grab a few towns, some others are lost, and any time you defend what you have, it's just an unlimited stream of the same enemies coming at you again and again until you get bored and quit.\n\nObviously, some people are capable of having a good time being in some clans and fighting competitive games, but there's very little enjoyable gameplay for someone like me who actually wanted to play the trading and exploring aspects this game pretended it had, but really didn't have.   This game is only meant to be played as a nautical-themed DOTA MMO, and any other playstyle is invalid.","October 26, 2015","false","13.3"," 115 of 135 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","115","135","3","10"

Stay far, far away from a scam artist like this one.\n\n----\n\nNote that this review was done from the single player experience. And as a single player experience, Windward is woefully grindy and simplistic. That's not a good combination.\n\nThere's nothing interesting to explore in Windward - the next map is a generic version of the last map. The game play is exceptionally grindy as you buy two or three goods (that's all your ship will hold for the first 10+ hours of any game), travel across the generic map to go to a different city and sell those two or three goods. You're thanking your lucky stars when you can sell both goods at the same city. And the cities take FOREVER to develop into anything remotely large, and there's no way to develop your cities beyond enduring this grind because the "quests" (all are either "kill x" or simple Fedex quests) level your cities even more slowly.\n\nSingle player combat is nothing more than sailing in a circle waiting for the next hotkey to come up - it's like the worst example of level 1 MMO combat.\n\nSo you move on from region to region, doing the exact same thing. There's no fundamental personality or purpose to the single player component. It becomes tedious very quickly and the known bug with pirate spawning rates (this is going to be fixed) only adds to that incredible annoyance. You're also pretty much on your own. You can have computer AI ships follow, but they simply fail to do so (or can't keep up), meaning that any battle you face will undoubtedly be on your own.\n\nMP is a different game. Windward is a better game when played cooperatively - it's easier to take down other enemies, coordinate strategies and so forth. But as a single player experience, Windward loses its luster quickly. Since that's what I like to play, Windward gets both thumbs down.","May 15, 2015","false","18.8"," 165 of 219 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","165","219","5","7"

The dev clearly had the discipline not to try and cram all sorts of additional doodads and whizzbangs to try and pad out the game, which, combined with actually using the Early Access platform in the manner one would expect it to be used, has resulted in a game with pleasing core gameplay and a smooth, customiseable experience that can be as casual or psychotically unfair as you want it to be.\n\nAt the time of release Windward concentrates on the core basics of it's gameplay; sailing and fighting. Sailing around the map is a weirdly pleasant experience for the most part, since the game throws realism overboard and makes controlling your ship easy and forgiving. Let's face it, people like the aesthetic and theme of the Age of Sail, but you don't want to be struggling to get your bloated wooden whale around the place. Instead, Windward lets you concentrate on deftly threading your ship through a tiny gap in the procedurally generated island chain, or weaving about scooping up bits of flotsam and jetsam as loot. Simply moving around is fun, or certainly vastly more tolerable than the majority of games at the worst.\n\nFighting is where the game really throws down it's arcade leanings, with guns automatically firing from both sides of your ships at the closest enemies, while you try to maneuver yourself into optimal position. And then you use an ability that hurls a flaming barrel at a cartoonish angle into your foes, setting them all alight. With one tongue firmly in your cheek, you can expect combat against entrenched pirates to rapidly descend into an all-out brawl between half a dozen ships, hopefully some of them on your side, pretty much constantly.\n\nIt's great fun, and thrives on simplicity at it's heart. You lose hours without even realising that you've just been going back and forth across a map, performing missions to move cargo and passengers around, maybe blowing up a pirate now and then. It gets worse when you discover the button that sets up an instanced combat map, allowing you to fight a war of conquest to clear a map of pirates, before returning to your main game world.\n\nThe best part is that Windward is currently a perfect foundation. For people who like indie games with potential, Windward is worth keeping an eye on, as its current pleasing focus on getting the real basics right means there's a sturdy framework to expand in Terraria-esque fashion.","May 12, 2015","true","22.1"," 76 of 88 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","76","88","3","0"

Windward is the closest thing to that game I have seen. Very similar naval battle mechanics to Pirates!, combined with 4 unique factions which cater to different playstyles, add in an MMO esque skill tree system, and an addicting loot/upgrade system and this game provides an incredible amount of entertainment.\n\nAll of the maps are generated similar to other sandbox games and roguelikes. meaning there is near endless replay value here. The game can get repetitive as most loot grind games (Diablo, Borderlands) can after a while but since it offers diffrent ways for you to progress, it breaks that monotony up a bit. Get sick of combat? start just doing noncombat trade missions, sick of trading? Just start exploring. Wanna play offline and fight AI pirates? Go for it. Wanna do some PVP large naval battles, hop on a busy server and have at it. Your ship and skills are persistant, meaning whether you are playing offline or on you can still progress your abilities and gear.\n\nOne of my only concerns with this game is that I hope the dev (there is only one) keeps working on it and adding to it, because It has the potential to be even better than Pirates! if he expands on his base game.  I highly recommend this game for anyone who was a fan of Pirates! or strategy games and even rpgs, at the very worst it is a good time killer worth 15 bucks easy, but personally I think the sky is the limit for this game.","May 12, 2015","true","10.7"," 72 of 84 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","72","84","0","0"

I binge played it all day yesterday, and had a great time. This is definitely best played with friends. I played solo for about two regions, but when my friends bought it too I got so much more out of the game.\n\nIt's very comparable to Sid Meier's Pirates. Here's some of the main simularities:\n- Camera Angle\n- Economy (Buy at one place, sell at another for a profit)\n- Regions can develope\n- Many ships to choose from, with different play styles\n- Different types of ammunition to utilize (However, in Windward you level up to unlock them)\n\nHere are some of the differences:\n- No crew moral\n- You don't control when your ship fires it's normal attack, it's just a steady stream of iron flowing from your cannons.\n- There are regions in this game, you can liberate them for your faction. Once liberated, trade and quests open up.\n- Coop!\n- No shanty esque music :c\n- Good music (despite lack of shanties)\n- Bigger naval battles\n- No landing party, and capturing a city is as simple as killing all the pirate ships around it and camping it.\n- Can build defence towers to help hold your land\n- Periodic pirate invasions\n\nOverall, I highly reccomend this game. It's a very fun pirate game to get into. You've got a lot of choice in customization, and I'd say this game is very replayable. Right now, I am going to go from playing a coop server with my two friends, to a large server with 34 people playing on it.

It could stand to be improved in some areas...the player/world selection style, for one.  Currently, you have to remember the name of your player and/or campaign name you've created in order to continue where you left off...a selection menu showing you a list of all of your saved players/campaign names would have been nice.  A way to delete campaigns/worlds you no longer want in-game would also be helpful.\n\n"Windward" is a little different from the build I played in 2012 on Desura.  That older build featured quick 5-10 minute skirmishes that allowed you to earn XP and loot.  You could equip your ship with new items and assign points to a talent tree.  For the most part, those mechanics are still present...though instead of quick skirmishes, you'll generate procedurally generated worlds that span multiple "map blocks".  In essence, it became more like "Sid Meier's Pirates" as opposed to a quick multiplayer shoot-em-up.  I admit, I do miss the old build and hope the dev plans to include these quick skirmish matches as another game mode of sorts.\n\nIn this campaign, most of your time will be spent doing quests (go here, build a new settlement there, defend this settlement, etc.) and trading via a supply/demand system.  It's all very basic right now but has the potential to be a lot more.  I'll be interested to see where this goes in the near future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLshbEfUloQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=robutS_xTTA\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpSvhXy2bg0","October 11, 2014","true","8.5"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","56","65","0","3"

This is a game that will fool you at first into thinking it's simpler than it is. It's easy to pick up and play without any instruction, although you may not understand the significance of your choices for the initial map and options at first. I played for HOURS, thinking "I like this game" before I realized that "the map" was still just the *first* square on the larger map.\n\nAfter 19 hours, I'm only on the fourth square, still in my first game, and discovering this game has great depth. I'm already looking forward to learning more detail about the specifics about the game AI. I have yet to encounter any of the other factions yet, and would probably play this first game for 50 hours or so before I start to encounter them.  I've changed the options to slow the gameplay a little (80 or 90% speed) so that I can be more strategic, but I love the fact that it is up to the user to decide whether to slow that down (or speed it up).  This is a game where you can easily spend a couple of hours a night for a *month*, building your faction, before you finally finish it. If you do. I dunno, I'm still on my first game.\n\nThe graphics are great (even at lower settings!), the ship movements and finishing touches are wonderful.  Night and seasonal effects: the snow drives me crazy with a feeling of movement (just as it would in RL). ;)  And as I am learning of what is typical of anything from Tasharen games (StarLink and now Windward), I have yet to encounter anything that faintly resembles a bug. And this one isn't even officially released yet.  As a veteran of 30+ years of software development, this developer has earned my total respect for what he's doing here. And the developer of NGUI for Unity too.\n\nFolks, I never heard of Tasharen before StarLink (which is one of my fave games on my tablet), and I have no connection other than I appreciate great software when I see it. I don't normally take the time to review things, but I have 3 important words to say, to anyone looking at the pics and video and thinking they *might* like it: BUY THIS GAME.\n\nIf you *think* you might like this one, you will. It's not for everyone, but anyone who likes this kind of thing will be shocked at how much depth this has, once they start to get into it.","January 26, 2015","true","35.1"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","58","69","4","0"

The basic mechanics are solid but, well, ultimately there isn't really much beyond the basic mechanics. It boils down to the same handful of cycles repeated forever and turns into a complete grind really fast. But also offers little as a reward for the grinding in question. There's very little variety in play styles on offer despite the surface impression of more from multiple ships and talents.\n\nCo-op does improve the gameplay considerably but it still  lacks depth or payoff for the amount of grinding it asks of the player. There's not much content here, but its stretched out basically forever. You'll see everything the game has to offer within a few hours tops and then its just that, over and over and over again. Its not terrible, its just too little stretched too thin. It plays like an Early Access title still and probably should have stayed there a while yet to fill out the content and add some much needed polishing.\n\nThen....there's the bugs. They are numerous and rove in packs seeking unattended pets and small children to carry off to their colony. Leaving only shock and confusion in their wake.\n\nHopefully, it will flesh out and mature over time, but right now it came out the door too soon.","May 17, 2015","false","92.1"," 111 of 153 people (73%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","73","111","153","19","11"

Foregoing the over the top personality and story elements that immerse you in the Caribbean, this game instead optimizes the combat, navigation and creates massive randomly generated worlds for you to sail around and to blow ships up in. You have skills, both passive and active, which make you a more effective combatant and if you'd rather just play the merchant game, you can sail amongst a massive number of towns building up large sums of gold. Also, the music is ridiculously relaxing in this game and top down sailing has never been so pleasurable.

Hi there! You are probably looking for a review, right? Well, then:\n\nWhy I bought this gameBefore buying a game I usually look for gameplay videos first. Trailers are great to convey the story, but they often don´t say much about the in-game experience. Luckily, the store page already featured a gameplay video with the Dev explaining.\nThis game has a lot of potential to become a large MMO, as it is very unique and currently the only one of this particular genre. The scaling of players (scaling lower players up in higher-lvl areas, and higher players down in lower areas) allows for co-op play without restrictions, e.g. in combat-instances.\n\nWhat to expect from this gameI´d tag this game as RPG/Action/Strategy/Tower-defense. To get an in-game experience I recommend watching the gameplay video.\nYou control a ship, sailing on shallow waters around chains of islands, fighting pirates, questing or trading. When starting you can choose any of four factions, each with its own benefits and penalties. The gameplay can be whatever you like it to be - peaceful questing and trading, PvE, or even PvP. You can play either alone, starting your own instance with nobody able to enter except by invite, or play on the regular map where you will cross paths with other players.\nAs you progress and level up, you will find better loot, more gold, buy better ships, equip better gear/crew/captains. You can also join more factions, one unlocking at level 50, another at 150, as well as the option to join the pirates.\n\nThe large server-map consists of multiple area-maps, with each having different difficulties the further they are to the factions spawn point. Once you reach a certain level, you will have outgrown the regular map content. To progress further you will have to join or create yourself an instance.\nInstances are private area-maps that are generated according to your level. Nobody can enter your instance unless invited by you. You can also team up with others and try to finish a heroic (much harder) instance, which will give you much better loot.\n\nThe game can be played in single player, local co-op, internet multiplayer. You can also host games yourself, available in the online serverlist. The game is moddable.\n\nDownsides of this gameThe only problematic thing about this game is: It is terribly addictive. You have been warned...\n\nStarting TipsValiant: Combat\nConsulate: Trader\nSojourn: Explorer\nExchange: All-rounder\n\nStart by doing quests. Trade as soon as you have enough gold. Buying every ship is very expensive, check which one you want.

It is charming in that way, but I would like to see ways to change faction relationships through war or favor type quests, ways to recruit NPC ships to fight along side you, bounties set on specific roaming ships, etc. Basically because it is so close in gameplay to those space games I mentioned, I definitely feel like there is some other gameplay features that can be borrowed from those games.\n\nI would also like to see more direct ways to improve a towns growth. Maybe let me use some of those resources I have been gathering to purchase direct upgrades to towns?

The world consists of a large number of rectangular regions, each of which contains a procedurally generated terrain and oceans, with a few coastal towns scattered in each. The next decision is to choose your starting faction.  There are several Windward factions, all of which are allies by default, and each comes with a different set of advantages and drawbacks, which are described to you when you're asked to choose: maybe you want to get rich as an Exchange captain, or rampage the seas wiping out pirates with Valiant, or ... the choices are yours.\nYou will begin in a Challenge Level 0 area (be thankful!) which will be peaceful enough to get familiar with sailing your sloop between ports around the map.  If you haven't watched the introduction video to get a feel for the gameplay, do it now!\nAlthough the game is *all* about sailing, and it's called Windward, this isn't a sailing ship simulator.  Your craft will make its way directly into the wind, if you like to point it that way, although more slowly.  There's a certain amount of wind variation, but you'll never get a flat calm, nor a storm to sink you.  You have simple controls to speed up, slow down and steer to starboard or to port (right and left, for landlubbers :).  You can even warp backwards at low speed, necessary if you're stuck up some creek, and your hull is taking damage from being aground.\nWith limited gold at the start, and very much like Commander Jameson in the original Elite, you have few options for climbing to the top: you need to get some weapons, some experience with which to buy talent points, and to build or find more advanced towns which will sell you more advanced ships.\nSome reviewers have described the early phases of the game as 'tedious' and 'grinding', and if you're an adrenaline junky who doesn't want to take the time to grow your ship and your XP, you might agree.  For my money, the calm and thoughtful elements are just as absorbing and rewarding as the maniac battles against fleets of pirates.  Make no mistake, though, you will encounter piracy early in the game, and you'll get sunk by gloating pirates often enough to make you want to get back at 'em.\nThe visual aspect of the game is excellent: the water and landscape are animated, there are flocks of gulls and shoals of fish, the clouds drift across the sky in the direction of the prevailing wind (which, incidentally, changes direction slowly but constantly - sometimes it's better to plan a journey that doesn't take you into the teeth of the wind).  The sound too is well-chosen, with informative sound effects for game events, and music which matches the peacefulness or otherwise of your situation.\nOptions for single-player play, multi-player on LAN or Internet servers and invitation-only 'instances' all exist, which means that you can be as solitary or gregarious as you wish.  The developer has been very accessible and attentive during Early Access, updating Windward almost every day for the last six months, and there is a helpful community on the Steam forums to answer your questions.\nAt the price, you won't find many better ways to spend enjoyable hours with a game.  I thoroughly recommend it.","May 13, 2015","true","733.6"," 46 of 55 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","46","55","0","0"

Ship combat is the heart of Windward but there are also simple trading, questing and faction reputation systems to play with as well.\n\nWhile Windward is a fun single-player experience, it really shines in multiplayer with both local hosting and dedicated servers that let you drop in with your personal ship and join in on the pirate-hunting and faction wars with a community.\n\nWith it's unique and streamlined blend of strategy, simulation and rpg elements, and slick presentation, Windward is game worth checking out right now.","May 12, 2015","true","117.5"," 46 of 56 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","46","56","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radoo-RO/recommended/326410/","Radoo-RO","Radoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radoo-RO/","207 products in account","First, when I saw the game on Steam, I wasn't sure if I should buy this game or not. I did a little bit of research, and I saw many reviews and YouTube videos that showed only some aspects the singleplayer game. In this review I will try to answer some of the questions I had when deciding if this game is worth the money.\n\nShort descriptionThe game is a sandboxed naval Action-RPG. In essence, ignoring the naval part, it's pretty much Diablo III, but:\n- with cool loot;\n- with 100+ players multiplay (not 4 like in Diablo III; OK there are instances which are limited to a handful of players, but WoW has this too, and that's a MMO);\n- real procedural generated world.\n\n\nThings many reviews missedI won't be speaking much about things that you will obviously find in every review or gameplay video you find. With that in mind, here are a few things I wanted to know about the game before the buy, and couldn't find a fast answer to:\n\n- How is your progress saved?\nYou create a user name that has an unique ID (I guess) associated with it. The user information is saved locally on disk (as a backup), and also on Steam Cloud, so basically, you can never lose your progress.\n\n- What about multiplayer progress?\nWhen you log to a server, or even your own game instance, that can be shared with your friends, you will use the same user name already created by you. Your progress will be saved on Steam Cloud. You can switch to any number of servers you want, you will still have the same XP and loot as before.\n\n- How do the multiplayer servers work?\nThe servers are independent, you can make one of your own, the developer shared all the info you need to create a dedicated server on the community forum. Each server is not related to another, and all your progress, as mentioned before, is saved on the Steam Cloud. Each server can be configured to have admins. Admins can ban players for cheating or for breaking any of the rules that may govern the server. The ban is server-based (it's an important factor, as I though cheaters could be banned forever from any servers, but there is no Steam ID ban unfortunately).\n\n- So there are cheats and hacks?\nYes, they are, and the people using them can mess up your fun a little bit, but there are ways to get pass these issues:\n1. The world maps has many zones, so one cheater can't being all the zones;\n2. The admin can ban the cheater;\n3. One night, many servers were hacked and some players got respawned a few times and levelled up fro 100+ levels, and some wanted to go through that levelling process doing trading quests, killing pirates, capturing zones from other factions (yes, there are a few factions, you can find all about it all over the Net) or by doing combat instances with other people. In this case, you could revert using your local backup (everything is documented on the community forum).\nFinal words on cheating: there will always be people which will try to cheat or hack, the important thing is that, in this game, those people are rare, and it can be dealt with them.\n\n- Are there any bugs that might affect my progression?\nThere were in the past. Most bugs that appear these days don't affect your progress, but may affect some actions you do in an area; usually there is a workaround. The important thing is that the developer is very involved into this project, and replies to most of the feedback he receives. He didn't abandon the game like others do with their game.\n\n\nFinal Words - Is it fun?I played the game in singleplayer mode for the first 10 levels. It was nice, but I could feel like it will get boring soon. I jumped into a multiplayer Internet server, and never look back on singleplay.\n\nIn the multyplayer mode, players chose different factions and can conquer areas of the map controlled by others or the pirates. So the areas change all the time, and may not be the same from your last login. Also, some servers do resets, which may change the way the worlds look. You can also do multiplay combat instances where you coop with others to remove all the pirates on the map, get the loot, level up, get new cool items and spend points on actions. You can also get flags that you can use to switch factions (there is even a pirate flag, Arr!!). There are many of things you can do to keep you entertain for a couple of hours or more each day, I won't spoil your experience by talking more about them.\n\nProbably, there is a point in time where you can say you are bored, but I didn't find it yet. So, YES! For me, THIS GAME IS PRETTY FUN! And for ~13 euros / 15$, it's one of the best investment in a game I ever made.","May 23, 2015","true","49.0"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","32","36","3","0"

There's also three different specializations you can put points into.\n\n-decent amount of servers and good playerbase for those wanting to try multiplayer, sadly the EU server selection is limited though\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-overall sound design is very simple, even a bit barren perhaps, music is also nothing to write home about\n\n-can get grindy, especially when you're trying to improve a faction's reputation or leveling a city\n\n-pvp is generally unbalanced,the player with the better ship usually wins easily, same goes for equipment, this can lead to a good amount of griefing on pvp servers/ contested zones\n\n-pirate spawn rate can get annoying very fast, freeing a region when every ship you sink respawns in less than a minute and often comes straight back to you gets aggravating. This can be solved by coming back with a better ship but,again,it means you'll be in for a possibly long grind. Grouping will make things easier ofc.\n\n-game progression is unbalanced towards instances, where you can easily sink pirates for a good amount of money/exp/loot: in contrast trading/questing progression feels way slower reward-wise (even though a recent patch improved money/exp rewards at least). This also means you'd enter a server and find that most people are just playing instances, leaving the sandbox world feeling barren.\n\n-NPC AI is pretty stupid overall, they wont react when they're in a collision course, they often get in your way and, during fights, do not maneuver well and might get stuck on land\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=441657540\n\nOverall Windward has its share of flaws and, generally speaking, is a pretty simple game when you look at how combat and trading works: despite this it's still a very fun game though. It can provide a relaxing experience and some pretty frantic fights especially when going against other players (provided you're of similar level to ensure a fair fight).\nIf you're looking for a well crafted sandbox game that isn't too complex then this game will provide a good amount of game time before you can consider your adventure "complete", just be mindful of its limits and whether they might affect your overall enjoyment.","May 22, 2015","true","23.1"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

Remember how cool it was to just explore that vast open world with your own ship? Well if you liked that BUY THIS GAME NOW.\n\nStill not buying? Okay then... Read this review see if it changes your mind.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot like ACIV and Sid Meier's Pirates! and even a bit of Pixel Piracy but with some MMO elements. You can gather supplies and use 'em to lots of utilities. You can upgrade your ship and buy new ones, with better armor, speed, cargo capacity, and some other stuff too. You can also invest in 3 different sets of skills. Defense, Offence and Support, each with it's unique abilities and passive skills. You can even start your OWN settlements that later can turn into bigger towns. There are 4 main factions and 2 other mysterious ones, Each offers unique perks that can give you that edge you need.\n\nNOTE: When I said it looked like ACIV I meant only the open world ship exploration and combat. Apart from that it has nothing to do with ACIV. I mean, ain't like you are gonna start doing parkour with a boat.\n\n==============================================\n\nPROS+ Extremely Addicting;\n+ Fun Battles;\n+ Well-Worked Skill System;\n+ Customizable Sails and Ship Colors;\n+ Good Economic System;\n+ Customizable and/or Random World Generation;\n+ MMO Elements.\n+ You can also be a Pirate! (Y'arr!)\nCONS- Menu interface needs just a BIT of improvement (like a "back" button on the map creation would be good);\n- Gameplay gets repetitive after some time;\n- Mid and Late Game becomes a bit of a grinder;\n- Needs more improvement on the Multiplayer.\n\n==============================================\n\nWindward mainly focus on 3 areas, and I'm gonna talk about 'em.\n\n>Questing/TradingAs the name says it's about making quests and making profit through trading. It's recommened for new players and for those who look for a more casual experience. Really fun and helps a lot to learn and get familiarized with the game's mechanics and interface.\n\n>CombatAgain, the name says it all. You'll be mostly fighting against pirates and helping your and other factions on claiming or liberating territory, and even helping settlements accross the map. Now, believe me when I say, it feels so good to wreck those pirates and show who's boss.\n\n>BattlegroundsA bit like combat but instead you'll be bringing the fight with other ship captains. A bit like PVP.\n\n==============================================\n\nPersonal NoteNow even if I loved this game I gotta admit that it has it's flaws. I mean come on, we can't expect it to be perfect, but still this game is pretty good.\nI'm pretty sure if the developer(s) put a little more effort and improve some things here and there this game could be a HUGE success.\nAlso, this game would give an awesome MMO, all it needs is some servers and more people to join.\n\nNow I couldn't and probably won't be able to point all the problems in this game, I've pointed a few, but with the help of the community and developers this game can be a smash hit.\n\n==============================================\n\nA Note to the Developer(s):Please DON'T give up on this game. it has so much potential. I simply loved it and if you make a little more effort this game can become HUGE. I can't tell you how happy I am to finally see a game like this again. It reminds me of the good old days of Sid Meier's Pirates! and (not so old) ACIV and Pixel Piracy.

It showed me enough to get me hooked, so that's probably the best video for you to watch.\n\nThe mechanics of thing game are simple, though there's a ton of this game I haven't reached yet. Each time you play the game, you're in it for the long haul. I haven't tried multiplayer, but I think it would be interesting as long as people kept using the same gear and you just play the game periodically. A shorter skirmish type multiplayer mode would be interesting.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is great. The peacetime music is relaxing and the wartime music is engaging.\n\nYou really set the pace of this game. If you want to fight enemies, you can do that within a few minutes. You can start doing missions very quickly, and trading. Most of the missions are dead simple, and trading is dead simple too. I don't think they should be any more complex than they are, otherwise I think it would ruin the simple mechanics to the game. That's my own personal opinion of course.\n\nThe only bug I have seen so far has been that some pickups in the ocean have resulted in an error saying the object wasn't known. I'm sure that will get fixed in due course.\n\nThe game could use a tutorial to explain some of the mechanics behind combat and questing. Most of it can be picked up easily enough, though I'm still uncertain why my ships aren't firing as often as the enemy ships. Maybe my equipment is still just that bad?It could also be that the basic ships just don't fire as often or as many shots.\n\nThe abilitites, inventory, talents and fast travel options can all be right clicked on to re-bind. It doesn't tell you what the current key binding is, but it lets you bind a new key.\n\nOverall I'm very happy with this purchase and I'm keen to see the new content that is brought out.","October 12, 2014","true","35.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","21","23","0","3"

I started a game to give it a try and kill a couple of minutes, and my first 4 hours were behind me before I realized it!\n\nTake the best (sailing) parts of the various pirate themed sailing games from the 80's and 90's, speed up the game play a bit, and be ready to lose yourself for a bit!  I don't know what it is about the balance they were able to achieve in this mix, but it simply works for this game.\n\nCombat\nPretty straight forward, you get into range and your ship auto-attacks the closest enemy within the various firing arcs.  You can hire escort ships or try to bribe pirates if you have enough gold, and those extra guns can make the difference between collecting the booty, and spending the night with Davy Jones!\n\nThere are special attacks you can unlock as you gain experience, some of these increase your DPS, reduce your damage taken, or can buff your allies (including defensive structures like sentry towers!)  Each faction has it's own perks, and depending on what you enjoy, you'll probably find one of the factions that calls to you.\n\nLater game play has you capture towns, towers, etc.. for your faction, and there is a benefit for doing so beyond it being a goal.  As you control more of the towns, you have more places to trade/quest, which also helps advance the town's level, opening new items for you to use on your ship, new ships, and even new quests.\n\nTrading/Quests\nTo me, probably the most "boring" aspect of the game, and it's still not that boring at all.  You can choose to take on quests or cargo, all missions take one of your cargo (not your inventory) slots, and as you advance up the various ship lines, you'll gain/lose cargo slots based on the ship's role.\n\nThe various "world" missions have been entertaining so far, and their rewards tend to be usable/in scale for the quest line.  One complaint here, you can get random missions for specific resources (like cotton) which are not available in your current region.  It would be nice if the game allowed you keep these types of missions in inventory when you find them, but you don't know the objective until you Examine the quest.  Unfortunately, unlike the port quests, you cannot choose to not take the quest on and save it for later.\n\nOverall\nEven though I was gifted a copy of them game, knowing what I know now, I'd have bought this one.  If you enjoy the game's style/theme, and are looking for a fun game that might surprise you, you'll probably enjoy this one!","May 14, 2015","true","3.9"," 40 of 56 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","40","56","2","10"

It is multiplayer, coop and single player.\n\nThis game is one of the few which i have seen utilising the "early access" style to the fullest. The steam-based discussion threads allow for user input and on a half a dozen occaisions in a fortnight, user-imagined content has been added to the game a day or two after being posted. I'm not trying to sell you on the false dream that you'll end up shadow puppetting the dev (heh), but i am rather attempting to demonstrate the developer's willingness to adapt and evolve the game based upon legitimately good ideas.\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and will have you collecting loot in a borderlands-esque style from enemies as random drops and during quests.\n\nThere are tons of features to this game which make it amazing. A useful link for explaining the basics is here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUChfKggqnw\nHowever, there have been DAILY, SUBSTANTIAL updates to the game since its release a few weeks ago, including ship customization and the addition of the ability to be a pirate.\n\nThe game is run on the Unity engine and will run on most PCs at low to mid settings. This game is by no means graphically intensive (although beautiful) through its extensive optimisation (so it wont ♥♥♥♥ your graphics card).\n\n\nThere really is too much for one review to cover. The video above does provide a nice overview of the basic mechanics, but IS 16 OR SO UPDATES OLD.\n\nI Hope this helps.\nSee you on the seas.","October 29, 2014","true","100.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

You're not getting a ship simulator. You don't have to steer with the wind or learn to sail a ship. There is no swordplay. There is no dancing with the Governor's daughter (thank god). You don't need twelve of your friends just to hoist the sails.\n\nThis is not a simulator. What it is, is the best parts of a trading game, naval game and RPG game combined for fun. My kind of fun. The ships move like ships, they take its time to accelerate, they don't stop on a dime, they turn and bow to the side to emulate how ships look. That also means when you shoot, the cannons fire from the side. So you have to learn to show that side to your opponent while... ok you get it. But there's a simplification of every element to just the amusement. You can sail across the entire region and you will have to. There's no teleportation. You can run aground and damage your ship. The captain, the crew, the sails you use, the cannons, the ammo, they all add to your stats. You can get a better ship. You can hire additional ships to fight for your side or bribe them if they don't belong to your faction. And your cargo hold can be use for quests such as ferrying passengers, buying resources low and selling them high and different other missions you can pick up.\n\nTowns around the islands grow in size, sometimes you even get to settle new towns and provide them with lighthouses and guard towers - although this is not a city builder, it just has very light elements from that genre. The needs of the town to you are just a way to make more cash by buying from another town that has more. In the beginning, you start on areas that are controlled by your faction, to eventually struggle on regions were you have little support.\n\nI'm barely into this game, but after 7 hours I think it has me. After venturing into a second region and getting my ♥♥♥ kicked, I went back to the starting region, build up some cash, got a bigger ship and went back. After hiring two allies and bribing a pirate, I went full conquest and won. Of course, if you don't want to start with Exchange (trading is what they're better at) then you can go full pirate as well. Me, I like me gold.\n\nJust so you know, there are no animated characters SimCity-style coming up on your screen to stop the flow of the action. It doesn't feel like a cartoon and I really hope they keep it that way. There's really never any need to put text on the screen alongside some goofy looking comic relief muppet because this is not a pop-up book! You don't need a mission to move. You don't have to move because of a mission. There are no rails except the limits of the region you are in. And there are a lot of regions in just one game.\n\nI will recommend it if you were a fan of the ships of 1701 AD and/or Age of Empires. Or if you wanted to play a less serious version of Port Royale. Or a more serious version of the original Tradewinds. Not that they look alike. Windward is to Tradewinds what the latest version of GTA is to the first version of GTA. This is a fully gorgeous 3D modeled world from the top down isometric perspective. The water does look like water, it shines with the sun, fish swim, seagulls fly overhead, sails puff up. I would add a little waves on the shore but it's really not necessary. It's flawless as it is.\n\nThat will do for now.","February 21, 2015","true","10.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

It's definitely been fun, regardless.\nThe game is definitely best played with friends, otherwise you probably won't have much drive to keep playing past the 10-15 hour mark.\n\nStory: 0/10 - Walked the plank.Nothing here but sharks.\n\nGameplay: 8/10 - Good, but still missing something...Keep in mind that this is definitely designed as a time killer, and as such you'll be repeating *ALOT* of content. Despite that, the game has enough variety in quests and combat to keep you interested.\n\nThe best part about this game is you can legitimately play it effectively in a variety of ways. You can take up quests to deliver supplies/people, hunt down and defeat pirate lords, smuggle supplies, build towns/defenses, etc. Everything nets you experience and gold to advance in the game.\nIf you dont like the idea of combat or questing, you can also become a trader and run around the world(s) buying and selling to get your money and experience.\nAnd if neither of those are for you, you'll still be able to just roam around the world and fight with pirates, factions and other players over control of the worlds regions.\n\nIt's loot system is similar to games like diablo, aka, color code loot quality and number statistics. You'll also find items to customize the coloration of your ship, in addition to being able to buy completely new styles of ships once you find their blueprints and save up enough gold.\n\nThe combat in the game seemingly simple, and for the most part it is. You'll have to rely on proper positioning and the use of your abilities to win or escape any fights you get into.\nYou'll definitely find a new appreciation for naval combat after playing this game.\n\nGraphics: 6/10 Okay.Graphics are definitely where the game is lacking, but it also doesn't need them to be good.\n\nModels: The models are actually well done, for what they are. From the "sloop" to the "clipper", every ship has a unique enough style and quality to it that makes it pleasant to look at, no matter how simple the games graphics are.\n\nTextures: I don't have issues with the textures on the ships, the towns, the towers, water, or anything else... But the ground terrain is definitely lacking. But, since its a game about being a ship captain, that's definitely nothing to worry about. Regardless, you'll notice it from time to time.\n\nEnvironment: I'm not really sure what to say for this... water? There's water. There's alot of water, everywhere. Sometimes there's an island or a continent. It's nothing that makes you joyous and some of the randomly generated maps will likely make you angry, but that's what you have explosive barrels for... It might be costly, but you'll be able to turn that mountain into another few fathoms of ocean.\n\nOverall, for a time killer game, the graphics are exactly what you'd expect and exactly what they need to be, honestly.\n\nSound: 5/10 - Cannons sound like cannons. Every, single, time...I honestly don't know how to describe the sounds. They have no bass to them, so they never really stand out from eachother... any of them.\nThe fire barrels crackle like real fire does, cannons sound like cannons, crew members shout when raiding towns or towers... Without any depth to the sound, it's significantly lackluster.\nI actually stopped playing with the majority of the sound, dropping it to 20% volume and just listening to my own music in the background. The game doesn't sound bad, it just doesn't really have anything I want to hear... especially for the millionth time.\n\nWhat they have "works", but it *DEFINITELY* could be improved.\n\n\nReplay Value: 8/10 - Again! Again!The game has enough content to work towards to keep you going, especially if you're into games that make you grind for really good gear. Regardless, play it in moderation if you want to keep coming back. Finding a few friends to play with helps alot, too.\nYou'll get significantly more longevity out of this game if you treat it like an android or Iphone app. Otherwise, if you're really into pirates, play all day every day.\n\nFinal Thoughts:I've been looking for a "time-killer" game, something really simple to play that can be mastered with a bit of effort. I've also been looking for something that has some social aspect to it, and this satisfies everything I've wanted.\nAs far as socializing in it, it's by no means a game you're going to go into and make a ton of new friends everyday, but you'll definitely be able to convince some people you already know to play with you have and fun together.\n\nThis is a game in the same style as Mount & Blade, it is what you make it. Don't play it to the "beating a dead horse" point and you'll be having mindless fun for a long time.","January 17","true","45.9"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

Your mission is to drive out the pirates and claim the lands for your faction.  The controls are simple and easy to use with a keyboard and mouse.

You can also buy and sell commodities to earn some doubloons and grow the towns.

It's possible to avoid one of them almost entirely.\nLeveling up and choice of faction lets you choose abilities to augment your chosen gameplay style.\nInstancing allows individuals or small teams on even very busy servers to take on fun combat sessions.\nYou keep your ship and stats from game to game, allowing you to jump into a new world and find a place appropriate to your development.\nDynamic scaling of abilities and ships makes combat interesting regardless of what level you are, and where you go in the world. Level simply limits how far into dangerous territory you can reasonably go.\nNeutralGame has no specific goals or end conditions.\nSlow pacing - boats are not quick vehicles, and don't turn on a dime.\nConGameplay never evolves - the same three activities (fighting, trading, questing) follow the basic same pattern in the 20th hour of the game as they did in the 2nd hour of the game.\nGoals are sort of hollow -  you simply acquire wealth and territory until you're bored. There's no story or characters to speak of.\nIf there are too many people on your server, you will constantly have your trading efforts frustrated, since anybody can meet a town's demand for particular goods at any time. You may travel for 10 minutes to discover somebody else sold furs to this town, and now they don't want any.\nBoats have an absurdly small limit on cargo (two or three items depending on the ship), meaning that the game is mostly travel time between friendly ports, where nothing happens. This limitation makes the above problem even worse than it would otherwise be, since there's no room for backup trade goods.\nFor some reason, quests and cargo share slots. That's right. If you have two units of cargo, you can only take one quest. Then your ship is "full".\nSummaryFor me, the dealbreaker was the highly repetitive gameplay. While some may find it "zen" or relaxing, I find it tedious. If you're the kind of player who can spend hours collecting lumber in Minecraft, then maybe you'll enjoy this.

I can say after reaching "end game" it was unreplayable\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is a casual game where you could either focus on trading or battling pirates.\n\n-Combat-\nThe fighting is simplistic, you point your broadside of your ship against his ship all the while trying to get behind him so he can't point his gun to you.This is your "standard attacks"but is enhanced by new abilities, such as a Fire Barrel(Grogolov Cocktail) that does AOE fire damage;A Water Barrel that does AOE Heal to friendlies.\n\n-Combat-Items-\nItems have stats that enhance your combat capabilities.There are Damage,Range,and Accuracy for hitting your targets.Then there are Sails,Hull,Mobility,and Speed to Avoid/Take Damage.\n\n-Trading-\nTrading at a new region first involves taking over towns from pirates in a region. Buying abundant resources for cheap and selling it at other towns with high demand.Occasionally you get Quests for making a new town, and you get to name it, which is half the fun of making the town.More towns increases more Demand and Supply for a region. Potentially making more Profitable runs and cities become more closer to each other.\n\n-Trading-Items-\nImportant stats for trading are Diplomacy,Speed,Cargo Space,and Maybe Mobility(Turn rate of a ship).Diplomacy gives you better prices for buying and selling goods.Speed should be obvious, but Mobility is dependant on your map layout.\nCargo space are slots on your ship.The more slots you have, the more quest/trading you can do simultaneously.\n\n-Ship types-\nThere are ships for Combat,Trading or Both, you start with a fairly small ship.You Progress up by buying a ship with hardearned gold. If you plan to fight pirates, a high offence and/or defence ship is good.Trading would require either a Speed Ship or a huge cargo space amount. Both is just having Average stats of Offence,Defence,Speed,and Cargo Space.\n\n-Replayability-\nWhen you reach the so-called endgame, there is almost nothing else to do anymore.

It's pretty simple. It's very repetitive, grindy and trying to capture zones from the AI without help is like a re-enactment of the first landing on the bug planet in Starship Troopers. Also, loot is only really obtained via combat, specifically farming/grinding your butt off. Some loot is so ridiculously over-powered that you will be blown to bits in no time flat in PVP even if you manage to get your hands on the two most powerful ships in the game (outside the special design ship). That brings me to the other sore point: PVP itself.\n\nIf you play on a public server, you can be attacked even if you have the no-PVP special item (which you don't start with, by the way, you need to find it) by players who farm up the Black Flag that lets them join the Pirate faction. You are not safe anywhere from these people. These people have joined "instances" I've been in and proceeded to farm everyone in it driving everyone else out. They can also sail into newbie zones with near impunity killing everyone in sight. The reason is because of the item imbalances and the fact that the insane farming needed (I'm told) to get the special item that lets them join the Pirate faction in the first place has given these people pretty much every skill unlock, tons of gold, every ship they want and probably Legendary quality everything. It's like in World of Warcraft, having a person in full top-tier PVP epics walking into a newbie starting zone and start slaughtering except there are no NPC guards to worry about.\n\nNot really much fun to be fodder for the e-peens of angry adolescents in a game where PVP is supposed to be consensual if you have the item that gives you that option. It begs me to wonder why it exists if a certain group of players, the ones that you DON'T want to be able to bypass it, can bypass it and grief until their victims all flee the zone/instance/server.\n\nEdit - June 7 - The developers seem to have listened to the opinions of people of like mind to myself and have made changes to the game to make it less combat-focused and make it possible to get some gear outside of combat.

I consider it a hidden gem in the sea of stink that can be early access.\n\nI've got almost 4 hours in to this game at the time of this review.  Very visually pleasing and laid back game so far.  A lot of time spent ferrying cargo, hunting and sinking pirates, looting crates, and setting up new guard towers or towns.  Certainly not a twitch shooter though the combat does use some strategy so you can't just expect to go in guns blazing after early on.\n\nI recommend this as it stands now as it has been very stable and I haven't had any issue with crashes or bugs standing out.

Let's get this review rolling by getting a few things out of the way from the git-go.\n\n1) This game is billed as an adventure-sandbox title.\n\n2) This game relies upon repetitive, simple tasks.\n\n3) This game has some beautiful scenery and aesthetics.\n\nOkay, with that out of the way, you're going to fall into one of two camps. Those camps are the 'I love this game!' and the 'I tried to like this game and I ended up wasting a handful of hours trying to like this game,' And that's fine. You have your tastes and your preferences. I'll be writing this review from the aspect of the latter camp, having tried to be a member of the former camp.\n\nWhat Windward tries and (arguably) fails to present you with is an in-depth naval combat/economy simulation, top-down with nice graphical appeal. Where it fails is the 'in-depth' aspect with its 'bounce your ship back and forth between towns for hours' mentality, you may begin to ponder the value of your time. Unfortunately, because of this, it's not a game that I would say is fun if you want to just 'jump in for a few minutes' but instead is probably a far more playable game from the sphere of 'play a few hours at a time and save your game progress'.\n\nEach and every faction tries to offer a special ability or focus that, after the first couple of hours, you don't even really think about anymore. And that is because each faction does the same things, with the same ships, but with one of four different color options. In the end, you may decide to restart simply because you want to play as your preferred color rather than for any 'faction specialty' reasons. In fact, one of my biggest problems with this game is that your sail embroidery is stuck as the color of your team. Frankly, that just pisses me off.\n\nAll this being said, I did play the game and I may continue to play it, and since I work a decent job the price tag isn't a deal-breaker either (especially on sale!).\n\nBut let me bring up another point, the game's aesthetics; they're pretty damn cool. I like the wind and sunlight effects. I like the way my sails creak and the mast groans and the wind buffets my ship around. That's cool stuff right there, and that little detail here and that other little detail there--that is what makes me want to play this game, and makes my little voice in the back of my head say, 'This game sure is neat--but we've been bouncing back and forth in this same square block of the map for hours now...'\n\nTrust me. It'll happen, if you're any sort of gamer with an adult life and an adult schedule.\n\nInterestingly enough about the 'sandbox' descriptor...is it? I mean it's got that basic random-map-generator thing right? But what does it honestly matter, when you're going to essentially be setting up some variety of chess board squares, slowly trying to build up the first block so you can move to a second block and begin again, grinding and bouncing around inside the map block of various islands/waterways in an attempt to stymie the flow of rabbit-like spawning pirate ships. (Oh god, the pirate ships...)\n\nThe game seems to aim big. It's got a lot of polish. But it's shots fall short of their target. In fact, now that I think about it...\n\n...the game designer(s) have a lot in common with the in-game crew of my Sloop-O-War.","May 17, 2015","false","39.5"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

Windward takes the joy and addiction of a game like Banished, gives you simple controls, a ship, and a procedurally generated world and with just the sound of your sails in the wind drops you in to your first map.\n\nNormally what would follow in a review is something about how I invested X amount of hours and did A, B, C, and saw J and almost crapped my pants. I'm not going to bore you with minutiae, as more importantly that will give you information that you should learn by playing the game.\n\nWhat I am going to tell you, is that I jumped the gun and paid the 15 dollars for Windward, started the game, and didn't log off for 13 hours. I played 9 of those hours co-op with my partner, and I have to say this is by far the best unit of entertainment per dollar game I have bought in YEARS.\n\nIf you look at the discussion threads, you can see the developer actively speaking with players and even including community suggestions in to the game (Diving Suit!) which means if you play Windward and want to see something or change something, your voice is likely to be heard.\n\nTL;DR Spend the 15 bucks. You spend at least 15 dollars to go to the movies with your friends, and this investment will give you an incredible return that lasts much longer than 2 or 2 and a half hours. DO IT!\n\nAlso, Michael Lyashenko, thank you for creating such a wonderful and beautiful game.","February 14, 2015","true","39.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","15","21","2","0"

Trade, questing, and exploration are indeed present, but serve to fund the player's upgrades; you will not be playing this game as a merchant, diplomat, or explorer. That said, if you do enjoy naval combat and aren't averse to a challenge, you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe developer claims to have taken inspiration from Sid Meier's Pirates!, and anyone who has played any of the releases of Pirates! will definitely notice some of the influence. I'd personally classify the game as an improved successor; the game took everything that was fun about Pirates!, strips away the tedious things that no one liked (we're looking at you, dancing.), and improved on some things that had potential but weren't explored, such as trade. This is probably why the game is so oriented towards combat, as Pirates! was as a whole about you sailing around being a scurvy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Except now you can have giant multiple ship brawls where crap is exploding left and right and everything is on fire.\n\nThe game itself follows your regular RPG sort of formula; kill things, gain experience, upgrade skills, and search for good loot. There are four playable factions, but aren't very different aside from some minor gimmicks. The world is split up into multiple procedurally generated regions, with enemies becoming stronger the further you venture from where the playable factions start. Those four factions start with a region they control and a couple that they hold part of, and the rest of the world is infested with pirates. Unless you're playing online, your faction will be the only one to ever advance beyond where they start, and you will spend most of your time fighting pirates. Inter-faction warfare is a thing, and you can contest other factions for control of a region, but I haven't figured out the purpose as of yet. Your end goal is supposedly to help your faction take over the world, but I have no idea what actually happens if you do.\n\nCombat is, again, the largest part of the game, but I found it to be the funnest. Fights are largely tactical affairs, usually with you sailing into range and your crew automatically firing at enemy ships with standard cannon fire while you fire off skills at the enemy. Multiple ships can enter and leave a fight, and whether you're engaged in a fight is guaged based on proximity to hostile ships and towers. The AI, which I'll address in a moment, does come to back both you and the enemy up, but only within a certain distance. In single player, this can turn skirmishes into full battles just to take a harbor, and that capacity for fluid battles is part of the appeal that combat has. The game scales rather well, so unless you sail to the lower level areas with higher level gear (and there's an option in world creation to force high level gear to get scaled for an area) or you try to rush too far ahead, you'll never too over or underpowered.\n\nThe game is not without its lackluster components though. Despite advertising diplomacy, trade, and exploration as options, they're not as prevalent as you would think. Diplomacy exists in the form of quests, which usually revolve around delivering stuff, killing something, or building new towns or defenses, and the only real benefit is gold and increasing the size of a town. Trade is a regular buy low and sell high deal. Exploration is just lifting the fog of war; there's no relics to be hunting for or anything. The AI is also a bit strange, with it usually backing me up pretty well but sometimes acting as if the pirate sloop currently taking over the nearby port isn't something it should intervene in. So far I've chalked that up to expected instability an overall effective AI. My biggest gripe is that you're thrown into the game to sink or swim; no tutorial, or even a quick brief on controls. Thankfully everything is rather simple and a guide does exist outside of the game, but a little guidance before sending me to take on every pirate in the entire ocean would be nice.\n\nAs for graphics and sound, gorgeous and fitting. The varying biomes each have their own graphics styles, and the models of the ships look great. The extra effects such as explosions or fires look nice, and they give a real feeling of weight to the carnage you're unleashing on the ocean. The graphics are a bit more artsy than realistic, but everything fits together really well. The music gives off a feeling off a nice feeling of adventure, and the sound effects are on point for everything. You will enjoy every single time a ship blows up, whether its yours or someone else's.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty nice game for what it is. I'm not sure of the developer's plans, but hopefully it will make trade and diplomacy more important and make the AI a little smarter. It's a good mix of RPG and... Whatever Pirates! was, and it's addictingly fun at that. I recommend getting it while it's still on sale, you should be getting your money's worth.","May 14, 2015","true","9.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

Yes, on the whole quests and other things feel like the same things over and over again. However, there's a strange allure to the game that makes it addicting. It is so incredibly serene, calm and relaxing.\n\nAlso, I think it's quite swell that connecting to a friend's game is so much easier, AND actually works, now that I've tried it a few months after putting this down. Playing with friends is probably where the most fun lies, and now that it is so much easier to do rather than finding a server, this makes this game a more enticing prospect for me now.\n\nI just wish this game got better review scores than it had, ultimately. Thankfully, on the whole the Steam community has been mostly receptive to this game. At least 4 of the friends I have spoken to have really liked this game, and played it for hours on end.\n\n=================================================================\nWith Windward now out of Early Access, this review deserved an overhaul.\n\nWindward is an incredibly awesome ship sailing, questing and trading RPG game, this has been compared very favourably with games like Sid Meier's Pirates. There's so much to do - sail across the seas to towns, claim said towns in your name (claim a majority of the towns in order to claim the region for your faction), fight pirates (and on occasion other faction ships), do quests for the town to help them grow...and as you progress you can upgrade your ship and skills to make you even more powerful in combat. Or whatever it is that you choose to specialise in, anyway (you can change it if you want, though).\n\nWhile it was in Early Access, I felt the game was way too good for Early Access. Thankfully, other players and the developer could see through the game's shortcomings, and a boatload of new features were shipped out to the game between the start of Early Access and the official game launch in May. The current version of Windward at release feels a lot better than when I played it a few months back. (Incidentally, I apologise for the ship puns. It's arrrrr rather infectious trend.)\n\nIn-between Early Access and game release, there have been a few (that's a gross understatement) interface changes and game mechanic tweaks so the game is much easier to follow. Instances, one of the most recent additions, creates a region appropriate to your ship level - a fun and challenging distraction that, when farmed properly, can be incredibly profitable. Of course, it is even better with friends/on a multiplayer server - high level Heroic instances make the pirate enemies drop VERY good loot. This is where Windward REALLY shines - it is all about the player interaction and cooperation on these online servers.\nWhat was already good about the game though is the combat, the quests, and the music (which dynamically changes depending on whether you are in combat or not).\n\nI only really have 2 gripes regarding the game. The physics occasionally feels wonky and sometimes my ship gets stuck in an odd situation...then explodes in a raging fireball. I understand though this is due to the quirkiness of Unity, so not much that can be done. However, Unity should not be knocked (so much, anyway) - this really looks stunningly beautiful.\n\nMy other gripe is something that can easily be fixed with high-level friends - if you're trying to do it solo, you're going to have a hard time. One of the achievements requires you to drive pirates out of a level 13 (39 talent points) region - chances are you likely won't have strong enough equipment if you were playing it solo. Leveling it up in order to better combat them may at times feel too grindy (however, the satisfaction of sinking the pirates overshadows that for me).This is where Heroic or high-level instances and a couple of powerful friends saves the day - farm these instances for the high-level equipment then return to the level 13 region and decimate the pirates.\n\nDeveloper ArenMook is one of the friendliest, most helpful and hardworking devs around. He actually comes into the servers to play with us mere mortals, ahem, sailors - and regularly pushes out bugfixes, game updates, all kinds of updates. You can't get any better customer service than that!\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this game is the closest I can get to living out my Somalian Pirate Fantasies™, for those who know me. Download size is surprisingly (and pleasantly) small, and it runs great even on low-spec computers. Highly recommended.\n\nWhen to buy: Launch week 15% discount would be a good opportunity to pick it up. Buy a four-pack and play the game with 3 like-minded friends. You'll probably end up sinking a lot of time (and pirates...okay, enough ship puns. I'm sorry.) into it for it to be worth the cost - it's just that fun.\n\n9.5/10\n\nLike indie games?

Pirates lacked multiplayer and was clearly tailored for young audiences. It was a game I got bored with extremely fast. Windward brushes off the Pirate dust and makes way for a whole lot of improvements. I find the faction system in Windward extremely fun to play around with. You start to have a faction grow on you and you genuinely start to get to know the other players playing for your faction and the enemy factions. The way the game plays promotes a sense of community that is lacking in a lot of faction-based games. I played the game with a friend throughout my entire play experience. It provided a ton of laughs and some intense moments for us. The PVE challenged us. The PVP made us want revenge. Our homeland was being stolen by the Valient. We started to fight back as hard as we could, but some of their players were a far higher level than us. We picked off small ships while dodging and outrunning their behemoths. Armadas of Valient players would chase after us, but we specialized in speed, mobility, and guerrilla tactics. The game was extremely fun, but I don't think it has enough content to keep us going much longer. This could be improved if more abilities are added, more things to do when not fighting, and extension of faction systems. I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a short MMO-like experience with their friends. It is definitely worth the $15 for what it provides.

Each one has its own philosophy (war/trade/exploration/quests). I've only tried the fighting one so far and I really don't regret my choice! The combats are just crazy fun. Fire and (pretty) explosions everywhere... Of course even though I'm part of the most violent faction I can still trade, do quests or explore if I feel like it.\n\nAnother thing I like a lot is that it already has tons of differents items (of different qualities represented by colors like in most loot-oriented games nowadays). You have 10ish slots (cannon, cannon ball, captain, crew, hull, sail, special item, specialist, ...). It kinda plays like an hack & slash game mixed with a real time strategy game. Random loot, fast paced battles against pirates and other factions, capturing their towns and towers,...\n\nThere is also an experience system with a skill tree to fill. Lots of passive skills that up your attributes (damage, accuracy, defense, speed, .....) and very helpful active skills (incendiary and poisonous bomb, ice thingie you throw in the water to make fog so you can hide in it (!!!), and a few others).\n\nI've only played alone so far and I'm already having tons of fun. But I think where the game might clearly shine in the future is within it's multiplayer mode. So far it's only direct connect, but the way the game is designed, I'm really optimistic on how it will evolve.\n\nI was hesitant before I bought it but it turns out to be a very good surprise.","November 10, 2014","true","62.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

I'm not sure how to describe it; it feels similar to how I imagine an open-world version of Sid Meier's Pirates would play.\n\nAt the time of this review, it is scheduled to transition from early access into the first release version within the month, and I'd say the foundation of the game is solid.  It will need upkeep to reach full potential, but it's a delight even in this most basic state, well-polished and beautifully presented.\n\nTour a randomly-generated world, or one of your own design, forge alliances and save the world from the pirate-infested seas--or join them!  I'd love to say more here, I really would, but words fail me.  Try it and bring a friend or ten along for much more fun.  Before you know it, you'll have sailed your entire day away, too.\n\n\n[Addendum - The Long Version]\nAs I feel this description tells very little, I would like to use this space to ramble a bit on the game's atmosphere alone.  This, I believe, is the most important attraction about it and I am forced to cite examples of other games here to make my point.  Please both excuse and indulge me.\n\nImagine a world like Minecraft, or your first days in a Civilization game, where the peaceful tempo of the world becomes the experience.  You step into it with a desire to create and grow, to build something magnificent, but the environment gently abducts you along the way.  You continue your quest, of course, unwittingly sedated by the roll of illusionary waves and a pointed lack of urgency.  You have all the time in the world.\n\nLike Minecraft, you will spend a great deal of time empowered to voyage on alone or with non-player escorts, but welcoming friends into your world has an allure of its own.  Even if each of you play independently, your ships passing one another breathes a sense of pleasant familiarity and kinship, knowing that if trouble strikes, you have a reliable ally at your side.  You need not travel together to build a world together and as your world accumulates that real flesh-and-blood population, it comes to life.  I use our familiar voxel friend as a baseline because it articulates the very same experience so well.\n\nYou come here to create a world and consequently, rather unexpectedly, you become simply a resident of it.  It's a glorious experience and well-executed.  It is my hope that the authors will nurture and develop their creation for years to come.\n\nAll of this and I have not even touched on the compelling combat system and the fun of instanced raids and dread pirate conquests.  That part I leave you to discover for yourself.  Go on, then.  You will not be disappointed.","May 10, 2015","true","46.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

More often than not, they will leave you to die as they inspect a nearby palm tree ("Yeah, I can take those 5 pirate ships. You go ahead and check for coconuts.")

Playing as a tank with a bunch of friends playing dps and support is a boatload of fun.

It has the classic "just ten more minutes" that i had with sid meier's pirates! It appeals to a larger audience however, as the game does not have a time limit imposed on you, thus allowing you to play to your preferences whether becoming a trade magnate or pirate hunter extrordinare. The varied environment brought on by the differing climate regions is refreshing instead of the sub-tropic carribbean often seen in games of this genre. I would argue that the idea of it being an RPG is more a loose term in that you change captains and aspects of the ship to increase stats. I would like to keep the change ship items to improve the ship to be kept as is and the captains tool chest is a fantastic idea. However, if I make a captain i would like to see a leveling system where by doing certain actions improves certain stats, so for instance sailing around improves speed and maneouverability, combat improves accuracy. certain stats would need to be allocated to physical items so cannons & shot improve damage and accuaracy, where as combat only improves accuracy and reload time as a crew matures and gains stats along with their salty captain. If the idea of changing captain or crew is to be kept then maybe a "familiarity" penalty could be implimented to offset the immediate bonus obviously as a crew and captain become familiar with each other then they work better together eventually becoming a well oiled machine. finially I would say maybe improving on faction identity where each faction has unique ships of the period. so maybe exchange being latin origin, valiant being anglo-frank, consulate asian and sojourn aribic/eastern med; this would mean that to access the best ships of other factions then you must conquer/trade at high end levels with other factions. I digress from a proper review. essentially the developer has created a gem of a title with few negative points, i thoroghly recommend for anyone who played Pirates! and anyone who is new to the genre.","December 15, 2014","true","56.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Of course pvp is also included.\n\nDon't feel like fighting then try your luck in numerous trade runs and diplomacy missions like creating a new settlement setting up defence & light towers for the numerous towns around the map.\n\nUsually I'm not much of a RPG mmo player. With the exception of STO I never really bothered about that as I dislike the whole concept of that. Still in this case I guess I can make an exception. In my opinion this game offers something for anyone. If you knew games like seafight1&seafight2 and you liked those titles then you will like this one here. It's very similar but x10 better.\n\n+RPG styled game\n+Lovely graphics\n+11 ships you can buy each serving a different role\n+Upgrade able ships (your crew, sails, captain, cannons in form of items - etc.)\n+Very nice and helpful community\n+Well explained beginners guide on their steam page\n+ Numerous climate zones (nice eye candy) with different effects on the goods towns produce and their demands etc\n+Map editor that allows you to define how large your map gonna be or how many factions you fight up against.\n+SP + MP game modes.\n+Everything is free no pay2win or pay2play concept.\n\n-Nice music but slightly repetitive after some while some more tracks wouldn't hurt\n-The Islands itself are rather doll and could use some animated animal life. Perhaps some crabs roaming around the beaches, sea shells sitting there etc.. Knights&Merchants used to have something like that it was kinda nice.\n-After some while you discovered most of the available missions and the game turns repetitive. There's lot of potential for additional missions.\n\nAll in all a well made and solid game go and get it people.","May 17, 2015","true","25.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Also Pretty lame to fight so long to capture a region for it to be contested 10 minutes later?Where is the booty!!! for all the hard work put into taking a region being actively defended. Make the region give bonuses to factions the more the faction owns the better the rewards in materials or something!. Also when a region if freshly captured or successfully defended make the CD longer before it can be contested again 3+ Hours at least to allow people to benefit from it.\n\nPlayer Owned Groups: Guilds,Corporations,Clans, Alliances!!!

As you progress the challenges get much harder to the point that even with a maxed out ship you will still need help. Multiplayer is both PvE and PvP.

(shipment/passanger transport/hunt a pirate/...)\n- If you do shipment or quests you receive reputation at that faction.\n- The reputation improves the quest/products/hints which you can receive.\n- The ship can be improved with items from inventory and can be custumized!\n- Random loots on the see.\n- And of course there is a see fight as well. With pirates or with other faction, this is a BIG FUN.\n- Ok the combat is simple but fast and it can turn to a huge war, due to the other ships may join, choosing a side depending on your reputation.\n- And of course the received XP can be spent to improve abilities, like better aim/faster movement/better durability... So lots of possibilities!\n\nIt is a great game, big fun.

It is a bit like crossing Sid Meier's Pirates! with an action RPG loot system. Crates and barrels float around giving you loot. They appear randomly but also when ships sink more appear. You can buy various types of loot in town - most of which add to your stats or even gives you new abilities.\n\nThe game is a time sink. It starts off a little slowly where you do some trading just to get some initial cash. Once that is done you can upgrade towns by completing quests or selling items that town needs. This will unlock better ships for you to purchase. There is also a huge randomly generated map to conquer. Plus the game has full mulitplayer! Yet even if you are in multiplayer you can create your own instance while on the server, invite friends who are also on the server to join you, and complete quests for even more loot! Reclaim an area from some pirates or make a trading/quest instance and sail to your heart's content. Suddenly it will be 6am and you won't be quite sure where the last 12 hours have gone.\n\nIn short if you like pirate games, like loot based games, enjoy single player OR multiplayer, then get this little gem!

It has some issues, but what game doesn't?\n\nThe lack of a tutorial is kind of lame, so you spend the first hour clicking on everything randomly. The game is pretty straight forward once you get the layout figured out.\n\nThe visuals are nice, but kind of looks like it was intended for console; having full controller support makes me wonder even more.\nThe control scheme is very basic, which is nice for time when you just want to lean back and not worry about the keyboard for a while, controlling most basic functions with just the mouse. Its a beer sipping game at times :)\nCombat requires both hands lol\n\nCombat is fun, though, dizzying at times from spinning circles around enemies; keeping them on your side for your broadside attacks.\nNot only can you destroy pirates, but you can also capture thier ships and add them to your AI driven team/ floatilla.\n\nThe game has an RPG style talent tree to make different builds for different styles of play (Think Borderlands skill trees).\nLots of different colors and emblems to pimp your ship and sail out with.\nYou equip items to your ship like it is your character, like new sails to go faster, armor to protect you from damage, crew to make you better at shooting enemies, etc. All i nall, theres 10-12 items you equip on your ship, then 4 vanity slots for 3 colors and an emblem. The equipable items are typical rarity leveled (White, green, blue, etc.)\n\nI'm only about 5 hours into the game, so I've only seen the ability to buy 4 different ships, though the videos I've watched show way different ships than what I have available, leaving me to safely assume there is more ships as you progress through the "character" levels, and find bigger towns.\n\nThe quests the towns provide are fun, but run into the problem of not being varried enough after a few maps: Place a turret here, ferry these people here, buy this stock and make a profit here, and a handful of other pirate elimination/ capture quests. There are lots of random quest drops that add a little flavor into the game, though usually its just bring this scroll you found to this place for a few resources and/or money.\n\nThe music is good enough to not be too distracting while playing, where as the sound effects are needed to be turned down for WHAT?! lol jk The sound effects/ ambient sound is great, but a little on the loud side when using headphones.\n\nThe worlds you play on are sectioned out by level, so you know where to avoid.

And 17th century means Sloops, Galleons and Frigates.\n\nYou control one ship as you fight pirates and other factions for dominance in cells in an overall map. Capturing all towns and defeating all enemies pacifies the cell and allows you to proceed into the next harder one.\n\nProgression is marked by skill tree, equipment and ship variety.\n\nSkills are seperated into defence, offence and support. Defence involves defensive buffs and abilities such as damage resistance, in combat repairs and speed. Offence involves attack buffs and abilities such as AOE attacks and damage buffs. Support involves accuracy, diplomacy and miscellaneous abilities and buffs.\n\nFriendly towns have quests which involves transport, trade, creating new towns and structures, town defence and hunting enemies. A large basis of the game is completing quests and trading which not only will reward the player with resources and currency but also will improve the prosperity of the town and raise the quality of equipment and ships on sale.\n\nThe gameplay and control are straight forward and all information is provided to player. No hunting through wikis for essential knowledge of game.\n\nBeing a sandbox, you can customise the layout of the map (the cells themselves are procedurally generated so you cannot create you own custom landmasses), the factions themselves and names of towns.\n\nNow, there are set backs to this game.\n\nWindward is clearly designed for multiplayer in mind, but the online multiplayer scene is lacking. Windward needs a group of friends willing to play for a night or two. Hypothetically you could play this single player (and I have) but it will get dull real fast.\n\nWindward is 100% sandbox. The game goes on for as long as you play. There is no plot or main quest. You make your own goals and fun.\n\nThe act of taking over a cell without human opposition will get dry very quickly. Once again, a mark against the lack of online scene. I cannot stress how much of a shame it is that this is not popular enough to have a large online presence because I would think a wide scale sea warfare in a map is incredibly capable but hasn't been made possible.\n\nThe game also implies that there are non combat routes to this game. Not realistically possible. I would like to see more of a variance in the scope of offensive capabilities as the entire diplomacy/support tree is not supported by how the game actually operates.\n\nThe late game ships choices essentially ask if you want more damage or more health and that's all the variance you will get and the early game ships are just moderate improvements on your previous one.\n\nAnd lastly, I made reference to this being inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates. To clarify, this game is definately not Sid Meier's Pirates. The way the ships handle and how combat operates is a reasonable comparison as well as the 17th century ships, but the entire game and how it operates is entirely different.\n\nIt's a neat game. Worth a bunch of friends passing time and maybe possibly one day, a server could get popular enough to get the true nature of the game fleshed out. Because then it would be promoted from neat game to great game.","June 14, 2015","true","52.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

You sail around countless regions, plundering towns and converting them to your allegience. Once you drive off all the pirates, you're free to sail around, performing quests and gathering gold. Every so often you'll find some lost cargo floating around that's yours for the taking. Just as with any enemy though, the pirates will eventually return and you get the taste of battle once again.\n\nQuests you can do are numerous in quantity, always being replenished by each town. You can ferry passengers to neighboring towns, drop off/pick up supplies, take a few drunken townsmen on a sightseeing trip, hunt down rogue pirates, convert pirates to fly your banner, etc. The amount of quests available are too many to list.\n\nThe sailing controls arent perfect, but they're very well done. You actually feel as if you're sailing around, subject to the laws of physics as in real life. The game does this by adding an inertia factor with turning and stopping, and other ways that must be experienced first hand.\n\nThere is a working market with upgrades and materials for sale. Work towards advancing to the largest ship available and customize your ship to fit your needs. You can change your ship's color, sails, emblem, hull, etc. When you first start off the game, you're also able to choose your allegience which comes with unique perks.\n\nAll in all, windward is a great sandbox game with a lot to do. You can create many worlds of various sizes and explore all the regions available in them. Singleplayer is fun, multiplayer is great, and the combination of visuals and music makes for a relaxing time.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing and playing this game.","June 23, 2015","true","13.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Relaxing, especially in the lower level areas.\n\nThe first zone was almost entirely at peace. There were a few pirates to dispatch, but once they were gone, the only other I could encounter pirates there was when I took a mission to hunt one down. Pretty much what you would expect for any MMO starting zone. Enough to get your toes wet, but not enough to overwhelm you.\n\nThe second zone opens at level three, although you may want to consider putting off going there until level 5 at least. When you arrive, you cannot do any trading until the zone has been taken from the pirates that are trying to control it. This is basically a small capture the flag event, combined with blasting pirates. Take out pirates and towers, find a captured town or lighthouse, and park up next to it. That's all you need to do to capture it, which will change the allegiance of the town to your own.\n\nOnce the zone has been cleared of pirates, trade becomes possible, although be careful. After a while, a small pirate fleet will arrive and try to take the zone back.\n\nWell, that's about as far as I've got, but it is a thoroughly enjoyable game, and I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of it.\n\n\nEdit:\nI had a technical problem, where I couldn't create worlds or join them. Basically made the game unplayable. But, the technical support was brilliant. Mine was an odd problem which ended up having nothing to do with the game itself, but rather one of the Steam DLLs. Michael (the developer) was of great help in finding and fixing the problem with contact and new ideas each day until it was resolved.","May 14, 2015","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

WindwardIn a Nutshell\nWindward is the nautical brainchild of lone developer Michael Lyanshenko and if you are looking for a polished indie gem, then I think you've found it. In this procedurally generated world you sail about and take on tasks of your own choosing. These range from defeating NPC rivals, PVP rivals, questing, building, trading, exploring, customizing and leveling your craft. You choose how much of each, where you go and what you want to do. You can do this equally well solo or with others, and the merits of each are different but related so that neither is mutually exclusive. The transitions between single and multiplayer games are seamless, and you can allow your RL pals to join your single player game or not, and even open custom shared instances within your solo game. You can play on a public server or create your own server with your own world built to your specifications if you want to have a more permanent multiplayer world to plunder in. One ship. Many worlds. Lot's of cannon balls. So let's get on to the bullet-points...\n\nThe game looks and sounds great. The graphics are uncluttered and modestly simplified but evoke the setting very well. Timbers creak, fires burn, sails shred from chainshot and hulls list as you careen through combat. The water has detailed reflections; so much so that you can see the reflected sails of the pirate vessels just before the ship itself comes into view. Cloud reflections show the direction and speed of the wind, and lighting impacts how deeply you can see in the water which affects your ability to spot sunken wrecks to plunder.\n\nRandomly generated worlds with parameters that you may control if you want. Determine the size, layout, factions, difficulty, world name, and environmental flavors.\n\nQuickly travel across a map to reach a new region, or do so even more quickly (Travel) if you have already discovered the destination region.\n\nSolo play is fun with a large variety of quests and quest types. Pick up and deliver, build, escort, seek-and-destroy bounties, dangerous smuggling runs, expansion, sight-seeing, and securing/capturing towns are a few of the types. Despite what some multiplayer purists might say, this Diablo/Path of Exile/Drox Operative fan is totally satisfied with the solo play.\n\nSimilarly, multiplayer gives you the same options but with the added dynamic of having fleets of your pals with you control the seas. This, I understand, is the primary way that the dev envisioned the game and it works well. Granted, if you get on a server with jerks you'll have a jerk experience like any such situation. So...\n\nYou can make a single player game and have your friends join it through the Steam Friends list, which should cut out the jerk factor (unless your friends are jerks, then I gues, deal with it.)\n\nDabble in both solo and multiplayer. The transition between each is simple and cohesive.\n\nDive into sunken wrecks and score long lost loot...\n\nor plunder treasure from pirates & towns and floating crates about the world..\n\nor buy goods from port towns if excitement isn't your thing.\n\nUpgrade all aspects of your ship, and upgrade the ship itself. Play to your style; large, slow powerful and with a big hull and guns to match, or a sleek slash of a craft where speed and agility deliver your shots and help you explore.\n\nIf combat isn't your thing, arm yourself for defense and focus on trading and diplomacy to build your vessel.\n\nMove on to the next region when YOU feel ready. Quests and pirates spawn in relation to your presence in the region so stay as long as you want. Sure, the dangers are greater in that higher level region just across the sea... but so are the rewards.\n\nGrow cities by questing and working toward their prosperity, then reap the benefits with better rewards and larger ships for sale at that port. Yes, you may rename cities as well.\n\nRespec your vessel for gold. You're looting it anyway, so go, live a little.\n\nCosmetic upgrades too! Change your sail and hull colors and the design (embroidery) on your sail, as well as the basic frame of your ship that changes as you buy/upgrade to new higher-level craft.\n\nBored with your faction? None of the other three starting-factions or two (at this time) unlockable factions seem like your cup of ale? Turn brigand and fly the black. Smuggle and pillage until your former allies turn tail or sink beneath the waves. Piracy can be a hoot. A bloody, fiery hoot.\nSummary\nWindward is a fun, theme-rich, polished, and beautiful marriage of open-world/multiplayer/and action RPG with an underserved, though oft-attempted, theme of piracy in the age of sail. Windward gets it right in a satisfying and enjoyable way. I whole-heartedly recommend this game for anyone who is interested in a less-frenetic ARPG with solid multiplayer trappings and a nautical theme. Also, you can take some drunken landlubbers on a cruise and show them a bit of battle after which they will pay you a larger bonus upon their return to harbor, so there's that too.\n\nHappy hunting,\nM13","June 22, 2015","true","10.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm playing as a military faction (red), so I've been pretty much trying to wipe piracy off the map... before I join the pirates and take it all back (I've got my black flag stored and I'm just waiting until the map is all mine). It's been fun as I take towns away from opposing forces and run missions to grow them in size. I'm currently the proud owner of a frigate, and I'm getting curb-stomped by hordes of pirates in what I assume is a man-of-war on the upper levels. This game also doesn't like to just give you tons of money, so you're going to need to plan your next ship upgrade with some questing and/or exploration. I'm finding just grabbing floating debris, and sinking ships (mostly to collect their floating debris) is pretty rewarding, but the game mentions if you're a shrewd trader, you can earn faster.\n\nIt's kind of RPG-esque as you try to upgrade your fighting style (or exploring style, or merchant style) of your ship. My ship is taking on much more powerful vessels with tons more HP simply because I've learned what strategies work for me (that said, the game seems to be punishing you for daring to take on tougher maps later if you haven't grown enough). It doesn't dial back the difficulty (unless you want to dial it back, I left it at default settings), and you're going to end up turning tail and bailing out for calmer seas and better upgrades.\n\nADD: If you're wondering what an "epic item" is in the achievements, I found a dive-helmet that allows you to pull "treasure" (usually just gun power, wood and stone) from the bottom (it was in a level 21 part of the map).","May 22, 2015","true","59.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

Windward offers players the chance to captain their own ship, improve upon towns, expand their territory, complete quests and carry out various other activities.\n\nAt the start of the game it can seem like a grand and it is, undoubtedly, best played in a multiplayer environment. The games depth opens up further and further as you can progress. Initially it can seem like a grind and information on how various mechanics work and the stats of the initial factions aren't obvious, however, once you get into the game and really sink your teeth into it, it is an absolute joy to play and I'm personally finding it highly addictive.\n\nI look forward to the future development of this title and to see what else the dev's will add.","May 18, 2015","true","29.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The best thing I've played in a long time.\n\nBasically, your ship is your 'guy'. You equip items to improve your stats, and you get skill points to, of course, get skills and also improve stats. And you can upgrade to better ship types, each of which are pretty well balanced.\n\nIf you want to play casual, it's a relaxing, beautiful place to roam, with great ambiance. There are simple quests to complete for experience, money, and basic resources. Everything is just pretty and nice.\n\nIf you want action, move into another area and battle waves of pirates, or go online and play PvP.\nCombat is simple, but gets deeper as you gain abilities and better items, and can get hectic with multiple units fighting in an area.\n\nDifficulty is totally scalable.  Skills can be remaped for a price.  Factions can be changed, so you're never locked-in to a play-style.\n\nThe few bugs that have poped-up get fixed immediately by the developer.\nSeriously, usually the same day they get reported.\n\n\nProbably the only down-side is that the progression can be slow at the beginning. If you have A.D.D., you definitely won't have the patience to build up at the start.\n\nGet a Schooner as soon as you can, then do quests and save up for the ship you really want.\nAccess to the ships depends on how big a town is, and increasing the size of the town is done by completing quests and selling them cargo that they have a shortage of. Basically you will probably have to do quests to get a town big enough to buy the ship you want. This part of the game can be a grind, so focus on one town and optimize your questing. On the way back to the town check to see if there is any cargo they need, because selling cargo at a town also counts as a quest completion.\n\nOnce you get the ship you want, things open-up and you can focus on expanding into pirate territory, collceting items from pirate bosses, or tooling around as you please.\n\n\nFor me, this game is already done. Any further development is just gravy. 10/10\n","May 5, 2015","true","115.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can bind the different cannons and shots to any key very easily. No GUI needed for that.\nTrading and sailing are a lot of fun just in themselves.

The controls are intuitive and the game world, while not terribly fancy, serves its purpose. That's not to say it lacks eye candy. You'll see pods of dolphins, seagulls, and a nice sense of water depth. The ship models are very nicely done and it seems clear that these developers have studied these graceful pre-Monitor and Merrimac vessels.\n\nSome have complained that you can't "fire" your Murderin' Billys like you can in Pirates. The mechanic is this game is all about positioning and frankly, the battles are tense enough without having to push the mouse button. Now, that said, you CAN activate barrages and such which increase crits but at the cost of reducing your defense. This game lulls you into sort of a Zen-like state, that is, until you get jumped by a few pirates. wat was a peaceful sail around a horn has become a fight for your life.\n\nThe AI is smart and will assist you but never think that gurantees success. You really have to know your surroundings as well as getting into prime firing position. Remember, these old sea birds only fired broadsides! :)\n\nI am playing the Valiant faction. This faction kills pirates. When you go into new territory, you and your faction members must clear out the pirate scum and that in itself is a blast. You must defeat ships, plunder towns, and later build guard towers and lighthouses. You can go on quests and trade which buold your towns into cities.\n\nThere is a LOT to do in this brilliant early access game. The developers clearly love their baby and it shows.\n\nI highly recommend this gem and, even though you aren't officially a pirate, there is no rule that states you can't scream at the screen in your best Blackbeard voice.","December 8, 2014","true","8.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

As per the other reviewers' comments there isn't actually that much to it. I'd probably give it a neutral rating if Steam had that option, but for myself it's a No.\n\nYou sail from place to place and sometimes find a pirate ship, whereby the basic action is to try and sail around them to get a shot off (since the ships only shoot from the sides). There's nothing wrong with it as such - there are lots of people who've spent hours on it and that's fine, if you like the relaxing element of sailing from place to place trading, but it's not for me.\n\nYou are able to get upgrades for your ship so if you're into your statistics then you'll enjoy that, however aside from an increase in gun range and speed I never really thought the other stats mattered (I'm sure they do, I just didn't see much difference with them).","January 24","false","1.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

Like a Town wants something, but there is no Town you know of that offers that\n- Instances may too hard at some point (Pirates have much better Ships than you, Respawn too fast)\n\nSuggestions:\n- Give The Possibility to upgrade Towns with Weapons etc\n- Introduce Rare Ships with rare Loot\n- In the original Pirates you could go on land with a crew searching for a treasure\n\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a small game that is enjoyable for some time until it becomes very very repetitive.

It still feels very much an WIP early access game with many missing or placeholder system but sadly it seems like this is it, the release version with no indication that there will be any more development.\n\nSo In it's current form I can't recommend it. It's missing so many systems that would seem to be to be vital for a deep and interesting game in this genre such as supplies managment, Crew moral, Boarding actions, Interesting ports with unique character, Open seas, Involved damage model, Ship naming, Salty inns, Interesting varied quests, Story of any sort, Interesting NPCs... I could go on and on but the overall impression is of a game that's only been half developed, it doesn't even have a tutorial that I could see.

Free roam sandbox, random gen maps, towns grow based on your activity, elective and random quests (found a map that lead to a multi part quest resulting in me finding a nice reward, wont spoil it.), trade economy, ship and crew upgrades, skill trees, hire allies, play as pirate or pirate hunter, solo, co-op and pvp (no server lists yet currently need IP address to join), area control with a purpose, etc... I discovered all that in less than 2 hours of play and just left the area i started in before writing this. Well worth the tiny price tag.\n\nThe dev also says he directly asked Sid Meier at a gaming conference if it was ok if he made a game directly inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates! and Sid said it was perfectly fine. That seems like a pretty decent thing to do in my opinion.  I loved that game but didn't care for the courting and dancing etc.. Which are mercifully absent here. Not sure if any of you are board gamers as well but it reminds me of Merchants and Maurauders quite a bit.\n\nI'm sure it's been linked already but the dev did a 2 hour stream/interview with Legendary Neurotoxin and he really seems like a good guy. You can pick up a lot of tips on how to play and his future plans while watching. He also reveals that he developed it to this state since August 2014.

This game has a different focus and feels closer to Action-RPGs like Diablo or Sacred combined with arena multiplayer kinda like Guild Wards.\n\nYou have an inventory just that instead of collecting swords and helms you collect Sails, Crew Members, Cannons, Captains. They have random stats and can be common, rare etc. There's a skill tree that unfortunatly is not very complex and Items have a level requirement.\n\nIt's not like Pirates! or others where you can freely travel the map. Well in theory you could however the world is divided in zones and similar to for example Word of Warcraft each zone has a suggested level, so throughout the game you progress from zone to zone and going to a zone with a much higher level will most likely result in your death.\n\nSo theres constant progression and because of that there's also grinding. However grinding is much more fun, at least for me, than it is in hack and slays. That is because one thing that fortunately is very similar to pirates! is the combat - positioning and outmanouvering your enemy is key and can help you take down bigger enemies.\n\nYou have skills with a cooldown you can use in combat. They are also comparable to action RPGs, for example you can place an AOE effect that places a neon-green fog that will damage every enemy that stays within it. They make combat even more interesting but they also break with the otherwise realistic setting.\n\nThe combat mechanics are quite fun. You take cities and other buildings like lighthouses and defensive towers by stayin in a given area as long as no enemy is around. Theres a progress bar that fills over time similar to battlefield. The AI is also decent. You can buy buildings and place them on the map at strategic important positions. If offered the right quest you can even place new cities.\n\nTheres also trading however it's WAY to simple. You can't buy specific units of something, instead you buy one "slot" of something. At the start you have two slots available, later on you can store up to 5 goods. In other games that offer trading you can buy a varieng amount of goods and the price for each ton was re-calculated after each transaction.\n\nIf you want to increase profit from trading in this game you mostly do this by equiping better items instead of min/maxing your routes and carefully calculating profit margins.\n\nThis game really is mostly a arena PVP game with fun naval combat mechanics (which make grinding much more tolerable) and typical RPG elements.

Free roam sandbox, random gen maps, towns grow based on your activity, elective and random quests (found a map that lead to a multi part quest resulting in me finding a nice reward, wont spoil it.), trade economy, ship and crew upgrades, skill trees, hire allies, play as pirate or pirate hunter, solo, co-op and pvp (no server lists yet currently need IP address to join), area control with a purpose, etc... I discovered all that in less than 2 hours of play and just left the area i started in before writing this. Well worth the tiny price tag.\n\nThe dev also says he directly asked Sid Meier at a gaming conference if it was ok if he made a game directly inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates! and Sid said it was perfectly fine. That seems like a pretty decent thing to do in my opinion.  I loved that game but didn't care for the courting and dancing etc.. Which are mercifully absent here. Not sure if any of you are board gamers as well but it reminds me of Merchants and Maurauders quite a bit.\n\nI'm sure it's been linked already but the dev did a 2 hour stream/interview with Legendary Neurotoxin and he really seems like a good guy. You can pick up a lot of tips on how to play and his future plans while watching. He also reveals that he developed it to this state since August 2014. Pretty incredible.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFDOCv2tPGg","December 30, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/326410/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","Windward is one of the greatest Early Access successes since the program launched. When the game was launched on Steam, I hadn't heard of its history on Desura, from which the developer, Aren Mook, had completely redone the gameplay. A game about sailing in a procedurally-generated open world and fighting pirates and trading and performing quests and just being a bad-♥♥♥ sailor? Hell yeah!\n\nI never actually played Sid Meier's Pirates!, so I have no idea how to compare the two in terms of the dancing minigames being gone. :P But I did play Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves on the PlayStation 2, and near the end of the game there was a whole area where the player could take their pirate ship and go exploring. It wasn't nearly as fleshed out as Windward, but it made me think that a game could be made out of that mechanic alone. And Windward is that game. You sail your ship between towns, trading goods, completing certain quests for each town such as defending against pirates or sending villagers to other towns, and building up your own ship as well as your faction. Eventually you will move on to the next region and continue the process to become an experienced sailor with a sick boat and some powerful cannons in case anyone wants to say anything to you.\n\nThere is no story mode to speak of, which is my main problem with the game. I love the procedurally-generated worlds and I love building them up, but it feels like it's lacking actual substance. There's no voice acting, and things will feel empty a lot of the time just because nothing ties it together.\n\nBut where the story lacks, the multiplayer shines. When you play a world in single-player, it's just you and AI ships. Other regions don't do anything unless you travel there, and it's all centered around you. But in multi-player, you can have dozens upon dozens of players fighting for control all throughout one world in each of its separate regions. Everyone will be trading and questing and potentially fighting and it's insane. I spent more time yesterday in one multiplayer session than any other session I've done in Windward. It was my first, as well.\n\nSound design is top notch. Everything has its own unique sound effect, and the battles sound like actual battles. Sure, there's no wood separating from wood when the cannons break in, but it's not nearly that detailed. What's there works very well. I also love the game's soundtrack, even if it can be basic at times. It's a joy to listen to.\n\nThe real great thing about Windward is Aren Mook. He has been updating this game almost daily since it released. Don't believe me? Check out the change log for yourself: https://docs.google.com/document/d/134aQGWrGfiwQFpcmsk0IxLsfS8WcB9rrXez2XNJVnB8/edit\n\nThis is a developer who has been listening to the community and is trying to make the best damn game he possibly can. This is such a rarity and he deserves so much credit for this. Windward is a damn good game made by a damn good developer and you should give it a damn good try.

The combat is enticing, teamwork is a given (and fun), and the pace is very well done. In the 11 hours I played I got to level 22 and a Royal Brig (level 4 ship), not a single moment of getting to that was boring in the least. Some might call this game casual, some might call it fast paced. Well the choice is yours. you can decide whether you want the challenge to be easy and the combat hard, vice versa, or at an equal level.\n\nAlso, no matter what difficulties you set you can choose whether to trade and quest (which is my favorite), this would be where people would call the game casual. However, taking over a region requires a large amount of combat which is probably the funnest combat I've experienced in a game.\n\n\nIn summary: loads of fun, time flies, I don't want to stop playing.\n\nFive Gold Stars","May 15, 2015","true","44.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't a bad thing as I for one like a challenge and love being made to work for my rewards, however one thing this game lacks is the ability to stay interesting for lengthy periods of time if you're playing solo, which is something I would eventually like to see addressed though it's not the most important thing in the world.\n\nGraphics 7/10\n\nThe graphics in this game are rather splendid considering the game is not overly complicated in it's gameplay, but it more than makes up for it with the lovely visuals, when you're sailing around a map and you can see the trees rustling and the reflection of the your ship in the water it's rather nice and somewhat relaxing.\n\nThere's more to it though, The lighthouses actually shine a light out to sea when it gets dark and the light actually plays off your sails if you're close enough, it's not just a layer of light that generically overlaps everything, the waves in the ocean themselves are very nice to look at, especially if you have some nice music to chill too at the same time.\n\nGameplay 6/10\n\nAs i mentioned in my general overview of the game, there is enough gameplay and enjoyment to be had if playing with others, to go into more detail let us look at what you can actually do as a group:\n\nExpand Territory\n\nAs a group you're able to take over territory for the faction you chose to join, (so long as your faction has territory already adjacent to the area you're trying to take control of that is), and the more people you have in your group the easier this becomes, the pirates in Windward are merciless they won't often just have one or two ships, there will be many a time when you'll be trying to take over pirate territory to expand your factions control, only to have to face many pirates (from my experience 5 - 7) all at the same time and some of those pirates will probably be captains in the tougher areas of the server you're playing on and eventually you'll reach lords and dread lords which will happily chew you up and spit you out if you're not ready for them. this is why you need a group because no matter what ship you're in, unless you've gone defence for your specialisation  or are some what over leveled for the zone you're in, taking out a pirate zone solo is neigh impossible.\n\nTrading\n\nTrading isn't necessarily a group activity if all i was to base this section on was the trading quests you receive from towns ("drop cargo of at..."), no instead if we look at levelling up a town or increasing a towns rank you do this by either, "A" quests for that town being completed or "B" from finding and selling materials the town needs to the town, a group effort in this scenario makes the task a little easier as the goods a town requires increases for each level so having help here is greatly appreciated as it saves one person a lot of work.\n\nPvP\n\nnot something I've spent much time doing (as doing so requires you to wear a black flag which unfortunately that makes you hostile to everything other than pirates), but from what I've heard PvP is all well and good until high levels decide to enter low level areas with black flags and wreck the newer players, now while i know that's what the white flag is for i don't think you start off with a white flag i think you have to find it just like you have to find the black flag (which to my knowledge drops from pirates, but i'm unaware as to what drops the white flag or how it is obtained).\n\nso what about solo you ask?\nsolo gameplay is possible but in comparison to playing with a friend or a group of people it is considerably slower and in some cases (such as expanding territories), much harder.\n\nthese are my thoughts on the game and if anything changes i'll modify my review.","May 20, 2015","true","72.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

But beware, this game requires plenty of patience as it can get very repetitive as you grind enemies, trading, and questing just to get that new shiny ship or upgrade. There are a few things though that I would like for the developers to focus on which is the AI as they have a fetish for light houses and towers, but not towns, so you sail around in a constant circle capturing all of the towns by your self as the pirates take another one while you have 5 guys at one light house or guard tower in the very corner of the map where it is completely useless.

While in EA it was placed and removed from my wishlist a few times as I toyed with the idea. I finally bought it when I saw they were taking it out of EA, nothing more then to win my support then dev's finally moving from EA to launch. While they're still updating it and fixing things they've stuck with it and haven't let the fans of this title down.\n\nPros: Game looks nice, handles smooth, runs well even on a POS laptop years old, music is relaxing and stays with the theme, dev's continue to update it as they add and fix things. There is just so many Pros to this game I can't list them all right now.\n\nCons:\nThis game is a grind. The first 2-3 hours all you're doing is grinding, leveling your towns and getting money to buy your next ship which will begin the grind process all over again.\n\nPirates, I feel the AI pirates have better everything then our AI ships we get. They spawn faster from the docks then our ships do, so if you're playing on your own it can take about 20-30 minutes to get an area because they can take your ships down quick (not always but a lot of the time) and they'll spawn a lot faster then our ships do. They can always do an emergency repair which keeps them alive longer.\n\n--\n\nIf you're playing this game with friends it's amazing and so much fun as you try to avoid their attacks (the fire) and you try to avoid killing them with your fire. It's even more fun if one has the black flag and can become a pirate as then this game can become PvP to see who's the better captain on the seas. Pirate or good guy.\n\nThe pirates do need to be fixed, as they do get annoying. I can see keeping that in the instances but for taking a zone its annoying as anything.\n\nI'd love to see an online Multi-player instance where you can PvP. Each person gets one area and from there you see who can claim the most in a set time period.\n\nThere is a lot of things that can be done to improve this game which I have no doubt that the devs will get around to doing as they continue to progress this game.","May 17, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a wide range of playstyles and can suit any mood. The game is not system intensive at all and the visuals are stunning. The audio is wonderful and gameplay feels fluid and fun. The controls are good and you can choose between mouse and keyboard. Shortly after purchasing this game it quickly became on of my favourites. It offers many playstyles for any mood. You can spend hours exploring new regions in beautiful Procedurally-Generated worlds, you can battle pirates or other ships for loot and glory in battle, or you could play the entire game as a passive trader and never see battle. The game is designed to be played with friends or in a group, but I often play in a solo world just trading. The multiplayer is well set up and fun, you can fight in Heroic worlds with other players against the most ferocious pirates, or you can engage in PvP Battleground combat. If you'd like, you can just join a server and chat. Playing with your friends is simple, they can join your world at the click of a button or you can find a nice public server to join together. Whether you are a casual trader or a fearsome warrior, if you come for plunder or exploration, Windward is the game for you. Tasharen has created a masterpiece, and a solo developer no less. Be very proud of what you have created, sir. I look forward to playing your next creations. Personally, I give this game an easy 9/10. Absolutely love it.

Imagine Sid meier pirates but better. Imagine port royale but with more tactical fights or more arcade fights (depending on which side you set your 'battle damage' slider). In Port Royale you had one map for the whole game, in Windward that map is only one region and you can have those up to 81!.\nOf course procedurally generated with very nice result. For me, one of the greatest strength of this game is fact you can choose pace of your game, you can always tailor your playstyle. You aren`t forced into doing anything and you got this feel that if you want to play 'slow' today game adjust to you, not other way around. And it transfers to multiplayer! Having big number of regions is greatest strength - if you want to play today with friends/strangers, just go to some server and be in same region and do stuff together. Want to be on multiplayer server, but do some stuff alone? Cool, just go to other region, or just ignore them.\nIf you like those type of games and/or always liked this type of world setting (like me) you are going to love this game.\nAnd don`t get stopped by being in early access, this game have the best developer I ever encountered. He reads *every* post on the forum, always respond and give advices or help if needed, even proposes himself if there is a need.\nIf you have ideas, post them on the forum. While Dev have strong vision of the game he is building (which is good actually), if you have concept that is agreedable with his vision you will have that idea implemented into the game. Probably tommorow - if it is a small one, as dev is throwing updates almost every day.","February 27, 2015","true","184.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Imagine Sid meier pirates but better. Imagine port royale but with more tactical fights or more arcade fights (depending on which side you set your 'battle damage' slider). In Port Royale you had one map for the whole game, in Windward that map is only one region and you can have those up to 81!.\nOf course procedurally generated with very nice result. For me, one of the greatest strength of this game is fact you can choose pace of your game, you can always tailor your playstyle. You aren`t forced into doing anything and you got this feel that if you want to play 'slow' today game adjust to you, not other way around. And it transfers to multiplayer! Having big number of regions is greatest strength - if you want to play today with friends/strangers, just go to some server and be in same region and do stuff together. Want to be on multiplayer server, but do some stuff alone? Cool, just go to other region, or just ignore them.\nIf you like those type of games and/or always liked this type of world setting (like me) you are going to love this game.\nAnd don`t get stopped by being in early access, this game have the best developer I ever encountered. He reads *every* post on the forum, always respond and give advices or help if needed, even proposes himself if there is a need.\nIf you have ideas, post them on the forum. While Dev have strong vision of the game he is building (which is good actually), if you have concept that is agreedable with his vision you will have that idea implemented into the game. Probably tommorow - if it is a small one, as dev is throwing updates almost every day.","February 27, 2015","true","184.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have enjoyed this game so much that only now, most of a month later, am I actually taking the time to write the review.\n\nI like single-person role-playing and sandbox games.  Here are some ways that this game is different than any other game that I have played (and other things I like).\nBecause this is a vehicular game, looking from the top down, WSAD literally mean forward, back, left and right from the perspective of your ship.  Yet I play it with no difficulty, because you can also use the mouse, which gives me a chance to learn how the use the keys correctly, without losing any of the fun of the game.\nThere are 4 different factions, with varying specialties, allowing you to further personalize your game playing experience.\nYou can make your own world to play in.  In fact, I have enjoyed one particular player's world that I have gotten nearly half of my XP there, at 24/7 Nautica Ballanced Factions.\nThis is the first one that I have been at all interested in using the multi-player option.  If you want to fight other players, you can.  If you don't, you can opt-out by putting up a white flag, which makes you unable to be hit.  You can also become a pirate.\nThis is really a great game, that I have enjoyed emensely.","June 5, 2015","true","113.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's an open world.\n\nCons:\n* A few unpolished edges. You can sail straight through piers, but crash if you get just a bit too close to shallow waters.\n* The inventory, town view and menus look like "coder art" (not great), compared to the sweet 3D-graphics in the game.\n* The multiplayer mode may have issues with lag (other players complained about this when I tried it).\n* The battle system could require less keyboard+mouse actions and be smoother.\n* A lack of non-repetetive things to do, over time.\n\nAll in all, though, it's an okay combination of relaxation and fun.","November 17, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I just kinda winged it and figured out you have to capture all the towns in each section of the map.  You win a section of the map when the pirates can't spawn. You kinda move twords the middle of the big overall map and the AI gets harder.  You can place your own defence and light towers.  The cool thing is the pirates can take back over defences and towns. If you have no captured towns you spawn on the edge.  also you have to sail off the edge of the map, to move to the next area. In a new section of the map you start alone till you capsure a town.  then AI allies spawn to help you (this is hard on level 5 and 6 map areas).  If you loose all the towns again,  the AI allies will not spawn to help. The trading is not like what you think, its kinda cheesy.  But different towns offer different upgrades.\n\nfirst thing to get is the grapel hook, it will pick up loot way away from you boat\n\nalso I did not see this in the first 2 or 3 hours --their are icons in the middle bottom of the screen ( my windows bar was\nblocking this from view) one is repair (this is very important)\n\n\n\nI played for the first few hours thinking I was playing with real people.  its real easy to get stuck on the shores.  the game will kinda make you mad for the first 10 hours, till you get the hang of it.\n\nI'm still not sure what my goal is?  I assume I take over the other areas.  It takes a wile to beat a little section of the map.\nI'm not sure if I exit if it will save the game.\n","November 28, 2014","true","73.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The graphics look pretty nice and the water looks good too. In some ways, this game reminds me of an old ship game called Tortuga that I used to play. Overall, I would definitely recommend it, and it is a good buy for its price.\n\nPros:\n-Online multiplayer aspect is pretty unique and fun\n-Fighting and sailing are not difficult to grasp at all\n-Abundance of items and varieties makes it fun to try and build the best item set for your needs\n-Fast traveling between regions is very convenient\n-Ability to play as many different factions, even the pirates\n\nCons:\n-Tasks aren't terrible, but can be a little mundane\n-The friendly AI in general (will explain more below)\n-Starting with only 2 cargo slots makes the first part of the game go by slowly\n-Damage from hitting land seems to only affect the player which is unfair/annoying when in combat against pirates\n\nFriendly AI- This is probably the game's biggest weakness in terms of a specific gameplay problem. When attempting to conquer the high-level territories in the center, the friendly AI become increasingly useless. They continuously patrol the entire map, while the pirate AI always go directly towards capturing objectives. This can become incredibly frustrating when you continue to be the only ship challenging 2-3 pirates at a time that spawn from pirate-controlled towns. You can have ally ships follow you, but as soon as you die, your allies often wander off if they haven't been destroyed too. This is something that isn't as big of a deal in multiplayer, but has a big impact when you play your single player world.\n","May 29, 2015","true","27.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You just do the same things over and over and over etc, etc, etc.\n\nIn my 6 hrs or so of game time, all the same game, couldn't get enough experience to make it to the next map. And I had constant battles, quests, etc.\n\nYou actually get more loot from floating crates then you do from trading or quests. Trading is useless, unless it's quest based, you hardly make an profit on anything. And with trading, you always have to travel across the entire map to make a small profit.\n\nThe random maps are poorly optimized, I had an area I needed to get to but couldn't because there was no way to get there.\n\nI should also mention in the normal game, your allies also respawn, so there's usually the same number of ships in play regardless of how many pirate ships you've captured from quests. If you have too many captured ships, pirates spawn and reduce the ship population back down to I think 5 or 6 (I don't remember exactly). Also any pirates ships you capture, you don't actually control any of them, they become AI players.\n\nWhenever a ship gets attacked by pirates, all AI allied ships head in that direction to engage the enemy. Often times I hated that feature.\n\nIn the video where it shows the ships sailing aroind in circles shooting at each other, well that's all there is. No strategy, nothing, you either sail in circles or you sit there and turn until one of you gets sunk or your allies show up and sink the pirate ship for you.\n\nYou can also play an 'Instant' combat game, where it takes you to another map, there you have to clear all the pirates. After 2-3 hrs of that, I had enough. All allied ships always respawn as do the pirates. I capture their towns, they capture mine, and so on and on, and on. Exited out of that. Went back into the normal game, played some more, got bored, quit, uninstalled it.","October 29, 2015","false","6.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's insanely multi player unfriendly. My friend and I bought it on sale and when we try to play together we can't join eachothers games by right clicking friends and clicking join game nothing happens so then i start googling ways to make this game multiplayer.\n\nSo I get make a dedicated server, I thought this sounded cool to have my own server and make it the way I want should be a lot of fun but oh was I wrong. I've spent upwards of 5 hours trying to make a server, I've read the devs guides, all the comments on said guides, I've done everything I should need to and still my server doesn't show up in the game.\n\nCreated map in single player and named it Merica for the following steps, opened WWServer.exe yes I use windows, the following formula mirroring what the dev said he uses:\nWWServer.exe -name "Exodeon and Totals" -tcp 5127 -public -world "Merica"\nWent into router and UPNP is enabled and even turned my firewall completely off just to make this work.\n\nStill I don't see my server in the public server list, I cant get my friend to find it and only way I can connect to it is connecting through IP in direct connect but he can't get in there.\n\nSo after messing with it for an hour my friend said lets just play a public server already made which IS the ONLY way to play with your friends, to join someone elses server that they can take down whenever they want, and you have to play by the rules which they setup.\n\nI love the gameplay, the work put into the game, and the game is eye candy but thumbs down untill I can make a server or atleast make it where ppl can join eachother through steam.","October 26, 2015","false","22.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

I've always loved little trade games, and it feels glorious to sail beautiful ships and get into the roleplay of sinking enemy pirates and the wonderful flavour text that pops up.\n\nTo balance out my glowing review, I'd like to add that while the music is nice, there are only six songs that are too short and don't blend very well. I'd recommend finding a 'pirate sea shanty' mix on youtube and mute the in-game music after a while\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, just look at the glorious screen shots and imagine building towers and lighthouses to defend your territory.

It has easy and simple controls and mechanics.  Has an RPG element added to it, which I personally love.  You can build colonies, and have faction wars.  You can run cargo and passengers.  In my opinion there are a good amount of things you can do without it getting annoyingly repetitive.  I myself enjoy pirate hunting above all, the combat system is easy and relatively stress free.  Simple button activated skill combined with auto firing cannon sysrems make for easy transitions from exploration to combat.  Combat which can include a great many ships at once.\n\nWhat I would like from this game?  A better soundtrack for one.  It would be cool to add some shanties(one of my favorite things from Assassin's Creed Black Flag).  I like where they are musically for the most part, but perhaps some more diversity would help immersion?  It's a bit childish, some themes are definitely geared towards a younger play audience, understandably.\n\nFurthermore, REPETITIVE.  Everything, especially the beggining, is very repetitive.  They MUST add a content update for this game to survive.  They need bigger maps, they need more music(as stated above), and some awesome world bosses would be cool as well.\n\nAll in all, what I got when I bought it was much better than I expected.  I got it because I enjoy naval combat and what I got was more so than I had previously thought.  I have hopes for a content update so for now, for an on sale price, it was worth it.","May 13, 2015","true","33.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","4"

The keywords that would hook me into any game, first introducted to me by a twitch streamer I watch.\n\nAs other reviews on this game says it's a Sid Mier's Pirates! Co-Op edition, in most case it is very true but Windward is all ship battles & trading. It was designed as a mostly instance based game,though it does have a open world setting to be played with a small group of friends as said by the creator of the game. He sure got a suprise when it launched and 200 people were on a server lol. In which may have hurt the perception of the game as people were treating it as a MMO.\n\nGameplay- First half hour might have your head spinning in questions on how things work but things come easier as the more you play and a extremely helpful chat if you are in the populated servers. From here on it's a fun ride to shoot all the pirates or be one! There is also trading to do if that is your fancy.\n\nThe replayability lasts for a solid 30 hours all of which I really enjoyed and had loads of fun. Afterwards for me it's kind of hard to pickup again as to I unlocked all the ships and skills so there is no other goals except get better loot but hell the level cap is 750 if you so desire to grind up to that. The devoloper is still continuing work on this game and dishing out content & I'll happily keep watch as to what he adds to pick the game up again.\n\nFor a indie game I'm damn impressed of it.

(It's no Terarria, but Windward is up there)\n\nA hack'n'slash game where the hacking and slashing is cannon fire and launching barrels of explosives/fire/old stinky fish toward enemy ships.  Call it an ARPG (heavy on the Action, light on the RPG), and toss some (light) tower defense and (very light) RTS elements in to the mix for good measure.\n\nCreate your own custom map and factions or have the game make a random one. Manually set the challenge levels (level requirement) of each region in the map - tedious but also important if you want to, say, make a giant spiral map that goes from level 0-330 or higher (default is 0-39).\n\nPick a faction (*combat*/questing/trading/exploration) and set sail. Unlock more ships, better cannons, captain and crew. Level up and spend talent points unlocking new abilities and specializing in defense, offense, or support.\n\nThe combat is where the game really shines, and it's deeper than surface appearances.\n\nEarly on, pirates are rather easy to take out. In the higher challenge level regions you can no longer simply trade cannon fire. You will need to get better at staying in their 'blind spot' where they can't return fire. You will need to clear out enemy towers - which will quickly turn a winning battle into a losing one. Hire friendly nearby ships and send them off to create a distraction and buy you enough time to capture a town.\n\nYou can use guerilla hit and run tactics with a small, fast, high-damage 'Corvette' that can sail through smaller openings and shallower water. You may want to drop anchor in a huge tanky 'Ship of the Line' and soak up damage so your friendly ships can attack safely. You may choose to support your fleet by sailing a 'Galleon' and tossing out barrels of water that put out fires and heal your allies. Or maybe you want to try out the <secret> end-game unlockable ship that can be good at both damage and support but is extremely squishy.\n\nHowever you decide to approach a new pirate-controlled region, it's some good fun and can be quite a challenge. To counter the 'too many pirates spawning' when trying to get the final town in a region - they cease respawning if you or one of your towers are in firing range of their harbor. Use explosives to dredge out a new canal to the town. They'll never see it coming. Fun times with moddable terrain once you find a construction kit.\n\nThe game is not for everyone. It can be frustrating at times. And it can feel a bit grindy and repetitive on the questing/trading side of things. But this can also be a tranquil relaxing time to de-stress from all your pirate murdering.\n\nThe majority of my play time is in single-player, but as with most any game, it only gets better when you play with friends (and sometimes strangers too).","June 19, 2015","true","187.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That is definitely a true statement. If you want a complex strategy game with diplomacy and something new around every corner, this is not the game for you. The missions are thoroughly repetitive and if you like that style of gameplay, everything so far has felt like a long slow grind getting from one side of the map to the other. However, beating up pirates and trying to figure out how to win a naval battle against three pirates who are bigger and more badass than you is super fun and I have died a solid six or seven times in three hours of gameplay trying to take on an area or battle that was too much for me. I'd recommend playing co-op as it's a lot more fun to raid and plunder and fight for supremacy with a friend on the map - though character players feel OPd (if only because PCs can manoeuvre better), even in areas that i would think are meant to be a lot harder for you. All in all i'd give this game a solid 7/10.\n\nPros:\nNaval battles\nPirates\nBlowing stuff up\nDoesn't require a ridiculous amount of thinking\nCo-op\n\nCons:\nRepetitive\nI cannot see the appeal in playing a diplomatic or trade based game (though I may change my mind when I need a lot more money)\nGraphics are eh","May 14, 2015","true","14.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jag64/recommended/326410/","jag64","WhoIsThatPokemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jag64/","726 products in account","For those who want a quick review with little explanation for ratings. The TL:DR is just below.\n1 - Worst I've seen,  5 - Around most games in this genre,  10 - best I've ever seen\n\nGraphics 8/10\nGame Play 9/10\nReplay Value 7/10\nMultiplayer Aspect 9/10\nProgression System 8/10\n\nIf you hate micromanaging every little thing, then this game is the game for you. Otherwise if you're looking for the ability to manage crew and other ships with great detail then you'll have to look somewhere else. Unless the Dev has plans for adding permanent fleets to the game. I would certainly enjoy having control of a fleet.\n\n\nThe TL:DR stop here. Now for a break down.\n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nPros: This game has beautiful graphics, you'll never feel like you're staring at some ugly mess of low resolution textures. Nice vibrant colors and wonderful water. The world feels very much alive. the game doesn't feel dated like most games you'll see today or in this genre.\n\nCons:The downside is the limitation of a zooming, so you can't really see your ship up close. Best thing is a spy glass which will only let you zoom out farther to see around you further away, an upgrade that I would recommend everyone getting.\n\nGame Play 9/10\n\nPros: I rated this really high, although I could have rated it lower. I gave it a 9/10 because it works. Everything just works and the flow of the fights are all seamless. You can end up in a tangled mess with 4 pirates and skillfully maneuver you way to victory. This is of course challenging if you're not very good at tactics. I have friend who can't even handle one pirate let alone 4.  Some fights you win, some fights you don't. Pick your fights wisely, no one will shame you for running away to survive and fight another day.\n\nYou can die, die, die, die and always get back up with out any major loss. I would recommend not dying as I believe it can negatively impact your stats temporarily. Not 100% sure, but it makes sense to have some sort of repercussion.\n\nCons: There's no crew on crew fights, or captain vs captain sword play. It would really break the intended game play and  I always hated having to restock on crew after every battle in the other games, but those types of fights were always fun as well and helped to immerse you into the pirates life.\n\nReplay Value 7/10\n\nPros: You can play as 4 other factions and experience the world semi-differently. There are multiple ways the world can be constructed so the maps will never be the same. The loot drops keep it ever so different and your luck plays a big role on the kinds of drops you get.\n\nCons: The game is a big grind fest and to do it once kind of puts off wanting to do it again. If I was leveling up at about twice the rate I am now it would be a whole lot better for the progression.\n\n\nMultiplayer Aspect 9/10\n\nPros: You can have tons of people in your game, not sure what the limit is. Everyone has their own loot drops HUGE PLUS!  You can trade all aspects of your ship's items with other players. The sky is the limit *wink wink* The multiplayer in this game is fully functional and\n\nCons: You can't join instances without being first invited even if you're friends with that person. Maybe Dev can add an option to allow others to freely join your instance or to lock it to invite only? There's no option to auto follow friends or allies, would make afking easier so at least your ship isn't idling around being useless if you have to leave for a moment. It would be something I'd love to see added to the game.\n\nProgression System 8/10\n\nPros: The progression system is nice, the talent points you earn from leveling give nice bonuses depending on what you pick. You can eventually max out the tree from what it looks like so you won't be missing any skills. You have a nice variation of abilities that accomplish different goals. I would like to see more passives in respect to leveling towns and such.\n\nCons: The skills do no differ a lot from other nations. They are pretty much the same with respect to your primary cannon skill varying by faction or whatever you decide.\n\nOverall Score 8/10\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone. It's very fun and you'll spend a lot of time especially with friends playing the instances and capturing towns. For a real challenge put the slider to 200%, the pirates are a real threat at this difficulty, but the rewards are real.  You can always change the difficulty of the game on start so you'll never be locked in a specific setting.  For a $15 game you're getting your money's worth. This Dev seems to be very active and is updating the game weekly, so it is far from a dead in development game. I highly suggest a 4-pack for you and your friend. We've got quite a few hours and plan to have several more.","June 22, 2015","true","79.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

My big complaint is that it could use a lot more depth for people that aren't interested in multiplayer.  The map is sperated into small regions you travel between but the AI nations do not expand by themselves so if you play by yourself or with friends only on 1 team your only competition is pirates.  As for the AI ships themselves your faction will have a few in every region that you have a town in and they are pretty good at dealing with pirates at default difficulty(I think pirates only attack regions players are in anyway so yourself+ friendly AI is pretty easy).  There is a shallow trade mechanic(you move items from towns with low price to high price <- the AI doesn't even do this it's just there for you to get money).  There are also some missions but they just exist for you to gain resources and to grow cities so they will let you buy better items(the occasional mission gives you a lighthouse/guard tower/town to deploy).\n\nThere are active multiplayer servers though and you get to bring your ship between them and single player so you don't have to enter as a complete noob.  So singleplayer or playing with 1 friend is a let-down but if you don't mind playing with others it'll be a good game.","December 31, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was looking for something similar to Sid Meier's Pirates, but more modern (it's hard to run Pirates on a widescreen display!).  I came across Windward in that search, but it was a small arena ship battle game which had apparently been abandoned by the developer, released for free as he'd gotten burned out by the lack of mainstream popularity and the fact that he could only piggy back on Pirates to get recognition.  That was sad, because Windward had a lot of obvious potential.  The gameplay was simplified, but it retained all the positional gameplay which make ship battles interesting.\n\nTwo years later, I see a couple of my friends playing a familiar name on steam.  Apparently Windward has been greenlit.  They have a couple of spare copies from a 4-pack and send me one.  The game now has a big sandbox mode, has heaps more ships, and lots more stuff to do.  I'm so happy for Michael Lyashenko that this game is getting success, because it means us lucky folk get to play it.\n\nIt's a worthy addition to the small group of games of this type.","January 10","true","41.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The TL:DR is just below.\n1 - Worst I've seen,  5 - Around most games in this genre,  10 - best I've ever seen\n\nGraphics 8/10\nGame Play 9/10\nReplay Value 7/10\nMultiplayer Aspect 9/10\nProgression System 8/10\n\nIf you hate micromanaging every little thing, then this game is the game for you. Otherwise if you're looking for the ability to manage crew and other ships with great detail then you'll have to look somewhere else. Unless the Dev has plans for adding permanent fleets to the game. I would certainly enjoy having control of a fleet.\n\n\nThe TL:DR stop here. Now for a break down.\n\nGraphics 8/10\n\nPros: This game has beautiful graphics, you'll never feel like you're staring at some ugly mess of low resolution textures. Nice vibrant colors and wonderful water. The world feels very much alive. the game doesn't feel dated like most games you'll see today or in this genre.\n\nCons:The downside is the limitation of a zooming, so you can't really see your ship up close. Best thing is a spy glass which will only let you zoom out farther to see around you further away, an upgrade that I would recommend everyone getting.\n\nGame Play 9/10\n\nPros: I rated this really high, although I could have rated it lower. I gave it a 9/10 because it works. Everything just works and the flow of the fights are all seamless. You can end up in a tangled mess with 4 pirates and skillfully maneuver you way to victory. This is of course challenging if you're not very good at tactics. I have friend who can't even handle one pirate let alone 4.  Some fights you win, some fights you don't. Pick your fights wisely, no one will shame you for running away to survive and fight another day.\n\nYou can die, die, die, die and always get back up with out any major loss. I would recommend not dying as I believe it can negatively impact your stats temporarily. Not 100% sure, but it makes sense to have some sort of repercussion.\n\nCons: There's no crew on crew fights, or captain vs captain sword play. It would really break the intended game play and  I always hated having to restock on crew after every battle in the other games, but those types of fights were always fun as well and helped to immerse you into the pirates life.\n\nReplay Value 7/10\n\nPros: You can play as 4 other factions and experience the world semi-differently. There are multiple ways the world can be constructed so the maps will never be the same. The loot drops keep it ever so different and your luck plays a big role on the kinds of drops you get.\n\nCons: The game is a big grind fest and to do it once kind of puts off wanting to do it again. If I was leveling up at about twice the rate I am now it would be a whole lot better for the progression.\n\n\nMultiplayer Aspect 9/10\n\nPros: You can have tons of people in your game, not sure what the limit is. Everyone has their own loot drops HUGE PLUS!  You can trade all aspects of your ship's items with other players. The sky is the limit *wink wink* The multiplayer in this game is fully functional and\n\nCons: You can't join instances without being first invited even if you're friends with that person. Maybe Dev can add an option to allow others to freely join your instance or to lock it to invite only? There's no option to auto follow friends or allies, would make afking easier so at least your ship isn't idling around being useless if you have to leave for a moment. It would be something I'd love to see added to the game.\n\nProgression System 8/10\n\nPros: The progression system is nice, the talent points you earn from leveling give nice bonuses depending on what you pick. You can eventually max out the tree from what it looks like so you won't be missing any skills. You have a nice variation of abilities that accomplish different goals. I would like to see more passives in respect to leveling towns and such.\n\nCons: The skills do no differ a lot from other nations. They are pretty much the same with respect to your primary cannon skill varying by faction or whatever you decide.\n\nOverall Score 8/10\n\nI highly recommend this game to everyone. It's very fun and you'll spend a lot of time especially with friends playing the instances and capturing towns. For a real challenge put the slider to 200%, the pirates are a real threat at this difficulty, but the rewards are real.  You can always change the difficulty of the game on start so you'll never be locked in a specific setting.  For a $15 game you're getting your money's worth. This Dev seems to be very active and is updating the game weekly, so it is far from a dead in development game. I highly suggest a 4-pack for you and your friend. We've got quite a few hours and plan to have several more.","June 22, 2015","true","79.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

I played Sid Meier's Pirates! on my C64 for hundreds of hours, so I had a lot of hope that this game could follow in those footsteps. I admit, that are pretty big footsteps to fill, but it is not impossible.\n\nThis game has basically no content. It has a few quests which are repeated over and over. After about ~2 hours, you have probably seen everything the game has to offer. There is not much to it, other than level, acquire money so you can get bigger ships. That is it. No capturing of ships to add to your fleet, no town combat. If you take over a town, you wait like in Battlefield Conquest until a timer is over. That is it. You can also not decide the faction of the town on your own accord. There are no Letters of Marquis, no fencing, nothing. Okay, I could do without the fencing, but Letters of Marquis would be so easy to implement and a way to acquire money besides the stupid grinding and running from A to B to deliver something, pick something up or shoot someone.\n\nTrading is also extremly dull and also mind numbingly bad. For example, if you do quests, the town grows in size, if you deliver needed goods, nothing happens.\n\nI also tried to be a pirate, but if you enter a region controlled by the factions, you get swarmed so fast by 6-7 NPC ships, you stand no chance at taking over the region.\n\nThe main feature of the game is tedium and grind and that is just plain wrong.","December 27, 2015","false","6.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I might give it another go if I am very bored, but I doubt I will play much longer in it's current state.\n\nWindward has many good points, the game itself is an excellent idea but it grows boring very quickly, even the music was amazing at first until I realized it was just the same two tracks on loop over and over. It got incredibly repetitive.\n\nThis game would be fantastic if it was one huge map maybe 10x or 15x the size of the current map size, then everyone on the same map fighting for control. But as it is now you go to one map, clear it out of pirates, do some quests, move on and repeat. It gets tiresome quickly, the progression speed also seems very slow (unless I did something very wrong, but if I did it wasn't explained to me through any form of ingame tutorial). I spent 2.5 hours with this game and got 1 new ship and 3 upgrades for my ship.\n\nOverall, if you don't mind repetitive grinding then go for it. Also if you have friends to play with this game might be more fun, or perhaps some future content patch will make it better. But in it's current state I can't recommend it unless you don't mind blowing 13€ (or your regional equivalent) for a few hours of fun (a trip to the cinema cost the same so why not) until you get bored of the grind.\n\nShort summary of good / bad.\n\nThe good:\n- Fun concept\n- Great UI (most indie games suck, but I was impressed with windward UI)\n- Pretty looking game\n- Good music (but repetitive very quickly)\n- Combat seems interesting and lots of stats if you like numbers.\n- Seems to have a lot of customization options through items, even though I didn't get to play with it much.\n\nThe bad:\n- Extremely repetitive (even the music gets old fast)\n- A few bugs (like pirates would spawn in areas I couldn't get to, so impossible to complete quest)\n- Very slow progress, I just don't have the time to play a game for 5+ hours to get to the fun stuff. Then I'd rather play a game where I have fun from the start.\n\nAs a final note I would like to say this is definitely a game to keep an eye on, if the repetitiveness of the gameplay gets fixed in the future I would be happy to recommend this game.","May 13, 2015","false","2.5"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","27","55","0","0"

I had fun for the first few hours, but then I hit a wall where it was obvious that a boring and repetitive grind was the only way forward.\n\nI went for a trading-based character to start, but trading in this game is too limited to be a viable strategy as far as I can see. Not only do the first AND second ship only have 2 cargo slots, with profit on all deliveries on the level of 20-100 gold (for comparison, the first ship with THREE cargo spaces costs 9,964 gold), quests take cargo space.  That's right, if you take a quest to kill a pirate, it takes one of your two cargo slots.\n\nTrade routes are also impossible to create, because in order to sell something, you have to find a port that wants one, and selling it may erase the demand altogether.  I ended up with a piece of cargo within the first hour I simply could not sell because no port would buy it any more.  I then had to play with only ONE cargo/quest slot until I died or threw away a piece of cargo equivalent to a third of my wealth.\n\nAfter venturing out a bit more, it became obvious that combat specs were really the way to go.  I respecced into combat abilities and upgraded my ship the best I could and went to town conquering the next two maps, which was pretty fun.  I still don't have enough money to buy the next ship, though, and the fourth map is beyond my level so I am having to rely on NPCs to fight my battles and hope I get some gold and xp... or else I'm going to have to go back to trading/questing for 20-90 gold at a time until I can upgrade enough to win a fight on my own again.  If the grind is this bad at the beginning of the game, I can't imagine how bad it is in late game.\n\nThere are things that are promising about this game, but it feels as if the devs thought that a grind was a substitute for content.  Maybe it is more fun in multiplayer, but for single player I can't recommend it.","May 17, 2015","false","5.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The one which says 'First hour in Windward', 'Hours later' and then 'Days later'? And everything that changes is the ship's sails color? Well, that's exactly what this game is, you just sail your ship from one city to another, actually waiting for something to happen. You can't set your foot on land, you don't manage your crew, you don't need any supplies, repairs are automatic, you only ever sail one ship at a time, you don't talk with anybody, you barely even have control over your cannons - all you do is just pointing your ship's bow and adjusting speed (not sails deployment, mind you, but speed, as if your ship had a throttle). Even occasional sea battles are not really exciting, either you have better firepower - that's when you win, or have worse, then you lose. In summary - after 15-30 minutes of gameplay you've seen everything there is to this game and it's not much.","November 27, 2015","false","4.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Long-term, this game is terrible, and becomes unfair.\n\nAt level 50 and above, the pirates start spawning in great numbers, versus the 4 allies that spawn, 5 minutes intervals between them.\nAllied ships are just, the stupidest AI I've come across. They throw harmful effects on themself, if not on them then on you, they ram you, block you, leading you to rage quits.\n\nThere's almost no distinction between the factions other then the colors of their sails, which you can change anyways with sail and hull paint. Going against the 2 higher level factions is LITERALLY unfair, they have special bonuses such as 10% more damage, speed, and armor.\n\nThe land is nice, but a bit buggy, sometimes you can get stuck on it and fly backwards 10 miles with no control, the towers they provide are way too weak, until you get to the max level of them.\n\nEnemy AI have almost 100% accuracy with barrels and such, while my own allies can't hit me with a water barrel 10 feet away.\n\nThe first couple of levels are fun, when you have to trade and quest to get started. At about 15 you're forced to do instances because the land is too high of a level for you, at about level 25 it's consant grinding and farming.\n\nThe Syndicate's required reputation of 1000 is far to hard to get, especially when you only have a 100% difficulty. Each quest only gives about 10 reputation each, and they take 2 minutes each. The last faction is also the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t system I can think about. Level 150 and you're allowed to spawn allies near you, and give others rewards, making firefights against other players unfair.\n\nThe game not very popular either, the highest ranking server has about 60 people on it, the others are lucky to have 15.\n","January 7","false","129.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The trading and questing systems are the exact same. You quest and trade to purchase what is effectively new equipment to improve your stats, and eventually upgrade your base ship after grinding enough gold and quests to increase towns' populations. Not complicated but that isn't a bad thing. In fact, if you're looking for a somewhat casual game to burn time this game is ALMOST excellent particularly given the price. In fact, if not for one glaring flaw, I'd give this game a 7-8/10. Throw in a few other quick tweaks and this game would be one of the better deals on steam.\n\nThe Really Bad\nHowever, I cannot recommend this game. The problem? The game-breaking pirate spawning mechanics are nothing short of absolutely absurd. Yes, this one mechanic alone is enough to take this game from being a solid game to borderline unplayable.\n\nLet me explain what I'm talking about a little bit. The war aspects of the game (as opposed to the questing and trading ones) involve moving region to region liberating all the towns in each region. There's typically 40 regions or so on each map with prates controlling 100% about 30 or more of these regions are partial control of all but 4 with the four playable factions on the map. Each region has a difficulty setting. The farther from your or another faction's territory the more difficult the pirates. That's obvious, nothing new. The problem is that liberating each region requires you to essentially put half the world's supply of wood to the bottom of the sea. Pirates have anywhere from 3-5 ships active on any given region map as long as they control one town. That wouldn't be an issue if the pirates ships didn't spawn as fast as you destroyed them. I literally had map where I turned down the difficulty and attempted to liberate a town the pirates captured. Given that I had a much more powerful ship than the pirates, I camped in the port to liberate the city (as to prevent pirates from spawning in that city). I was killed after face-tanking 8 (yes 8!!!) pirate ships without a chance to repair my ship. The spawning mechanic is so ridiculous that liberating regions requires building an obnoxious number of towers, then buffing them, and avoiding pirates ships and stealing towns while the pirates are bogged down with the ♥♥♥-clown allied ships (that are wholly useless and love to sail around aimlessly while towns quickly fall to pirates) and your towers. The effect of this is that you end up avoiding what should be the best part of this game - the naval battles. But since the pirates spawn so quickly and actually work together, there is no such thing as a decisive battle on this game. Kill three pirate ships and the occupied towns to replace them faster than God could fiat them into existence. Early in my first game I had an awesome naval battle. All three or four of my allied ships against all the pirates in the region in pitched battle. It was great. We lost two ships but sank the pirate fleet. Victory... right? Wrong. Despite annihilating the entire pirate fleet, they re-spawned, attacked immediately, finished us off and took three towns (half the map) in the next few minutes. After resorting to the unrewarding town-stealing method, I took control of the region.\n\nIt's not that this makes the game too difficult. It's worse than that. It's merely not fun. Compounding this is the fact that any region bordering another region has has even one pirate-controlled town subjects the region to pirate raids. This raid can take half a region in only a few minutes. They'll attack from two or three sides of the map (even those not bordering the pirate-controlled region). Since your buff on your towers only lasts 10 minutes, your town-protecting tower cannot hold off even a single pirate ship very long. The result is your liberated region has to go through the same ridiculous garbage again as the pirates nap a town or two and you're forced to go town-stealing while buffing your towers in an effort to hinder the pirates' progress. Just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.\n\nAside from this game-shattering flaw the game is pretty decent. You can get around this aforementioned issue by turning the difficult WAY down (it will still take you 15-30 minutes to retake a region).\n\nThe Good\nGraphics - the water looks amazing and the graphics as a whole are solid. I'm a hardcore turned-based strategy guy so I don't value graphics much. This game is pleasant to look at without creating any performance issues.\n\nCustomized Ships - your ship has many different options for adjusting its appearance. The symbol on your flag, the flag color, the symbol color, and your ship's hull can all be changed with paints and sails found or purchased (for very little).\n\nTransparency - the game is straight-foward and relatively simple. There wasn't any point in the game where something confused me, I didn't know what something did/meant, and/or I didn't know how to do something. A lot of games overlook this, but this is a non-issue. Yeah, some of the damage/accuracy/range numbers aren't readily translated into useful information, but combat isn't over the complexity that an analysis of the numbers is necessary.\n\nThe Gameplay - aside from the opening issue and some minor ones listed below, this game is actually fun and could be much more fun with some relatively small changes (a mod would do the trick). The controls are simply yet require some mastery to excel in combat by maneuvering your ship.\n\nDifficulty - the combat and difficulty can be adjusted to exactly what you want. I like more difficult games and this game is actually fairly difficult in a good way.\n\nThe Needs Improvement\n\nAllies - in each region that your faction controls, four allied ships patrol. Unlike the pirates they don't coordinate their attacks nor do they respond to pirate invasions unless the chance upon them really. You can solicit their aid, but since you have to avoid combat to win, there really isn't much point.\n\nGrinding - the monetary (gold) rewards from quests and trading are a fraction of what they should be. To acquire better ships you need to spend hours doing the same quests and trading in the same towns over and over again. It's incredibly boring and a lot of it is required right off the bat. Since you need to have a least one ship upgrade better than pirates to handle the endless spawn, you have farm for probably 5 hours on your first map unless you lower the difficult significantly (and lose much of the fun of combat). The good news is your profile carries over your ships and equipment to any new map you start. If you don't want to dominate the new map, you can switch to a lower-level (and faster) ship without it costing you a thing.\n\nContent - although the game is simple, it would benefit from some additional content. The other three factions you're not playing don't do anything. The quests and trading never really changes. There's no diplomacy mechanics to spice things up. The pirates and factions have no real distinguishing aspects apart from appearance. One thing that would greatly improve the game would be to really exploit the differences in ships' balance to make them feel unique. For example, the smaller and lighter ships are faster and more maneuverable, but lack the defense and firepower of bigger ships. One might think that this game would allow you to make a choice for the ship design you prefer. No such luck. The smaller and faster ship quickly become militarily obsolete with an upgrade of two doing 2.5-3x the damage. With a little balancing and making the smaller ships harder to hit, it could really make the ship choice vastly more interesting a fun.\n\nI'll update this review if anything changes. I really would give this a mixed review if that were an option.","May 17, 2015","false","21.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

You can even create custom quests if you know some coding.  This is reviewed in the workshop section.  Still, these problems shouldn't exist.  What's being sold here is really a game engine, not a game.  Furthermore, mods don't really enhance the multiplayer aspect of the game since people don't play with them despite that's where the game thrives.)\n\nI want to like this game.  I really do, but it has a few seriously major problems:\n\nThe game plays very slow.  Ordinarily, this wouldn't be an issue, but as an action RPG, the game needs to feel a little more arcadey and not so simulating.  The game literally becomes a timesink of your real life time to achieve virtual progress, and at that, it's not that much.  You just upgrade your ship and develop skills while expanding your faction's control of the map.  It'd be a better use of one's time to make this a turn based game where you make career or campaign decisions instead of having to actually wait to do things.\n\nOn the other hand, for all the game is a timesink in the name of realism, sailing in the game isn't very realistic.  You don't have to adjust your sail for the right point of attack to catch the wind.  Yea, you sail faster with the wind than against it, but that's it.  The game also doesn't make much difference between fore-and-aft versus square sails in how fore-and-aft sails are supposed to sail fastest at a 45 degree angle away from the wind while square sails are supposed to struggle much more with either sideways or backwards wind.  A square sail ship shouldn't be able to move at all in many currents since the sail doesn't turn.  Fore-and-aft ships don't have to use tacking to get from point a to point b, and weather doesn't change.  Yea, the wind changes direction now and again, but there are never any choppy seas to sail through.\n\nThe singleplayer game has no narrative at all, so the quests you do are literally just sailing from point a to point b in exchange for points.  This sort of mechanic works well in a multiplayer aspect where you're competing over efficiency and strategy to control the map among your friends, but in singleplayer, it's a pointless grind.  On top of that, friendly AI boats bump into you all the time.  There's no understanding of "right of way" between smaller and bigger, slower and faster, forward and backward, or other different positions of ships.\n\nThe multiplayer game has a very small community, and is already dominated by elites who took charge with the Valiant faction.  The other three factions have no chance of success unless you spend a ton of time developing your singleplayer profile and import it.   Keep in mind that I've spent 15 hours by now just to reach level 34.  The regions that Valiant doesn't control for you to start on the public server go into the 90s.\n\nAlso, understand that combat represents the climax of the game.  Once you explore and trade a lot, the only thing left to do with your experience and money is spend it towards combat skills, bribing pirates or recruiting allies, and upgrading your ship and getting equipment.  The Valiant faction succeeds in the climax.  The other three factions are supposed to grow faster than it one way or another to reach their climaxes before it does, so once Valiant climaxes, it's pretty much game over for the other three.\n\nYes, you can host your own private game with friends or host your own server, but that's not something the game deserves credit for.  It's an extra effort you have to make.\n\nAlso, yes, it's advertised that you can customize your own maps, but that doesn't mean anything beside choosing which tiles to deactivate in a square grid.  Also, the public server isn't customized at all.  It simply left every tile activated which means there's no direction in which way to expand.  This wouldn't be a problem if the archipelagos had some real diversity to them, but they don't.  Therefore, it just adds more monotony into the grind in order to secure your faction's borders.\n\nInstancing in the game is what the game should be in general, but it's boring to instance on your own, and nobody really does it in multiplayer... unless they're importing their own superclassed ships.\n\nAll and all, the game is just passive-aggressively out of control.  I don't expect the community to ever thrive because while the combat, trading, and exploration mechanics have potential, it just isn't handled very well.  If the game played in 30-120 minute instances between 5 on 5 teams where everyone starts at the same level (like a MOBA), then the game would be great, but it doesn't.\n\nAlternately, the game could be played in monthly seasons so people can have some sense of saved progress, but if the game doesn't reset periodically, then it will constantly alienate newcomers from joining while oldtimers dominate (which is exactly why I advise you, a newcomer, to not buy this game).","December 2, 2015","false","26.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That concept could work if it was more engrossing like a 3D sort of first-person experience, but a top down perspective where you do next to nothing but steer and click menus is bland to say the least.\n\nI'm still looking for that high quality Pirates! experience.

It's like Sid Meier's Pirates without a lot of the extra land based stuff. I was hoping that there'd be a lot more depth to the combat, in terms of acarde-like gameplay, to make up for that.. but it is a slow grind. Even playing with other people doesn't really help much more as most people tend to just do their own thing or when they do group up, it's just the same old combat again. I like the game but I wouldn't recommend it to others unless they really like this kind of game.

It's like Diablo - you want to stop playing because you feel you aren't making good progress, and then a cool rare item shows up.\n\nAnd then all of that gets destroyed by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥ save system.  There isn't one, you see - it saves when you exit.  Or 'periodically' or whatever that means.  I couldn't tell you when it saves.  Well, actually, I can - right after your computer is shutoff thanks to a random brownout.  Or more specifically, right after you go back into the game and try to restart your instance only to find out that the last 5 hours of progress have been wiped and they expect you to start your ♥♥♥ over in a new world with a ship that you traded in a while ago.\n\nYep - lost 5 hours worth of ships, rare items, gold, and everything.  It isn't fun.  And no, the backup didn't help - the backup WAS that old ♥♥♥ save FOR SOME REASON.\n\nIf I had manual saves, I'd have lost maybe a half-hour - tops.  But that's not the 'design' of the game.  It's some stupid hipster cloud ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about instances, and servers, and who-gives-a-crap.  The game basically showed me lots of cool stuff and then robbed it from me.  For that, it deserves a special place in hell.\n\nI want my $12 back.","May 16, 2015","false","9.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

If lack of Sid Meyer's Pirates has left a hole in your gaming soul, GET IT. BUT, I was initially frustrated with movement. This will help immensely:\nI had my controller ready, prepared to catch winds and sail to ports unknown, re live my pirates dreams. Then my ♥♥♥♥ sat there. I tried to turn to catch the wind like I would have done in SMP. Nope. Saw that I could use the mouse at the same time. Moved a bit. More nope.\nHere's how to make this game FEEL good, so you can enjoy the trading and battling and everything else.\nUse the mouse, with mouse movement activated in the setting. Use ONLY the mouse. And there's a very important thing to understand about it: ***The Left Mouse Button = Increse Throttle --- The Right Mouse Button = Decrese Throttle***\nI know this sounds incredibly weird, but after an hour plus of fumbling around, wondering if I needed to hold down left mouse to move... or what the heck was going on, that was when I discovered it functioned like a throttle. Once you are going in the direction you want to go, you will keep going. And, you can throttle-down for tight turns and so on. Enjoy.

The problem, however, is that you really just stop caring by the end, there is no reward for questing or missions. By reward, I mean a sense of acomplishment. The quests feel like a chore to get more resources to buy larger ships. I've only played single player, but I think overall there is no point to the game.

It has HD textures and sound all jam packed into a 61mb download. The moment you start playing you will be blown away by the fact the games size does not reflect the graphics quality and the games mechanics. This game has what all Piracy Sandbox or MMO fans need, online, singleplayer, custom servers, mods, talent trees, HD graphics and a smooth game mechanic, which present you with a strategic and all-inspiring game.\n\nThe ship's are persistent and can be used in any server or in singleplayer. All your progress with the ship will be saved and transferred depending on if the server allows it. (Most do)\nSo even though you can play how you wish, online on the other-hand offers benefits from the chat so you can ask questions or you can fight over contested territory in open world PvP.\n\nSome other things to menchion to wrap this review up are instances and heroics. Instances allowed you to create a server within a server for combat or questing and trading.\nCombat instances put you in a new map and you have to destroy all the pirates to win. This yields great rewards for your effort and time. I highly recommend doing these to level up and earn money and gear.\nHeroics are increased difficulty versions of instances. Same rules apply, but in this version the pirates have a lot more health and do a lot more damage. These are great for inviting people from highly populated servers to come assist. The exp is shared and it is a lot of fun to do. The rewards as you would imagine are fantastic.","May 25, 2015","true","38.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I bought this game because of the good reviews. And I really do have to ask myself: "What's up with you guys?" Is there some drug disturbance? Else I cannot explaine the positive grading. THIS is the most boring game I ever played. It strongly reminds me at times, where no computer games were kind of sparce. Maybe when Laisure suit larry did his best. BUT it lacks in diversy and in plot and actually in everything. Whith the better graphics it has (not quite cool today, except of the water, but anyway), it could not compete. After driving around for 4 hours to get some XP or gold, and didn't get enough to buy a better ship, I installed the game. And I am mad at the people giving a good review for this game. It is ridiculous to give this game a positive review. Just compare Anno 1404 with it, which now is about 4 years old (and does cost less!!).

Traveling is PAINFULLY slow, like a minute to get even to neighboring towns. During that time you do nothing besides steer your ship. And there is zero challenge on that.\n\nI swear the game almost lost me right there, but since I paid for it, I was committed to find the fun on it, so I endured the whole starting area all the time saying outloud.

Once the requisite treadmill activilties are complete, back to pirate controlled areas, where you can then proceed to play a game of whack'a'mole with infinite spawning pirates at unbalanced spawn rates.\n\nIf sixty to eighty hours of grinding to reach the fun is up your alley, then this title is for you. You'll be challenged relentlessly, without mercy or thought. If you're interested in a more casual experience then the title is something you should pass over.\n\nThis game’s core mechanics and play are simply grind based with a colorful pallet of topical islands and ocean thinly layered on top.\n","May 1","false","6.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I gave constructive (but negative) criticism of the game in general discussions.  They didn't like my comments so they deleted them and then banned me.  So I will put my comments HERE so maybe they can actually do something with them and so other users can think twice before buying (forcing the DEV to actually listen to their customers and make change).  1. The gameplay is very slow (the ships should move faster). 2. Graphics are very basic and an old smartphone can run the game (so, increase the graphics so i can zoom in like the Total War series and see more).  3.    Put some element of a human touch in it...it's just ships moving around (there is no personality).  4.  Let me customize the color of my boat and maybe modify it a bit (nothing crazy...but something)).  5. Have better objectives.  6. Gameplay is repetitive and very "monotone".  7. At times you can't progress b/c other ships are so much bigger/better you stand no chance and keep dying, leading to frustration.  8. Don't delete negative comments leading people looking to buy the game to think ppl only say positive things.  That is totally REVIEW and COMMENT manipulation and discredits your company.  THIS DEVELOPER DIDN"T LIKE MY CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS...then deleted them and banned me.  How many other people are in the same boat?  Deleted and banned.  The developer CENSORS the discussions to only keep comments that make the game look good...and delete the negative ones.","June 16, 2015","false","2.2"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

I played for 2 hours and found the game's pace to be either painfully slow or crazy hectic.  Either I was sailing along from town to town and being bored out of my skull because nothing was happening, or I was constantly being engaged by pirates and having to resort to hit'n'run tactics to stay alive.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and pleasing, but in my opinion a game needs more than a pretty skin to be enjoyable; in its present state, Windward is lacking in gameplay.  It presents itself as a free form sandbox game, but there just isn't enough different things to do in the game to make up for the missing plot.  Maybe it gets more fun as you rank up and unlock abilities; certainly from the trailer it looks like there's plenty more in the game than I discovered.  I was just too bored to grind more hours into this game to find out.  My advice to the devs would be to dramatically speed up player progression.\n\nI am sure multi-player adds that extra dimension which will make the grind seem less obvious and thus make the overall experience more enjoyable.  However, the current price tag prevents me from recommending the game to my mates, so I probably will never find out.\n\nAs it stands right now, if you are really aching for some good clean pirate action, there are better (and cheaper) alternatives to get on Steam.

Arrr, All aboard! Tons of pirates everywhere, who try to get your regions and sink your ship in trade functions.\nIn addition other players can challenge you to get regions, so the war and fun is guaranteed!\n\nWe have a plenty of possibilities is the customization, from equipment for the ship like cannons, sails, crew... which boost our ship stats to hull paints, sails paints, sails drawings... and even flags that we can use to change of faction, disable pvp or even be pirates! We have the possibility of customize our own map when we start a world too.\n\nAnother important aspect of the game is the possibility to create and add mods, which is a very interesting possibility and can expand the gameplay a lot. At the moment few mods were released, but the community is pretty nice and in some months I think some interesting mods will start to show up.\n\n-Pros\n* Pretty nice graphics, that can be supported by mostly of economic graphic cards nowadays.\n* The gameplay is easy and very fun.\n* The IA of the npc's is pretty good ( Still having some cons ) but they does their job and the quotes are interesting and fun.\n* The customization is just great, from the appearance of the ship to his stats.\n* The skill system is a good motivation to get levels and are useful.\n* Combat system is simple but fun, with some details like the sails deterioration that affects the mobility and speed.\n* Quest system is useful not just for XP and resources, it upgrade your town to get better items, profits, and ships, giving a good reason to do the quest and get better towns.\n* The factions are defined, having each one different features, so you can choose according with your style.\n* Mods support, something awesome to not get boring of the same functions always.\n* Frequently updates and active dev in forum.\n* The community seems nice and help.\n\n-Cons\n* The IA is useful, but sometimes allies ships does weird things like ram you all the time or damage you in combat frequently.\n* Skills are useful, but in my opinion too useful, I mean, with the whole skill tree of defense I can kill 4 ships  at the same time with my ship of line, some needs a downgrade.\n* At the moments there're just 10 quest, it's a good amount of them to start, but when you have some time playing the quest are so repetitive.\n\nAll the cons will change with the time, it's just a early acess at all, but the game have a great future, congrats to the creator, it is a great and fun game, and I hope we can enjoy it much more.","April 2, 2015","true","66.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is also the standard merchant style of play where you buy low and sell high. Finally you have the more combative gameplay where you can hunt down pirates and liberate cities and defend your waters.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about Windward is a severe lack of explaining how useful the right click button on your mouse is when playing. A common item in the game is something called a "Sealed Letter" better known as "This item begins a quest!" which are found as flotsom in the ocean or from the sinking hulls of your enemies from time to time. One such example where a merchant requests a shipment of goods for no gold but will trade you a (good) item in return. Think a blue or purple type item (legendary in one case for a buddy of mine) by completing these quests. However the Sealed Letter adds a quest item to your cargo area then you go buy the relevant cargo as well (spices, tobacco, fur, etc.) but when you arrive at the appropriate town nothing happens (most town based quests hand in automatically when you approach the right port). You have to open your inventory and right click the "Opened Letter" quest item (it's not so sealed now) and select "Advance Quest."\n\nThere are also several tools in the game: diving gear, a spyglass (telescope), and grapping hook that can be equipped in your tool slot.

Finally Just got it and spent several hours boating around the starting area learning game maniacs and getting a feel for how it's played. As far as I can say right now the game is very well done. Light weight on HDD space Heavy use on ram. Gameplay is very zen like I would not mind playing it with sound off while watching a movie.\n\nThey make upgrades worth while... Do you get that new cannon or do you save up for the new ship?\n\nSomething that breaks my immersion however is storage and hull space. You get an invo where you can hold things like... Replacement hulls.. Like an entire new hull for my ship... Infact I can hold tons of them. However If I want to take on a diamond to sell at another port I can only seem to fit two of them on my ship :P","February 19, 2015","true","29.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instances act as stand alone regions to farm items, gold, xp, etc.  There is a map which factions can fight for control over and in general it naturally leads itself to a somewhat helpful experience.\nThe online setup can be done through direct connect or through servers with an actual server browser, this might not seem like much but actually going through and seeing "blah blah 24-7" servers really struck a nice nostolgia chord with me.\n\nCombat is fun and gets better around lv20-30 or so where you start getting more active skills.  Trading makes sense and is rewarding but arguably could be more rewarding especially cross-region trading.  Overall I'd say its a fun game that has a nice base to work with and ideally in the future brings even more to the table like sea monster fights, more ships, etc.","May 19, 2015","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no great penalty on dying and you can easily ramp up the difficulty to push yourself without losing out. You can happily sit in a friendly region and use a very simple quest and trading system to get some gold and just while away a few hours; or what I consider to be the more fun part is to set out capturing new regions.\n\nCombat turns out to be both complex and very simple. Point the side of your ship towards the enemy and your ship automatically shoots at them, but the tricky part is then not having them shoot back at the same time or fighting / running away from multiple enemy ships.\n\nWindward is essentially very simple and can be repetitive, yet it is beautiful, engaging and well worth buying.\n","May 19, 2015","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A pirate/boat ARPG with procedural generation.\n+ Boat controls are smooth as grog. Makes trading runs very calming.\n+ Both relaxing and a thrill to play depending on what you're doing. Trading, combat, taking over regions, pvp, instances, etc.\n\n- Game can feel repetitive at times, but if you are a fan of ARPGs, you already know this.\n- Can feel a bit daunting and slow at first. No real tutorial. (Pro tip: there's a great beginner guide on Steam)\n- There are occasions pirate ships spawn at what feels like an infinite and speedy rate, overwhelming you. Early on in the game this can be very frustrating. I'd imagine it gets better as you gain more power.\n\nDefinitely has similar addictive mechanics that keep me coming back, just like Diablo does.

Arrr, All aboard! Tons of pirates everywhere, who try to get your regions and sink your ship in trade functions.\nIn addition other players can challenge you to get regions, so the war and fun is guaranteed!\n\nWe have a plenty of possibilities is the customization, from equipment for the ship like cannons, sails, crew... which boost our ship stats to hull paints, sails paints, sails drawings... and even flags that we can use to change of faction, disable pvp or even be pirates! We have the possibility of customize our own map when we start a world too.\n\nAnother important aspect of the game is the possibility to create and add mods, which is a very interesting possibility and can expand the gameplay a lot. At the moment few mods were released, but the community is pretty nice and in some months I think some interesting mods will start to show up.\n\n-Pros\n* Pretty nice graphics, that can be supported by mostly of economic graphic cards nowadays.\n* The gameplay is easy and very fun.\n* The IA of the npc's is pretty good ( Still having some cons ) but they does their job and the quotes are interesting and fun.\n* The customization is just great, from the appearance of the ship to his stats.\n* The skill system is a good motivation to get levels and are useful.\n* Combat system is simple but fun, with some details like the sails deterioration that affects the mobility and speed.\n* Quest system is useful not just for XP and resources, it upgrade your town to get better items, profits, and ships, giving a good reason to do the quest and get better towns.\n* The factions are defined, having each one different features, so you can choose according with your style.\n* Mods support, something awesome to not get boring of the same functions always.\n* Frequently updates and active dev in forum.\n* The community seems nice and help.\n\n-Cons\n* The IA is useful, but sometimes allies ships does weird things like ram you all the time or damage you in combat frequently.\n* Skills are useful, but in my opinion too useful, I mean, with the whole skill tree of defense I can kill 4 ships  at the same time with my ship of line, some needs a downgrade.\n* At the moments there're just 10 quest, it's a good amount of them to start, but when you have some time playing the quest are so repetitive.\n\nAll the cons will change with the time, it's just a early acess at all, but the game have a great future, congrats to the creator, it is a great and fun game, and I hope we can enjoy it much more.","April 2, 2015","true","66.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is just absolutely amazing and a total blast to play with friends or if you are the lone wolf type. The quest system makes it so there is plenty to do and if you lucky you my just find a sealed letter quest on your journey that adds some story as well as a longer quest to follow. The combat is fun but a little wonky, but once you are used to moving your ship to be more effective in combat it makes things easier. The only con I have is there is some cases where you can break a quest (basically no way to move forward), but I don't find this a big deal since you can abandon the quest and pick up a new one.\n\nOverall this game is great and I am amazed how this was all developed by one person.

Single player drags on a bit at first and it's a pretty nice experience, but heading online to a populated server will yield greater rewards, like faster level gain and better loot. Learn the ins and outs with single player, then once you get it, head online, and join instances. There's an excellent community and the devs are always helpful, in the forums. They also play themselves as I've heard, although I have yet to run into one. The sea battles are a lot of fun, and the trading and questing adds a different flavor to it too, but the meat of the game is online.

Rather than a large, open world, everything takes place on a series of maps and, if you desire a bit of privacy for yourself and friends, instances.  You can even host and play the game in a LAN party locally, or by direct-connection to a private server.\n\nIn gameplay, you choose a faction to start with, are assigned a basic ship, and can quest/trade or hunt down pirates to fill your own personal coffers and increase your experience level, which unlocks more difficult areas and provides talent points that increase your capabilities.  Higher areas = more money and experience.  Towns can be leveled up through a combination of trading and questing, which unlocks access to purchase and then choose between new ships.\n\nIf you like a peaceful game that can be played at your leisure, then this game is for you.  If you like teaming up with friends and blowing the competition away, this game is also for you.\n\nCons: some content is still being worked on, and the end game can be a bit sparse.

You are a captain. You have a boat. There is a map. With Pirates, treasures and a whole host of factions, instances and gear! So much gear, so many stats... so little time to sink your teeth into the wheel and get blasting those pesky pirates from the scurvy seas!\n\nOverall, Windward has a great level of polish, with issues addressed frequently by its one man development team... frankly remarkable. The controls are easy enough, and the battles fast paced but not dependent on to much skill/knowledge. You have your conventional holy trinity of damage, defence and healer each with their own skill tree, and stat modifiers. The game does have its limitations, however these are in my humble opinion minor in comparison to the replay-ability.\n\nInstances are fun, with a familar MMO feel, and the community doesn't seem riddled with pesky kids being overtly childish in a bid to ruin your fun. At this stage there seems little end to Windwards potential, except maybe spaceships... I don't see that working!\n\nMy advice, if you like Patrician 3/4 or any of the old ascaron games, but felt the battles were a tad arduous. Try Windward. Trade is an option but not the focus of the game, town development has been dummed down also. But then this game is all about the battles and the timing of shots!

On one hand, it is rather enjoyable to sail around and decimate pirates in a glorified colonial-era motif. The combat is simple to grasp and the upgrade tree really forces the player to make choices on equipment rather than paying X gold for a reskinned version of your current arrangement. The rendering is smooth and the battles are frequent enough to keep one interested, which is important because the worlds will bleed together. However, that package comes with a rather grind-heavy level system (even for an RPG, the mechanics scream tedious fetch quests). The singleplayer falls flat, and that remains the biggest disappointment for people who don't want to venture into multi-player maps. I can't say the game is bad, far from it. But I can't recommend it at full price either.\n\nI suppose the best analogy I can think of is the first Assassin's Creed game: beautiful interface, pseudo-historic setting that doesn't worry about the banal details, exciting concept, but the whisps of exploration fun are drowned out by obvious campaign lengthening quests.","June 26, 2015","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I look for the negative ones first. Not from a bad news perspective but because, I want to know if they think a game is worth the money they paid for it.\n\nSo right now, I see Windward selling for $14.99. (Though right now it's on sale, I still look at the base price.)\n\nI and a buddy tend to play games together, and so I look for the features of a game next, as well as if it's something that is in both our wheelhouses.\n\nThis game crossed our path after we recently took a break from a different game. (7 Days to Die)\n\nWe looked it over, the videos seemed pretty simple, it was going to be about sailing, but not a sail simulator. It was going to be about trading commodities from town to town, but not an economic simulator. It would involve quests that would bring in wealth, where you can deliver goods, pick up goods, ferry passengers, smuggle goods, capture pirate ships, defend towns, build lighthouses and watchtowers, and even build new towns themselves. That seems like it's billed correctly. There is also the exploration aspect of the game, explore new regions, find new towns, encounter pirates and other factions.\n\nThat so far, sounds like it's meeting it's advertising. Then it involves getting in and playing, and finding out how quick it is to pick up on the various aspects of the game.\n\nWhat seems like grinding to those with the attention span of gold fish, can alternatively be seen as growing the region, training your crew and upgrading your equipment. There are RPG elements to the game in the leveling of captains, crew, equipment, ships and more.\n\nWell that's a fun thing to do as we continue to strive to expand our wealth, and beat back Pirate forays into the region.\n\nSo with a good number of hours under my belt.\n\nI can say this game is well priced for the entertainment it brings. Fun adventures exploring a map, settling towns and naming them as well.\n\nSo it's got a lot of fun positives.\n\nPros\nEasy to learn - Principles of the game are easy to pick up and learn from observation.\nQuick to play - You can drop into the game for a few minutes here and there, do some combat, or trade, or both.\nDifficult to Master - The average player is used to having their hand held through everything, this game let's you understand the easy aspects, but the nuances of trade and combat and even exploration are at times complex.\nVisually Attractive - Looks pretty, and there is minor ship customization cosmetically.\nPricing - Good price point for a fun casual game\nAddicting - It's got that one more turn mentality baked into it. You urge to learn and explore.\n\nCons\nLittle documentation - You can go to a wiki or even read the beginners guide here on Steam. But not much explained at all. (Some actually like this convention and see it as a plus, that it lets you learn it's secrets.)\nCo-Op Play - If you're used to being able to clicking on your friends who are gaming and then joining them in game. This will be an exercise in frustration. You'll need to set up either a server or do some port forwarding, and other hoo haw stuff to get a private server up and running or a direct connection. The best way I've found is go to a public server that is up frequently, and have your friend meet you there. You can then join a private instance if you're inclined or participate in the general map multiplayer play.\nSpecial Combat Options - Others have indicated combat is a case of doing a circle of death, waiting for special buttons to pop up that you can initiate. These often do feel a bit detracting. But again it's a casual game, and millions of people planted crops on other casual games that weren't nearly as interactive as this one.\n\n\nVerdict: Addicting purchase. Go for it, especially if you see it on sale. Otherwise it's still worth the $14.99 it's selling for. For some this could be a several hundred hour to a thousand hour game, from a shelf-life. (And that's not even including any future updates, or even DLC's or expansions of the game.)\n\n"This feels like a more casual spiritual successor to Sid Meier's Pirates!

I love being told what i just won in an explosive fashion\n\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- The quest lines that you get for a high quality item have you go from one end of the map to the other constantly about 5+ times\n- I feel as though you NEED to get the next ship in order to liberate the next area without being so overwhelmed by the pirates. (This is just me, maybe I'm a fail sailor)\n\n\nOther than that, I still find this game highly entertaining and I CAN'T WAIT what the developer has planned to add to this.\n\nRecommended.\n\n","May 18, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can design the map and specify specifics for each faction. And, if you don't like those, you just start a new map. The other gem here is that you can play single player, p2p, or on servers.

I have been waiting for a successor to "Sid Meier's Pirates!" for a long time now and this is pretty darn good.  It got rid of the sword fighting, (good in my opinion), and has no treasure seeking option on land, (this is a pity).\n\nThe game play in terms of combat is much better than its predecessor in every way.  It is really good fun in my opinion.  This is one of those games in which I find that after having played for about an hour I find out to my amazement that four or five hours have gone by in a flash!\n\nThe graphics are very good.  The game can be readily played without any great learning required.  Customization is well implemented.  Sound is fine.  Very playable.  Easy to use interface.  Instances are a great idea and easily made use of.  You can build new towns as well.\n\nI really enjoy the method of infiltrating and taking over zones one by one and then developing them.  It was a great idea that is implimented in this game.  The abilty to then quickly jump from zone to zone without having to sail there the long and boring way is also a fine idea that works well.  I am playing this game with a lot of enjoyment and belive it to be a well built game.  I rate it 9/10.\n\nMy only wish is that there could be a few additional side questing aspects to the game to make it even more captivating.  Perhaps some way of spending part of your loot to create or build things other than for your ship.  Perhaps even a special home base/town that can be lovingly created by the player and added to as time goes by as a personal reward for all of your effort.  Perhaps by treasure questing on land they can find the objects with which to build their monument to themselves. Then having conquered the seas the player can admire and relish owning something customized and created by their own hand as a final personal in game reward.  ( I would really like an excuse to park the ship and go onshore from time to time).\n\nI do hope that with lots of support the developer might add a few more interesting aspects to this already fine game and turn it into a real classic that takes away the mantle from its predecessor.\n\nThis game is well worth buying in my view.","May 22, 2015","true","101.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You are a captain. You have a boat. There is a map. With Pirates, treasures and a whole host of factions, instances and gear! So much gear, so many stats... so little time to sink your teeth into the wheel and get blasting those pesky pirates from the scurvy seas!\n\nOverall, Windward has a great level of polish, with issues addressed frequently by its one man development team... frankly remarkable. The controls are easy enough, and the battles fast paced but not dependent on to much skill/knowledge. You have your conventional holy trinity of damage, defence and healer each with their own skill tree, and stat modifiers. The game does have its limitations, however these are in my humble opinion minor in comparison to the replay-ability.\n\nInstances are fun, with a familar MMO feel, and the community doesn't seem riddled with pesky kids being overtly childish in a bid to ruin your fun. At this stage there seems little end to Windwards potential, except maybe spaceships... I don't see that working!\n\nMy advice, if you like Patrician 3/4 or any of the old ascaron games, but felt the battles were a tad arduous. Try Windward.

Though it doesn't have the background quest to find your family that "Pirates!" does, it does grant you a lot more freedom to pick what you do. There are quests offered in the towns, as well as cargo to haul from one place to another.\n\nFor multiplayer options, you can choose to allow Steam friends to jin your game, or play on servers hosted by others.\n\nI'd say it's definitely worth the $20 to buy it; my only real gripe is the lack of a tutorial or other in-game reference.","June 5, 2015","true","110.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than a large, open world, everything takes place on a series of maps and, if you desire a bit of privacy for yourself and friends, instances.  You can even host and play the game in a LAN party locally, or by direct-connection to a private server.\n\nIn gameplay, you choose a faction to start with, are assigned a basic ship, and can quest/trade or hunt down pirates to fill your own personal coffers and increase your experience level, which unlocks more difficult areas and provides talent points that increase your capabilities.  Higher areas = more money and experience.  Towns can be leveled up through a combination of trading and questing, which unlocks access to purchase and then choose between new ships.\n\nIf you like a peaceful game that can be played at your leisure, then this game is for you.  If you like teaming up with friends and blowing the competition away, this game is also for you.\n\nCons: some content is still being worked on, and the end game can be a bit sparse.  Definitely a game to be savored and not rushed through.","June 8, 2015","true","43.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is simple, but can still be a challenge. The graphics are vibrant and change based on the different climate of whatever region you visit and with day/night cycles. The music fits the game very well with a cycle of simple, but unobtrusive melodies. The sound effects are just right, from cannon fire to the ship creaking as you change direction to catch the wind.\n\nWindward is a casual trading/city building game where you complete quests such as ferrying passengers to nearby town or hunting down pirate well as buying and selling goods to raise money to buy your next big ship.\n\nIt also has exploration and conquest where you have to squash the pirate threat when you enter a new territory. You won't be able to trade or gain quests until the pirates are driven out. You engage in ship to ship combat using you cannons and then as the game progresses other abilities such as throwing barrels of fiery oil, poisonous barrels of rotting fish, the fog of war to mask your position and the old standby of just ramming into your enemy.\n\nWhen you start, you're a lone buccaneer who must put together other ships in your fleet. The most direct way is to either capture the other pirates or bribe them to join you. Once you have a crew, they will come to your aid when you're attacked as well as engage pirates on their own and work to secure ports. Once a region is secure, you can trade between the cities to build up money and skills or you can move on to the next region and engage more pirates.\n\nAs you explore you can dives for treasure amongst the wrecks or pick up flotsam that is washing ashore. This can contain gold, wood, iron, sails, cannons, and even crew members. You then keep building up your attack fleet to engage the enemy. You will also gain XP which can be used to increase the skills of your crew in attack, defense and negotiation.\n\nPeople say the game is slow and there is a lot of grind. If you prefer endless hordes in an FPS, then yes, this is mild by comparison. If you expect to do something once and move to the next level, then no, it doesn't work that way. You will have to trade goods to make money. You will have to buy bigger boats to trade more goods to make more money. You will need to make money to buy bigger boats so you can defeat the bigger ships the pirates will have. In essence, you will have to trade. The progression makes perfect sense to me and the game has a mixture of both easy, moderate and difficult regions on the same playing grid.\n\nThis is a great game at the retail price, but is a downright steal at $5. There has been a nice stream of updates and new features and bonuses have been added, not to mention Steam Workshop integration.  I think this is a great blend of action and adventure and can provide hours of enjoyment.","December 28, 2015","true","63.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are looking for a customizable open world Trading, Privateering, and Naval Combat RPG then you have found it in Windward.\n\nThe only downside is that the Online presence is rather small, and this is where the game shines. Contesting cities and zones against other players while organizing your AI ships and Trade/Quest Runs is where this game really shines.

Start with a simple ship, by fighting and quests improve your equipment and skills, and help your faction wrest control of the map from the pirates or other factions. Powering up and slowly taking over a map really scratches an itch of mine.\n\nQuests are pretty basic--you're either delivering things to one or more places, or fighting pirate ships. Taking over new squares of the map from pirates are where I found the real fun, but also some frustration--I can totally understand other reviewers who trash the solo game for this. As a solo player, it sometimes feels like you're the only sensible player in a 5v5 game of idiots. You might find yourself trying to single-handedly fight off the pirates being spawned from their single remaining town while your allies are dicking around in safe territory. Or even if you vastly outpower the enemy need to reconquer towns multiple times because the tower-based defenses aren't great and you can't count on allied ships to defend sensibly. It is possible to hire your allies to either stay with you or go to a destination of your choice, but this control is pretty limited.\n\nHowever, fighting off the pirates is enough fun that I don't really mind the protracted battles--it's one of the best ways to get new equipment and experience, anyway.","June 20, 2015","true","55.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And in a way it's similar - it's a pirating game with some questing and trading mechanics, but it really isn't Sid Meier's Pirates either.\n\nThe game has very solid combat mechanics and RPG-like elements to it. Ships can be upgraded through switching out different materials (your crew, your cannons, your sails etc) and because they're not permanent, you can switch it out depending on your whims.\n\nNaval combat is somewhat automated - cannons fire automatically within range - but you have custom attacks that you can trigger manually. So far I've only unlocked volley shots and chain shots but the videos show that there are significantly more.\n\nTrading is simpler but still rewarding. If you've explored the towns, they'll tell you which area provides the cargo they would want to buy. There's less planning involved and it feels more like a fetch quest but it's still satisfying to sail across the virtual seas.\n\nThere are pirates that roam the seas and other factions as well. You can bribe the pirates and you can capture the cities/towns that the pirates have control of too.\n\nYou can level up and unlock skills as well, and I believe your crew and captain rank and level up too - albeit at a different rate. But at any time you'd like you can switch to a different captain or crew (they essentially act as passive items) too.\n\nI'll admit I wasn't entirely convinced of the graphics on the screenshots - they looked a tad jagged and oversaturated and the waters looked dull. But rest be assured, it looks much better animated. It's a beautiful indiegame.\n\nFor $14.99, it's a wonderful game.\n\nPros\n- Beautiful graphics\n- Solid trading, questing and combat mechanics\n- Lightweight game\n- Solo or co-op gameplay\n\nCons\n- I hope the trading and questing mechanics is developed upon a little more\n- The difficulty from "Challenge 3" to "Challenge 4" is akin to the leap from racing a car in Need For Speed Underground to racing a car in Grand Turismo 5, there's a sudden difficulty climb that can feel overwhelming.","May 11, 2015","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Drop system is good sometimes u can find good items from big ships or captains. This game not like a old school Pirates:Gold or Sid Meier's Pirates maybe we can just compare their ship battle system and trading system but there is no real man fights. U are controling ships and canons automaticaly shoting. its sounds so basic but games not like that. Yes hard to defend citiys or another AI ships but in online gameplay its gonna be real fun. Wars and regions(btw map have regions and u can explore this regions after level up.) gonna be total chaos if u playing some frineds or another players. i didint tell so much about gameplay cuz evry expericend player should be understand what's goin on there. its easy to learn hard master style game.(like easy to control but its goin harder at battles if u face real players) U can play as a single and u can take ur ships to the other players server or they come to ur server that was another good thing and ur earning in all server will save.\n\ni think this game community will be grow soon cuz its adressing all kind of players cuz it including  basic trade, battle, team play,questing and discover. But there is no Offical and big server for the play i guess or i couldn't find it, thats the what this game is need.(btw there is 4 functions all of them have their own specs why the game turn to so funny at online 4 team at the same region battleing for to be conquerer)\n\nThere is also room for improovements maybe with new ideas game gonna be much much more beutiuful.\n\nSummary\n\n+Funny\n+Big battles(sometimes)\n+Easy to learn after few hours\n+Friendly Community\n+No Raging battles(if u are strong and skillful player u can sink so many as u can alone)\n-Lack of servers (but i guess this problem solved soon and also there is servers)\n-Single player repetitive ( but u should this game play online there is much more fun)\n-Lack of events (if devs take control over online playing like offical big server and event on it thats will be legend)\n\nDon't expect too much from this game at the moment but its playable and worth for price.\n\nSorry for my bad english and thanks for reading.

You can do that.\nYou want to blow stuff up and never quest or trade? You can also do that.\n\nThe combat is fast and fun, but complex enough to be rewarding.\n\nEach of the factions bring a different approach to gameplay, yet you can be successful with any of them.\n\nThe game developer is very proactive with his game and, if you play on a public server, you will probably run into him.\n\nDo yourself a favor, and buy this gem of a game.

The music and visuals are very relaxing most of the time.\n\nYou will ferry passengers from one port to another, get involved in trade, and of course engage in ship to ship battles and then grab the loot from your fallen enemy. The best way to describe it is Diablo/Dungeon Seige on the Sea. Though item stats seem less randomized than those games, which some may see as good, while others may see it as disappointing,\n\nYou can buy different ships with different stats and cargo capacity and so on. Each ship can be outfitted with sails, hull material types, cannons, etc all of which you can buy from most port towns, or you can sink some ships and try grabbing loot that way as well.\n\nThe game also has random world generation and the ability to choose varying map sizes. You also have several factions that you can allign with.\n\nI have not tried the multiplayer yet, but you can host your own server and enable or disable PvP.\n\nOverall the game is very good. I personally would prefer more of a Diablo approach to loot, but it is fine the way it is currently.\n\nI would give Windward a solid 8/10.","June 24, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can buy different ships or upgrade your existing one (in turn changes the look) with items you purchase or find, you can gain experience through the different game types.\n\nThe whole map is broken up into section squares (as viewed from the fast travel map) that have set instances for level ranges of players. Players starting in a game seem to only select areas that are not higher then their level, however can travel into them manually later if they wish.\n\nThe end game seems to be a strategy take over of the generated map, adding defensive buildings, capture and holding areas to take them over - I would imagine in later levels require more team work.

I spent a lot of time being a merchant, buying goods in one port and selling them in another port, or ferrying passengers. And while that's exactly what I wanted from this game, I can see others becoming bored since there are very few quests with any kind of storyline attached. There isn't much in game reason to push into pirate controlled regions other than seeking more gold to buy better ships. You are questing and selling goods to have more gold and more experience to upgrade your ship or buy new ships, and that alone has been enough of a hook for 20 hours of gameplay, but there isn't any personality to the captains or crew, and no overall story to keep me emotionally invested. Still worth a buy at this price point, but I'd love to see a sequel that is fleshed out with a storyline, day/night cycle, stormy weather, crew boarding, and dialogue.","May 31, 2015","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Single player drags on a bit at first and it's a pretty nice experience, but heading online to a populated server will yield greater rewards, like faster level gain and better loot. Learn the ins and outs with single player, then once you get it, head online, and join instances. There's an excellent community and the devs are always helpful, in the forums. They also play themselves as I've heard, although I have yet to run into one. The sea battles are a lot of fun, and the trading and questing adds a different flavor to it too, but the meat of the game is online. Windward is wholly enjoyable especially if you like seafaring games. It's pretty much a game made up of the sea battles from Sid Meyer's Pirates! except with added abilities and flair.

This may change later, but for now it's really just your ship and your faction's AI ships versus Pirates.\n\nA good place to start and learn how to play the game, but a limited experience. It can be great fun sometimes, but experience is limited.\n\nThe Co-op optionThis can be a little tricky because it does not use your Steam Friends list or any kind of in-game friends list.\n\nYou create a game, just like you would for the Single Player option, and you click the check-box to allow "friends" to join. The way they join your game is by specifying the IP address of the host. This may change later.\n\nUnless you want to make a public server, this option is great for parents that want to play with their kids, assuming the kids have their own computer.\n\nThe Online optionOnce you are comfortable with the controls and you know how to play the game, this is where you will want to spend most of your time. Here is where you will have the most fun in the game.\n\nFuture patches and updates that change the Single Player option may make that option more attractive, but online co-op and PvP is always more exciting.\n\nWhat you can expect to find online:\nMembers of different faction, fighting together to beat back a Pirate invasion.\nPeople playing as the Pirates trying to create chaos.\nHigh-level players in low-level areas.\nContested areas where everybody fights for his/her faction.\nEpic battles that can last for a very long time.\nFaster XP and gold income.\nInstances where people from all over the world fights against pirates for loot.\n\nMy experience with the gameOn my first day, I spent seven hours in-game and fell in love with it.\n\nI was hoping to find a game where you can control when your Starboard and/or Port side guns fire and was a bit disappointed to find that they fire automatically. However, you get used to it and learn to accept it because there is so much more to the game.\n\nI don't use the Single Player any more because the XP and Gold gained from playing on a populated server is great. You can't find decent four-way faction battles anywhere else really.\n\nThe game is not perfect. I really wish you could board and capture ships (at least in Single Player), but it's still a fun experience.","January 4","true","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You do not have to feed or take care of your crew so its more of an Arcade version of a pirate game, which I prefer for my own style of play. Lots of explosions, the cannons are auto manned so you can focus on special skills. There is loads of room to play as each part of the map leads to another map to play on and you can move back and forth between these map instances. You can get quests from cities or from letters floating around in the ocean. There are map pieces you can get treasure hints from, take landlubbers for a senic tour, bring cargo to build up cities you place, and many more types of quests. Its open world and you can have friends drop in on you to play or you can go onto a server. The game style is mostly about capture the flag: you clear and area around a guard tower, then the city it guards and then plunder the city till it is yours. The game does not require actual numbers of crew so you do not have to spend time gathering and looking for crew which makes this pirate game very action filled on the seas.

Yes he got some help in specific areas, but a single developer coded this game into being from start to finish almost entirely on his own... and it does not suck.  Not at all.  In fact it is pretty damn incredible, especially when you learn the backstory behind it's creation.  On top of that a glance at the forums shows that he is an incredibly responsive developer who engages with the players, built in modding from the get go to allow for community expansion of the game, and is constantly working to tweak and enhance the user experience.  I mean he built a game intended for LAN play that somehow supported 300 simultaneous players in a single game instance running on his home server via cable modem!  That is nutz!  He added server limitation code after that to ensure more managable numbers since this was not intended as an MMO, but it shows the quality of his code work that it worked at all.  How many other 1 person dev teams could put out a game that allows 50 + users enaging in battle simultaneously?  Seriously... Support this game, support this developer, and support others like him who show the dedication to bring great games in to being.  I whole heartedly encourage others to buy this game if it's genere is even remotely interesting to you, it is absolutely well worth it.","June 6, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been waiting for a successor to "Sid Meier's Pirates!" for a long time now and this is pretty darn good.  It got rid of the sword fighting, (good in my opinion), and has no treasure seeking option on land, (this is a pity).\n\nThe game play in terms of combat is much better than its predecessor in every way.  It is really good fun in my opinion.  This is one of those games in which I find that after having played for about an hour I find out to my amazement that four or five hours have gone by in a flash!\n\nThe graphics are very good.  The game can be readily played without any great learning required.  Customization is well implemented.  Sound is fine.  Very playable.  Easy to use interface.  Instances are a great idea and easily made use of.  You can build new towns as well.\n\nI really enjoy the method of infiltrating and taking over zones one by one and then developing them.  It was a great idea that is implimented in this game.  The abilty to then quickly jump from zone to zone without having to sail there the long and boring way is also a fine idea that works well.  I am playing this game with a lot of enjoyment and belive it to be a well built game.  I rate it 9/10.\n\nMy only wish is that there could be a few additional side questing aspects to the game to make it even more captivating.  Perhaps some way of spending part of your loot to create or build things other than for your ship.  Perhaps even a special home base/town that can be lovingly created by the player and added to as time goes by as a personal reward for all of your effort.  Perhaps by treasure questing on land they can find the objects with which to build their monument to themselves. Then having conquered the seas the player can admire and relish owning something customized and created by their own hand as a final personal in game reward.  ( I would really like an excuse to park the ship and go onshore from time to time).\n\nI do hope that with lots of support the developer might add a few more interesting aspects to this already fine game and turn it into a real classic that takes away the mantle from its predecessor.\n\nThis game is well worth buying in my view.","May 22, 2015","true","101.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would actually just ignore the negative reviews at this point. This game is only $15 and you get so much. It is rare to have a game like this these days. At its core the game is very basic, but there is an art to mastering everything. The developer has given the players unlimited options on how they want to play. You can design the map and specify specifics for each faction. And, if you don't like those, you just start a new map. The other gem here is that you can play single player, p2p, or on servers. Awesome, totally awesome! I mean... argh, I likes the game and the booty!","June 7, 2015","true","27.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it’s fun in its current state, it lacks value.  Certainly not worth 15 bucks.  Very tedious after the first hour.  Perhaps future updates will make it worth the money.  The potential for improvement is what makes it so hard to say no.  As of right now however, the game isn’t quite worth it.  As a fan of the age of sail, and just about every game set in that era, I really hope this game develops quickly and well.","June 29, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
