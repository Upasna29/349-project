"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SixHealthOfFury/recommended/25700/","SixHealthOfFury","SixHealthOfFury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SixHealthOfFury/","2549 products in account","A great multiplayer arena shooter. It doesn't take long to unlock all the class abilities and has plenty of game modes beside the well worn VS multiplayer most of these party games have. Multiplayer works and the netcoding is better than most on the indie titles I've played. Played against a friend in Austrailia and had about 200ms response time where 200 is what he often gets in Counter Strike.\n\nI like the variety in guns selection the most. Each gun has an alternative fire that slightly changes how it functions while maintaining the theme of the gun. For example, the Shredder launches a saw blade that has slow projectiles while it's alternate fire shoots a slightly faster projectile that isn't as accurate and does less damage. Combined with class abilities, many guns are useful and can mix up the play experience.\n\nHighly recommend this game and it is certainly worth $2-5 pending when you get it. You should get the 4 pack due to multiplayer being pretty much dead. That is the only real negative I have about the game.","October 25, 2015","true","6.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The gameplay is smooth and very well done. The story gets you ready for online play. The online community is small but still active from time to time. The gun fights can be a lot of fun and the different weapons in the game make it interesting to fight with all the variety. The online battles are fun but can be hard for new players. There is a co-op option that is fun to play with friends and see how long you can survive. The view that you get is a top down view which is great for this game but can be hard at times. It does support the Xbox controller which is a nice addition to the game.

Whether you are playing the competitive multiplayer mode or the Single-player/cooperative campaign mode, half the time you will be switching guns you find along the way. The variety of weapons found in this game are also divided into 2 separate energy types, which are regular bullet-type weapons & laser type weapons, and the other being heat & cold powered weapons. Your character is a ball-shaped Babo that rolls around as you move, and each character has his/her own special abilities at their disposal. Experiment with the variety of characters and weapons in this game and find out what suits you best.\n\nIt's a great game to play with friends, or by yourself if that is your thing. Either way, this game is quite good and can keep you entertained for a while.","June 12, 2013","true","43.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

I've never heard of the Madballs thing before - apparently they were a toy in the '80s ('90s is the best) - but this top down shooter thing is solid. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer are fun with the multiplayer in particular a big surprise.\n\nYou crash on a planet or something and have to kil the bad balls because they're bad. There's a few different types of balls you can play as and they're all different enough to play fairly well.  The Story Mode gets a little repetitious, mostly due to the areas ahead being locked until you kill all the dudes the spawn. Still, pretty short and mostly fun.\n\nMultiplayer is really fun, although there won't be any players now. I got the most out of it when there was that free weekend for it and everyone was playing. You unlock weapons and ablities as you go. It's super fast paced and you'll die a lot but once you learn you'll be killing peeps like no tomorrow.","December 11, 2010","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Back then they weren't much more than ugly little toy balls kids could buy, and later had a TV show that fell on its face rather quickly.  These gross toys were revived in 2006, and three years later this video game came out.  I had little hopes for this game from the start, reclaiming the obscure popularity of the toys and the general bad video games that are usually put out for children's entertainment... however, this game is none of that.  It is easily one of the most enjoyable shooter games I have played.

I've never heard of the Madballs thing before - apparently they were a toy in the '80s ('90s is the best) - but this top down shooter thing is solid. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer are fun with the multiplayer in particular a big surprise.\n\nYou crash on a planet or something and have to kil the bad balls because they're bad. There's a few different types of balls you can play as and they're all different enough to play fairly well.  The Story Mode gets a little repetitious, mostly due to the areas ahead being locked until you kill all the dudes the spawn. Still, pretty short and mostly fun.\n\nMultiplayer is really fun, although there won't be any players now. I got the most out of it when there was that free weekend for it and everyone was playing. You unlock weapons and ablities as you go. It's super fast paced and you'll die a lot but once you learn you'll be killing peeps like no tomorrow.","December 11, 2010","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"Madballs in Babo: Invasion" bristles with the reflexive jabs and on-the-spot opinions that tend to come during long-distance sparring sessions with the nebulous masses. The single-minded focus on wrangling a complicated commercial-vs.-underground reputation can feel exhausting at times, but the game's playality makes up for it, with an improved graphical delivery and a collection of beasts that expand on what drew attention to Playbrain's production at grime's onset.","July 3, 2011","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has simple (but challenging to master) mechanics, pretty good graphics for an isometric game, a competent UI, good physics, and a fair amount of content.  I offers multiple game modes, multiplayer (both co-op and competitive), and leaderboards (I happened to make it to #3 [at one point] global on one of the levels, yooooo).\n\nIt's a great bit of fun, and well designed for a rolling-ball type game.  It made me want to do a 360 and roll away.","August 30, 2015","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combination of the 2 special abilities per character and the dual firing modes for each gun just worked out so well.  Even the story mode was a blast!  Obviously the story wasn't top notch but it was great to mow through different scenarios.\n\nNever forget~.","May 6, 2015","true","204.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
