However, the way each character needs to get those items worth the trouble of playing it again.\n\nI laughed a lot with this game, it's really confusing sometimes, but I recommend it.\n\n7/10","March 14","true","3.8"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","34","47","6","4"

It's a game that I feel would have felt right at home in my DOS collection in the years of the early Duke Nukem games and games of the like, by today's standards it just feels a tad lacking, but in an odd sense that's not entirely negative.\n\nPicture if someone from the mid to late 80's travelled in a time machine to modern day and saw games like Castlevania: Sympthony of the Night or other Metroidvanias, and decided to take that knowledge back with them and used the technology they had to work with in the late 80's.  I'd almost put this game in between a cozy place of Metroid and Legacy of the Wizard for NES; but a heavy C:SotN vibe.  Is it beautiful?  no.  Is the music stellar?  hardly.  But it still has a slight retro charm to it, whether it be intentional or not.\n\nThe game gives two characters to play, I've only played as the ninja, and it's pretty straight forward.  You get a ranged attack, melee attack, backdash and jump.  You find powerups and spells later on which help you progress further in the game.  The combat is really straight forward, later bosses you will have to learn their attack patterns at times to avoid certain death, but aside from that the combat is simplistic.\n\nI can't rightly not recommend this game since it's not broken or dreadful albeit a little bland at times, yet giving it a thumbs up I do so with hesitation.  Another game where a thumbs in the middle would be appropriate, since I think there are far more games in this genre I'd sing the praises of first.  I got this game in a bundle so the price isn't hugely a deciding factor for me, but for anyone purchasing at the full retail price I may suggest waiting for a sale or it to appear in a bundle, that aside though I think there is still some enjoyment to be had from this game regardless, I just feel $5-$7 would be a more appealing price to the consumer for having them feel like they got their money's worth, due to just how saturated the market is with this genre of games that are competitively priced.","May 11","true","4.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
