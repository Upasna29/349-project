The universe created by Spiders is certainly curious but is often let down by the badly written dialogue and pacing of the story, or the sometimes horrendous voice overs.\n\nGraphically it is an appealing game and the environments and music is all there in a solid fashion. The combat is largely enjoyable and has a nice punch behind it, the skill system and crafting mechanics are nice but the lack of variety within loot is a letdown. In the end, Mars: War Logs is an above average game that will certainly be an enjoyable experience for those looking for a nice little third person RPG, and are willing to forgive it for its diamond in the rough state.\n\nFull review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emM-sxmOx9c","November 27, 2013","true","13.8"," 245 of 291 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","245","291","0","2"

Combat is smooth, landscapes are gorgeous, and the story isn't too bad either. I'm aware when this game came out it was pretty bad, but they did an excellent job at fixing what needed to be fixed. So many of the negative comments don't apply anymore. However, many have said the combat and crafting system is a rip off from The Witcher 2. I will have to say false. Similar? Without a doubt, but not a rip off. This game takes it much more slow, and the option to use the techromancer abilities makes it its own. And a crafting system is a crafting system. Not much you can do there. Now, my impressions: I love this game. I was constantly entertained from start to finish. I love action RPGs and this game delivered. But not only that, the landscapes were amazing. The towns and such were nice, but you got tired of looking at them after a bit, but when you stare off into the distance, beyond the towns, you saw beauty. They made a boring red planet into something else. If you enjoy a not so hardcore RPG then by all means pick this game up. But maybe wait until a sale. I love the game, but $15 is still a tad high in my opinion, but nonetheless I think this game should be on any RPG lovers game library.","March 22, 2014","true","10.9"," 134 of 149 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","134","149","0","3"

For a traditional RPG it's got some things right, but it has its share of problems.\n\nPros:\n1. Tactical combat. Combat gets even more challenging and fun at Extreme difficulty, but at a price...\n2. Nice setting and atmosphere. Mars here is like a remnant of some former colony; a fresh change from those high-tech ones. Everything is rusty, red, and make-shift. Put it another way, it's more like an apocalyptic Mars.\n3. Your choices matter. People may die/live, quests may be locked/opened, etc... If you like replaying for different endings then this is for you.\n\nCons:\n1. At Extreme difficulty, a bad selection of skills will make the game almost impossible. There seems to be some skills that must be unlocked first, such as Evade, Sneak, etc.\n2. No crowd AI. At hubs you may get invovled in battle, but civilians do not react at all, even when the fight is happening right under their noses. This hurts the sense of immersion.\n3. Some quest are hidden inside branching conversations and are easily missed if you choose the wrong reply (but you have no idea of the difference). Choose between "just say it!" or "ok ok i got it"?\n4. Characters and lore are rather under-developed. For an RPG of this length (30hr for me), you only get to know a few of the characters. Some just pop up with little background info. The romance here is merely a filler.\n5. In combat you only have limited control on your companion (only 4 "states"), which sometimes is not that helpful.\n\nDespite the cons, I still enjoy this game a lot, primarilly for its combat and story. If you aren't that picky about graphics and AI and just expect a down-to-earth action RPG, this shouldn't disappoint you.","July 14, 2014","true","37.7"," 91 of 99 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","91","99","0","0"

Its settings is poorly described, even after I read through the in-game journal and the documents on the game's web site. The characters feel shallow and - not helped by poor voice-acting and writing - I never empathized with their plight. Mars is gorgeously rendered, but the detail is only skin-deep; too-few NPCs, quests and maps results in an world that is artificial and empty. The combat and crafting are moderately entertaining but, again, the lack of content hobbles even this; a mere handful of weapons and spells did not give me much to play with. Mars War Log plays very much like a game where the developers had a great idea, but neither the talent nor the ability to bring that idea to fruition.","November 25, 2013","false","11.0"," 407 of 546 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","407","546","0","4"

Mars is an amazing game despite what the Meta score says. People complained saying it falls short of a great RPG because it's to simple , but that's the wonderful thing about this game - It's simple. Its gameplay and combat is like Witcher 2 with Slow-mo chosen abilities , blocking and rolling.\n\nFor someone that likes the idea of an RPG but doesn't have the time or doesn't like the complexity of RPG's ,this is the perfect game for you! You don't have 20+ type of stuff you can get items from , only enemies , crates and piles ( No max items slots or weight too) There are side quest but not so much that you will leave them later on ,  but instead you will most likely do them all.\n\nAn amazing SIMPLE wonderful RPG that deserves your attention.

Too bad the game offers only a short adventure. Although a complete walkthrough can be done under a dozen hours with all sidequests accounted for, War Logs offers replayability thanks to the variety of specialisation it offers along with the choices the player can make during dialogues.\n\nPros:\n-- An interesting story that puts our protagonist, Roy, in the centre of a guild war. Two guilds are battling for the power on Mars where the most valuable source is water. Roy is a prisoner of war who desperately tries to escape the camp he's sent to by joining forces with others to plan the great escape.\n-- Techromancy: The manipulation of electricity. Technomancers are the mages of this RPG. Roy later on obtains this ability and along with combat and stealth the door is open to the 3rd gameplay style.\n\nCons:\n-- Horrid voice acting: Some of the voice acting is just awful. One particular example was when I needed to get rid of someone bothering a farmer. Intimidation was a good way to do that instead of a fight but the actor was so awful that I really felt like loading the last checkpoint and going for a fight. Also, sometimes the texts do not correspond to the sentences uttered. An example of why War Logs feels a rushed development.\n-- Shortness: See the first section. The game is quite short considering it's an RPG. They could have included a couple of more missions and one or two extra chapters. The ending also felt rushed and while the epilogue was satisfying I thought the game could have offered a better antagonist.\n-- Companions: Just like in Mass Effect you have companions. Sometimes one and sometimes two. The problem with them is that they die. All the time. I played the game on normal difficulty and a couple of hours into the game the enemies were so strong that they immediately took out my companion.\n-- Taking sides: Again, a similarity with Mass Effect. You can take the good or the bad path. But what exactly is the result of this? I could not really find out as I became good but did something at one point that immediately rendered me neutral. This could have been more refined.\n\nWell, I have more negative bulletpoints but make no mistake War Logs is an entertaining RPG. Coming from an indie developer it is a plus. Do give it a try if it has a discounted price.","March 8, 2014","true","10.3"," 66 of 76 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","66","76","0","0"

On a Mars that's been cut away from Earth for decades, Roy "Temperance" is an Aurora soldier stuck in Abundance P.O.W. Camp 19 that wishes to escape back to his home city of Shadowlair, just to find out the Technomancers have taken over the government.\n\nPros: Good base story that reflects a rich universe, much larger than the span of the game. While the graphics themselves are sub-par for 2013, the aesthetics are excellent, showing a dry planet built from scraps where people have obviously grown beyond their resources and no supplies are expected. Combat gameplay works well and prevents you from just going flailing about or shooting all in sight: you need to think and react properly to the different ranged or close-ranged attacks, blocking, leaping and hitting when the time is right, and the A.I. actually does a great job at becoming much more strategic and challenging at higher difficulty levels. Also, ranged weapons are under-powered, a good thing as it forces you to make use of the melee combat mechanics. There is an interesting, although limited, crafting system for upgradable items.\n\nCons: The voice acting and cut scenes are bad, and I mean it: out of sync voices, long awkward pauses between character reactions or interruptions, bad character animation, all so much more dated than the game itself is. The maps feel just as dated: floor surface is polygony, there is no climbing or jumping over 1 inch obstacles, invisible walls and "decorative" stairways or ledges your character should so obviously be able climb on, it reminds me of the one thing I hated in the map layout of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The story is rushed, as so many concepts are introduced or teased at but get no development whatsoever. There is barely any equipment you can purchase (a few suits and a few sticks, some of which are not upgradable).\n\nVerdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget it\n\nI wish I could recommend this game, but in all honesty it's not that good. The writers obviously wanted to bite on much more than they could chew, as the game introduces concepts meant to rival the biggest modern RPGs or sci-fi stories out there: Mars being cut from Earth, futuristic guild wars, mysterious ruins from the first colonists, serum (body fluid) being used as currency, that and so much more gave the game a lot of potential, none of which is exploited in a significant way and all end up falling flat. Still, the setting might be enough to get me to look into the upcoming spin-off The Technomancer, hoping it'll be any better.\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","August 24, 2015","false","42.0"," 70 of 96 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","70","96","3","0"

Yet I am somewhat disappointed with it. There is so so so much potential for story of this game but it just misses its mark. I think with a better budget and studio and with perhaps a different name, this game could have been huge. The plot/story starts off really well is so very interesting but this drops off rather quickly. It's still interesting, but the depth drops and the plot starts to feel somewhat half formed, before dropping out completely with a sudden ending. It feels like there needs to be a sequel, to fully round things up.\n\nThis may seem like a criticism rather than a recommendation, but I want people to play it and see exactly what I mean about the beautiful artwork, interesting concept and huge potential for this game despite the misgivings.

Very story-driven, that means NO for open world experience. But there are none good tale as well. Just a decent action part in narrow tunnel of somewhat "noir" agenda.\n\nIn truth, game isn't all bad, it's just mediocre. But I'm freaked out by how it is presenting itself there on Steam: "An Intense Cyberpunk Rpg On the Red Planet!" While it is really telling about humans on the fourth planet, it is as far from cyberpunk, as me from being a wealthy man. And "Intense" means it is very short and linear. Not a good point to present for decent "story rich" RPG, you agree?\n\nI'm going to tell you about my experience with the Mars: War Logs, so there will be some minor spoilers. Sorry for that, if you don't want any spoilers - don't read any reviews on that game before playing! But I suggest you to look the other way, there are plenty of games of much greater value.\n\nThere are many comparisons for this game to others. Somehow, Mars: War Logs are truly looks sometimes like Mass Effect or Star Wars KOTOR 2... But these moments are rare and second-handed at best. In other words, all what is that game going to show you - already been somewhere.\n\nTake a first act, for example: you are in the prison, and you're going to make escape from there. By stealing a train, for that you need some guy at generator, and some guy from the guard. And weapons. Funny, but ALL of these were in russian game Planet Alcatraz (2009), where you also starting at the prison, and gotta run out on the train. Only difference is what in Planet Alcatraz you can trust only in yourself in that prison, so you need to choose: either make yourself an electrician, or try to evolve in a guard - to get your hands on weapons and make ways to the train...\n\nOkay, I'm feeling I'm skidded away. Let's forget for a moment all other games, movies or books, in some way similar to our Mars: War Logs. Let's just look at it. For what gaming experience should we pay our money?\n\nStory? Well, it's sketchy. Bleak. At the end of the 2nd act you need to decide whoever party you'll side with. But truly, none of those parties are good choice for you. And, which is more - even that most affecting choice doesn't really changing anything for the player. Maybe except for the game achievement. But we know what genuine achievement hunter want all achievements, so he's gonna play for both parties. I suggest start with the Rebellion, and then for the General, it seems scheduled in that order by the game plot.\n\nWorld? Well, we don't really see Mars. Or participating in war, like it shows in the title. There are decent background, but it is absolutely static. In the worst way. Side-quests are about running from A to B, beating some guys, returning back. After that in point C appears some other quest person, and it's going further, to running to the D point - to beat or scare another bunch of losers. And the most annoying part is what sometimes some scripts aren't working properly, and you unwillingly skipping from A to D point, without even knowing what it was. Example? There are many, but side quests with romance line(s) are coming in mind first.\n\nAs for visual part of showing the life on Mars... well, it's nothing pretty. No John Carter stuff there. Dirty suburbs where we hanging back and forth, that's all you'll gonna see in the whole game.\nSounds are nothing spectacular too. Music is boring and forgettable. And voice acting... it's not That Bad, as some other reviews are pointing, but since all characters in the game are pretty obscure, their voices aren't really helping to bring them some personality. Pity on that.\n\nFinally, action part! Can you fight in this game? Yeah, there are decent battle system. You mashing people with your mace in the right hand and shooting with some nail gun from the left hand. Also you can cast some spells, like electric bolt, or stunning wave. Or you can throw grenades and mines. It helps in the fight, but, since the resources are scarce, you're still need to bash people with the stick. No power-chokes there.\n\nBut then, combat part is decent, but not really good. It is imperceptible at normal fights, but bosses are turning everything down. They are too easy to beat. And even easier to be shot. There are only one out of the line boss fight in the 3rd sequence, where you meet some challenge for the boss. But alas! It's only because of it's health bar, other than that - same boring stuff.\n\nSynopsis:\n\n1) game is not original. Not in the scenario, neither in the action part. And over the most of all, it is treating you not as an associate, a hero of adventure, but strictly as a player clicking the buttons behind the screen. There are no place to dive, it's knee-deep at best.\n\n2) I can suggest you many games of much higher value. Even for the action part, which is the most satysfying in the Mars: War Logs. And I'm not talking about AAA titles, like Mass Effect or Deus Ex. If you are looking for well-written story where your actions are really changing something, try Alpha Protocol. And if you are up to the good trip, try Risen 2&3. And if you are really want a sci-fi story, there are a fine gem of forgotten games, Septerra Core.\n\nAs for marks for Mars: War Logs, it would be 6.5/10, for the effort, and almost working scripts. It is almost a good game. Not worth buying though.","July 28, 2015","false","33.7"," 86 of 142 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","86","142","3","15"

Has all the elements of an rpg (character development, central story with a hero protagonist, etc), except for the extremely linear level design and exploration. The world is divided into hubs, each with 3 or 4 linear maps with repetitive design and art - and this is the one and major drawback of the game.\n\nOtherwise the story is decent, with few branching quests, but with a strong separation between following a tyrant or a peaceful path. The characters are also believable and have a fair developed background with a few options for romance.\n\nGame runs well with no bugs to report. Graphics are average (think last gen console level) but the combat mechanics are solid and the gameplay is fluid.\n\nI recommend the game for player looking for a ~12h RPG with no grand expectation. You will definitely derive enjoyment from the game.","October 4, 2014","true","12.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed it. The combat system was fun to use and adapt to and can make your character look like a total badass if you've got it down, or a blind 10 year old waving a stick if you don't. Hell, maybe you're even a badass blind 10 year old with a stick. In any event, I found the combat very satisfying. As for characters, Roy (The protagonist) was great. I loved the way he sounds, his word choice no matter what option you choose, and just the way he lookes (having a main character with heterochromia just looks cool). I also liked the other characters and how you can influence them and converse. And as far as weaponry goes, you get a huge selection of makeshift, modifiable weapons and explosives.\nI can see why some people might have less praise for this game than myself though, it isn't a typical game like many of us are used to. It's not like any shooter here, and not even that similar to other RPGs like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls. Nonetheless, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good game with a good story, unique combat, and well rounded (and yet somewhat mysterious) characters.\n","November 26, 2014","true","28.6"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

I've only been playing the game for a short time currently but I absolutely love it. If you're a science fiction fan or like games that really pull you into the story, what roleplaying game fanatic doesn't right, then you will really appreciate this title. The game like its namesake takes place on Mars and you play as Roy, a renegade tough guy, who gets inadvertently pulled into an epic story of which I won't get into so as to potentially spoil anything for you. The game is played for the most part in a third person view as you navigate yourself through the environment. There is enjoyable combat and anyone familar with titles like the Batman Arkham games or Sleeping Dogs will feel right at home with the controls as the fighting consists of similiar methods of attack and counterattacks. The roleplay elements of the game seem quite deep as there are many skills and perks that you can apply to upgrade and develope Roy to your particular style of play. Graphically the game is very beautiful...it manages to capture that rugged futuristic cyberpunk style that so many people seem to love. Another thing that I really like is that it's one of those games that doesn't use many load screens. Most of the time the story transitions from normal gameplay to cutscenes then to combat and vice versa seamlessly. Also like any great RPG you have the ability to craft and upgrade your gear. So far I've only scratched the surface of this fantastic title but I am really enjoying it and can't wait to play through to the end.

Think of it as just a sand desert world and you get the idea.\nYou are playing in 3rd person and you have during the normal game only one NPC in your party which always cares himself for his armor and weapon. You only decide the way they fight. I always put them to "defensive".\n\nThe story is understandable and good. The side missions don't look like side missions, it is just so that you are in a situation and can do some things. So I did everything I saw which I could do because I WANTED to do it. There is no "oh my god, another one of these side missions, AGAIN", nope. You just play the game and see the story and do what you want.\n\nThe fights are fair and sometimes you have to do them more than once until you get them done.\nBut the fights are fun. (And there is a quick save, yeah.)\n\nYou have to decide if you kill the guys or not, you decide after each fight\n\nYou don't have 1000 variants how to fight, but enough to not make it boring. And I just liked the different ways. Could not decide which one I like more, switched all the time.\nFirst attack with stealth for the fast first "kill", a bit of rolling and attacking from behind, breaking guards, throwing hand grenades and... ups, sorry guards, did I forget to mention the mines I put down in stealth mode before?\nAfter that a bit of magic, back to melee, win and loot.\n\nThen perhaps changing armor or weapon (that is all you equip) or upgrading one of the two.\nOr handcrafting some grenades, mines or ammo?\n\nI even had sex with one of the girls. Not like in Witcher, just so you know had it. And I liked girl even more after that.\nShe is a bit weird but really nice. I like her. I am weird too, so everything is ok.\nAnd each time she asks "can I do something for you?" you remember that one time and think, man, where is the dialog option for ... you know? ;)\n\nIt took me 15 hours to complete the game.\nBecause the game is a bit repetitive after some hours this is really enough.\nI liked the story, I liked the fights and now, after the finish, I am contended.\n\nThis is for sure not for everyone, and can't even imagine what people will like it,\nbut if you can get it for cheap and like stories and fighting and just do not want to\nread a book today, give this a try.

But good friend of mine, a great RPG lover, gifted it to me, so I gave it a try. Nice, it also has achievements. Well, let's load this thing up, and roll it on the hardest of difficulties (because achievement demands it!!!).\n\nFirst thing you'll notice - lots of orange and brown. Lots and lots of orange and brown. Good God! I know its a game on Mars, but orange and brown coloring is so intensive that after this Red Faction Guerrilla looks like an old black and white movie. It gets tiresome for your eyes sometimes, making occasional grey interiors relaxing... Its not that the graphics is bad, though. Its not perfect, but everything looks very detailed, although facial animation isn't that great. Movement and combat animations are very nice, and my personal favorite is how characters are bouncing of when they strike someone protected with the energy shield.\n\nThe game starts with "Innocence" Smith (who, for the difference, looks like his name, unlike many others in the game), narrating on his way to the prison, like the other cannon fodder from the clan wars. Skiny guy, with a soft voice... Well, since this is a RPG game, I guess experience will make him manly and muscular soon, since the war isn't already... Upon arival, big, fat and ugly welcoming comitee is so happy to see some fresh meat, since he's "grow tired of drillin' same old arses." Enter Roy "Temperance", who saves Innocence's innocence just in time, and he is the character you'll controll, which makes better sense. Roy is also tired of something, tired of being in prison, and with Innocence's help his plan to escape is set in motion.\n\nSimilar to Witcher 2, the game contains 3 large(ish) areas, through which you can explore mostly freely (some small gaps are locked until you get a side quest which leads throught them), but once you finish with the final task in them you can't go back. Besides story driven missions, you also have a bunch of optional tasks, given by the various folks in the world. If you are aiming for the 100% completion you have to chose dialog options carefully, and sometimes actions within those missions.\n\nCompletion of these quests gives you XP points (just like fighting), and every time you level up you'll get 2 skill points and 1 character point. Character points are invested into unlockable perks, which you are unlocking by accomplishing certain tasks during your playthrough (they are unlocking better crafting items, giving you more XP from the defeated opponents, etc), while skill points are invested into one of the 3 skill trees: renegade tree is mostly about sneaking and some dirty fighting techniques; combat tree upgrades your armour and makes you better in melee; and the 3rd tree will be unlocked at the end of the 1st chapter, after you defeat a Technomancer and obtain a power glowe from him. I would advice you to not waste any points into sneaking perks, because stealth in this game is useless, and you'll be able to sneak successfully maybe in the whole 2 places in the game.\n\nCombat is mostly melee focused, although you'll get a gun as well (it can't be equiped, its usable like an ability by mashing a hotkey) plus technomancing powers later on. Pressing "Q" key slows down the action and brings the combat menu, from which you can select your abilities, and you can also tie them to the numerical keys on your keyboard. Over it you can also give the orders to your current follower. Besides blocking, there's also, imo more efficient, dodge roll (and you'll better be upgrading it to the max becase you'll be doing it a lot...). You can break your opponents guard in a couple of ways, including throwing a sand in their faces, and the game even takes in consideration if someone is wearing goggles or a riot helmet (needless to say that this ability is completelly useless vs mutaded creatures with no eyes).\n\nDefeated opponents aren't dead, they are just incapacitated and will get up soon after you pass through that area several times. Near the end of the chapter 1, you'll get a hold of the serum extractor, which will give you the option to finish them off and get some serum (which is a curency in here), but it will lower your reputation which may influence how the enviroment is reacting to you.\n\nSome armour and equipement pieces are having slots (up to 3), which you can upgrade by crafting upgrades on them. Each type of upgrades requires certain amount of resources, which you can scavenge around, including from killed/incapacitated opponents. Via upgrades you can give various bonuses to your equipment, having better protection but with a trade off in another area, getting more damage to your weapons but being more susceptible to attacks, getting better chances to cause various crits like bleeding, stun, etc.\n\nNow regarding its difficulty. To say that this game is super-cheap is an understatement. On the easiest difficulty level you can run through it in just 5 hours, with completing all of the side quests (it also includes considerable amount of the backtracking), and its probably the only level on which your follower is semi-useful. On harder levels - its a nightmare. Except in the couple of side quests, where you'll be combating a single opponent, on every other occasion you'll be outnumbered and outgunned. Vastly. The best you can hope from your companion is that he will attract 2 or 3 opponents, while you are trying to deal with the rest of the gang. Once he is down you'll end up with a tail of 5-6+ thugs chasing you around, while you are rolling and dodging their attacks, desperately trying to make sucker punches with hit and run tactics...\n\nLike that isn't hard enough, the game is also glitchy, with devastating Technomancer shock attacks heat-seaking you through the walls. Also, you get hit if you don't dodge early. Even if you can clearly see that the model isn't touching you, somehow their claws/teeth/bats end up on your face. The game is so unforgivingly hard sometimes, it will really make you to think about your tactics and equipment. You'll be often changing your armour upgrades to suit the curent situation, trading damage sponge enforced metalic plates which are useless vs Technomancer's electrical attacks, to more shock resistant upgrades but they are offering less protection against physical attacks (at very least those cannot reach you through the wall...). Not to mention that happens when you load a quicksave where you were sneaking pass sleeping guards they end up awaken...\n\nOverall, its cheap but not that bad. It offers two endings, interesting dialogs, and I had some 10 hours of fun in my overall playtime, but the rest was a chore. For its price (especially on the sale) it may offer you your moneys worth, if you don't have anything better to play. But, as I said, I would never buy it myself, and I gave a thumbs down to some far better produced games than this (Crysis 2), so taking these things in consideration I think it would be a little bit unfair to say that I'm recommending it. Which is really a shame, because you can't get rid of the feeling like its overambitious, and a huge wasted opportunity.\n\nBesides somewhat interesting main theme, the rest of the soundtrack is generic and repeatable. I would recommend "Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine" album in the background while playing this. Accidentally, friend of mine linked this album to me while I was playing, and for some reason it went nicely with the game.","July 9, 2014","false","23.4"," 57 of 105 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","57","105","0","2"

The worst of these is the voice acting, it's terrible and the game would have benefited with just text. At times the voice work verges on parody, badly stilted and it makes you wonder if English was the actor’s first language.\n\nNot only does the voice work detract from the game but the writing doesn't help. There's a good story hidden away somewhere but you have to dig deep to find it.\n\nThe biggest frustration however is with the combat, which is best described as the worst aspects of Risen crossed with the worst aspects of The Witcher. I played and completed the game on 'Extreme' difficulty mode which only highlights the problems, early on the game turns into a mini game of rolling around in circles desperately trying to regenerate health. The lack of weapon choice, a long stick with some additions doesn't change throughout the game but thankfully later on the technomancer skill tree opens up and allows for a bit more choice in combat. It's not perfect but helps break up the monotony of the combat in the first chapter\n\nThe UI and inventory system is also badly thought out, forcing you to craft one item at a time. On later levels you might want twenty health kits and have to painstakingly click through the system twenty times. Like Risen there is also no weight limit meaning you can pick up as many items as you wish which leads just grabbing everything. I had so many items at the end of the game that had no real use.\n\nNext up is the reputation system which is basic with what appears to be three different reputation levels, Good, Neutral and Bad. I hit the bad reputation early on and even though I killed as many people as I could I didn't go any further than bad. I'm not sure of the effects that reputation has on the game, I didn't notice any major changes to the way I was treated, the game says Merchants treat you worse but then Merchants aren't needed at all.\n\nSo what are the positives and why I am recommending it? Well the setting of Mars is well realised and the background lore is new and fairly interesting. The fluff is interesting enough to read through the diary excerpts and information about the various locations and characters. It also moves along at a nice pace and just when one area gets boring it moves onto the next.\n\nThere is something that I enjoyed; I just can't really put my finger on it. There's a lot of potential here and if we ever see a sequel and they iron out the various issues then it could turn into a great series.","December 13, 2013","true","18.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","2"

Sound is fine and as I mentioned fighting system might be weird but it is playable.

In what I thought (from what I saw from the previews) was a simple hack then dodge, then dodge, then dodge again game I was slightly mistaken. Yes there is dodging, however there is a point to it. The storyline behind the game is an interesting one as you slowly discover what's going on around you and at this Mars prison camp.\n\nGameplay is as follows, 3rd person view with the ability to use a variety of weapons from a pipe tube, to a nail gun, to landmine explosives, to throwing sand in someones eye, to throwing grenades etc... Having options in any game is good and in this one you are able to buy a variety of weapons. My personal favorite is throwing sand at people as the only game I remember being able to do that is Assassins Creed ( which I never used it in ). Anyway besides having a multitude of things to choose from, the game play is somewhat consistent as multiple weapons provide for different tactics, and of course different opponents need different sort of lovin'.\n\nVisual graphics are stunning and are probably as top line as you can get for 2014. Although the graphics are cool at first it seems the game has some frame issues but just may be my computer, but that just may be the way the game is. At first glance it's noticeable but as the game goes on it becomes negligible.\n\nNow... what do I give a game that seems like people cared for it - but all the while keeping in mind something like this has been done before? An average rating for an average game to be blunt. Some will enjoy playing it, others won't. I'd give it a higher rating if there were objects in game that could be picked up and used randomly.\n\n7.3/10\n\n\n*note, some parts are ridiculously meticulous and require some serious fire power. Going in with a metal rod ain't going to cut taking on a few enemies at a time.","September 16, 2014","true","2.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's got a big game room on the bottom floor with a big screen TV, Pinball, and arcade. Fully furnished. Comes with a big pool and 6 cars in this really big mechanics-like garage. You go in the house, see all this stuff, and are in awe of the awesomeness of it all. But eventually you realize that everything is made out of cardboard. Yea, you can say you have all this stuff, but it doesn't work and it doesn't even look good in the house. Its just a really nice house with the idea of cool stuff in it. That's how I feel about this game.\n\nThere's a really cool crafting system, but coupled with the really bad fighting makes it seem like a waste. I keep seeing tips about relationships with your partner, but I never saw this in game. You can't level up your partner, can't give them better equipment, can't give them weapons, nor can you even heal them in battle. They give you the ability to give commands, but its bare commands like "attack the closest" or "attack who I'm attacking." All really good ideas, but none of it actually works.\n\nThe story is a really nice idea, but it feels off. I realized at the beginning that I shouldn't expect much though. When a game doesn't take the time to name a pretty promient character shows the lack of shine on the story. When the game starts you fight "the fat guy" in a prison who's so well known in the prison that he has been giving everyone trouble for a long time. Yet the character has no real name. Every one just says, oh I heard you took out "the fat guy."\n\nThe fighting system in the game, is also lacking. The "magic" isn't very good, and the fighting style isn't polished. It reminded me of the way Arkham games do fighting, except there's no flow to the fights. It's like they said 'here's what we want, and we'll put in the basics, then go back and fix it up'. But then never went back and tried to fix it.\n\nAll in all the game was, lacking. It's a good idea, but that's about all.","July 30, 2014","false","8.7"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","25","46","0","0"

Story takes place on planet called Mars, in time of war and poverty that followed soon after the colonization. Story is about different groups of people fighting for control over the land and resources.\n\nRPG element includes three character skill trees, perk system, weapon and armor modification and crafting of support, utility items (like medkits, explosives, etc.). You have a variety of abilities available, some allow you to enchant weapons, others protect you from damage like electric shield, some do damage or stun enemies like arc lightning shock, etc.\n\nYou mainly use melee weapons, like metal pipes modified with different attachments you make with metal scraps and hardware found throughout the game. Ranged combat is really limited to one shot nail guns, grenades or Technomancer electric abilities. You can craft and place traps, that are useful if you're surrounded by enemies.\n\nThere's decent amount of missions and side missions available, some have choice and effect element, so pick your answers wisely. Good amount of voiced dialogues. Reputation system in game was a bit weird, I didn't change from Neutral all game, though I didn't do anything bad, nor did I juice the downed enemies. Main currency in the game is pretty much human blood, as far as I understand, and was kind of weird.\n\nYou can have followers in game, five in total, two of those can be chosen by joining one or other group of people, one is partially available and two are available pretty much throughout the whole game. Two males and three females as far as I could tell. You can romance females, if someone wondering, though there's nothing special, just hugging and groping.\n\nVisually game looks poorly, a lot of low resolution textures for 2013 game, model quality is bad, animations are poor, voice over quality is decent. Game has a lot of glitches, texture clipping, hovering objects, bad lighting and other sort of things that could be fixed in post-production.\n\nOverall game was fun experience, but lacked serious polish. Some missions were hilarious, I also liked typos in text that made no sense, and weird naming for drugs and nurses advice for cutting someone's jewels off. Don't know if it was intended, but apparently you can bed both female followers and then chose which one you like more.","August 15, 2015","true","11.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

This game is pretty much a standard action rpg, designed with consoles in mind. Story is pretty nice, characters are interesting, but the setting is great. I really loved the brown, postapocalyptic Mars landscapes. You have customization of your weapon/armor, you can craft various things and advance your skills in three trees (pretty much stealth, craft / melee / magic). The game itself is pretty linear, there is no open world, and most of the locations are narrow, so if you expect open world gameplay, pass on the game.\nWhat i really loved is the amount of time the playthrough takes: 15 hours. It is ideal in my opinion, the game does not get boring and does not end too quickly.\nThe game is not ideal at all, as every aspect of it lacks something (limited options of crafting, skills, choices etc.), but it does not make it a bad game.\n\nSo, if you don't like corridor like levels, lack of open world and a bit limited options, pass on the game.\nHowever, if you don't mind these things, want a game that will take you about 15 hours and love the setting, try it out, i recommend it.","January 3, 2015","true","13.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Hard difficulty meant rolling around on the ground for minutes while getting an occasional hit in with melee weapons.  I just wanted to stop playing altogether.  Reducing to easy difficulty made the game playable (albeit a bit too easy), and some fun was had.\n\nThere is a monetary system of sorts, but no incentive to sell items.  Nothing available to buy with the cash you could get that you wont find laying around/be given for completing quests.\n\nI read reviews from console players gushing over the graphical qualities; the visuals were nothing more than ordinary.

It’s almost funny, given that solid combat mechanics, decent visuals, and creative and interesting lore should give us something substantial to play with – it’s better than a lot of games do nowdays, right? But it’s the little things like the fact that NPCs are placed at either the bottom or top of every staircase (in the same pose) to stop you from being nosy if you have the audacity to try and interact with the world, or that the dialogue options as they are written don’t match the dialogue that is it spoken – in either text or tone, or that the first two characters we see are two NPCs that use almost the exact same character model, sitting next to one another and performing the exact same looped movement, synchronised perfectly. These things break any immersion the graphical fidelity serves up and leave the game feeling really half-baked.\n\nNot to mention the down-right awful voice acting in parts. “Sorry the dog attacked you, really…” is read as “Sorry. The dog attacked you? Really.” Who, in 2013, was overseeing the development of a game where such obvious issues are overlooked or left uncorrected? And what kind of society are we if we let these basic things wash over us in favour of ‘pretty 1080p widescreen’ and a ‘smooth feeling fight’?\n\nReally this all makes me seem more angry than I was when playing the game - I was mainly just frustrated by the multitude of basic core issues. The game's NOT a piece of crap! It's just average or sub-par in a lot of immediately evident ways. Mars: War Logs seems like it’s trying to be the love child of Mass Effect and Red Faction, but it’s as if the developers thought that the key to the success of an RPG is that ‘they’re set in a far-away place and you get to fight things’, rather than the IMMERSION that the RPG genre is famous for, and the reason that it was created in the first place.","June 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 30 of 58 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","30","58","0","0"

The story is okay I guess, nothing special and super crazy like something you would expect from a game like Mass Effect, but it's... "okay". I liked it.\n\nWhat REALLY drew me in was the fact I could invest skill points into my character, the ability to also not only wear different armor and weapons but also modify them to suit your playstyle, which you need to find parts to do so. You can also romance two women in the game, I won't spoil that though if you plan on playing it. The combat is kinda' hard at first since you seem to have to dodge and roll around a lot to avoid enemy attacks, you can't just go in there and start button mashing because you'll get owned in probably less than a minute.

The story is serviceable--interesting enough to keep your attention, but it doesn't exactly blow your mind.\nThe bad: There's almost no variation between areas visually or mechanically, which isn't too big of an issue due to the length of the game, but is very noticeable.\nCombat gets tedious, since while the mechanics are solid, it often gets repetitive and you only ever fight five real enemy types through the whole game--and one of them quite rarely.  This isn't helped by the fact that some often-traversed areas have respawning enemies, which makes traveling around somewhat of a chore, since you do the exact same fights over and over again.\nThe characters generally feel underdeveloped and oddly-written, and the voice acting for a few characters feels a bit weird (but this is generally not a problem, and Tenacity's voice acting is as good as anything you'd see in other games, all things considered).\nWhile the backstory and world of the game seem very interesting, very little information about them is ever given to the player.  I ended up with questions at the end of the game that I really wanted answered, and I really want to see more fleshing out of this world.  What's there is great, but it's very sparse.\nThe tutorial seems to leave a lot of things out, and a few things regarding the control scheme are completely unclear.  Namely, how to unlock from targets in combat--I couldn't figure this out, so I just stopped using the lock-on all together.\nOverall: It's definitely not a BAD game.  But it's also not a great game.  It's definitely not a game to actively avoid (if it's on sale for a few bucks, I'd go ahead and recommend it full-heartedly), but I wouldn't say you should go too far out of your way for it.  It has a lot of promise but never quite cashes in on it, and I would absolutely love to see another game set in the same world that goes into much more detail about the world itself.\n\nI'm going to click the "recommend" button because I did, at the end of the day, have fun playing Mars: War Logs.  Not the most fun ever, but enough to justify the time I spent on it.

Tried to continue my previous game - where I'd done nothing but beat up the fat man - and somehow I was transported to the Epilogue for the Resistance path. Free achivement! Rather wierd.\n\nStarted a new game and was pleased to see the voice stuff was resolved. I'm sure I remember it being bad, maybe I am thinking of another game. Or maybe it was fixed who knows.\n\nAnyhoo, this is a pleasent RPG. It's not ground breaking, and suffers from being a 3D game that is strangely 2D (for example no paths cross each other at other levels), and it's far too fond of little invisible walls that stop you going into doorways and so on. And you can't jump.\n\nGraphically, it's not the best you'll ever see, but it does a nice enough job of depiciting a ramshackle Mars. In fact, the thing that annoyed me most was that you couldn't look up properly, so when you encounter giant cranes, towers and shields over the settlements you can't actually get a good look at them.\n\nVoice acting was great, and the audio wasn't bad overall.\n\nStorywise, it's a decent story, with a few marring jolts here and theres.

The combat is kinda' hard at first since you seem to have to dodge and roll around a lot to avoid enemy attacks, you can't just go in there and start button mashing because you'll get owned in probably less than a minute. Should've called this Mars: Enemy Dodging Simulator 2013. Also your partner barely helps you, if anything he's only useful if you plan on using him as a way to distract the enemy (at least I think so). The game is also extremely short, yes.... I beat this game in 16 hours, that also includes most of the sidequests, if not all of them. Crazy right?\n\nBut anyways, there is a sequel (or prequel) coming out called "The Technomancer", and it looks pretty damn good. As for this game, if you plan on playing it just play it without any high expectations whatsoever, understand this is a.... I guess you could say "Budget" game.","May 30","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting isnt that great and the word arent in sync with the character's lip movement. The combat is solid, it isnt the best but it does the job. The story is basic and the skill tree and leveling up system is good. AI is pretty good but the cutscenes arent that great. This game isnt a normal RPG its different because of the 3 main things- Combat, Renegade, and Technomancy (I honestly prefer Combat and Technomancy but thats just my opinion) you can level up these 3 skills and it important because each one changes your gameplay experience.\n\nCombat- 3/5\nStory-3/5\nVoice Acting-2/5\nSkill Tree/Leveling Up System-4/5\nAI- 3/5\nCutscenes- 2/5\n\nIts a game that is pretty good and i recommend it for anyone who is into RPG'S, i give it a 8 out of 10.\n\nAlso its impressive that such a small company can make a pretty good RPG and you will get about 11 hours of content.","October 28, 2014","true","11.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It is a Spiders game so you should go into it knowing what you're getting.  If you were a fan of their other RPGs (Of Orcs and Men, Game Of Thrones, etc) then you'll probably be able to overlook the simple combat and weird mechanics.  The Mars setting is unique for a game of this type, and the game is overall competent enough.  The voice acting was terrible but that comes with the Spiders brand as well.  The story was decent and had a solid conclusion with two separate endings creating two different final chapters.  The world building and the Technomancer idea is unique enough that it's worth checking out but be aware the gameplay is a little janky.  Hopefully their followup "Technomancer" will fix some of the gameplay hiccups and give this universe the game it deserves.","February 8, 2015","true","8.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It has very similar mechiancs, and a very similar combat system. While I can't say it succeeds, it's definitely very enjoyable.\n\nThe graphics aren't very impressive, and Mars is very monotonous and boring to look at.\nThe combat is fun and sometimes challenging, though since there are only a few different enemy types it gets repetitive fast.\nThe voice acting on most characters is pretty bad, and the dialogues aren't very well written for the most part, but they do the job in telling the story. There is a companion romance option, but it's so badly written it feels like they put it in last minute just to make sure the game has a sex scene. "Hey I like you" - "Oh I like you too, and now that we're finally alone with the entire crew watching, wanna f**k?" TRUE LOVE.\n\nThat being said, the story and the world are interesting and well crafted. A lot of thought was clearly put into the backstory, and I did feel intrigued to know what happens next at every point in the game.\nThe RPG elements are all there, some better than others. There's also a morality system but its effect on the game is so tiny that it really doesn't matter if you're "good" or "bad" (i.e. if you're bad you get more money, but if you're good shops sell to you for less. Ends up exactly the same... and doesn't matter either way since there is no reason to buy anything in the shops anyway). There is a significant choice to make at the end of the 2nd act which does alter the story, and isn't as obvious as good/bad, so I did enjoy that one.\nI really like the weapon customising system. It was new and innovative - You start with a pipe or iron bar or something like that, and you craft it according to your will. Add a sharp piece at the top and you have an axe, put a brick there and it's a club. Put iron on the bottom if you want a hilt, or leather if you want a better grip.\n\nOverall this game reaches far and doesn't quite get there, but it's definitely worth the ride. Hell, if they ever make Mars: War Logs 2, I'll probably buy it as well.","March 29, 2015","true","10.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Don't waste your time or money on it like I did.\n\nNormally I'd say that bad gameplay can be made up for by a good story, but in this case both are equally abysmal. Fighting largely consists of kiting enemies around for long amounts of time waiting for your health to regen so you can risk getting another hit in. This is exacerbated by the fact that any ability other than melee is worthless. For example, by my count there are about 100 total nailgun ammo shots that you can pickup throughout the entire campaign (and it's the only gun) but it would take about 20 shots to actually kill a single enemy. The other abilities are similarly worthless. Fighting becomes a chore best avoided, and you can't respec your abilities, so if you commit to one that doesn't apply - e.g. you have points in stealth when a big battle is forced upon you - you can be screwed and have to replay a checkpoint for hours until you get lucky enough to edge by. The NPC's also die in just a couple hits, so there's no help. It's like they didn't try to balance this game at all. Or worse, they purposefully didn't want anyone to have fun playing it.\n\nThe story isn't even worth mentioning. The writing, the voice acting, everything is just at the worst caliber imagineable.\n\nEven mediocre RPG's or third person action games are better than this. I'm baffled at how it got funded and made.","June 10, 2014","false","20.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The combat it's a little bit wonky but it works, the customization and leveling system are done in a interesting way, i enjoy the fact that when you change something in your armor/weapon it shows a different plate or handle because of the changes you made to that object.\nI think the major issues of this game come from the low production costs that it had, you will see a lot of repeated NPC's with nothing to say, the voice acting sometimes is great sometimes not (for ♥♥♥♥ sake Mary...), the story ends in a abrupt way.\nBut it has strong points as well for example the decisions you make will have a strong impact in the outcome of your playthrough and graphically i found the game for the most part well modelled with good lighting effects.\nPick it up on a sale, but don't expect a massive world like Skyrim, or Mass Effect or even Dragon Age.\n\nIt's a solid game.","October 14, 2015","true","13.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Of Orcs And Men was a sleeper hit for me personally. It was a game with terrific graphics and fun and exciting gameplay. Yes, it was light on the RPG elements, but that didn't matter. It was truly fun. Mars War Logs has none of that fun and exciting gameplay, and comes across as dull. First of all, the graphics are decent. They're in no way similar to the graphics in other RPGs or even OOAM, but that's to be expected for a budget game. It's perfectly understandable and they're perfectly serviceable.\n\nBesides, it has lots of stuff that other RPGs have as well. Think of crafting and sidequests, for example. But it all feels so similar to a low quality version of OOAM, I just can't help it. The interface reminds me of it, the way the story is cut up in chapters, the quick-skill menu, you name it. It's all feels the same, but... cheaper. The voice acting for the main characters is decent, but for most of the other characters it's just terrible. The quests, however, are somewhat fun so it's not all bad.\n\nMars War Logs should take about 7-8 hours to finish. And that's including all or most of the sidequests. So it's not that long, but still long enough to keep you entertained.\n\nIf I had to make a decision I'd pick up Of Orcs And Men, but, then again... that's me.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","April 28, 2013","true","8.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It gets you through, at least, and lets you concentrate on the atmosphere and setting, which are somewhat unique and interesting.","March 17, 2014","true","11.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

As does the random encounters which are quite hard in fact most of the "big" fights are in fact easier than the random ones. Also the amount of equipment in the game seems rather limited and has very little to do with modern much less sci-fi concepts I spend most of the game running around with a metal pipe with what was basically a nail through it. Finally the biggest flaw of the game is it tends to forget to teach the player the consequences of using ingame mechanics, apparantly to be "good" in the game you shouldn't kill (do forget that we knocked the guy down with a barrage of 7 inch nail darts and several massive blows to the skull), however if you do kill you gain more money, when this mechanic is introduced it isn't explained that you just knocked everyone senseless up to know (except animals which you apparantly kill).\n\nOn the up side the game autosaes quite often before fights so you can redo them, the dialogues are fully voiced and feel more natural than most RPG dialogues and the dialogue choices actually fit well with what is being said (I am looking disapproving at you mass effect) and there are sometimes everal different ways to handle a situation. the combat mechanics are solid and doesn't change wildly from one fight to the next with two exceptions, other than that the enemies mostly stay the same in terms of tactics while you gain new combat skills and improve your old ones.\n\nAll in all I will give this game a 7 out of 10.\n\nThis game is a joyful little trip to a post apocalypotic world.","January 10","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't think I see many games based around Mars, with that, they did a decent job.\nFast Pace Combat\nGood menu system overall for doing quests and such.\nLimited resources which makes the game feel challenging.\n\nCons:\nThe story was okay, but felt very rushed while a lot is explained it's own version (War Logs) of it's Codex; I feel the game should have explained this in a bit more detail.  Roy the main character of the story is still a mystery to me and a lot details wasn't revealed about him.  Wheather or not this was intentionally, he just felt empty of a character.\n\nAs for other characters, except for the first character/party member Innocence everyone's story felt rushed.  Mary the other character is the only othjer one that didn't feel too rushed as her storyline was cut and dry.\n\nFor other aspects of the story, it really felt rushed and while I could tell I was near the end, the final moments felt really anticlimatic.  Romance options are in this game but they too, are very rushed and other than a few dialog options, They're easily romance and don't build up to the point of snoo very well.  Wanna go out?  Sure? Ok that's that.\n\nShort game under 20 hours and VERY linear aside from a few side quests.\nCombat and such is cut and dry while there's a few tactical things you can do it's more near a button masher for most of the fights.  Sometimes hit detection wouldn't hit on enemies.\n\nOverall not a bad knock off of Mass Effect but there's a LOT of room for improvement.

The moebius-esque images of the "technomancers" with the total recall setting of mars really caught my attention.\n\nThe truth is this game is the proof that small studios should not do "open-world/areas" RPG games.\n\nCONS:\n\n* NPCs: The game presents you with small areas, supposedly cities full of NPCs, but reallity is they dont feel like cities at all. NPCs are no better than crate boxes just standing there, they stay in the same position 24/7, they don't even react when you are fighting enemies 1m away from them. The only NPCs you can talk to, are marked in the minimap so that you can rush directly to them, they are normaly vendors or quest involved characters, 3 or 4 per big area, and are very shallow and uninteresting characters. You'll forget them immediately.\n\n* Quests: Quests normally are take this item to the other end of the city, or kill this guy and come back, which you get really bored of at the third time, even if they try to call the objective something else.\n\n* Maps: The minimap is horribly implemented, to the point I try not to use it, even though it is essential for not hitting dead-ends while you run around the city, dead-ends are extremely common and add to the destroying of the city feeling, there's normally just 1 or 2 paths from point A to point B.\n\nNormally, when you start a new area, you can open your minimap and guess which of the areas will have enemies (it's always the ones which look like big rooms for you to roll around to avoid enemy attacks, opposing to the rest of the city, which are just corridors). For some reason I really don't understand, each city, or area, is divided by some shut-doors, or barricades, which you have to interact with in order to advance. They introduce no apparent loading-time, so they just break even more the feeling of being in a real city.\n\n* Enemies: Enemies for some reason know you are a threat, even though they have no way of knowing it, at least in the early stages of the game. They just attack you on sight. There's some enemy respawn too, I'm not sure how does it work, but it is very annoying when you have cleaned a now full of enemies area less than 10 minutes ago.\n\nPROS:\n\n* Fights/Crafting/Skill Tree: The fighting is melee based, where shooting is just a special ability. This, along with the crafting abilities and the skill tree, are very decent. They all remind me of The Witcher 2, they are very similar. The fights, even in normal difficulty are tough, you die a lot, which require you to do somekind of planning or preparation before confronting enemies.\n\n* Plot: If you can ignore all this gameplay wrecks the game presents, the story is somewhat interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel like this game could have been incredible if more depth had been added to it, but I have to say I do not recommend it. I got it for 2.65€ in Steam sales and I still payed more than what it's worth.","April 18, 2014","false","9.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The PC port is especially atrocious, given that it does not even consider that one might use a mouse and keyboard instead of a gamepad. The fighting is somewhat similar to Dragon Age 2 or Batman: Arkham City, yet less engaging than either of those, as it has a targeting system that loses track of the enemy constantly.

Some have deemed it the "poor man's Mass Effect" but this is incredibly misleading as the similarities between the two games stop at the sci-fi setting.\n\nWhen I finished the game I found myself wondering how I made it from start to finish without utterly giving up on it. If it wasn't because the game is only 10 - 15 hours long then the only other reason I could come up with is that the game really makes you ponder what it could've been if it had come from a more experienced developer with a bigger budget.\n\nAll the usual trappings of an RPG are present but none of them feel particularly fleshed out or provide any kind of depth. The combat harks back to the "old school" style of pause-and-play (ala Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age: Origins, etc) but beyond the fact that you can pause and then choose an ability none of the other aspects of the style are there. On top of this, while the game allows you to have a companion character you can't choose their attacks, outfit them with weapons/armor, or even take control of them in any way other than choosing their "stance".\n\nA dialogue system is also in place but a lot gets lost in translation - literally. Since the developer is French the game is localized for anything else and it's terribly done. You'll find countless examples of this when your character says something that doesn't even kind of sound like your selection and/or when another character reacts to you in a seemingly opposite or confusing manner. Additionally it doesn't help that the voice actors bring disgustingly wooden performances to the table as well.\n\nThe inventory system is barebones (perhaps 4 different sets of "armor" and maybe 6 weapons), the crafting/upgrading system is totally out of whack, despite having skill trees to that branch into RPG archetypes (rogue, warrior, magic user) the game almost seems to want you to max out everything and use everything in one playthrough, a romance system is there but is so poorly done it's easy to find yourself not knowing it's even there at all or glitching it/breaking it yourself, and finally the story (while pretty unique) is at times confusing, ill-paced, and withholding.\n\nHow/why did I finish this game? In the end perhaps it was it was a strange desire to see a good idea shoot itself in the foot with poor development and virtually no QA. Mars: War Logs is a yet another example of something that could've been great, that wanted to be great, but just couldn't.","July 2, 2013","false","12.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

To me it seems the creators either didn’t know how to or simply couldn’t decide what to focus on.  The characters while unique in some ways are not well written and are easily forgotten.  The plot while trying to be edgy in some parts is just plain gone in others.  Oh and the writing, how many games have adult relationships described by 10 year olds.

This isnt a bad game but it isnt particularly good either. It shines in the first half introducing a Sci-fi prison break sequence which is of great enjoyment but a tad long. During the first chapter you are introduced to a limited skill tree with either Brute or rogue as your choices becuase mage is left till you exit part 1. Story wise I actually really liked this game but the story left a longing for the epic backdrop painted in so many conversations. the war logs sounds like it should have an epic lore, but your left with a very mysterious character who never really gains a solid back story, in an environment that never seems to be more than a few blocks in the back of a big city. This man is trying to find freedom as a nomad rather than a techromancer, relying on his skills in combat to keep him out of trouble. The combat in the game was rather basic, assassins creed-esc parry, attack system, with crafting on the side. Overall this game is a nice pickup at a low price if your looking for a sci-fi rpg that is out of the ordinary. 5/10 Exceige","October 22, 2013","false","8.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game's rough edges give it that charming underground indie band feeling, and I loved just about every minute of it.  Give me fifty titles just like this before giving me ONE Call of Duty.  Could this game have somehow possibly been better?  Sure, but so could your mom last night, but she's still worth paying for.

The gameplay reminded me of KOTOR, while the overall story was unique and a bit refreshing. The equipment in the game is fitting, if limited. However, the upgrades are what makes the gear. I felt a bit limited by the linear story, but there was enough detail in the extra info to help flush out the story some. The dialogue was probably the worst part of the game, which did limit me from really -liking- any particular character. I also didn't feel that following a good/bad path really affected the game all that much.\n\nOverall, Mars: War Logs just missed the bar from being an excellent game. However, if you are a scifi/rpg fan, I highly recommend giving it a playthrough.","May 19, 2014","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, there is something interesting going on here that is worth a look for fans of Knights of the Old Republic I & II and similar games.  If you go in with a low price and low expectations it can help tide you over until the next good CRPG comes along.\n\nWhile unpolished is the word of the day, there's something valuable under the ugly surface.  This game does not have intricate character leveling, crafting, or combat systems.  It's world is not fleshed out, and it's characters are not compelling.  However, in each of these elements there exists a good idea heading in an interesting direction.  It's just not there yet.  In truth this game could have used a year or more of development.

No they have to constantly reuse skins and areas but then again so did the original mass effect and dragon age 2. For a small company, this game is really well done. It has a littl bit of everything but not so big as to be cumbersome. A little crafting, a combat design, character devolopment and it does a unique job to portray mars.

If they would of spent (like i said earlier) maybe a few more months on this game, to give the graphics more "mmph", better optimize the game overall, fix the VO, add more skill tree depth, fine tune the combat system, and anyother things i may have missed, i would pay more than 3$ for it, but the way it is, im glad i only paid 3$. but ill still recommend it for those looking for something to kill the time to get over your 3 week SWTOR binge, while dinner cooks, or while waiting for your coffee to finish brewing. but do yourself a favor, and get it while its on sale if you are considering buying it.","March 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, there is something interesting going on here that is worth a look for fans of Knights of the Old Republic I & II and similar games.  If you go in with a low price and low expectations it can help tide you over until the next good CRPG comes along.\n\nWhile unpolished is the word of the day, there's something valuable under the ugly surface.  This game does not have intricate character leveling, crafting, or combat systems.  It's world is not fleshed out, and it's characters are not compelling.  However, in each of these elements there exists a good idea heading in an interesting direction.  It's just not there yet.  In truth this game could have used a year or more of development.

It has a littl bit of everything but not so big as to be cumbersome. A little crafting, a combat design, character devolopment and it does a unique job to portray mars. I just wish it had a better title, Mars: War Logs is not a great title idea I'm afraid lol.

The ideas are fresh and the story is original enough to keep you interested.\nThe upgrade crafting is great and makes you think about what you want on your gear.\n\nAll in all, this game delivers everywhere it should, gives surprises where you least expect and doesn't fail to make you feel like a badass when needed.","August 15, 2014","true","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/walpulgiss/recommended/232750/","walpulgiss","Walpulgiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/walpulgiss/","141 products in account","I'll give the short version first. :)\n\nThe best way to describe this game is:\nImagine the spawn of a brief torrid threesome affair between The Witcher (the gameplay/combat), Fallout 3 (the atmosphere) and Mass Effect (the story setting). Take out a bit of awesomeness from it. Add the russian guy from GTA IV (on acid) as the protagonist aaaaaand...\nCongratulations!... It's a "Mars: War Logs"! :D\n\nSo, this is a "safe" game... It picks up on stuff used succesfully countless times on other games of the same genre and repeats them competently. It doesnt have any "great new features", the maps or the history arent huge master pieces. Actually the questline that goes along with the story is pretty straightforward and the maps are short and simple.\nBut the graphics are pretty great, the game is well built all arround and it's fun!\nI mean.. Werent you furstrated when you ended The Witcher, or Fallout 3, or Mass Effect? I admit i got lost and purposeless! I was loving the games and they ended... So, i know it's not the same, but with this game you can pick up from that "orphan" feeling those great games left you with and keep the fun going a little while.\n\nAnd for the money it costs... It's worth it!\n\n7/10\n\n\nNow, the boring and long version.\n\nSo, this is the tipical 3rd person action RPG that takes role in an improbable future where mars was colonized and, naturally, there's conflict because every "major power" wants a piece of it. You start as a POW, inprisoned far behind enemy lines. As you work your way out of the prison, and after, running from your former cagers, you start unfolding a deeper plot concerning older inhabitants and their powerfull knowledge... Bla bla... Cliche... De ja vu... And "play it yourself to find out". ;)\n\nYou'd expect that a game happening in a future far planet has all sort of advanced weapons, rayguns, guided missiles and stuff but.... no... Its more like "Post apocaliptic future in mars", so you'll use mostly pipes, hachets, bones and such as weapons. Combat is mainly melee, ranged weapons are used more like a complement in combat and later in game you'll develop some "technomancer" powers. These are basicaly "Sorcerer's magic" but based on technology.\n\nI think the rate this game got with the critics is unfair. The game is not "epic" (as the graphics might suggest) but is very decent entertainment.\nThe story is engaging. The character leveling up keeps gameplay fresh and interesting. New skill and abilities are meaningfull and will keep you focused. As gameplay is concerned, you'll find it very familiar overall and will constantly relate to similar features in other games.\nThe characters are built well enough, although i confess i hasnt able to create any "deep emotional connection" to them. It was hard to feel empathy and maybe because of that i never really connected to the game atmosphere.\n\nConcluding, the game has all elements to keep you interested for a while (if you are into this kind of game). But you must be carefull and dont fall to the tempation of comparing this games to the "giants" of the genre or you might end up feeling and thinking the same as the critics that rated this game with a 5/10.\n\nAs mentioned earlier: a solid 7/10","August 10, 2014","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Graphics and sound are both pretty good.  The story isn't groundbreaking, but it's far from horrible.  My only real gripes are about the controls and dialog / voice acting.\nFrom the beginning of the first chapter, this seemed like a promising effort from what I thought was an indie developer.  A few minor things, like stilted dialog, oddly-paced voice acting, and some weird collision issues niggled at me, but I was willing to overlook those as necessary evils of an indie game.  Then the second chapter started.  A single scene at the beginning displays possibly the worst voice acting I've seen in a video game -- you'll know it when you see it.  From that point on, I couldn't help but be painfully aware of every weird turn of phrase and every moment of odd prosody.\n\nFortunately, the mechanics and combat are fairly solid -- the game never actively prevented me from enjoying it.\nIt never quite rises out of the hole of mediocrity that it starts in, though:\n-Controls seem slightly non-standard to me.  For example, 'E' is only used to extract serum from and kill people.  In most other games that I play, it's used generically for object interaction.  The LMB does multiple-duty as initiating combat, attacking, object interaction, and NPC interaction.\n-With the exception of buying medkits, the economy is pretty useless.  Even at extreme difficulty, I never found a need to buy anything else.  Weapon and armor upgrades were always a side-quest or two away.\n-NPC followers are next to useless, so don't count on them to aid you in combat much.  They only seem to be good at distracting a single enemy for a few seconds before they're downed.\n\nAfter finishing the game, I learned that Spiders isn't an indie developer at all, but a French studio.  Which simultaneously deepened my disappointment in the lack of polish and explained my major problems with the game.  Whatever their budget for developing Mars: War Logs, the internationalization portion was inadequate.","August 7, 2014","true","24.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Characters are not numerous but each one is so clearly identifiable you'll grow fond of them - big-eyed Innocence, candid Mary, general Honor, each one has a unique voice actor. Voice acting has been redone, and this is one of the best performances I've witnessed in a game.\nCombat needs some getting used to. At the beginning it's quite frustrating, but once your character has enough experience, it becomes much better. You have a melee weapon, a nail gun and technopowers, which are plenty enough IMHO, each one becomes stronger and stronger which is better than having numerous weapons just slightly or not different at all.\nI liked the post-apocalyptic atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/walpulgiss/recommended/232750/","walpulgiss","Walpulgiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/walpulgiss/","141 products in account","I'll give the short version first. :)\n\nThe best way to describe this game is:\nImagine the spawn of a brief torrid threesome affair between The Witcher (the gameplay/combat), Fallout 3 (the atmosphere) and Mass Effect (the story setting). Take out a bit of awesomeness from it. Add the russian guy from GTA IV (on acid) as the protagonist aaaaaand...\nCongratulations!... It's a "Mars: War Logs"! :D\n\nSo, this is a "safe" game... It picks up on stuff used succesfully countless times on other games of the same genre and repeats them competently. It doesnt have any "great new features", the maps or the history arent huge master pieces. Actually the questline that goes along with the story is pretty straightforward and the maps are short and simple.\nBut the graphics are pretty great, the game is well built all arround and it's fun!\nI mean.. Werent you furstrated when you ended The Witcher, or Fallout 3, or Mass Effect? I admit i got lost and purposeless! I was loving the games and they ended... So, i know it's not the same, but with this game you can pick up from that "orphan" feeling those great games left you with and keep the fun going a little while.\n\nAnd for the money it costs... It's worth it!\n\n7/10\n\n\nNow, the boring and long version.\n\nSo, this is the tipical 3rd person action RPG that takes role in an improbable future where mars was colonized and, naturally, there's conflict because every "major power" wants a piece of it. You start as a POW, inprisoned far behind enemy lines. As you work your way out of the prison, and after, running from your former cagers, you start unfolding a deeper plot concerning older inhabitants and their powerfull knowledge... Bla bla... Cliche... De ja vu... And "play it yourself to find out". ;)\n\nYou'd expect that a game happening in a future far planet has all sort of advanced weapons, rayguns, guided missiles and stuff but.... no... Its more like "Post apocaliptic future in mars", so you'll use mostly pipes, hachets, bones and such as weapons. Combat is mainly melee, ranged weapons are used more like a complement in combat and later in game you'll develop some "technomancer" powers. These are basicaly "Sorcerer's magic" but based on technology.\n\nI think the rate this game got with the critics is unfair. The game is not "epic" (as the graphics might suggest) but is very decent entertainment.\nThe story is engaging. The character leveling up keeps gameplay fresh and interesting. New skill and abilities are meaningfull and will keep you focused. As gameplay is concerned, you'll find it very familiar overall and will constantly relate to similar features in other games.\nThe characters are built well enough, although i confess i hasnt able to create any "deep emotional connection" to them. It was hard to feel empathy and maybe because of that i never really connected to the game atmosphere.\n\nConcluding, the game has all elements to keep you interested for a while (if you are into this kind of game). But you must be carefull and dont fall to the tempation of comparing this games to the "giants" of the genre or you might end up feeling and thinking the same as the critics that rated this game with a 5/10.\n\nAs mentioned earlier: a solid 7/10","August 10, 2014","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This isn’t to say this game is a complete write-off as I’m still playing it and enjoying it… most of the time. As I play it, I feel that the developers have taken great ideas from other games and then mashed them together, without fully developing any of them. The leveling up is based on experience gain and allows you to spent points on perks (like Fallout), and separate points on skills with a skill tree reminiscent of The Witcher 2. Though unlike The Witcher 2, there’s not real room for focus on one particular skill set as you need to utilise everything at your disposal such as dodging, blocking, attacking, traps, bombs, guns, technomancy (magic), healing and other party members to be able to survive through most combats. Because you need all of these, you need to spread your skill points evenly across the board. Though I will say that the skills have significant effects on what your character can do, as do the perks, meaning that your choice in either do matter.\n\nMars: War Logs aspires to be a lot of things, though doesn’t quite reach any of them. This all being said, this blog is called Icarus Reviews and I cannot fault a game too much for aiming high, even if it doesn’t succeed.\n\nFor full review, visit:\nhttp://icarusreviews.net/2014/03/14/mars-war-logs/","April 6, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game can be a little buggy but nothing show stopping. The mechanics of the game, how the fighting system works and so on, not perfect but I'm not all about game mechanics. Take a game like Jade Empire, it's flawed mechanically but there's so much more to that game, it's great fun. This game is very much like that too. Jade Empire, Remember me, games like that are more about telling a story and the RPG elements and game mechanics are there to keep you interested while that story plays out.\n\nI don't like Mars: War Logs, I absolutely love it. Good science fiction tales are hard to come by in PC gaming and this is very much one of them. I'm also gobsmacked that such a small developer was able to pull off so much. So for me it helped a lot that I went into this game knowing a fair bit about the developers, what they were trying to do and forgave the problems the game has because of that.\n\nTake a game like Skyrim. A truly epic game with a massive budget and huge team of programmers  and artists. Even that game has many problems but I adore that game despite its problems. I love that they were trying to create a huge open world and fill that world with enough content, that at times it felt like I was in a real place, really role playing my way through it. Mars: War Logs is trying to do the same but with a tiny fraction of the budget of Skyrim. The fact there were plenty of times I also felt I was in another place, really role playing my way through it is quite astounding to me.\n\nBottom line, if you love a good Sci-Fi tale and want to be immersed into it, this game will give you that. On sale it's an absolute steal and a must have. At full price, I'd say you probably should avoid if this is going into a backlog to be played later as it will go on sale again. If you want to play it right now, the full price which is £11.99 as of writing this, I'd pay that.","June 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have no idea of how bugged it was - apparently it was, according to other reviewers - but in my hands ran just smoothly.\nBased on such remarks, here are my opinions on the game:\n\nThe setting and the artwork are nice, with a flavour of steam-punk style. After all, Mars is the red planet.\nDungeons, caves, and maps in general are a bit repetitive.\nDialogues are just fine. Perhaps they lack a bit of depth, though they are just enjoyable as such. The story is nice and leaves plenty of room for other episodes.\nAnimations are well made. It is nice the way it slows time down when opening the wheel menu or while counter-attacking.\nIt is a pity that jumping is not available, although it would be useless considering the game mechanics.\nRPG mechanics are OK; the characters evolves by spending points in the three branches or potentiating already unlocked skills.\nCombat may be the weak element of the game. After getting acquainted with the commands and the combat mechanics, the most successful way is to evade all the time, hit'n'run. If AoE skills from the Technomancer's branch, that becomes even easier.\nEquipment is also lacking depth. There is a lot of different weapon and armour upgrades, though it is rather difficult to find upgradable pieces during the game. The nice point here, is that you can adjust your gameplay by choosing the desired upgrades - which, by the way, also change parts of the look of the upgraded item according to their stats.\nCrafting also appears to be incomplete and could be improved a lot.\n\nOverall, I believe this is not a "< 60 game". As already state, based on the opening remarks, I would rate this as a 65, at least.","February 1, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's worth every penny.\n\nThe game is a mix of gameplay from Dragon Age and any MMORPG. It takes place on Mars, with 3 long chapters, and allows you to have one party member at one time. You only focus on your characters items and skills, the game handles the rest.\n\nThe game takes roughly 8 hours, including all side quests. This has a moderate replay value so you definitely find yourself wanting to change your choices the second time around. There are minor kinks that need to be worked out, but not very noticeable.\n\n4/5. Great game.","March 19, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is fun, and has a few moments of really well done story. The Dialog is both really good and really bad, depending on the character. Innocence (strange heavy handied naming convention asside) Is a great character and the airy voice acting does wonders to enhance the character. The main character however is totally hit or miss, mostly because it's obvious the lines weren't read in order, so he reacts strangly or puts odd emphasis on lines.\n\nIf you need a TLDR, the worst thing I could say for this game is it's a bit unpollished. There are no big bugs that I've seen, but the game's a bit short, thin, and mediocre, when compared to the Bethesda and Bioware counteparts that are the obvious influences. All that said It's a good game, with a good story, and I'm enjoying it.","June 30, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Set on a post-apocalyptic Mars, your character is thrown into a power struggle between factions. The atmosphere sort of reminds me of a steampunky dune, complete with electric magic, sneaky face-whacking, political backstabbing, a bit of romance, and even a sandworm!\n\nPros:\nThe atmosphere is interesting. Drab, desert-ish industrial themes, with little splashes of color or variation.\nThe commerce system is simple, but effective. You can buy ingredients to construct upgrades to weapons and armor, or scavenge them from the environment.\nThe combat system is different from anything else I've used, but easy to get the hang of. The first chapter is a bit slow, and gives you plenty of time to get your bearings before throwing you into the thick of it.\nThe general plot and main characters are interesting enough, but some of the voice acting (especially for minor characters) is less than stellar, and in a few cases, downright bad.\nThe perk trees are nicely done. Basic, but they allow you to tailor your approach to combat to suit your style of play. The perks come in three trees, Stealth, Ranged Attacks and Healing, Manual Combat, or Technomancy (magic). Each tree has a few tiers of perks that unlock as you purchase items in that string, and each perk has three upgradeable layers of effectiveness.\nCons:\nThe visuals are drab, and this can make it a bit hard to navigate, simply because you're visually bored.\nThe side quests can be too vague. I had to resort to a walk-through for one in particular...turned out I had already missed my opportunity to complete the task.\nIt's a damn short game. I took my time, and it only took me 10 hours to complete.\nThe alignment system is janky. It makes some actions (ex. harvesting serum from downed enemies) obviously "bad", but it doesn't give you any direction or input as to how to navigate these choices or check your progress. I made "good" choices all the way through, and still finished the game with a "neutral" alignment, preventing me from taking advantage of the various perks attached to either of the divergent character paths.\n\nOverall, a good diversion RPG game, to play in between titles like Skyrim and Mass Effect. Maybe not worth $15, but I'd recommend buying it when it's on sale.","July 15, 2014","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If they would of spent (like i said earlier) maybe a few more months on this game, to give the graphics more "mmph", better optimize the game overall, fix the VO, add more skill tree depth, fine tune the combat system, and anyother things i may have missed, i would pay more than 3$ for it, but the way it is, im glad i only paid 3$. but ill still recommend it for those looking for something to kill the time to get over your 3 week SWTOR binge, while dinner cooks, or while waiting for your coffee to finish brewing. but do yourself a favor, and get it while its on sale if you are considering buying it.","March 19, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game can be a little buggy but nothing show stopping. The mechanics of the game, how the fighting system works and so on, not perfect but I'm not all about game mechanics. Take a game like Jade Empire, it's flawed mechanically but there's so much more to that game, it's great fun. This game is very much like that too. Jade Empire, Remember me, games like that are more about telling a story and the RPG elements and game mechanics are there to keep you interested while that story plays out.\n\nI don't like Mars: War Logs, I absolutely love it. Good science fiction tales are hard to come by in PC gaming and this is very much one of them. I'm also gobsmacked that such a small developer was able to pull off so much. So for me it helped a lot that I went into this game knowing a fair bit about the developers, what they were trying to do and forgave the problems the game has because of that.\n\nTake a game like Skyrim. A truly epic game with a massive budget and huge team of programmers  and artists. Even that game has many problems but I adore that game despite its problems. I love that they were trying to create a huge open world and fill that world with enough content, that at times it felt like I was in a real place, really role playing my way through it. Mars: War Logs is trying to do the same but with a tiny fraction of the budget of Skyrim. The fact there were plenty of times I also felt I was in another place, really role playing my way through it is quite astounding to me.\n\nBottom line, if you love a good Sci-Fi tale and want to be immersed into it, this game will give you that. On sale it's an absolute steal and a must have. At full price, I'd say you probably should avoid if this is going into a backlog to be played later as it will go on sale again. If you want to play it right now, the full price which is £11.99 as of writing this, I'd pay that.","June 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Those were my major memories of Mars:War Logs. The name is not quite apt...Mars:Rusty and Grimey perhaps. If it was a movie the  word to describe Mars:War Logs would be "slight" and reviewers would be politely disparaging if they only watched Holywood blockbusters. Not to be too negative though- the game is a primarily fun with a reasonably interesting if short and slightly predictable story. Character development and voice acting are decent for a video game. The RPG elements are rather of the "Witcher" variety but the game lacks  the "Witcher" depth and polish. But it isn't bad just short and ordinary.

I purchased this during it's 75% off sale and I can say that it was worth the money spent, but had I bought this game for full price, even at the low price it is already at, I would have felt a little bummed out, but not enough to really regret the purchase.\n\nThe flaws in this game are few, but affect the immersion and gameplay pretty heavily. For starters, we have the most obvious issue of poor lip synching for the voice overs and poor voice actors. Now, I don't know about you, but when it comes to a game made in 2013, you'd think that you could at least have proper lip synching so that your game characters don't look like a bunch of puppets when they talk.\n\nThe voice acting side of things in this game also comes with another tag along flaw of horribly bad dialog and just general sloppyness of a story. It has a nice twist in the beginning which is refreshing when it comes to your main character, but that is about it. The voice actors in this game were not refreshing however...and at times, even right off in the beginning they showed their lack of skill at voice acting. This could have also been a result of poor direction as well, which would be understandable, but it's still significant enough that on my first playthrough I was skipping the dialog just so I didn't have to suffer.\n\nCompanion choices are obvious enough that you won't be surprised at all and the game does have you do a fair bit of running around for quests, which gets annoying at times, but not so much as to detract from the gameplay a whole lot. The game is extremely linear and I also felt that your reputation in the game meant all of ♥♥♥♥ when it comes down to it. My reputation was bad the entire time and it didn't affect anything I could percieve to be a detriment to my gameplay when it came to companion interaction or affecting the story. The only thing it did affect was that I couldn't get the companion bonus feat or the merchant price reduction, but that wasn't a big deal considering my companion was only good for distracting an enemy or two and that the game gives you everything in the game that you need. Vendors were pretty much pointless as a whole and the crafting system, while neat, was generally pointless as well as once you obtain the copper tube and leather outfit in the 2nd chapter you effectively have the best weapon and armor in the game.\n\nCombat is frustrating but fun, and stealth is a broken mechanic allowing you to typically take out 1-2 baddies before they notice you. Explosives are your friend and the blast power with the cone effect is really the only power I ever used since the shield and weapon powers take forever to cast.\n\nThe best thing about this game is the detail in the environments. This game looks gritty and dirty and it's great.\n\nI was expecting more, but for the price I paid I knew that I wasn't going to be super impressed with it, however I didn't hate it and if you are looking for a cheap game to beat then pick this one up during a sale.","March 25, 2014","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game seems to have closely watched and learned from that game. Although somewhat short (about 12 hours while also doing side quests), this game has the making of something great. The world and characters are intriguing, although the game is a tad too short to really flesh it out. The combat could use some tweaks here and there, as there are big difficulty spikes: once you're comfortable with one class of enemy, a significantly tougher one is introduced. This is fine, except for the fact that these tougher enemies come in packs of at least 4, which can be overwhelming until you upgrade your gear.\n\nWould love to see more from this IP in the future, preferably a tad longer and with some more polishing.","April 6, 2014","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of the voice acting and dialogue is a bit rum but the ideas are great. The game itself plays really well. The combat feels really tough.

Sadly it can be frustrating as it tends to throw groups at you regularly.\n\nHowever, it's a rough diamond and well worth it.

You'll get the background of the main characters by conversations or the storyline. One of my favourite thing is that they introduced us by the story of our young follower.\nWell, it needs some patches, of course. You might find smaller bugs here and there. It can be nerve-racking that it is not that open as it should be, at least for the first hour. Sometimes it feels like you're only travelling from locations to another and back to earn XP. But in some hours of gameplay it all starts to open before your eyes. You really can decide, and those choices really seem to count as they have promised. So there are pros and cons, as always.\nI have a lame 1.5GHz oldgen dualcore laptop with integrated graphics, but it is still running on low settings. Certainly, it is not so smooth, but the requirements are not too high.\n\nThis game can entertain you if you give it an hour. If you're not interested in it after that time, maybe you won't be ever.

Play this game...and let them watch.\n\nMars: War Logs is a great third person brawler game marred by a middle school creative writing class-grade storyline and even worse voice acting.  No.  Seriously - Mars: War Logs' voice cast makes Elizabeth Berkley and Mark Wahlberg look like the principals of the Royal Shakespeare Company.  Forgetable characters, laughable script and a vision of the fourth planet that had me waiting for the Governator to jump out of the shadows and yell, "Get your a** to Mars!".  No...wait...Mars: War Logs makes the original Total Recall look like an art house film.\n\nFor all it gets wrong, though, Wars: War Logs has a truly enjoyable combat system and a skill-based character development tree that really allows you to play the game the way you want.  Want to go in guns blazing? No worries.  Prefer to sneak through the shadows and backstab?  You can do that, too!  Want to use "magic" and zap opponents from a distance.  Gotcha' covered. Just put your points in a different skill tree.  There are a lot of possibilities.  The game's crafting system is also fairly interesting and it feels like a nice extension to the skill tree, as you can tweak weapons and armor to match your play style.\n\nSome of the environments have a lot of character, too, though the game very obviously divides larger areas up into smaller battle arenas to keep combat confined to relatively small spaces.  This is probably a memory management technique and, as such, points to this title's origins as a console game.  The problem here, is, which console?  The spaces are _so_ small, I assumed the target platform was the original XBOX or Playstation 2.\n\nSo: great combat, a few pretty (but small) spaces, nice crafting and skill systems, terrible storyline that telegraphs every dystopian scifi trope, 1-dimensional characters (to include your own) and voice acting so bad it screams for an MST3K voiceover?\n\nAnd I'm *recommending* this?  Yes.  Because the combat is worth the $3.75 price of admission.  And because you'll cringe so much at the story that you'll find yourself laughing to relieve the shame.","July 14, 2014","true","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Despite the limited number of options compared to something like Borderlands or Arkham Asylum (the two games with the most similar gameplay styles IMO) most of them actuallly make you care and feel like genuine (if occasionally slighlty clichee) progressions in a compelling story.\n\nJust remember: this is a "solidly medium sized" mid buget game with a lot of love on the part of the devs clearly driving the experience. Don't buy it if you expect a Mass Effect or Fallout or Borderlands. But if you like sci fi, story driven, action RPGs this one is worth giving a shot at full price.

I have no idea of how bugged it was - apparently it was, according to other reviewers - but in my hands ran just smoothly.\nBased on such remarks, here are my opinions on the game:\n\nThe setting and the artwork are nice, with a flavour of steam-punk style. After all, Mars is the red planet.\nDungeons, caves, and maps in general are a bit repetitive.\nDialogues are just fine. Perhaps they lack a bit of depth, though they are just enjoyable as such. The story is nice and leaves plenty of room for other episodes.\nAnimations are well made. It is nice the way it slows time down when opening the wheel menu or while counter-attacking.\nIt is a pity that jumping is not available, although it would be useless considering the game mechanics.\nRPG mechanics are OK; the characters evolves by spending points in the three branches or potentiating already unlocked skills.\nCombat may be the weak element of the game. After getting acquainted with the commands and the combat mechanics, the most successful way is to evade all the time, hit'n'run. If AoE skills from the Technomancer's branch, that becomes even easier.\nEquipment is also lacking depth. There is a lot of different weapon and armour upgrades, though it is rather difficult to find upgradable pieces during the game. The nice point here, is that you can adjust your gameplay by choosing the desired upgrades - which, by the way, also change parts of the look of the upgraded item according to their stats.\nCrafting also appears to be incomplete and could be improved a lot.\n\nOverall, I believe this is not a "< 60 game". As already state, based on the opening remarks, I would rate this as a 65, at least.","February 1, 2015","true","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not a AAA game but a solid buy on a deal/ discount.\n\nA decrepit mars colonial feel is a nice mix of settings and the lore is quite nice. Technomancy is a nice take on cyberpunk magic. Combat is not like most games and requires you to set up with grenades, mines, and nail shots.\n\nStory is quite strait forward but above average.

The best features are the story and narrative which is mature, dark and most often grim since I took the "evil" character route but it does let you still make positive choices and help out those you like. The combat is great, reminds me of The Witcher 2 and Dark Souls mixed in a way because you block, counter and roll dodge around most of the time killing fools with melee attacks because ranged combat is limited due to scarcity of ammo for your makeshift nailgun. Its not too long, I beat it in 12 hours and missed some quests and killed off a few annoying key characters but had a blast the whole way through once I mastered the combat.","June 2, 2013","true","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First bits of combat feel like a tutorial for the combat system, as if to say, "hey, just go figure it out, here it is." And then, you're kinda thown into a wall after the fist boss fight. I absolutely love that it only took me a few attempts to take out a "technomancer" with only 3 tries and yet, next stage of the story I've been put into a main sotry fight that pitted me up against 7 enemies and even with 15 tries, I haven't found a good strategy (mostly because I emphasized in stealth). (( I also had a few beers in me)).\n\nFrom what I have seen, the stroy-telling reminds me of old Lucasarts games directors.\n\nPros:\nuh..... It feels nice to customize weapons and gear in a crafting system that lets you optimize to your playing style, so long as your playing style is agressive or defensive.\n\nHas one of those open-story types, where your choices have outcomes and consequences.\n\nThe "go fetch" quests really kinda play into the story instead of being plastered on.  For instance, there is the oportunity to help a mechanic who's alegience is counter to your own, but you could do it for the possibility that he might help you later.\n\nCons:\nVoice acting is ok... but mostly lame. The lead (as of 5 hours) sounds like Charlie Shean on an off-day, the narrator...... I like him, got that nieve thing down very well.\n\nDifficulty curve is wacked. I don't think on "normal" mode, where there are two higher difficulties, should be as aggrivating, instead of challenging.\n\nVery blan colors\n\nConstant need to open doors for the next zone (they are skip-able in cinematics though)\n\n......\n\nIf you can get it on sale, I would get it on sale, for less that $7.\nIt's not great (,so far) but It is nowhere near horrible.\n\n","September 8, 2015","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can choose between shooting (and letting your guard down), using powers (which requires so precious time), or just bash in with your "almighty custom made pipe of destruction". Do not expect much more than this (which is enough for my tastes), so do not expect to lose hours in micro management about every single move.\n2) The story is nice. OK, it's not going to attract Hollywood movie makers (even though, given the high quality standards set by the latest Fantastic Four movie … *SPOILER ALERT sarcasm sarcasm*) or win an Academy award, but the game is short enough to keep up its momentum until it's over. You read the end credits before you get bored, that is.\n3) Being a huge gdr fan (both paper and PC versions), I really like the "leveling up" mechanism.\n4) The idea of mixing together some scraps of metal, pieces of cloth and electrical wire with a steel pipe or a worker's suite may sound odd. Even more so when you realize that, in this way, you turn your beggar-look-like hero into some sort of space mar...(ops copyright alert) futuristic soldier in impenetrable armor with a planet - killer weapon. I think it brings some character to the game and adds some ever-welcomed variety as well.\n\nCONS: 1) graphic ... OK, it does its job, but a little improvement would not hurt. Make it a big improvement and you'll get a really, really good game.\n2) Soundtrack. It could be improved. Definitively.\n3)Technomancer powers. Why should a post apocalyptic future need some sort of weird magic? Mad Max has no such things and it rocks.\n\nNOT SURE IF PRO OR CON: the game is linear. Fullstop. You have a main quest and you go from A to B and reverse, sometimes calling at C to do some side questing. Fullstop. Perfect for killing time without turning your brain on.\n\nAll in all, I rate it 7 / 10, raising to 8 because I've bought my copy with a huge discount (12,50€ got me all 4 Focus gdrs).\n\nFor comparison sake, I rate 10+/10 Baldur's Gate 2, Torment and Borderlands 2. I'd rate 1/10 Kerbal Space Program … OK, it's a masterpiece and I know it, but I just don't like this kind of games.\n\nThanks for reading.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sigfried/recommended/232750/","sigfried","Sigfried","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sigfried/","236 products in account","The story takes place in the distant future on Mars. Long ago in the history of the game Mars was a prosperous colony on a well terraformed world. Now it is something of a post apocalypse wasteland where the surviving remnants of civilization fight over continually dwindling resources. People known as Psychers use ancient technology to manifest magic like abilities serving as elite military personnel for the factions.\n\nThe protagonist of the game is a renegade Psycher who becomes embroiled in a plot to stop the Psychers from one of the factions from completing a secret project and taking control over society for their own mysterious ends. The story begins in a military prison from which the hero escapes with a comrade, then moves to a neighboring empire where you either ally with a band of idealistic rebels or a concerned faction of the establishment to stop the Psycher plot.\n\nGame play is two pronged. There is a branching story to navigate and you can form alliances with different factions and relationships with different potential allies. There are also various side quests to occupy your time. This shares about equal footing with the hand to hand combat encounters which are a mix of arcade action and leveling/gearing your character in various combat powers and attributes.\n\nThe storytelling and world building are the game's strongest selling points. Unfortunately both suffer a little from uneven writing in the dialog and plotting. At times the story can be quite compelling, especially in the game's first two chapters. As it moves on things get a bit more predictable and wrote and the end of the game is on the anti-climactic side. The same goes for the world building. It starts out very intriguing but before too long you realize you are only going to scratch the surface of it while playing the game.\n\nThe combat and character building are lackluster but not deficient. Most of the combat choices are decent and they do lead to different tactics during fights. The controls are a little on the awkward side and the combat animations are not the sophisticated sort you find in Witcher 3 or the Batman games. It is a pretty simple game with fairly simple mechanics.\n\nUltimately it feels like a game made by professionals but both a bit behind the times and on a very limited budget. The locations are linear and limited and the range of enemies is pretty small. There is a fair bit of detail in the art, but there isn’t all that much of it. I certainly got my moneys worth and personally I like a short game with a concise story. By the time it had started to show its weaknesses the game was nearly over.\n\nI recommend it for fans of the genre so long as you go in wanting a smaller simpler game than sprawling epics like Dragon Age but with the same sort of game play and in an unusual genre setting.","November 9, 2015","true","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You don't even always attack in his direct if he is targeted. Targeting is mostly used for your spells and abilities.\n\nGraphics are not to good on the faces but it did not bother me to much while playing.\n\nVoices are out of sync somethimes or there are weird long pauses or charaters just staring at eachother.\n\nIt has alot of bad things if you look for them BUT if you are bored and can get it for under $5 it's not to bad.\nStory is oke, nothing major. It has something special tho, which is fun if your looking for a melee 3d person half sci fi game. Oh and this is more a wastland than mars... the only things which is outerworldly is the 1/3 Prawn 1/3 Armadillo 1/3 dog creatures. Other than that it looks like a wastland with a minor radiation/mutation problem.\n\nOh and yes there are litteraly only 4 tipes of enemies in the game 2 of them being human.

You can choose between shooting (and letting your guard down), using powers (which requires so precious time), or just bash in with your "almighty custom made pipe of destruction". Do not expect much more than this (which is enough for my tastes), so do not expect to lose hours in micro management about every single move.\n2) The story is nice. OK, it's not going to attract Hollywood movie makers (even though, given the high quality standards set by the latest Fantastic Four movie … *SPOILER ALERT sarcasm sarcasm*) or win an Academy award, but the game is short enough to keep up its momentum until it's over. You read the end credits before you get bored, that is.\n3) Being a huge gdr fan (both paper and PC versions), I really like the "leveling up" mechanism.\n4) The idea of mixing together some scraps of metal, pieces of cloth and electrical wire with a steel pipe or a worker's suite may sound odd. Even more so when you realize that, in this way, you turn your beggar-look-like hero into some sort of space mar...(ops copyright alert) futuristic soldier in impenetrable armor with a planet - killer weapon. I think it brings some character to the game and adds some ever-welcomed variety as well.\n\nCONS: 1) graphic ... OK, it does its job, but a little improvement would not hurt. Make it a big improvement and you'll get a really, really good game.\n2) Soundtrack. It could be improved. Definitively.\n3)Technomancer powers. Why should a post apocalyptic future need some sort of weird magic? Mad Max has no such things and it rocks.\n\nNOT SURE IF PRO OR CON: the game is linear. Fullstop. You have a main quest and you go from A to B and reverse, sometimes calling at C to do some side questing. Fullstop. Perfect for killing time without turning your brain on.\n\nAll in all, I rate it 7 / 10, raising to 8 because I've bought my copy with a huge discount (12,50€ got me all 4 Focus gdrs).\n\nFor comparison sake, I rate 10+/10 Baldur's Gate 2, Torment and Borderlands 2. I'd rate 1/10 Kerbal Space Program … OK, it's a masterpiece and I know it, but I just don't like this kind of games.\n\nThanks for reading. I apologize if it was too long.","September 28, 2015","true","20.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The bad combat system is the worst part. I kept finding myself facing the wrong way when trying to attack an opponent and can't get turned around quickly enough. When in combat, the sprint get changed for a roll button which limits your movement. The two together means I kept rolling to behind my opponent, then standing up and swinging into the air, while he turns around and attacks me from behind. When you are using projectile weapons, you can't actually aim; instead you set a "target" with your mouse wheel. Not a fan of that. Granted I am a FPS fan but have played a couple in the style of this game without having the urge to slam my mouse through the monitor. If your are a FPS person, don't bother. Go play Borderlands(s) or Fallout(s) or Bioshock(s) or Far Cry(s) if you like "RPG", or even Mass Effect if you are not into FPS. And to add to the sins of War Logs, you can't remap the keys; what "modern" game can't you remap the keys??? And the micro cut scenes everytime you open a door??? Enough already.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-simian/recommended/232750/","the-simian","Sparkle Magic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the-simian/","722 products in account","Mars: War Logs\nIn the masterfully crafted "Mars: War Logs" (which is in fact a war-diary), we are transported to a martian "anti reality", where societal norms regarding sexual orientation are questioned and examined in series of autisticly voice-acted scenes populated with uncanny-valley robo-people. "The War", (referenced in the title), is actually culture-war being fought not only on the Martian landscape, but within ourselves.\n\nStory        10/10                Gameplay        10/10                Graphics        9/10                Overall        Like a million/10\nStory 10/10:\n\nIn this game, you play  a man metaphorically questioning his own sexuality whilst constantly being thrust into combat scenarios  where the only way to survive is to forcefully bludgeon others with handcrafted electro-phalluses.  Our  protagonist hails from a martian colony called "Aurora";  a symbol of cis-genedered norms. Aurora issues "virtue-names" to each inhabitant  like "temprance", "honesty", "morality", "steely-dan" and "jazz-organ" as if to imply a life of freedomless societal predestination.\n\nOur doucheburn-wearing antihero held rank in "The Source". "The Source" is a guild of "technomancers", a group of pick-up artists who have dedicated a lifetime of hot-gluing wires and glowsticks to their bodies in a misguided attempt at peacocking. Rejecting this worldview, he is cast down into a dirty man-prison festering with debauchery. It is in this gay-underworld that our protagonist takes his first steps in breaking away from breeder-culture and changes from his assigned name "Temperance" to "Roy", the name of a gay space-cowboy.\n\nAll is well in the Brokeback Mars Mountain-Prison until one day a strapping young bronco named "Innocence" appears one day, in the shower room. After defending him from an attempted ♥♥♥♥ (yes that's what happens), "Innocence" thanks you and becomes your new buckaroo-boyfriend. Innocence then keeps a scrapbook, where he draws fanart about the main character, and talks about his feelings. (This is where the game gets its name, by the way.)\n\nAfter bonding with Innocence by digging through trash bins, rubble heaps and rotten mushroom patches for a few hours, Roy and his young buck decide to "break out of the closet" by stealing a train, and returning to Aurora. Ideally, this is where where they will organize a "resistance" that will pridefully march in the streets and overturn societal norms.\n\nGameplay  10/10:\n\nThe gameplay consists primarily of combat and dialogue. The dialog feels largely forced, much like the expectation our protagonist feels to conform to society. Your character is almost entirely sent on errands, in an effort to highlight the meaninglessness of life without freedom. You are both figuratively and literally wasting away in a prison! This nihilist gesture is surely to underscore the overarching theme of resisting cultural assimilation and cisexual assumptions.\n\nIn a bold move, the extended metaphor of sexual discovery is manifest in akward camera angles during combat. The audience is constantly asking questions like "what am I really trying to see?" and "who am I, in all of this?". The camera encourages you to explore new ways of seeing reality.\n\nThe enemies you fight during combat consist of your sexual rivals in the prison, cave dwelling testicle-mutants and pick up artists wearing rave-gloves. Despite the fact humans have clearly terraformed Mars, you are restricted to fighting with nailguns and crude batons. You must therefore "assert dominance" over your foes by forcefully employing these erotically-shaped instruments in a symbolic display of fertility and potency.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=513841744\nThis half-man half-testicle is a visceral manifestation of your latent sexual urges.\n\nHowever, with the slow response speed and erratic camera movements, much like the theme of the game, the real enemy is yourself, thus highlighting the thematic motifs present in the story.\n\nGraphics  9/10:\n\nIn another bold artistic gesture, the developers decided to maek every mesh appear as robotic and lifeless as possible during the dialogue. This is clearly an allusion to a dystopian reality, where "every cog has its place" and personal freedom is stifled. Every landscape is a exercise in monotony and every texture is visual litter.  Everything, (even your clothing), is covered with the same blurry rust, soot and grunge; a clear attempt to give Mars a literal and figurative sense of 'uncanny valley', a fitting location for our symbolic tale.\n\nI feel like this Idea could have been explored more throughly, hence the 9.\n\n\nOverall  integer-overflow/10:\n\nIf you're the right kind of player, itching for a game to make you question yourself, social norms, and why you spend money on Mars: War Logs, this is a game that will raise the right questions. I have never seen a game so experimentally break the 4th wall by intentionally crippling core gaming features in service to a noble theme. Bravo!\n\nSadly however; I cannot recommend this game. I don't think most people are ready for this. Mars logs is simply ahead of its time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419706842","September 7, 2015","false","11.3"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","46","12","26","13","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoffix/recommended/232750/","zoffix","Zoffix Znet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zoffix/","152 products in account","I definitely recommend the game. I got it on sale for $5, and after 1.5 hours I already feel I got enough fun for the money—and the game has only just begun. So, I think even the $17 for the game is well worth the price.\n\nIf you go in with right expectatoions into this game, you can definitely enjoy it. It delivers just what a $17 game should deliver; don't compare it to those that go for $40-$60.\n\nThere's no jumping in the game and you do occasionally bump into an invisible wall. There are some really grotesque looking people and I often want to find out what had happened to them, but alas, they just ignore you and there's no option to talk to them. Some characters stand in your way, [intentionally?] blocking your way. They're like furniture—no interaction with you at all—which feels lazy and lame on the part of developers.\n\nWhat irks me the most is the UI. Every time you pick up loot or ransack a corpse, you get a popup message telling you what you found, and you gotta click "OK" to close it. This really should've been a brief message at the bottom instead. Quests, on the other hand, flash by so quickly, you don't get a chance to read what you have to do, so sometimes you gotta navigate into your quest journal to read them.\n\nIf you don't have your weapon out, SHIFT makes you sprint. If you do, SHIFT makes you roll. The problem is if you have to go up/down a cliff or ladder, you have to position yourself in front of it and click your mouse. The area where that click actually makes you climb is small, so you often miss it, and get your weapon out instead. There's no button to hide it, so then you just wait for it to be put away just so you could sprint again. Annoying.\n\nVoice acting is mediocre in places, but the dialog is very well written.\n\nThe setting, story, and writing shine. I'm enjoying them so far. Combat system seems good too. It isn't a "click-until-they-die" stupidity, like in Skyrim. If you hit your enemy with the same thing repeatedly, they'll start blocking it. Dogs can't be damaged in the head, so you gotta try to get them from the back. There are stealth combat attacks, blinding sand throws, guns (though you don't aim to shoot them), and seems like a bunch of other "magic"-like attacks that you unlock later on. So I'm enjoying the combat.\n\nA few other reviewers dissed the graphics, but they look fine to me. You get an occasional model that seems to bob a bit too much when idly chatting, but that's minor.\n\nIn summation, this isn't a $50 top-shelf title; don't go into this game expecting it to compare to such games. It's a $17 game and it's worth every penny. Voice acting and user interface are the the weak points, graphics are fine, and combat, setting, and writing are the strong points.\n\nI definitely recommend this.","October 16, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

However, it is still a very well put together game and fun to play, once you get the hang of it. Lots of good elements from other games of the past, reminds me in many ways of Knights of the Old Republic. Not an 'open-world' game but you still have some freedom to poke around in the corners a little bit, and there is more to do than strictly follow the story. This game also had more RPG depth than I had anticipated. There is quite a vast skill tree and many different approaches to how one plays the game. In addition there is a good variety of equipments, many of which can be modified in various ways to become more powerful.\n\nThe story and the writing itself is not exactly too wild or interesting, but it isn't overly shallow or lacking either. And once you get a little ways into the game the combat picks up quite a bit too. Overall this game is a great game to buy and to play, perhaps not one to buy at full price but still one to consider and definitely worth the cost","December 21, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The game has a lot of flaws, but none are enough to make the experience unenjoyable, the cut scenes are odd, with sudden silences, some poor voice acting and some jarring story leaps, but I never felt truly pulled out of the experience. The landscapes are very linear from what I have seen so far, with little true open world exploration, though the game does reward you for what little exploration you can do.\n\nNow onto the positives and it has some strong elements, firstly, Graphically it is quite pleasant to look upon, giving the environment quite a pleasing look, from the starting prison to the city later on, both are enjoyable enough to look over, even in 2015. Next the story has some intriguing elements and original concepts to them with some genuinely interesting characters, they do have their flaws in design, but again, it doesn't ruin the experience.\n\nThe Combat system, I found to be challenging to use to begin with, but after some experience it becomes quite useable and isn't simply a case of mashing the buttons.\n\nUltimately, I feel that if you are a fan of the Sci Fi Universe, especially those to do with Mars and Dystopian futures then the game has a lot to offer, dont expect perfection as it isn't here, but the game shines despite its flaws and it isn't like anything else on the market.\n\nSo for a unique experience and to support a company with original idea's I recommend this game.\n\nFor me its a solid 6.5/10 Not Great, but an enjoyable experience none the less.","September 29, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Not perfect mind you, but great!  Finally a company truly sees how great a game like Mass Effect can be, and the need for more games like that inspired by its mechanics.  Mars War Logs is that game!  A great sci-fi adventure where your decisions shape the story and truly matter!!!  I hope more companies see this, and make more games like this.  Here are the pros:\n\nPros:\n\n- Branching decisions that make you truly feel like a hero who shapes his destiny\n- Great story with interesting characters\n- Stunning and Gorgeous graphics\n- A short but satisfying inclusion of a love interest\n- Combat that's really fun and reminiscent of the Batman Arkham games (Asylum, City, and Origins)!\n\nLike I said before, the game's not perfect.  There are some serious cons that can't be overlooked.  Despite an annoying camera that you have to fight with during every fight scene, the biggest cons come from artificially padding the game's length.  In fact, I think this game could've been cut down to a respectable 8 to 10 hours runtime if the developers took care in tightening up the experience.  Here are the cons:\n\nCons:\n\n- The game's built around fetch quests.  In fact, that along with repetitive battles make up 90% of the experience.  These fetch quests are so overly abundant that you're constantly going from point A, to point B, then back to point A, then back again to point B, and yet again back to point A, and so on...  You get the picture.  The first chapter alone made me quit for awhile, because I thought this was it.  I'm glad I stuck it through.\n\n- Overuse of respawning fights.  Holy crap!  You finish the first chapter, which is a myriad of fetch quests, and then the second chapter greets you with a never ending barrage of respawning enemies.  You win a fight getting to your first fetch quest objective, then you're told to go back to the area where the fetch quest began, and on your way back, all the guys you've just killed have come back to life in the same positions they were in when you first fought them.  Like I said before, I love the game's battle system, but when you have to tread a same area 20+ times, and fight the same enemies each time, it gets tiresome.  The use of this tired JRPG trope has never been fun.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEven with its glaring cons, Mars War Logs is worth playing all the way to the end.  It even succeeds where Mass Effect failed at the end of its trilogy; a satisfying ending based upon all the choices you've made.\n\nDeveloper Spiders knows how to treat its customers with respect by offering a complete RPG package without holding parts of the game (story DLC) behind pay walls like Electronic Arts/Bioware (you still can't buy the complete Mass Effect Trilogy with all its story content in a complete collection).  I hope more companies like Spiders take the approach of offering the complete story/side stories in game, and avoid big corporation BS of nickel and diming their customers, and never letting them own their copy of the content.  [Note:  Not speaking bad about DLC, actually I like some forms of DLC, just not the way some companies handle, distribute, or manage it; see said example above.]\n\nSadly, I can't recommend Mars War Logs at full price, because of its cumbersome experience, but it is a game everyone who likes these types of games should play.  There have been several 75% off sales and the game is well worth it at that price.\n","September 1, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I really enjoyed it.\nI'm one of those people that happily play old games, so maybe that's why the graphics didn't bother me like some people.\nCombat wasn't great, though, I'll admit. There were times that I could storm through a group of enemies with no issues, and others where they just seemed to destroy me. I don't really know why. Stealth isn't terribly useful, and blocking seemed slower than it should be. It should come as no surprise that Technomancy becomes very very useful.\nThe story was good. It wasn't amazing, but I'd enjoy some sort of sequel or spin-off, if one ever came out. There were a few different options to the storyline, too.\nI will say that I was annoyed that I couldn't finish Devotion's quest, and I never did figure out why (I'd even turned the other one down completely), but honestly, the relationship quests weren't anything amazing anyway, and the idea of being with either on the General's side made me feel a little squiffy, since they both seem so brainwashed. The only other issue I had the occasional clipping of dead bodies and a missing achievement (Got Ch 2 and 3, no Ch 1, probably Steam's fault, really).

Biggest sleeper hit of the year?  I think so.  Haven't been pleasantly surprised by a game from a dev I'd not played before.  This game has everything.  Awesome Sci-fi setting somewhere inbetween cyberpunk and post-apocolyptic.  It not pure polish, but its pure heart.  No crashes and nothing really broken in it.  The quests are enjoyable as is the main story.  Lots of side quests and like the main ones you have actual choices that not only affect the games outcome but also the NPCs in the game as well as your companions.  The later plays a good size role in the game and you can have one with you nearly the entire time who help you in combat (no control over their actions though).  And the combat--Awesome.  If Dragon Age 2 had used this combat system it would have been way better.  There's no combo system in combat but you have to use a combination of your melee attack, dodge, counter-attack, kick etc.  you get powers later in the game which are also key especially the shield.  the only ranged combat in the game besides your powers is a nail gun and grenades.  both of which are not used to often though as their supply is limited though they can be bought or crafted.  and crafting this is also something that this game is superb at. you collect lots of items which are used in crafting either supplys and or upgrades to your two equipment slots, your melee weapon and your armor.  both have a lot of customizable options and you can even recycle your stuff to get back some crafting supplies.  the skill tree is also highly customizable but not overly complicated.  and you wont be able to unlock even close to it all so that is nice unlike other games.  stealth build is an option though their were really only a couple instances that it seemed highly viable and worth the points in it.  this game has all the hallmarks of a great RPG while also being a enjoyable melding between an engaing sci-fi story/world and a highly rewarding combat experience.","April 30, 2013","true","16.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deneric/recommended/232750/","deneric","Cooper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deneric/","370 products in account","Mars: War Logs is a cyberpunk rpg in which you fight the a corporation (or is a government?) called Abundance because they are the people that attack you.  Also you fight thugs and mole-things.\n\nGameplay - It's pretty lacking.  The only time you interact with the world is when you dig through the trash or talk to a merchant.  There are also side quests to do, but they're not interesting and don't really have any affect on the environment.  It's like played bioware games, thought they ROCKED, and then didn't realize what they liked about them.  The combat's also pretty underwhelming.  It's a brawler (in the vein of Sleeping Dogs, just without the combos or useful interface) which would be fine, except for this terrible ability every enemy has; the ability to not take damage. Every so often, usually when you're doing well, they'll choose to jump back and avoid all of your damage.\n\nThis is a pretty big deal since there's no way to counter it (even if they're already against a wall) and you're usually against a large group of competant enemies.  Choosing to attack an enemy is a risky decision since they can all suddenly start tearing through you at any moment.  It's not even an issue of difficulty, it's an issue of poor design.  You're forced to spend most of each encounter rolling around waiting for your technopowers to recharge\n\nStory - I feel like there could have been a really cool story here.  From what I gathered, it's based on a cool idea of corporate warfare on an unforgiving planet and the effects that can have on a population.  The problem is that the game does NOTHING with any of this.  It's like they start the game right after the end of a really cool game.  No part of the story is really explained beyond "these are the bad guys because just trust me" moments.  I mean, the whole first act of the game seems to only happen because of the main character's impatience.   I actually had to stop playing at the end of the second act because I was given a choice to make and realized that I had NO idea what anyone was talking about or trying to accomplish.\n\nActing - I feel like it's important to be forgiving here; how many indie studios could talented voice actors? It's entirely possible that it was just the developers.  To their credit, there are some characters that are voiced in a perfectly acceptable fashion.  They're even able to give emotion!  The problem is that most of those characters are pretty throwaway.  The MAIN cast, on the other hand, all sound ridiculous.  Either they're "bad ♥♥♥ female roles" that sound like 7 year olds or they're the protagonist who, oh my god, has not changed his tone once through the entire game.\n\nWorld Design - Like I said before, they really could have done a lot here. I mean, a dystopian, cyberpunk world set on MARS?  Instead they just made everything orange and dirty.  I actually had to rely on my map to get anywhere because the areas were so confusing and samey.  I also said this before, but nothing you do changes anything and there are only like ten characters that say anything in the whole game.\n\nRPG Elements - Pretty lack luster.  The progression trees mostly just boost damage or give uninteresting boosts like being able to react faster after being hit.  Then there's the feat system that gives four types of boosts; increased xp from enemies, increased loot from enemies, more crafting options (crafting's mostly just for upgrading your gear), and better stuff from recycling gear.  There are also some perks from the morality system but the only ones that are useful come from being a bad guy (the good guy perks involve slightly decreased prices from merchants which you NEVER use and increased damage/health for your companion, which is probably just going to stand there being hit anyway).\n\nAchievements - Nothing too hard, but it's worth mentioning that there's an achievement for doing all the side quests.  They're pretty finicky and will actually become unavailable if you do them in the wrong order.\n\nFinal Thoughts - I love when indie devs take on something that's probably more than they can chew; it shows they're driven!  So, for the first four hours I managed to ignore a bunch of the flaws with the game.  It wasn't until the end of the first act when a character who had no reason to die was killed purely to create dramatic tension (and failed to do so, by the way) that it really clicked with me that there was something actually WRONG with the game.  I can't really recommend this game, but I'd suggest you keep an eye on this development team; this game was bad, but it seems like a step in the right direction.","June 27, 2014","false","7.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Especially if you like studying games from a design standpoint. As a full (even if low) price story driven action RPG, Mars: War Logs isn't very good.\nStory never picks up, partially because of a rather bad translation, partially because everything in the game is fit into very claustrophobic locations and it's hard to take anything seriously. Characters go from "we just met" to "like family to me" in 15 minutes, with no indication if in-game time flies differently from player real-time or not. A lot of plot threads get hinted at as being important and grand, but then just kinda resolve in the most disappointingly boring way possible.\nGameplay-wise, it's also pretty badly put together. Combat has some nice ideas, but they never work properly. You constantly find a lot of crafting stuff and money, but there's almost never a need to buy anything and best weapons and armor for the chapter (of which there are 3) are available from the start, so when you can just wait to find or buy best possible stuff you need, upgrade it in the best way you need and play out the rest of the chapter without ever caring about it again. So, by the end of the game you have tons of money and stuff you don't need at all. Skill system is also rather weridly done, as the most useful skills are in the combat tree and by the end of the game you'll have enough points to max out it and about a quarter of another skill tree, so focusing on anything else feels like a waste. And one of the trees is not even available until the second chapter. And companions are useful only for diverting attention from you, but useless otherwise. Also, there is a morality system, which simply doesn't work. Or, more specifically, it seems that I did finish the game as a best guy ever, since merchants talked about giving me a discount (which is a feat for being "good"), but in-game menu always showed me as "neutral" and "good" feats were showing as locked.\nIt is a shame, though, really, since there are some nice ideas here and there and the game world seemed to have been put some thought into. Game also looks quite good, with its own distinct colorful style. But the game is so underwhelming and frustrating and most of the time simply boring, that it's hard for me to recommend it. Unless there's a big story RPG itch you have, and you can't scratch it with countless better games. Like Rise of the Argonauts, for example, which is actually a better game.","March 24, 2014","false","11.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Especially if you like studying games from a design standpoint. As a full (even if low) price story driven action RPG, Mars: War Logs isn't very good.\nStory never picks up, partially because of a rather bad translation, partially because everything in the game is fit into very claustrophobic locations and it's hard to take anything seriously. Characters go from "we just met" to "like family to me" in 15 minutes, with no indication if in-game time flies differently from player real-time or not. A lot of plot threads get hinted at as being important and grand, but then just kinda resolve in the most disappointingly boring way possible.\nGameplay-wise, it's also pretty badly put together. Combat has some nice ideas, but they never work properly. You constantly find a lot of crafting stuff and money, but there's almost never a need to buy anything and best weapons and armor for the chapter (of which there are 3) are available from the start, so when you can just wait to find or buy best possible stuff you need, upgrade it in the best way you need and play out the rest of the chapter without ever caring about it again. So, by the end of the game you have tons of money and stuff you don't need at all. Skill system is also rather weridly done, as the most useful skills are in the combat tree and by the end of the game you'll have enough points to max out it and about a quarter of another skill tree, so focusing on anything else feels like a waste. And one of the trees is not even available until the second chapter. And companions are useful only for diverting attention from you, but useless otherwise. Also, there is a morality system, which simply doesn't work. Or, more specifically, it seems that I did finish the game as a best guy ever, since merchants talked about giving me a discount (which is a feat for being "good"), but in-game menu always showed me as "neutral" and "good" feats were showing as locked.\nIt is a shame, though, really, since there are some nice ideas here and there and the game world seemed to have been put some thought into. Game also looks quite good, with its own distinct colorful style. But the game is so underwhelming and frustrating and most of the time simply boring, that it's hard for me to recommend it. Unless there's a big story RPG itch you have, and you can't scratch it with countless better games. Like Rise of the Argonauts, for example, which is actually a better game.","March 24, 2014","false","11.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There are guns, bombs and mines in the game, but they are inferior to THE PIPE. There is electric magic, but the pipe still wins.\n\nThe typical gameplay: you go through a corridor, ugly crippled people sit by the wall and look at you, a enemy soldier appears at the other end, you rush to him and beat him down with your trusty pipe. Then go to the next corridor and repeat.\n\nThere is a crafting system too, you can add a leather grip to your pipe, and tape a tooth of giant lizard to the other end to increase its DPS.\n\nThe graphics is ugly, but this meshes well with the general atmosphere of lost war, ecologic disaster and general desperation, and almost seems intentional.\n\nThe game works, there are no bugs, you can complete the quests and advance along the plot line, but ... you know... this endless pipe fencing is just not fun.","May 1, 2014","false","8.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There are many much better examples in this genre. I got the game in a bundle, so I can't moan too much, but would not buy it outright.\n\nI recall many games that looked a bit like this from my youth. Linear, slightly blocky textures, lots of running about and terse dialogue. Even the voice acting reminds me of those games, and the 8 hours of this I played reflect the nostalgia trip I was on. However, the lack of any real depth just had too great an impact, and I found myself dreading loading it up. That's when you know it's time to move this from the pile of shame in to plain old "not interested" category.\n\nThe story and characters are crudely drawn stereotypes, possibly done in crayon on the back of a happy meal napkin. That would actually be ok if the quest design was decent (again, like the golden era games I remember), but there is nothing but grind...run here, give this, kill that, run back. Another quest, and oh look, it's over where I just was, 15 minutes away through a maze of tunnels and streets. I found myself not caring enough about any of the people, or the world itself, to want to slog through this to find out what happens. The dialogue and quest branches are highly misleading, as are the on-screen dialogue prompts, so in as much as you have a choice about anything it is frequently routed in a direction you did not intend.\n\nUnfortunately, the potentially very cool technomancy and martian survival story (warring water companies are an interesting twist on an old formula) are left to the back seat in favour of following the personal stories of two of the most boring characters ever invented. "Roy", a possibly bipolar schizophrenic with violent tendancies and an inability to explain even his basic thoughts without a drawn out monologue ("Hmm, there's a door here. I think it's closed...yep, locked. Darn! Maybe later I can pick it or get someone to open it. Then I could go through, hmm, see what's in there. Because now it's locked, and won't open."). And then there's "Innocence", which is so on-the-nose it's silly...he's about to be ♥♥♥♥♥ in prison when Roy comes in and saves him (by beating everything to death with a heavy pipe). Innocence is the reflection of his name, and we're supposed to go on the journey with him more than Roy, though Roy is the player character, as he gradually becomes more grown up, whilst still anchoring Roy to his humanity. It makes for terrible, terrible dialogue, and really, they probably both deserve to perish in the wastes.\n\nTechnically, the game is very average, with a dodgy-ish but functional combat system, limited enemy variation, a dull skill progression tree, and extremely linear environments (after the first prison level, everything is quite small as well, possibly rushed out given the number of invisible walls and empty dead ends. The crafting is menu driven, and depends on random pick ups. It's finicky, but ok functionally...but again, essentially pretty boring and tacked-on so they could put "crafting" down as a tag for the game.\n\nSo overall, a disappointing experience. It seems the developer is launching a new game about post-apocalyptic Mars and Technomancers...seems basically identical in the premise. I would research it carefully before picking it up...and not bother at all with this one.","May 28","false","8.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Even though cyberpunk is very hard to classify and provide any rules to make it so, this game is not cyberpunk. post apocalytic, yes. and though it is said to be on Mars any planet would have done as earth was mentioned once or twice in passing and could have been completely left out. This could have taken place on Earth and it would not have made any diffference if the mentioning of being on Mars was left out.\n\nThe description also states water drives a company war. No mention of attaining water is present, only the acquiring of power lost since the cataclysm. So, no part of the description is accurate. Except maybe the part of being a RPG. RPG-Lite, yes. With a very basic and limited crafting system to upgrade weapons and armor you can still have some variety in how you upgrade these items. Basic but nice.\n\nThe Feats are not that creative but the Skills and the associated trees give a decent variety to choose from and also provide some replayability. this is good because to get 100% acheivement you will have to replay twice. once on the second hardest difficulty and once on the hardest. you will also need to choose either the resistance or a general trying to overthrow the government. different choice will give a different ending which is good.\n\nAfter about 18 hours played once through I will at some point revisit the game. Not to get the 100% but because I enjoyed it. I didn't expect to because as other reviews state it suffers from Bad to very, very, very bad camera controls along with some questionable voice acting and written dialogue. a few times I laughed at how bad it was but there are some characters that are voiced awesome and have great dialogue to make up for the bad ones.\n\nAll that said I would tell anyone about this game and how surprisingly good it is. Maybe the secret to my enjoyment was expecting a horrible experience. Far from my expectations. I look Forward to the next game I just learned is entitled Technomancer and hopefully will be out soon.","September 11, 2015","true","18.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The story takes place in a gritty, dystopian, almost post-apoc setting and spans 3 chapters. There are a lot of sidequests and character interactions, and the game tends to alternate between big open areas and linear levels, which in my opinion provided a nice change pace.\n\nPerhaps what I liked the most was the levelling and the combat. The fighting was incredibly fun, a little awkward at first, but easy to get used to. And the customization of your weapon and armour is great. You get to find various tools and crafting parts that you can use on your gear to give it additional bonuses of your choice. The levelling had 3 different mastery trees - combat, renegade (support abilities like healing and stealth), and technomancy (electrical powers). The levelling happened very frequently, which was great too, since you didn't have to wait for ages to get to the skills you've had your eyes on.\n\nThe story and setting are pretty interesting. I personally found chapters 1 and 2 to be brilliant, but chapter 3 fell flat on its face. It almost felt as though the game was rushed at the end. What was most interesting perhaps is how at the end of chapter 2 you get a choice of split paths to join one of the 2 factions, which changes some things in chapter 3, but ultimately you end up visiting the exact same locations regardless of which faction you go with. The premise of split paths for the final chapter is fantastic, but the execution resulted in a diluted experience. Going with the Resistance at least was a half-decent attempt at a conclusion that presented some more moral choices down the line. But going with the general felt like it was added into the game at the very last minute just for the sake of having this split path feature.\n\nThe game also had 3 romance options in it, but this too felt rather lacking and devoid of much dialogue. A few other NPCs felt like they should've gotten more screen time than they actually did, like the bounty hunter friend of the main character.

It opens with Innocence Smith being taken into a POW camp where he is nearly molested by revolting Butterbean impersonator. Another prisoner named Roy steps in and defends Innocence. As the player you take control of Roy and attempt to escape the POW camp with your new buddy Innocence. From there the plot meanders until Roy and company expose a technomancer threat that must be dealt with. War logs offers two different paths to it's conclusion and aside from Innocence there are a few other companions that fight at your side.\n\nIt doesn't take long before it becomes clear that War Logs is one of the most poorly written RPGs to be released in the past decade. While most RPGs do a commendable job of integrating their lore into the narrative and supplement the details with an in game encyclopedia. The dialogue itself is coarse and attempts to paint the game world as pulpy and nihilistic but instead provides some juvenile shock value, copious groan-worthy lines and chest puffing macho posturing. Also plaguing the experience is the lack of a well developed antagonist and clear motivations and goals for the characters. The plot just meanders on in an entirely directionless manner until you reach the abrupt and cobbled together conclusion.\n\nBorrowing heavily from The Witcher 2, combat is involves a mixture of attacks, blocks, parries, dodge rools, special abilities, traps and items. Split second blocks result in parries which open enemies up for combos and mixing up your attack strings is necessary to prevent enemies from repelling your blows. Special attacks, like using your nail gun or techromancer abilities, can be set to hotkeys or accessed from a tactical menu that slows time and allows you to change your companion's combat behavior.  You rarely fight a single enemy so learning to mix your abilities and attacks to handle multiple foes is key. Early on this is a rather frustrating design however since you have a very limited tool set to engage groups of enemies with. Also frustrating is the camera which can become ensnared in tight spots. Companions also help keep the heat off of your character but they are not terribly effective in combat, often dying. All in all the combat in War Logs is the most engaging thing it offers though not the most original.\n\nRunning on the Silk engine, War Logs is far more reminiscent of burlap in terms of it's visual appeal. The settlements of Mars are a homogenous blend of metal scraps and red dirt. Few areas offer distinct visuals and interiors are sparse. Three quarters of the residents of Mars are bald and scars are their only distinct features. Art direction is also miserable, one of the characters looks like an extra from Little House on the Prairie that managed to fall into an electrician's toolbox. The moles in the game look like uncircumcised quadruped phalluses with beaver teeth.  Many of the interesting features of the martian settlements are above the camera's eye level and will most likely be missed by many players. Shadows are grainy and clothing textures have a dreadfully low resolution. Lip syncing is terrible and racial animations are limited to mouth movements resulting in unexpressive characters. Every now and then you will run into an area where the warm martian color pallete contrasts with cool green and blue hues creating an attractive setting. These areas are two few and far between to salvage the visual experience. Fortunately the music is inoffensive though not exactly memorable. Voice acting is much improved after a major patch which features a revised script and new vocal performances that amend what was one of the most atrocious voice overs since the Playstation era. Even still the characters fail to bring the shoddy script to life—a feat that is probably impossible anyway.","November 25, 2013","false","18.5"," 18 of 40 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","18","40","0","1"

Meanwhile, some of his co-thugs take up formation behind him, partially blocking the way leading wherever our hero wants to go. Cutscene ends, and there we go.\nOne of the lesser thugs attacks our hero. It's a short fight, only lengthened by our hero's realization that staying in block stance causes him to take no damage, and the thug to keep tirelessly hitting him. Meanwhile, our shy friend picked up a metal pipe, but doesn't want to do anything with it. We click the thug with our metal bludgeon until he falls to the ground.\nThe thug leader then says something to scare us. Now another lesser thug is facing us, the only one with a health bar above him. The rest of the band is standing as a group, taking on the important role of the audience. The one up for fight seems scared, pointing his dagger at us. Standing there.\nStill standing.\nThe tension is incredible, as our hero, facing such danger, waits a few moments to see if the thug means business.\nBut when nothing happens, Hero Guy tries to walk on towards his destination. He reaches the band of thugs, all seemingly cheering on the "fight", looking entertained, facing the empty middle of the yard. The rhythm of the Mars War Drums loops on from some unseen radio, as our hero silently walks between the thugs who seem not to notice him. But he can't go far: an invisible wall is preventing him from moving on. He seems to be very frustrated by this, as this causes him to perform a strange running excercise while remaining in place. He gets angry, swinging his bludgeon at all the standing thugs, who seem to be entirely unaffected.\nHero then goes back to the dagger-pointing man with the red bar above him. This man doesn't seem to want trouble. Hero stands up close, letting the daggered arm pierce through his upper torso, unfliching. Nothing happens. After a while our hero gets too frustrated by being magically locked in with these entirely inactive brutes, and swings his bludgeon at dagger guy. This guy seems to parry everything, and not attack at all, no matter what. Ah, apparently he's the tutorial (we disabled tutorials in the settings menu) for our hero's "block break" ability. He will parry our heavy bludgeon (exhaust pipe part? not sure) with his dagger every single time, taking no damage, unless we kick or punch him first, disorienting him. The block break doesn't do any damage, our hero can kick and punch the guy across the room ten times with no effect. The extremely advanced combination of kick and bludgeon hit however seems to do the trick, dagger guy falls quickly.\nThe next generic thug is sent towards us. He actually wants to hurt us, and can, unless we're standing in block stance. Our hero runs to the other end of the yard, the thug takes a few seconds to notice, swinging at air first. This one can be disoriented by the block break, or the pocket sand abilities.\nThen the leader thug comes at us, along with one of his friends, relatively quickly killing our hero. Thus ends our Martian career as a... who knows what?\n\nFights in this game can be very challenging to survive, but I didn't find them interesting at all, rather quite frustrating. Yes, this first fight scene was clearly meant as a gradual introduction to more difficult enemies, but I just couldn't take any of it seriously. The scene completely broke immersion for me with way the characters acted and the way the scene was rigged to show us basic combat movements without any regard to believable characters.\nAnd there are the other problems.\nThe game pauses while you select the ability to use, and if it requires aiming, well, you're out of luck, your gun will be fired in the direction you were standing before pausing. Same with thrown weapons. Climbing a ledge is a slow cutscene, with your comrades teleporting to behind you after you're done. Animations are rough, collision detection is terrible.\nCharacters stare with empty looks on their faces most of the time. Dialogues are extremely slow-paced, over-stretched, full of unnecessary pauses. After a dialogue, you might see a long, slow camera pan to our hero. The game starts with a long monologue by the shy kid about how war is bad. Then we enter an attempted sexual abuse scene, distrupted only by our gruff, silent hero, about whom we know nothing. The kid looks at him with doe eyes, but those eyes are the same all the time.\nThe gameplay consists of a lot of looting, collecting scrap metal, and doing quests for vending machine-like characters. There are moral choices sometimes, the very first one being the following questionable situation (after we "stop the shower sexual abuse"): the kid thanks us. Here we have the option to say "don't mention it", "you're welcome", or "I just wanted to keep you for myself!". What a great moral conundrum there!\n\nDidn't have the strength to play it much more. Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading. Have a nice day.","September 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Not Mars: War Logs. You must sell everything one by one, even if you have fifty of them. Enjoy!\n\nCrafting objects that are way more expensive then just buying them: To craft a health injection costs 20 serum, to buy one costs 8. Do the math.\n\nPutting sick plates on your dusty clothes: Now you can look like an awesome post-apocalyptic warrior, or maybe you can look like Kevin Costner in The Postman.\n\nActually fighting: When you aren't busy gophering, crafting, and getting lulled into a rage-coma by the silly acting and storytelling, you can beat enemies with improvised weapons. Yes, we are far into the future, but due to apparent reason guns, laser swords, and fun weapons don't exist in this sparse world. You get to beat up on your enemy with light fixtures and mole creature bones.\n\nPros of Mars: War Logs: You will be momentarily distracted from all the evil in this world by this catastrophe. You will get to practice your digital gymnastic skills (except for jumping, because why jump over things when you can roll right past them?).\n\nCons: Playing Mars: War Logs is a lot like playing Solitare. It's basically a way to tell your friends and family that you are exceptionally bored and have nothing on your plate at the moment. It's inviting people to give you a menial task to do, much like the NPCs in Mars: War Logs.

The game is pretty decent, and once you figure out the combat problems and techniques (yes, problems), it's a decent play.  However, the ovewhelmingly big issue is technomancy.  Everyone in the game world talks about technomancers like they are gods.  You turn out to be one and can use these powers.  Except you will NEVER be able to use these powers.  They are amazingly slow, so there is no way you can ever use them in a fight, other than if there is a single opponent who is focused on your companion, and at that point you may as well just club them instead.  They missed a huge opportunity with this massive design flaw to allow you to play different styles of character.  This continues through the other combat options as well, they simply are not designe well enough to allow for anything other than one style of play, when there could be 3 easily.  So, if you ignore technomacny entirely, never waste skill points on it, never try to use it, just focus on grenades, sneaking, and melee as your main points of combat (the occaisional trap and nail gun attack are fine too), then it's a decent play.  Unfortunately the other major flaw is that side quests never show objective markers like main quests, so that's pretty frustrating as well.  Get it on 60% off or more sale, it's not worth paying full price, and there are probably more enjoyable games to blow time on.","January 24, 2015","false","6.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I clocked in 30 hours before being completely finished with my first playthrough. My only recommendation for anyone considering purchasing it is to watch a gameplay video showing the combat, because it's likely to turn certain people away immediately. Try to play it like a hack & slash and you will die endlessly.\n\nCurrently, it has its share of tiny errors that can be easily missed if players aren't looking for them.\nTo avoid bugs/glitches, update your computer's graphics controller, audio controller, and verify the integrity of game cache before playing.\n\nComputer: Compaq Presario CQ57-439WM Notebook PC\nOperating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit\nGamepad: Logitech Dual Action w/Logitech Profiler\n\nIn-Depth Review:\n//Level Design\nThe level design is so well thought out that the entire world feels expansive and every location feels like what it is. Mole caves feel like enclosed spaces with only one exit. Shadowlair feels like a city full of life and people going about their lives even if they aren't happy to be alive. The structures above Roy and the paths he isn't allowed to take, even though they are right in front of him, all make the world feel existent.\nAn hour into the game, the level design reminded me of Phantom Dust. Fourteen hours later, it still did. This isn't a negative trait in the slightest.\n\n//Combat\nCombat is challenging, but simple. Attack, guard-break, block, counter, and dodge make up the basic maneuvers. What players spend their skill points on after leveling-up make up the fun part.\nExcluding boss fights, players can flee to the next area of a level to skip combat altogether. This could lead to a need for grinding as the game progresses, unfortunately.\nThe response time prevents button mashing since doing so will prevent players from making the quick decisions that are a constant part of combat. There's basically a half-second delay for every movement Roy makes.\nParty members can hold their own, but not for very long. Their main purpose is to distract enemies while the Roy eliminates as many as he can before they inevitably fall unconscious. They cannot be healed by the player, but their health is fully restored at the end of every battle. This system forces players to engage in combat rather than hide and adds an invisible timer set to how long they have until every conscious enemy gangs up on them. Yep.\n\n>Technomancy\nThe Technomancer skill tree is a worthy investment due to how fun and powerful it is. Too many enemies? Electric Arc. A single enemy with a high armor rating? Charged Weapon. Feeling overwhelmed? Energy Shield. The more you experiment, the more fun you'll have.\n\n>Stealth\nStealth is worth investing in for players who prefer not to go on all-out frontal assaults and enjoy thinning out the enemy first. There are some very tricky levels where playing as a stealth-based character becomes a challenge, but figuring out who to eliminate first and when to do so is part of the fun. Enemies are alerted by fallen comrades and will alert others if players don't quiet them quickly enough. Only further down the Renegade skill tree can players invest in hiding fallen enemies from sight.\nParty members stay in place and out the way until Roy exits from stealth mode. Since a patrolling enemy can still spot them, players can push party members wherever they want by running into them.\n\n//Boss Fights\nTo my recollection, there are six challenging boss fights in the game. None felt misplaced or thrown in.\n\nMy only complaint is that, at the final level of the game, there should have been an actual boss fight before the endscene. One or two powerful technomancers that Roy and/or Mary knew from their past would have done the trick.\n\n//Quests\nThere are more than enough non-mandatory side quests that get players more engulfed in the game world. Not a single quest is dull and pointless. All bring the world together and add character to its many inhabitants.\nQuest can go anywhere from helping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and mutants to stopping serial killers and spying on a political figure. Get ready for some odd situations you may not have been prepared for.\n\n//Party Members\nThe party members are interesting characters with their own motives, back-stories, and personalities. Personal favorite: Mary. She will say the darnest, hilarious, and most sad things.\nPlayers get a choice between three female love interests and gain five party members total. Only four of these five are available for each playthrough, however, and only one is allowed to accompany Roy at a time.\nParty members actually comment on Roy's decisions (serum extraction and dialogue) every now and then. Those moments help breath life into his character and theirs.\n\n//Dialogue\nConversations are well written and funny. There are even references here and there.\nPlayers get different options of what to say to NPC's. Some choices will cause Roy to engage in combat and others will cause him to evade it.\nGet ready for some hilarious conversations.\nThanks to the dialogue, I've found myself caring about the characters I met throughout the game. This really backfired when people died.\n\n//Ending\nI enjoyed the Aurora ending cutscenes I got, especially the last one.\n\nThe endlevel, on the other hand, was lacking in impact. I may have gotten the impression that this was it, but the lack of dialogue during the entire level made it similar to a non-boring grind without the need to level up.\nI'll give Spiders this much, they were successful in making a grinding level that was entertaining and barely felt like a grind. Unfortunately, they did not give it thrill, impact, or emotion.\nThe dialogue between Roy and his follower at the end was great, though. Just one more moment like or leading up to that beforehand would have done the trick for me.\n\nEven having Honour	 speaking out loud about the 'endboss', and adding backstory in the process, would have tremendously helped players care about what happened next. It would have also helped us understand the choice that was made in the first endscene.\nIt's a matter of character depth. More was given in the endscene for Honour and the 'endboss', but not quite enough. For me, the 'endboss' was the only character who lacked depth. All we really got were the reasons for said character's actions, which make sense and explain his/her villainy.\n\nOther than the lack of impact and a boss, the endlevel was perfectly fine.\n\n//Others\nPlayers must choose one of two factions (Resistance or Aurora) two-thirds of the way through the game. Both come with their own female party member / love interest.\n\nThere are multiple opportunities to end some NPC's lives outside of extracting Serum from defeated foes. This includes resolving conflicts for quests and actually killing one of the potential party members either directly or by abandonment.\n\nSerum extracting isn't necessary unless players want to do a 'Dark Side' playthrough, which affects the merchants' prices, intimidation skills of the player, and reactions of party members.\n\nThe actual war logs used in the game is a nice touch. It adds first person perspective immersion for those who are interested. Think of the journal from the Elder Scrolls series or, more accurately, Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura.\nThere's even a bestiary that includes NPCs and locations.\n\nThe main menu and combat menu are both very well designed. It took me some time to remember which menu tab (equipment, stats, etc) had what, though.\n\nWeapon, armor, item, and component crafting adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. There are no wrong combinations. It all comes down to what works best for your play style.","December 1, 2013","true","31.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

Meanwhile, some of his co-thugs take up formation behind him, partially blocking the way leading wherever our hero wants to go. Cutscene ends, and there we go.\nOne of the lesser thugs attacks our hero. It's a short fight, only lengthened by our hero's realization that staying in block stance causes him to take no damage, and the thug to keep tirelessly hitting him. Meanwhile, our shy friend picked up a metal pipe, but doesn't want to do anything with it. We click the thug with our metal bludgeon until he falls to the ground.\nThe thug leader then says something to scare us. Now another lesser thug is facing us, the only one with a health bar above him. The rest of the band is standing as a group, taking on the important role of the audience. The one up for fight seems scared, pointing his dagger at us. Standing there.\nStill standing.\nThe tension is incredible, as our hero, facing such danger, waits a few moments to see if the thug means business.\nBut when nothing happens, Hero Guy tries to walk on towards his destination. He reaches the band of thugs, all seemingly cheering on the "fight", looking entertained, facing the empty middle of the yard. The rhythm of the Mars War Drums loops on from some unseen radio, as our hero silently walks between the thugs who seem not to notice him. But he can't go far: an invisible wall is preventing him from moving on. He seems to be very frustrated by this, as this causes him to perform a strange running excercise while remaining in place. He gets angry, swinging his bludgeon at all the standing thugs, who seem to be entirely unaffected.\nHero then goes back to the dagger-pointing man with the red bar above him. This man doesn't seem to want trouble. Hero stands up close, letting the daggered arm pierce through his upper torso, unfliching. Nothing happens. After a while our hero gets too frustrated by being magically locked in with these entirely inactive brutes, and swings his bludgeon at dagger guy. This guy seems to parry everything, and not attack at all, no matter what. Ah, apparently he's the tutorial (we disabled tutorials in the settings menu) for our hero's "block break" ability. He will parry our heavy bludgeon (exhaust pipe part? not sure) with his dagger every single time, taking no damage, unless we kick or punch him first, disorienting him. The block break doesn't do any damage, our hero can kick and punch the guy across the room ten times with no effect. The extremely advanced combination of kick and bludgeon hit however seems to do the trick, dagger guy falls quickly.\nThe next generic thug is sent towards us. He actually wants to hurt us, and can, unless we're standing in block stance. Our hero runs to the other end of the yard, the thug takes a few seconds to notice, swinging at air first. This one can be disoriented by the block break, or the pocket sand abilities.\nThen the leader thug comes at us, along with one of his friends, relatively quickly killing our hero. Thus ends our Martian career as a... who knows what?\n\nFights in this game can be very challenging to survive, but I didn't find them interesting at all, rather quite frustrating. Yes, this first fight scene was clearly meant as a gradual introduction to more difficult enemies, but I just couldn't take any of it seriously. The scene completely broke immersion for me with way the characters acted and the way the scene was rigged to show us basic combat movements without any regard to believable characters.\nAnd there are the other problems.\nThe game pauses while you select the ability to use, and if it requires aiming, well, you're out of luck, your gun will be fired in the direction you were standing before pausing. Same with thrown weapons. Climbing a ledge is a slow cutscene, with your comrades teleporting to behind you after you're done. Animations are rough, collision detection is terrible.\nCharacters stare with empty looks on their faces most of the time. Dialogues are extremely slow-paced, over-stretched, full of unnecessary pauses. After a dialogue, you might see a long, slow camera pan to our hero. The game starts with a long monologue by the shy kid about how war is bad. Then we enter an attempted sexual abuse scene, distrupted only by our gruff, silent hero, about whom we know nothing. The kid looks at him with doe eyes, but those eyes are the same all the time.\nThe gameplay consists of a lot of looting, collecting scrap metal, and doing quests for vending machine-like characters. There are moral choices sometimes, the very first one being the following questionable situation (after we "stop the shower sexual abuse"): the kid thanks us. Here we have the option to say "don't mention it", "you're welcome", or "I just wanted to keep you for myself!". What a great moral conundrum there!\n\nDidn't have the strength to play it much more. Sorry for the rant, thanks for reading. Have a nice day.","September 30, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I used the XBOX 360 controller to play the game.\n\nI can only recommend the game on sale, and if you don’t have any high expectations. You might be disappointed otherwise, like I was. I was more disappointed in the plot and characters as I got nearer to the end of the game.\n\nMars: War Logs (MWL) starts off great but will eventually fall flat and dull, with boring characters, story, and environments. RPG elements are great, and combat gets more interesting if you invest the points wisely. MWL looks good on top that helps immersion, unfortunately on closer inspection npcs and the environment look rough around the edges. MWL has a very linear corridor setup for you to travel around, and visually the game gets very repetitive.\n\nMWL does start with an interesting story, and characters. Mars itself has a robust background that really helps create immersion in the game, the same can be said for the characters, but it doesn’t last. The story feels uninspired nearer the end of the game, and characters feel rushed, flat, and placed to connect the plot. This is a shame because Spiders have done a really good job in creating the universe you play in, they just couldn’t hold it up.\n\nYour introduction to the protagonist, Roy Temperance is a little odd, as he doesn't react to the situation he’s in. He just stands there in silence, and the gang leader he’s confronting has a one way conversation with him. I understand that maybe the reason for this was to make Roy a blank canvas, so you could shape his personality with the conversation lines you pick. However they missed a good opportunity to introduce the conversation mechanic. You can also further shape Roy by either abandoning fallen enemies or killing them at the end of a fight, the payoff is more serum, serum is the game currency as well as a craftable for medicine.\n\nLike a lot of action games the fighting doesn’t get interesting till you unlock certain skills that compliment your play style. The same could be said for MWL, because when you unlock the technomancer skill set, the combat is a lot more fun. You can plan your skill advancements by looking at the locked skills, this really helped gain the skills I wanted on level up.\n\nFor everything the combat does right, it does something wrong as well, but at least it gives you options. You can go solo or go along with a side kick. You can control your buddy’s fighting style with defensive/attack nearest/ranged/or same as, but you can’t share items and tell them to use them or certain attacks, also you can’t heal them. Not being able to heal your party member will mean that they could fall during the fight. Mashing buttons won’t help you either, this will end up queuing the next selection while the current action is played out, a little thought and planning is vital to fights. There is the option to go in stealthy and hide enemies to avoid alerting others, your success may depend on your skill unlocks. Combat isn’t helped by bad camera angles, that can have you fighting off screen till it resets or you move it.\n\nFrom an RPG aspect a lot of game mechanics and details were added that really benefit the game. You can craft upgrades for your melee weapon or clothing, your conversation choices will affect the person you become and the reactions by npcs. Levelling up will give you skill points to use for combat, and in the trait selection. The trait selection offers an additional boost to non combat things such as looting and crafting. Cutscenes can be skipped as well. All these little elements enrich the gameplay and were thought out by an experienced dev team with gaming experience.\n\nVisually MWL looks good on top then degrades the further down you go. Roy Temperance, has a lot of detail and looks good. However thing start to look a little worse when you get to npcs and the environment itself. MWL really needed some variety in how it looks, the change in environment was occasional, but still bland at best.\n\nHopefully one daySpiders will  revisit Mars, they really do have an impressive backstory with a lot of potential to do more with, especially with the technomancy.\n","December 7, 2014","false","15.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The problem is that the AI of your companions is useless, if you have any companions, and that if you are fighting two opponents you're guaranteed to lose at rock paper scissors, since one of the two will be countering you, and the other will kill you. That means you're constantly trying to evade and get occasional hits in, in really cramped quarters.

I clocked in 30 hours before being completely finished with my first playthrough. My only recommendation for anyone considering purchasing it is to watch a gameplay video showing the combat, because it's likely to turn certain people away immediately. Try to play it like a hack & slash and you will die endlessly.\n\nCurrently, it has its share of tiny errors that can be easily missed if players aren't looking for them.\nTo avoid bugs/glitches, update your computer's graphics controller, audio controller, and verify the integrity of game cache before playing.\n\nComputer: Compaq Presario CQ57-439WM Notebook PC\nOperating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit\nGamepad: Logitech Dual Action w/Logitech Profiler\n\nIn-Depth Review:\n//Level Design\nThe level design is so well thought out that the entire world feels expansive and every location feels like what it is. Mole caves feel like enclosed spaces with only one exit. Shadowlair feels like a city full of life and people going about their lives even if they aren't happy to be alive. The structures above Roy and the paths he isn't allowed to take, even though they are right in front of him, all make the world feel existent.\nAn hour into the game, the level design reminded me of Phantom Dust. Fourteen hours later, it still did. This isn't a negative trait in the slightest.\n\n//Combat\nCombat is challenging, but simple. Attack, guard-break, block, counter, and dodge make up the basic maneuvers. What players spend their skill points on after leveling-up make up the fun part.\nExcluding boss fights, players can flee to the next area of a level to skip combat altogether. This could lead to a need for grinding as the game progresses, unfortunately.\nThe response time prevents button mashing since doing so will prevent players from making the quick decisions that are a constant part of combat. There's basically a half-second delay for every movement Roy makes.\nParty members can hold their own, but not for very long. Their main purpose is to distract enemies while the Roy eliminates as many as he can before they inevitably fall unconscious. They cannot be healed by the player, but their health is fully restored at the end of every battle. This system forces players to engage in combat rather than hide and adds an invisible timer set to how long they have until every conscious enemy gangs up on them. Yep.\n\n>Technomancy\nThe Technomancer skill tree is a worthy investment due to how fun and powerful it is. Too many enemies? Electric Arc. A single enemy with a high armor rating? Charged Weapon. Feeling overwhelmed? Energy Shield. The more you experiment, the more fun you'll have.\n\n>Stealth\nStealth is worth investing in for players who prefer not to go on all-out frontal assaults and enjoy thinning out the enemy first. There are some very tricky levels where playing as a stealth-based character becomes a challenge, but figuring out who to eliminate first and when to do so is part of the fun. Enemies are alerted by fallen comrades and will alert others if players don't quiet them quickly enough. Only further down the Renegade skill tree can players invest in hiding fallen enemies from sight.\nParty members stay in place and out the way until Roy exits from stealth mode. Since a patrolling enemy can still spot them, players can push party members wherever they want by running into them.\n\n//Boss Fights\nTo my recollection, there are six challenging boss fights in the game. None felt misplaced or thrown in.\n\nMy only complaint is that, at the final level of the game, there should have been an actual boss fight before the endscene. One or two powerful technomancers that Roy and/or Mary knew from their past would have done the trick.\n\n//Quests\nThere are more than enough non-mandatory side quests that get players more engulfed in the game world. Not a single quest is dull and pointless. All bring the world together and add character to its many inhabitants.\nQuest can go anywhere from helping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and mutants to stopping serial killers and spying on a political figure. Get ready for some odd situations you may not have been prepared for.\n\n//Party Members\nThe party members are interesting characters with their own motives, back-stories, and personalities. Personal favorite: Mary. She will say the darnest, hilarious, and most sad things.\nPlayers get a choice between three female love interests and gain five party members total. Only four of these five are available for each playthrough, however, and only one is allowed to accompany Roy at a time.\nParty members actually comment on Roy's decisions (serum extraction and dialogue) every now and then. Those moments help breath life into his character and theirs.\n\n//Dialogue\nConversations are well written and funny. There are even references here and there.\nPlayers get different options of what to say to NPC's. Some choices will cause Roy to engage in combat and others will cause him to evade it.\nGet ready for some hilarious conversations.\nThanks to the dialogue, I've found myself caring about the characters I met throughout the game. This really backfired when people died.\n\n//Ending\nI enjoyed the Aurora ending cutscenes I got, especially the last one.\n\nThe endlevel, on the other hand, was lacking in impact. I may have gotten the impression that this was it, but the lack of dialogue during the entire level made it similar to a non-boring grind without the need to level up.\nI'll give Spiders this much, they were successful in making a grinding level that was entertaining and barely felt like a grind. Unfortunately, they did not give it thrill, impact, or emotion.\nThe dialogue between Roy and his follower at the end was great, though. Just one more moment like or leading up to that beforehand would have done the trick for me.\n\nEven having Honour	 speaking out loud about the 'endboss', and adding backstory in the process, would have tremendously helped players care about what happened next. It would have also helped us understand the choice that was made in the first endscene.\nIt's a matter of character depth. More was given in the endscene for Honour and the 'endboss', but not quite enough. For me, the 'endboss' was the only character who lacked depth. All we really got were the reasons for said character's actions, which make sense and explain his/her villainy.\n\nOther than the lack of impact and a boss, the endlevel was perfectly fine.\n\n//Others\nPlayers must choose one of two factions (Resistance or Aurora) two-thirds of the way through the game. Both come with their own female party member / love interest.\n\nThere are multiple opportunities to end some NPC's lives outside of extracting Serum from defeated foes. This includes resolving conflicts for quests and actually killing one of the potential party members either directly or by abandonment.\n\nSerum extracting isn't necessary unless players want to do a 'Dark Side' playthrough, which affects the merchants' prices, intimidation skills of the player, and reactions of party members.\n\nThe actual war logs used in the game is a nice touch. It adds first person perspective immersion for those who are interested. Think of the journal from the Elder Scrolls series or, more accurately, Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura.\nThere's even a bestiary that includes NPCs and locations.\n\nThe main menu and combat menu are both very well designed. It took me some time to remember which menu tab (equipment, stats, etc) had what, though.\n\nWeapon, armor, item, and component crafting adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. There are no wrong combinations. It all comes down to what works best for your play style.","December 1, 2013","true","31.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgthopsthefag/recommended/232750/","sgthopsthefag","I'm somehow enjoying Merzbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgthopsthefag/","235 products in account","This game is a great example of what happens when a developer sets his ambition way too high, and creates something that he is not capable of creating. He might have had great ideas, but because his skill was not that great, he ended up creating something of mediocre worth rather than a grand masterpiece. And what a shame it is, because this game did indeed have some potential.\n\nGameplay wise, it is essentially Witcher 2 combined with Mass Effect, but without any of the things that made both games great. Much of the choices that you make don't really matter, and the morality system is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, as all the bonuses that it gives you don't really help at all, nor does the morality system majorly change the way people look at you. The bonus that you get for being a man with an excellent reputation doesn't help due to how useless your NPC party members are, thanks to the fact that the AI in the game for party members sucks ♥♥♥ and due to how quickly they die. Merchants are pretty useless unless you are trying to complete certain plot related quests that involve giving serum (money) to NPCs by selling off ♥♥♥♥ you don't need or are in need of serum for making meds to use in combat. You can pretty much get a lot of the items you need by looting enemies or by finding some junk piles or crates that are put across the map. Speaking of serum, it is admittedly an interesting kind of currency, but as mentioned before, it's only really useful for those two things, and just like most items, you loot it from crates and enemies. The way you loot it from enemies though is usually through a serum extractor, which apparently kills some guy who should already be dead after being beaten mercilessly by a pipe with a cleaver, and using the serum extractor on a guy who should have already been dead by now also lowers your reputation. Like that totally makes any sense. Had it not been for the skill level cap of three instead of two, it would have been safe to say that the game's skill tree system is an exact rip off of Witcher 2's skill tree. Now, character building is one of the better things about this game, but sadly there still are a couple of problems. For instance, the renegade skill tree has skills that suppossedly help improve the stealth in this game, but stealth is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useless thanks to how poorly it's implemented. I know Witcher 2 has some questionable stealth as well, but at least that game didn't have you go out of stealth mode after attempting to knock out an enemy or had skills in the skill tree related to a mechanic that was pretty much pointless. The perk system is also pretty stupid. Do X amount of things several times and you can then wait till you level up a few times in order to get X amount of Character Perk Points just to purchase X perk. Why not give the perk after doing X thing several times, or do what the Fallout series does, and give out a perk every few levels. Some perks are also tied to your morality level, which is something that I find to be really stupid. Not being able to use charismatic and intimidative dialogue choices unless your character is (or was at one point) with a good or bad rep shows that the game's view on morality is worse than that of an elementary schooler. Of course, as mentioned before, most of your choices do jack ♥♥♥♥, so what's the point anyways? Combat is pretty much ripped straight from Witcher 2. Everything from the ability to slow down time and switch your skills to the roll n' doge - stab - block gameplay of Witcher 2, with the exception that you can actually heal during combat. It's too bad that the camera can cause you to ♥♥♥♥ up, and although not at the teir of Kingdom Hearts Camera Bad, it still is pretty shoddy. There are also bombs, traps and ranged weapons just like the ones from Witcher 2, but the variety is quite lacking. In fact, you only get one type of trap, one type of gun (a nail gun, which makes me question how they could only have those and not ♥♥♥♥ like machine guns and laser pistols), and one type or bomb. The game also allows you one AI-controlled party member (this is where the Mass Effect elements come in), though you might as well be playing without the AI, because about 95% of the time, I found the AI for party members to be one of the most incompetent things ever, as it dies faster than a still-born baby in the womb, and that's even when you tell it to focus on defense. Not being able to go through your party member's equipment in order to give them better weapons and armor doesn't make it any better. The game is also full of stupid invisible walls, and the enviorments are a bore to explore, as you can only enter places that the game deems important. You cannot even enter a single house that belongs to some random person. The civillian NPCs in the game must be the most ballin' people in the universe, because they don't get scared if you pull out your weapon in front of them! Side quests ♥♥♥♥ing suck, as they are primarilly the same boring fetch quests found in plenty of other RPGs, and their rewards usually aren't worth it. Finally, there's crafting, and cliche as it sounds, crafting is perhaps the game's best feature, though I do find it stupid that you can access the craft screen during battle.\n\n\nBefore I talk about the story, I would like to say that I wouldn't call the setting a cyberpunk one, as it looks more like an apocalyptic low-tech wasteland with some minor cyberpunk and space opera elements rather than a cyberpunk world full of men with cyberarms that act as weapons mowing down corparates from the local mega-corp. Having hi-tech gloves that let you shoot beams of electricity doesn't make it a cyberpunk game either. The game does however have an interesting setting, despite how generic of a setting Mars tends to be. Of course, the game has to have poorly explained lore that is extremely hard to follow, and this is despite the patch that was suppossed to fix a lot of the problems with the script. The characters? I didn't really like any of them, and the way the characters act is so unreal that I highly doubt that anyone could truly care for them. My least favorite charcters would have to either be Roy or Mary. Roy because he's the typical man with a mysterious past type of character, and Mary because she suddenly goes from being this ♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to kill you and hates your guts to this ♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to ♥♥♥♥ you just because you saved her, and she doesn't even have a hint of suspicion about you afterwards.\n\n\nPresentation wise, the game is what you would expect from a small studio. Not too bad, but there could have been way more colours than just orange, red, black and grey. Character designs range from okay to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking, Mary included. Enviorments tend to be boring as hell, and as mentioned before, are not very explorable due to how many invisible walls there are. The music is pretty forgettable as well. Finally, there's the voice acting, and holy ♥♥♥♥ is it bad most of the time. Sometimes, it's actually quite funny, while other times it's cringe worthy, and of course there's always the mixture of the two. Now, I should note that it is better than the voice acting that was in the game at launch, but it still is a long way from being good.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Mars War Logs is average at its best, and mediocre at its worst, and, at least in my opinion, is not worth its current price tag, nor is it an RPG that I would recommend to people looking for a great RPG experience. If, however, you still want to give the game a go, do what I did, and buy it on sale for really cheap. If I had to give it a rating, the most I would give it would be a 5/10.","July 26, 2014","false","9.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Granted, I'm only a couple hours into the game but it's already lost me.  Your companions are next to useless, walking pylons at best, and you spend the majority of most battles leaping around the battlefield or blocking a flurry of blows in order not to get stunlocked.  I don't mind a challenge, Darksouls/Demonsouls are difficult games but there you at least feel like you lost a fair fight.  This game is just tedious.\n\nI'm going to refrain from commenting on the story, haven't experienced enough to give it a fair shake.  However, so far the majority of the quests have been fairly bland in nature (talk to person A or find enough of part B) which are usually solved by walking around talking/clicking on everything until it says you did what you're supposed to.  A few of the quests appear to have some branching paths, which I regard as a good effort, but ultimately aren't really used that effectively and end up being fairly bland.\n\nI might go back and give it another shot at some point, but at the moment I'm glad I only spend $5 on this.","October 15, 2014","false","2.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The graphics are okay, there is not much to see, but overall the places and people are believable, however do not expect anything fancy. The game kicks off better as it progresses later.

I understand that I have only play just under 20minets. But just hear me out.\n\nThis game was Relese in 2013. Expectations where high. But i do under stand the RPGs are really big games to build\n\nAs a pc gamer, I was expecting this game to be good from that trailer that Spiders Studios release. But this is where it has taken as complete U-Turn.\n\nPlay with as mouse and keybourd like that majoraty of PC plays. We began this game with as avrage cut scene to get some back story, befoer handed the controls. After going through 5mins of base story that explains who this character taht you will be getting the story through. We meet the character that you play.\n\nStarting out where i can now move it began to fall apart. I can see veay clearly that this game was 100% desihned for a controler not keybourd and mouse. normal that is not a really big problem for me but this game just felt really clunky through all the animation blending and hot the character respoind to the commands.\n\nCombat was very basic only need about 3 keys to fight Strick, Block and Block Breaking. A very simple fighting game style, but I felt it need something more something to stand alone from other RPG's. But saddly i had to stop after finishing of the first guy.\n\nAfter completeing just the little bit I was done.\n\nTexture where very low even on high I can see all the detail in the 512X512 maps. I was hopeing that they would have pushed it a little more.\n\nAnimations Felt like it was on the second pass of the Animation stage and need more time spent on. Considering there are lot of closes ups on faces and the lip sinking was off.\n\nControls really clunky, if going to play it controler you may get better game play.\n\nOver all if your RPG fan maybe try it if you have finished all other games from AAA companys. If your looking to buy it there are a lot better RPGs out there than this one. That is why i would NOT Recommend this on PC.","November 8, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

The environment design is strong, but the game itself is nothing special at all. There is only one type of gun, one type of melee weapon, and combat is very repetitive: dodge, attack, block, counter-attack. There is a crafting system that adds some value to the repetition of looting glowing crates and piles of junk, but it isn't especially robust. The principal voice actor is not strong and subtitles are poorly written. Run-of-the-mill scripting and frequent grammatical errors lead the voice actors to give bad line readings. Voice recording direction seems nonexistant, as they stuck with bad and awkward takes. Some elements just feel erroneous and low-budget; the leg animations for walking are awkward and unrealistic, for example. Legs sort of swing outward and roll forward. Really basic animation elements like these being punted contributes to the unfinished feel. Poor lip-synch and a lack of transition animations between sneaking, walking, slow walking, and sprinting seem to be a function of the low budget and small studio.

I beat the game pretty quickly despite the fact that I had to replay multiple parts, and I didn't love the combat, though it was still fun. I found the few characters that were actually developed to some degree to be quite interesting, and the ability to influence the final outcome, and who lives and dies is just something I always enjoy in an rpg.\nWhat's wrong with it? For one dialog is confusing, it's not like in mass effect which gives you, good bad and neutral, in fact it makes little distinction obvious, at times I felt like there was no difference in the choices I was given, and what irrirated me the most was when I clicked an option, but what the character said seemed to be nothing like what the option said.

Full stop.\n\n"Why?" you might ask.\nWell...\n\nI like this think this game captures enough of how a lot games used to be: focusing just the right amount of time on each part of the game; story, world, environment (visuals), characters and gameplay. Can't say that about many games that get released these days.\n\nThe game introduces you to the concept quickly, yet efficiently. There's just enough said so that not too much is told and it makes you want to go explore and learn about the world around you, and characters.\n\nThe combat isn't perfect, I have to admit. There are a couple of faults and bugs here and there. But it's on of those combat models which is challanging - and requires quite a few tries until you get used to it. Especially when you're trying to complete the game on hardcore difficulty...\n\nThe best part of the game is the story. There is no "right or wrong" or "good or bad". It's a story, with complications and twists round every corner. I won't spoil too much...\n\nIt provides a good 10-15 hours depending on how many side missions you take on and how much time you invest in conversations. Usually, I would say it's too short - but it didn't cost a lot (I got it when released - not on a sale).\n\nSo yeh. Get this game - it is simply amaizing! I'd really recommend it!","May 1, 2014","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You cannot exploit all of its hidden potential despite you upgrade al your stealh related skills (for not mentioning that you're the one alerting a gang of idle/patrolling foes, but your partners are blessed with "feather feet" and won't alert them even when they run in front of them -that makes a bad and very ugly impression-). But the rest of the game features goes from the good implemented to the very well implemented. All the RPG part in this game is very simple, but you won't find any lack of fun for it.\n\nVisuals in this game are always good and, sometimes, they're stunning. Its atmosphere is well implemented (in the line of Mad Max, Chronichles of Riddick or Borderlands).\n\nCombats are tremendous, almost a matter of button twitching but, again, fun and addictive (the fact of almost stopping the time -but not completely- for determining an action or give an order to your partner gives a chance for you to not think only about twitching).\n\nSounds and ambient music make its role, and voice are pretty well (at least the voices in english, I can't understand some comments regarding to the awful voice acting but to refering to other languages, or it's me that I ain't so demanding on this term -but I don't think so-). :P\n\nThrowing sand to the eyes of human enemies not protected with Riddick-style-sunglasses is a feature I'd never seen before in a game, and useful a lot.\n\nHistory is fragmented, there's not a clearly central plot involved as their tittle ("War Logs") suggests, and mainly focused in the friendship between the two protagonists and their fight for survival.\n\nIn resume, a well planned game (and well executed almost all the time) that is absolutely worthing of a try. Just don't expect a complex and big "monster" as the above mentioned (which they're not games, they're UNIVERSES) with a rich amount of player statistics.","February 1, 2014","true","65.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's worth $5 and 15 hours, but don't buy it unless it's on sale.\n\nThis is a case of a game not having the resources required to meet its vision.  The core idea behind the game is good, if not entirely gripping:  you take the role of a typical hero on Mars, deciding the fate of its people and factions.  The area design is decent: combats are interesting and there's a certain limited amount of exploring to do.  The environments and character models are visually appealing, but there are far too few of them. The entire game, apart from one area at the end, uses almost all the same object models (doors, walls, boxes, piles of junk, etc).\n\nThe skill design is decent: there are actual choices to be made that affect how your character approaches combat.  There are a few choices to be made, story-wise, but it never feels like they really have an impact.\n\nIf you're looking for another Mass Effect, this isn't it, although it tries to be.

Equally it has a choice driven story with actions changing the game progression. The combat is pretty fun, although once you have the mechanics down it feels the same every time. Theres also a leveling system although its not as intuitive as it could easily have been, and the explanations of how it works are fairely poor.\nThe game suffers from some very basic visuals, and poor oversight in its development, such as when I spared some people and it stated id killed them in the diary.\nEqually, some points of the plot are very poorly written, to the extent that on the spot you could come up with more feasible dialogue.\nDuring cutscenes or dialogue exchanges you can also notice the seams where bits are played based on your choices, which kind of kills the atmosphere. And the dialogue is very limited, with very few available exchanges or choices.\nPerhaps the most damning fact is the game is brutally short. For the time iv played it i would expect to be no more than a quarter of the way through it. It feels like it could have been so good, and at times you actually become interested in whats going on, but the development is so shallow, and as soon as you find something interesting the game rushes onto something else.\nHad I paid full price, this would be a down vote and id be pretty angry.

Olny one thing, what i did not like about this game is that in combat you are allways fustratingly undernumberd, and companinons are good for decoys for some soilders, so you could kill off some before you have to deal with whole army.

Full stop.\n\n"Why?" you might ask.\nWell...\n\nI like this think this game captures enough of how a lot games used to be: focusing just the right amount of time on each part of the game; story, world, environment (visuals), characters and gameplay. Can't say that about many games that get released these days.\n\nThe game introduces you to the concept quickly, yet efficiently. There's just enough said so that not too much is told and it makes you want to go explore and learn about the world around you, and characters.\n\nThe combat isn't perfect, I have to admit. There are a couple of faults and bugs here and there. But it's on of those combat models which is challanging - and requires quite a few tries until you get used to it. Especially when you're trying to complete the game on hardcore difficulty...\n\nThe best part of the game is the story. There is no "right or wrong" or "good or bad". It's a story, with complications and twists round every corner. I won't spoil too much...\n\nIt provides a good 10-15 hours depending on how many side missions you take on and how much time you invest in conversations. Usually, I would say it's too short - but it didn't cost a lot (I got it when released - not on a sale).\n\nSo yeh. Get this game - it is simply amaizing! I'd really recommend it!","May 1, 2014","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's worth $5 and 15 hours, but don't buy it unless it's on sale.\n\nThis is a case of a game not having the resources required to meet its vision.  The core idea behind the game is good, if not entirely gripping:  you take the role of a typical hero on Mars, deciding the fate of its people and factions.  The area design is decent: combats are interesting and there's a certain limited amount of exploring to do.  The environments and character models are visually appealing, but there are far too few of them. The entire game, apart from one area at the end, uses almost all the same object models (doors, walls, boxes, piles of junk, etc).\n\nThe skill design is decent: there are actual choices to be made that affect how your character approaches combat.  There are a few choices to be made, story-wise, but it never feels like they really have an impact.\n\nIf you're looking for another Mass Effect, this isn't it, although it tries to be.  If you're looking for 15-20 hours of solid gameplay, go for it.","April 19, 2014","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This indie role-playing game boasts a unique setting and world to explore. The game has plenty of action, but also provides customization through skill trees and crafting.Both of those aspects are nice, but don't feel like fully fleshed-out concepts. I find myself wishing the game was longer, not only because it's a bit on the short side, but because I want to learn more about the fascinating places and characters introduced in the story.

Many time syou will enter combat to find out you have no companion because he/she is stuck in the entrace still.\n-As said above, story is mixed bag of good and bad. Why its that is it makes these huge leaps forward in time with no warning or exlaination. One character literally went from hating me and wanting to kill me, to questioning her faith, to being in love with me, IN ONE CONVERSATION. So you end up doing adouble take and wondering what the hell just happened.\n-Thats the problem, the writers knew where they wanted to take the story, and its a good story, but instead of flowing from start to finish its jump jump jump and often in those juumps your left wondering how such a huge change happened.\n-Maps/zones are quit small in size and because of that you find yourself loading into combat befor eyour compaion joins in\n\nOver all I would give this game a 9/10 on potential\nbut a 5/10 on delivering and meeting potential\nThe concept is sound and appealing\nThey just needed better writers and more back story and lore to discover","December 18, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is stellar (think Shadow of Mordor on a 50th of the budget), the transitional animations are nonexistent (again, 50th of the budget), and the dialogue is a handful of great lines jingle-jangling around in a nonsensical word salad. Great fun for cheap.","June 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there's high replayability since there are several paths to follow that lead to different endings (altough for that purpose, I highly recommend that you save prior to key conversations, as they do matter a lot in this game and the outcome).\n\nThe thing is... the combat sucks. Like, big time. But if you get hooked by the story, it's bearable and you can get used to it.\n\nThe game's got pretty interesting things actually, it does a good job at imagining a distopian futuristic Mars, and lets you build your hero/antihero with an fair enough skilltree. Not to mention that you can romance someone in it, as long as you're not a ♥♥♥♥ at a specific point in the story.\n\nAll in all, yes I do recommend it BUT keep in mind that the combat is real crap and that the game's a bit rough around the edges. AND buy on sale or bundled only.","May 29","true","17.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/232750/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","For whatever reason Mars: War Logs makes me feel like it’s coming from one of those hungry new developers that have something to throw out into the industry and make a noise. Mars: War Logs when going head to head with some of the bigger developers and publishers seems more like a poor man’s answer to Mass Effect. It comes away with a mixed bag of features that if you are not looking for King Lear you may find enough here to keep you entertained amongst the Hodge podge of entertainment values. This sci fi rpg style game has a nice enough mix to it in regards to gaming that players of some of the table top cyberpunk or other sci fi games will find some entertainment here.\n\nMars: War Logs takes place a century after some world changing event. The red planet is in turmoil and war. Water is now the most prized resource causing out right war for its control. In the middle of all this players start out as a prisoner of war. Shipped off to a POW camp the interactions begin to get rather tense here and it is here that you soon discover this is not a game for kids. When they warn of adult content and sexual innuendos they are not kidding. A young character almost runs afoul of a prison gang in the sand showers; they want to ♥♥♥♥ the lad. The dialogue is pretty straight forward about it as is the actions of the characters on screen.\n\nThe main character is multi skilled and like any good story is soon on a grand adventure. It’s in a world where the outcome really won’t make a huge impact; it’s more about making a crap situation into a tolerable one. Along the way players the character is developed more by not only the choices set forth, but also as the players choose different skills and perks to customize the character. There is also a crafting system that allows for creation and modifications of equipment. Early in the game you are able to craft either injections like a health pack, or ammunition which allows the player to create ammo for their weapons.\n\nUnder the skill tree there are only a few options to choose to branch from they are Renegade, Combat or Technomancer. Each one has interesting builds offering different play styles and strengths and weaknesses. Every time the character levels up the player will have skill points that they can spend to better the characters abilities. There are also equipment slots; players can customize the looks and stats of equipment for a better overall RPG experience.\n\nThe first part of the game is understandably easy, the first encounter acts as a tutorial when you mix it up with some fellow prisoners. Later on the enemy types get much harder to deal with and it takes some strategy to take them on. Depending on your play style there are some sections of the game that stealth comes in handy. You can even go so far as to say stealth is very important in some areas. Trying to max out the renegade skills having to do with stealth is a big help in these sections; especially if the player wants to try their hand at some of those stealth kills.\n\nStory and voice acting are not too bad; they fit the game style well. There are times throughout the story where the character dialogue is cut off, and they do not speak what is painfully obvious the full line they are supposed to speak. So if you run into this, having the sub titles on may be of some assistance. While on this subject in regards to story, avoid the temptation to jump past the story dialogues and cut scenes, a lot of the game is more enjoyable while having the story play out for you. Voice acting I suspect was done more on an individual actor by actor basis, rather than the actors running the scene together and being in the moment. For the most part it sells, it’s not stellar voice overs but it is not awful either.\n\nCombat in the game comes down to a lot of maneuvering, especially if the player draws the attention of several enemies at once. They will swarm you and attack as they see fit. They won’t line up and come at you in order to make it easy for you. Oh no, some strategy and hit and run tactics are in order here. After taking an enemy out don’t forget to search them for useful items.\n\nMars: War Logs is worth a go as long as you understand out of the gate it’s not a triple -A -title. But as a gamer, a true gamer, you may just find yourself some entertainment here.","March 18, 2014","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
