In comparison to similar games, it was made before FTL (and served as minor inspiration for FTL) and after the first two Weird Worlds games (not cited as an inspiration for Flotilla).\n\nYou are the captain of two identical small ships to begin with, always the same two ships. You have been told you have seven months to live. You jump around a procedurally generated starmap just like FTL and Weird Worlds, at each jump you encounter a random event. It can be a multiple choice question, a free item or ship to add to your flotilla and of course it can be a fight.\n\nYou'll enter a fight with your full flotilla, which will be every ship you managed to get during that run. You will fight the opposing team in 30 second bursts until one team is completely annihilated. Back on the map, after a certain amount of time has passed, the game ends and you get your final score.\n\nPROS\nThe combat: Every time someone makes me play a game and says "it's art" they're not always wrong but they usually are. Well I'm putting my nuts on the chopping block, this is art. You point out where on the X, Y and Z axis you want your ship to travel too, you decide if they'll be firing and who they'll be firing at. Then you press play and it plays out for 30 seconds, everyone floats in their allotted directions firing at what you wanted them to. In the background plays classical piano pieces, Prelude in D-Flat Major by Chopin etc. as this is going on. Then when the 30 seconds are up, silence.... and you plot the next moves and press play again. Shielding is actually proper shielding, you hit the light coloured areas you're hitting a shield, chances of scoring an actual HP lowering hit are slim when you do that, you hit a non-shielded area such as the rear or underside then you'll likely cause damage. I play out these battles in the background all evening while I'm working on other things, it's a relaxing experience and it's very difficult to get flustered. To me this is the best part of the game it does what FTL and Weird Worlds couldn't do for me, fit into the background rather than command my undivided attention.\n\nThe characters and setting: Rastafarian Cats, Bandit Penguins it's got an interesting mix of anthropomorphised characters, humans too. Each character is offset against a very fitting musical theme. After every jump in the star system you find yourself asking "what the hell was that about?" which definitely seems to be the developer's intention and I think they pulled it off. I find it even more interesting than the lore in FTL.\n\nThe Mystery: Outside of the ships and ship upgrades, nothing is explained. Every decision can come back to haunt to you in a branched off event, this was done to excellent effect in FTL two years later as well, Flotilla's handling of events is terser and shorter but far more representative of the whole game story. For example each jump you make and what happened gets written down in a Captain's log which reflects your ending score.\n\nCONS\nReduced content: The game is small. It's a real shame that it likely won't see the updates and DLC that it so richly deserves. From a standpoint of pure common sense it's just not viable for Blendo Games to return to the development of a 4 year old game, especially when it's a one man team and the popularity of this title pales in comparison to their other titles, such as Thirty Flights of Loving. As opposed to other games where the community would like to see PvP/Co-op multiplayer, updated art assets, expanded story or even a sequel just for the purpose of milking their favourite game dry even when it's not the best decision, that is definitely not the case with Flotilla. This game gets the green light on PvP multiplayer, especially online, the mechanics are screaming out for this addition to the game it would work incredibly well, online co-op fits in just as well (note: Local co-op is already available). Another well-fitting feature would be modding, Flotilla is built from a small pool of "what is fun", to pull this off the developer reduced the graphics to very simple geometric shapes and made the game all about travelling to the location, then fighting in the location. As for the fighting itself, you move, you roll, you fire, you turn your shields in the direction of oncoming fire, you direct your fire towards the non-shielded areas of the opponent. A modding community could work with the whole game, even if it was just pure XML (similar to Dungeons of Dredmor) after only experiencing 5 hours of the game you could extend it straight away.\n\nUn-pruned areas: The developer has been very honest about the state of his code on Flotilla, undoubtedly being his first commercial game it's likely that large swathes of the code didn't lend itself to decent re-use and as a result it would seem that a few screw ups here and there that detract from the overall enjoyment of the game can't be as easily fixed as you would think. Certainly not as easy as if he wrote the game today with his current experience. An example is controller support, this game has it but in a very old-fashioned way, you can't use the gamepad in single player, but a second player can use a gamepad in addition to the first player using keyboard and mouse in local co-op. The Beam Frigate's AI can get stuck quite a lot and just not move, making them sitting ducks, it typically happens when there's too much going on in the frigate's vicinity. You start with two of what is arguably the best ship in the game, it's so fast it can take on almost anyone, my opinion may change after a few more games in hardcore mode but for now I would say that other starting configurations and balancing things more favourably for the opponent would have been a great improvement also.\n\nSUMMARY\nThis is space opera the game basically. A twenty minute let's play video would not contain any spoilers as far as I can tell so go and watch one if you're interested in purchasing the game because so much of this game's charm is in what is indescribable, it's definitely a game most would describe as "crafted".\n\nUsing the Horseblair rating system I would give it 8 Tiger Hats out of 10. Or a thumbs up on the Steam rating system.","November 2, 2014","true","41.2"," 38 of 39 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","38","39","0","0"

Inoffensive and accessible, Flotilla lends itself well to both pick-up-and-play gaming, or more extended sessions with the hardcore mode.  The gameplay is quick to learn, and surprisingly deep once you get a decent lineup of ships.  You can get some pretty impressive all-out battles underway, especially if you use the custom skirmish mode.  The main story is extremely basic, but as you move through the universe you'll meet crazy characters, creatures, make friends, and make enemies.  Every play will be different.\n\nFlotilla has a unique and striking presentation that works quite well, and gives the game a special flair you won't find anywhere else.","December 14, 2013","true","1.5"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

It's easy to learn, the tutorial takes like 45 seconds and you feel lke a Flotilla master! At first glance, I was confused. I asked myself what is it's purpose? Whats the story? How do I quickscope? And all these questions were answered well along the way within the first few minutes. The purpose is to not die, build the most greatest Flotilla in the galaxy along the greatest, wacky, fun-for-the-whole-family, space adventure! The story is built along the way, each planet you travel to has a new encounter which ranges from going to a party with your harty crew and becoming THE FREAKING KAREOKE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE, or to meeting the all Might Godess Afrodita riding a god damn unicorn, ripping your eye out and giving you a bad ♥♥♥ gauntlet! The possibilities are truly endless and no adventure s the same. It's addicting, and encourages you to throw your life away and become the FLOTILLA MASTER RACE! All in all please buy this game, buy it again and again until you have no money, no job, no love life, no house, no life, just...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/recommended/55000/","nww02","<Insert Name Here>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/","400 products in account","Okay, let's get one thing straight. This is NOT homeworld. I know it looks like a simplistic indie version of it, but it ain't.  This is one of those "Choose-your-own-adventure" books from the 80s. but with a massively-simplified 3d game built in.\n\nYou start off at the beginning with a fixed amount of 'moves' (14), which equate to picking 14 planets out of 20 or so, and have to make the best choices in each situation.    Similar to 'deal-or-no-deal', there's no actual strategy to your next choice of 'planet', you just have to pick planets one after the other until you run out of them.  At each planet, something happens, (the box is opened, if you like).  You have to make a choice, and you either come off better, worse, or unchanged.\n\nI quite enjoyed those "choose your own adventure" books, so this game kinda grows on me.  Each time you play, you get a slightly different set of choices, and therefore outcomes.   I've tried a few different options, and the results are pleasing, and sometimes marginally funny.  Mostly. however, you're left wondering WTF that was all about.  If you do remember those books, you'll remember they were designed to be played during a lunch hour, or  break time. You could rip through an 'adventure' in about 15 to 20 minutes, and once you knew the book, you could scan the text, note where you were and move on, doing each page in a few seconds.  With some of the two-person book sets, where someone was 'chasing' you (Dual-master series, for example), you could very quickly have a chase through the landscape.  That's exactly how this feels.  You play a 'game' for no more than about 20 minutes, maybe 30 if you take your time in the battles.  Each 'game' is wholly self-contained, and when you start the next one, everything is reset, and you play over.   Many of the situations repeat verbatim, so when you're playing you see a picture, pick out a word, like "pirate" or "slaver", and immediately pick the outcome you want, without reading the rest of the text, note the outcome, and move on.\n\nBy and large, the game is completely random: There's no ramp-up or anything. When you arrive at a 'planet', and are told to fight, you may be up against easy, medium, or hard at any stage. So, a lot of the negative reviews talk about how hard the game is because you can meet more powerful enemies right at the start.  Well, yes, that's true, in the same way that if you're playing any game, it's only challenging if there's a bigger monster to fight.   However, flotilla has one pro and con in the same 'feature':  There's one strategy that works really well.  It's pretty obvious when you think about it, but I won't spoil it.    There are lots of other strategies as well, but as with most space games, like Homeworld, there's not a whole heap of stuff you can do in open space warfare.\n\nTo counter this weakness in the genre, Flotilla has an overlaid 2d-ism on the 3d: Ships have 'tops' and 'bottoms', which means that there's an asymmetry in the usual turning battle you get.   The only thing I'll say is that as long as you have two ships, you should have no problem with battles in this game, more and you're sorted, fewer (i.e. 1 ship), and you have a long fight ahead, which is probably only going to end one way, death.\n\nThe game feels like a first project:  Very simplistic art, simplistic models, sound clips taken from other games or stock sources, one or perhaps two music tracks.  However, it's been nicely polished, and you don't get a sense that it's 'raw' or anything.  The bizarre animal images, like deer wearing uniforms, is just absurd, but ultimately ignorable.  In the same way that you ignore the features of the face cards in a card game: It's what the image and its text represent as a positive or negative to your 'game' that matters.\n\nSome of the 'positive' effects allow you to upgrade your ships. Some of the upgrades appear marginally useless, whereas some really affect your life expectancy in the skirmishes.  You get to realise which pretty quickly.\n\nI'd recommend this game if it was on sale for less than (say) £3 or £4.  It suits people who like quick skirmishes of space ships, and have an absurdist sense of humour.  Don't get it if you're expecting a serious story, or subtle combat like Homeworld.\n\n","April 8","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Why I subsequently purchased the game is beyond me, but I'm glad I did, and not just because in the future, status in society will be determined by the number of games we own on Steam.\n\nFlotilla at some point came together for me. Some heady mix of Rastafarian cats, complex simultaenous turn based pirouettes through all of the good dimensions, an aesthetic that knows what it needs to give you what you want, and a tone that encompasses all of this (which can be summed up in the subtitle of the game: Orbital Battleship Maneuvers) leads, circuitously but inevitably, to bliss. This is at once a pocket sized Homeworld and, like BLENDO Games' other work, an experience waiting to happen to you for as long as you wish your attention to be held by it.","February 18, 2012","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There is no saving, you are the captain, and you are stuck with a fatal disease that will take your life in a predetermine amount of turns. Flotilla offers a lot of real time choices that directly affects your fleet of ships. Some scenarios include saving a group of space-llamas and adding them to your fleet, or destroy them for ship upgrades.  The combat is turn based and takes place on a 3D plane; you can command your ship to fly in any direction and fire at enemy ships. With tons of combat choices and flanking decisions your head might explode from strategizing, as a result I can’t recommend this game to strategy noobs. However, if you use to fight alongside Napoleon and George Washington back in the day, I highly recommend this game. Oh ya just play hardcore mode, in normal mode you just end up dead faster from your “disease”.

It's that it is something that would be more suited as an early release prototype for a gamedev project. Not something shipped on Steam. There's a lack of content or novel gameplay that sets it apart from other space battle/strategy games. I was a little disappointed by the steam page implying that the combat was something innovative. It's something that is commonly seen (and rather better implemented) in many other space games. It's literally 3D combat, as in an explicit point of origin and sharp angles  of movement.

It doesn't go into detail as to the how's and why's because that's unimportant.\nWhat is important is that you've set out on one last adventure, and you're gonna have as much fun, and kick as much ♥♥♥, as you can!\n\nThe gameplay is great, "encounters" are laid out across a Star Map, which you click on and are transported to. Once your ship marker arrives you have an Encounter- a picture of the individual or group you've encountered and a text box detailing what's happened, along with your multiple actions/answers.\nSometimes you will have to fight! This is done in a Mode which puts you in command of your ship(s), in a turn based, Three dimensional battlefield. You can move in all 3 dimensions and some strategy regarding your positioning is necessary, as shots often move slow enough that several turns pass before it reaches the enemy.\n\nThe characters you meet along the way are imaginative, charming, and hilarious.\nThere's always some new thing that makes you chuckle, or curse, happening to you, and you have multiple choices as to how you'd like to deal with it.\n\nThere's a cool Upgrades system, and you gain XP through battles that allows you to explode an enemy vessel for free (which sounds cheap, but ♥♥♥♥ me, it is VERY necessary when you've got 2 battleships up against your tiny ship).\n\nI really like the fact that it's got a two player mode, too.

Flying my flotilla, or fleet, of starships from system to system, collecting items and encountering bizzare creatures and characters is loads of fun! Combat is tricky enough to keep things interesting but easy enough to learn the tactics needed to win. Large flotillas become difficult to manage and sometimes combat grows tiresome when you're determining the angle of approach for every individual ship. Usuing 'manual mode' is a must!\n\nGames don't last very long so you're often left wanting more. No save function is sometimes frustrating but it adds an element of finality to each battle.\n\nFlotilla is a great game but you see all the events after a dozen playthroughs or so.

You will not beat Flotilla your first playthrough, you probably won't even "beat" it after 30 attempts.

It's never going to get uninstalled.\n\nThe premise of the game is you, the player, are a Spaceship Captain who's just found out he's got a few months left to live. It doesn't go into detail as to the how's and why's because that's unimportant.\nWhat is important is that you've set out on one last adventure, and you're gonna have as much fun, and kick as much ♥♥♥, as you can!\n\nThe gameplay is great, "encounters" are laid out across a Star Map, which you click on and are transported to. Once your ship marker arrives you have an Encounter- a picture of the individual or group you've encountered and a text box detailing what's happened, along with your multiple actions/answers.\nSometimes you will have to fight! This is done in a Mode which puts you in command of your ship(s), in a turn based, Three dimensional battlefield. You can move in all 3 dimensions and some strategy regarding your positioning is necessary, as shots often move slow enough that several turns pass before it reaches the enemy.\n\nThe characters you meet along the way are imaginative, charming, and hilarious.\nThere's always some new thing that makes you chuckle, or curse, happening to you, and you have multiple choices as to how you'd like to deal with it.\n\nThere's a cool Upgrades system, and you gain XP through battles that allows you to explode an enemy vessel for free (which sounds cheap, but ♥♥♥♥ me, it is VERY necessary when you've got 2 battleships up against your tiny ship).\n\nI really like the fact that it's got a two player mode, too. It just adds another factor to this incredible game for me to love.\n\nPlay this ♥♥♥♥ing game, I dare you.

Also, a deer will likely call you a pleeb and engage in slow-dance combat. Basically this game kind of rules, for at least a few hours.\n\nNot sure I'd say $10 worth it.

That alone is exclusive enough to matter. For those who don't want to fully commit to something that's an outright flight sim, or the more meatier and demanding Homeworld games, you can play Flotilla.\n\nThe display options are limited though, and the color can be grating. Also, the tactical options are rather limited, making stalemates more tedious than they need to be.\n\n...And I really wish there was some kind of fast forward option for exactly those tedious moments when you know how the turn will play out.\n\n\nStill, one of my favorite titles in my Steam library. I wish there was some kind of follow-up.","September 28, 2011","true","35.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Flying my flotilla, or fleet, of starships from system to system, collecting items and encountering bizzare creatures and characters is loads of fun! Combat is tricky enough to keep things interesting but easy enough to learn the tactics needed to win. Large flotillas become difficult to manage and sometimes combat grows tiresome when you're determining the angle of approach for every individual ship. Usuing 'manual mode' is a must!\n\nGames don't last very long so you're often left wanting more. No save function is sometimes frustrating but it adds an element of finality to each battle.\n\nFlotilla is a great game but you see all the events after a dozen playthroughs or so. Nevertheless, I  totally recomend this game.\n\n7/10","November 25, 2010","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not a fancy game by any stretch, seeming almost a little bit incompleted. My understanding after many hours of play is that there is in fact no way to win. It seems to me that it was on the leading edge of the rogue like trend. Unfortunately that makes it feel a little dated. However, the game mechanics are the best space combat strategy I have ever seen (reminds me of the book Ender's Game a little). So I recommend Flotilla for anyone. Just don't spend much on it, or expect an expansive game.","May 18","true","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
