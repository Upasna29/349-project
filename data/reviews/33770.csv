It keeps the original Drakensang's awesome stat and combat system, but improves on nearly everything else: much better writing, dialog, and production values (including class specific quests ala "Dragon Age: Origins"), much fewer trash mobs (fighting is less frequent in this game compared to the first, but much more difficult and better thought out when it happens), and (perhaps best of all) a new fast travel system that prevents your having to run everywhere like in the first game.\n\nPlus, it's technically a prequel, so if you only play one Drakensang (and you should if you enjoy RPGs at all) it should be this one.","April 12, 2012","true","59.9"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","51","52","2","0"

Imagine the gameplay of Neverwinter Nights but with vastly superior graphics and gameplay. Loads of class choices, loads of abilities to improve, you can spend your adventure points (xp) on these as you get them not just when you level up. You have to find trainers to get new skills and spend your adventure points to learn these too. Skills are based on combinations of related stats, and it can seem a bit confusing at first, but common sense can see you through it. There can be a lot of running about and movement can feel a little slow but there are fast travel points on the maps, most of which are not huge anyway. Based on the pen and paper rules of The Dark Eye system (and not button-mashing action rpg hack and slashers) these games are well worth checking out if you're a fan of proper role players made the way they should be.","January 10, 2014","true","2.6"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","48","51","0","0"

It makes you want to play the game for the game. I really like the controls for movement, you can point and click or take full control, very similar to World of Warcraft. In battles you can pause (turnbase style) or just go full action. I am also a fan of The Dark Eye ruleset, if you hover over or right click on anything it gives an explaination, so it is easy to learn.

Bought it on sale for cheap because I was jonesing for an rpg, and thought this was worth a few bucks to waste a few hours. But it really turned out to be an excellent party based rpg along the lines of DA:O, NWN, etc. It is on the lighter side, not nearly as gritty or 'mature' as DA:O, but a good old fantasy rpg with swashbuckling heros and mustache twisting villains. Graphics are descent / good (considering it is several years old), but a bit cartoonish. The story is kinda meh, just a reason to do one quest after another, but good enough. There is a descent crafting system, and deep character leveling system. However, there are no real in-game context clues for some of the attributes (what they do, how they interact with other attributes, etc), and as this is a german import, it is easy to forget that we all get used to what is basically the same D&D based ruleset for RPGS. Unfortunately, the game has no manual. I spent a little time googling player guides or wikis to figure out a few unknowns and the game became much more intutive. On the negative side, the voice acting is for the most part (in English at least) MUHFUHORRIFIC. Didn't stop me from enjoying the game, but made it a bit campy. Also, the pausible real time combat turns are slower than you are used to, which makes certain actions (like spell casting) a bit problematic until you get the feel of it. Not necessarily a negative, it can even be a positive,  you just have to learn the proper tactics. All in all a game worth playing if you are a party based rpg fan.","June 22, 2014","true","73.8"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

Not tons of reviews or attention but it should have got some! In an age of MMORPG games, this game stayed hidden. Single player only, but the maps and story are awesome. I can't stop playing this one. Some of the best locations, graphics and city detail I have seen in this genre.\n\nThe combat style is different than you would expect for a game such as this. If there was a more active combat system for this game it would have been legendary. Overall, I will keep adding some hours to this game and look to finish it. It appears the main storyline can be completed in about 20 hours.\n\nI'd pay the $20.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPGEndBoss/recommended/33770/","RPGEndBoss","RPGEndBoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPGEndBoss/","204 products in account","2009's European import CRPG "Drakensang" was the kind of game I like to call a "slow burn" title. By that, I mean it started out moderately fun and as time went by I found it to be more and more compelling and addictive the longer I continued to play it. While it didn't have the non-linearity of Dragon Age or the visual fidelity of Germany's own Risen, Drakensang did have something very few RPGs seem to want to include nowadays: Complex rules and challenging tactical combat. It was these inclusions to the rapidly aging CRPG formula that kept me glued to my monitor long enough to go through the game three times and eventually led me to track down its sequel, the much improved and brilliantly written "River of Time".\n\nThough River of Time is actually a prequel it's hard to believe it when you look at how much of the game has been changed for the better. With the English translation cleaned up (No more confusing 1W numbers instead of 1D), the game's combat being better balanced in the early levels, the experience points doled out in larger chunks and the story paced much slower than the previous game it's hard to really find fault with what Radon Labs has done here. The original Drakensang was one of the best CRPGs I had played in the past five years and besides a few tweaks and more variety in the locations/quests/monsters you encountered I didn't see much wrong with it. The characters were memorable, the combat was fantastic and the rules were the perfect antidote to the watered down 3rd edition D&D I had grown sick and tired of.\n\nYet Radon Labs managed to somehow shave some extra fat off of this already slender game and dress it up even prettier than it already was.\n\nFor those who enjoyed the original Drakensang there is really no reason why you would dislike the sequel. Much of its shortcomings (Such as fighting stereotypical low-level beasts like rats and wolves nonstop in the early levels) have been dealt with and what you're left with in this prequel is a much cleaner, more refined CRPG. The only drawback that I noticed was that the game seems to put a much tighter rein on leveling since even after my 2nd trip whereupon I used an FAQ to maximize my experience gains I was still unable to get past level 12. This was slightly disappointing when you consider that the first game let you leap all the way to level 17 before the last boss fight was even unlocked.\n\nI also noticed that the economy seemed a bit out of whack since even though my characters were swimming in gold ducats I still had to spend hours selectively buying and selling things just to get the equipment that I needed to survive. This constant obsessing over money and equipment caught up to me in the end after I completed a quest that opened up a 999 ducat helmet that I couldn't afford no matter what I sold or traded. It irked me that I couldn't buy it and left me bitter as I went on to the game's final area 728 ducats short of being able to afford it.\n\nOverall however, River of Time is considerably better than its predecessor and the only faults you'll find with it are, as I've said, small gripes that can be easily ignored.\n\nTo make up for these small missteps River of Time manages to give you a little bit of non-linearity in your adventure, something the first game completely lacked. Though this non-linearity is basically just a couple optional boss fights and a hunting reserve with a few quests tucked away within it, it's still nice to see that Radon Labs was listening to the fans when they cried out for some optional "challenge" areas.\n\nAs a matter of fact one of those challenging optional areas is so hard that it contains the best CRPG boss fight I've seen since the battle with Kangax in Baldur's Gate 2. Not to spoil the surprise, but if you find yourself in an underwater temple and you've just solved a floor tile puzzle to open a door you had better make sure you've bought or found end game equipment because you're going to need it. The amount of micro-managing and aggro-distribution I had to do in the boss fight below that temple nearly drove me insane","November 25, 2011","true","0.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

They seem to have figured out what went wrong with their first foray in to RPG territory, and fixed it right up. The combat has been improved, although its still basic PnP rules, the story is actually interesting, and stays consistent, unlike the first one, and its just much better constructed.\n\nIf you like RPGs, and want one very similar to the oldschool PnP style games, ( NWN/NWN2, KotOR/2 ), then you'd be foolish to not pick up River of Time at its asking price, its everything I was hoping Dragon Age 2 would be, except much cheaper.","June 7, 2011","true","25.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","10","10","2","0"

Also i never knew when and where to go which resulted in going against too hard enemies and reloading to previous save-file and try to beat him several times and returning after a while.Decision\nGame is worth playing in fact if you have it in your library and haven't played it you should at least try it if you liked games like Dragon Age it may feel a bit similar in certain times, even with it's little flaws it's a true hidden gem and must play if you own it.\n\n8 out of 10","January 12","true","53.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

The depth of the lore alone is quite amazing, but I also really respect the attention to detail in making the subject matter truly their own in such a bloated market (ie fantasy fiction).\n\nDrakensang: Rivers of Time is the 2010 prequel to the original Drakensang (2008). For anyone familiar with that particular title - Ardo, Cano and Forgrimm play a central role in RoT as well. You play a nameless adventurer who earns in the anals of history alongside these three heroes.\n\nWhat appeals to me most about this game is that, despite being a relatively modern game, it lacks the constant hand-holding of so many other current gen RPGs - which, to me, only ever translates to a plus!

Though I like the pause and ensuing tactical planning elements, it does not always work.  For example, I could be hit by ranged weapons and despite having high level ranged combat, I could not fire back despite pause, select targeting, etc.  I could set the attack up and... waited...  and... waited...  Nothing happened, all the while I was getting hit until my party was decimated by three low level dwarfs with crossbows.  No matter what I did or where I stood I could not fire back, yet they were in clear line of sight and within range.  Whether or not I was being a numpty, I don't know - it just seemed to spoil what is a good game from being a great game.\n\nThis could be so much better if not for the occasional cumbersome combat system.  Still, it really is a gem and has all the elements of what an RPG should be - character interaction, crafting, freedom in character builds, weapons, armour, etc.\n\nAlso, another gripe (for me at least) is that I would have liked to have seen a greater variety of spells for magic users.  I guess we can't have it all.\n\nPost Sciptum:  I have now completed this and the expansion, Phileason's Secret, and despite the earlier niggles, once I got used to the combat system idiosynchrasies, this really is an absolute gem.

The game do its best to put you into the story not just play the game. It makes you care about your character and your party members. DROT is prequel of the first Drakensang RPG, so, if you want to get to know the girl in the opening cut scene you might need to purchase the first Drakensang game.\n\nPros\n+ Difficulty setting plus lots of character classes. Replay value.\n+ Story isn't boring. It doesn't reveal who are you gonna face until your almost at the end.\n+ Simple Combat. Enable you to strategies not just spam skills.\n+ Old games looks good one new PCs\n\nCons\n- Not that openworld compare to current European or Western RPG (I am from South East Asia) out today.","July 23, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a fair amount of content, charming visuals and a large number of ways to customize your party members. It has crafting, a bunch of side quest, a reasonable amount of areas to explore, speech checks, a bunch of companions, a ton of items and etc etc. Overall it delivers what your would expect from a party based roleplaying game such as this. I had a fair bit of fun with it even though i would not say that the game is amazing in any single area it still comes together into a rpg which i would recommend fans of the genre to check it out.\n\nThere are some thing though that i believe could have been done better. I was not familar with the dark eye ruleset before i started playing the game and i often found myself having to resort to google to understand what was going on. There are some tooltips that for the most part manages to teach the basic stuff but the game could have done a much better job in introducing the ruleset to players new to it.\n\nI am also not in love with the ruleset in general or the skills available in the game. I would have prefered there to be a larger amount of skills/spells, especially for melee characters. This would also have served to force the player to be a bit more active in combat. Personally i found the combat to be a bit too slow for my taste and i would have prefered it to be a bit faster and there to be a few more options available.\n\nAnother thing that i believe could be improved is the games story. The side quest are for the most part alright and delivers what you would expet them to do. The world is also interesting and portrayed in a nice way. But the main story takes a very long while to get going and even then it does not really go anywhere. It jumps around a lot and no plotline or character get enough time to actually develop into something that you care about. It really feels like wasted potential and it made the last ten or so hours of the game considerable less enjoyable than they could have been.\n\nThe game is also very dice-rolley. Some may love this but it slows down the game quie a bit when you have to successfully bandage up all you teammaters after a fight and etc etc. I would also prefer to be able to fast travel everywhere instead of only being able to do that at certain spots.\n\nI do not wish to sound too negative about the game but since i did for the most part enjoy it. But it did not live up to the very high expectation that i had of the game after playing it for a couple of hours. The game took me around 30 hour to complete and i had a fair amount of side quest remaining.","September 4, 2015","true","35.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like Drakensang, this is a party-based RPG with tactical elements. Meaning you'll want to give orders to each character to make it through battles. The graphics are very nice (I believe better than Drakensang, but that could have been my imagination). The story was good, the music was good as well. A nice atmosphere for exploring.  Like the game before it, the game suffers from poor optimization, due to the game engine. It doesn't use much of your GPU or CPU processing power, and framerates can drop down into the 30s and 40s. This seems to be a problem with several of these related games by this developer.

If you didn't play the first one or any other TDE rpg games this is then a good game.\nYou might grab the first one as well, as this one actually makes a reference to that game. You will see that in the beginning, so for new players it might be a bit weird. Cause the story is actually told by one of the characters.\n\nThe River of Time corrects errors from the first game. While that one was alot melee based, TRoT is more playable as a mage or a stealthy char. Especially magic is improved and does enough damage now. An other thing is that visited locations now stay open. In the first game after you have completed all the quests in a region you got the message that the region is locked now. For example; once you got your recommendations avestrue became locked and quest was completed. Not in The River of Time. You wanted to go back to turnstone tollgate? No problem.\nJust like in the first one the combat is in turns, bit of dicerolling. Fans of DnD will recognize it, not very surprising as the dark eye (das schwarze auge in german) is the german answer to DnD.  And you will have alot of stats to go through.\nIt's not a game for the casual gamer, mind you. However, Radon Labs did make it more casual though.\nOne of the downsides is the stupid fast travel. Really, fast travel in a partybased rpg, what the heck does it there. It's a real  turnoff in this game and totally not necessary. But the biggest disappointment is that The River of Time is actually not a partybased game at all. It falls flat when it comes to creating a party. In the first game you began in a little village and ran already into one companion and as the game got further you got more. But that's not the case in TRoT. Your starting point will only give a temporary one and a rather lousy too. Then you are presented to 2 companions, but one of them dies. Yep, they give you the nice choice to choose which one you wanted. And with that one you will form a party with most of the game. There are 3 others available as well, but they only join much further in the story and also one of them doesn't join that long. Technically there are 5 companions, but you form actually just with one a party. While in the first game you really have a party with 3 others and one summon.\nThe River of Time is a nice game though. Nice locations, your own ship (sort off), can revisit locations, some interesting characters, dicerolling combat, to name a few. But in terms of partybased gameplay it fails. It feels more like Jade Empire, while it is presented as a partybased rpg. If you look for something similar like Baldur's gate, Icewind dale, planescape: torment, then skip this one and go for drakensang: the dark eye instead (the first game). That one is much more partybased. If you just look for a decent rpg with a good story, then give it a go.\nAs i have finished the first drakensang and in mind to what is promised i can't really recommend it. Would vote an average score.","January 28, 2015","false","64.4"," 7 of 24 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","7","24","0","0"

You are then given a choice on how you'd like to storm said keep, killing all the guardsmen and anyone else unlucky enough to cross your path in order to persue this hunch.\n\nIf you can stomach the poor story telling and forget about the whole role-playing thing, this is a half decent RPG.  Graphics are good enough, character progression has a ton of depth, though some of the branches lead into worthless abilities, so choose wisely.  It also is quite challenging so if that is a draw for you there is a challenge here.\n\nI wanted to love this game and may give it another go someday, but that day will be a desperate one and I'll likely grow frustrated with it fairly quickly once more.","January 25, 2014","false","6.1"," 11 of 34 people (32%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","32","11","34","0","0"

It plays in the world of German pen and paper-RPG "The Dark Eye" back in the cozy days when the writers weren't all Earthdawn ft. Voldemort. It captures the saturday night gaming sessions of my youth rather well.\nSince game's now on steam I got it again - that's why I don't have that many hours clocked yet.\n\nMood-\nGame is leisurely paced and feels mostly light-hearted compared to the dark and mature settings of the witcher or dragon age though there is also betrayal and murder. More an escapist fantasy into a heroic age so to speak. "The grass was greener, the light was brighter.."\nMorals reflect this as the party plays "lawful-chaotic good" in most cases. No Geralt-choosing-the-lesser-evil-moments this time around.\n\nGameplay-\nCombat is real-time with pause not unlike dragon age but with the camera closer to the characters. Camera control is complicated - best use wasd for steering the character and the mouse with right button pressed for camera control. Battles are won by selecting the right actions and positioning your troups rather than overpowered inventory. Beside the magical gear items mostly reflect medieval equipment from the TDE rulebook.\nYour chars earn adventure points to spend on esoteric skills like "seducing", "herbalism", "treat wounds" and so on.\nThe game will check those in dialogues same as race or profession (=archetype).\nThere is also item crafting -blacksmithing, bowyer, alchemy.\nYou can only create the first character from scratch from 22 archetypes like pirate, soldier or battlemage.\n\nStory-\nIt's technically a prequel. The old adventurer guys you met last time around are still young and you find out why they became big buddies.\n\nCompared to Drakensang 1-\nCompared to the last time things improved. More waypoints, still some but less backtracking. No cheesy world saving this time. Less linear. Seriously part one can be skipped.\nRiver of time has a mostly fixed party to play due to story reasons.\n\nCompared to German Retail Version-\nLacks the detailed 76p.-manual for the complicated ruleset and I think that's really lazy, DTP. So-so translation and voice-over quality.\n\nTL;DR\nClassical somewhat cliched but tasty and solid roleplaying experience. Pretty lighting and love of detail like the thoughtfully created medieval town add to immersion.","February 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is lots of exploring to do and it has a detailed crafting system which I find simpler and more fun than the one in Skyrim. The usual skills are there to improve, eg the "plant lore" skill will let your character pick better plants so as to make better potions using the "alchemy" skill, etc.  (On screen everything looks like a better version of the old The Guild games - medieval, organised and northern european.)\n\nBest of all, you can have a squad of up to four unique characters whom you equip and manage separately. Combat looks good and is made easy to manage by the game pausing automatically before the fights start so you can equip and prepare your squad and assign each of them to different targets, pausing as the fight progresses to adjust things. This makes for easy to manage battles.\n\nThe graphics aren't cutting-edge, but the village environments are sunny and pleasant with lots of lively npcs around and the dungeons are creepy and atmospheric. The game has no obvious bugs or annoyances. In short, it is a very good, fun, game. Why isn't it better known?","February 6, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A prequel  to the original. More of the same, though, so if you just played the other one you probably won't want to play this right away.","January 8, 2013","true","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I should have remembered that I never finished Drakensang so I probably didn't need to buy this.  Instead, I could have just gone back to the original.  Again, this is my problem.
