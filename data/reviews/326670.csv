As is common these days with mobile ports the game is more expensive on Steam than it is on mobile devices. Warhammer Quest is $5 on mobile but $15 on steam, that is a crazy price jump for the same game. Not only this but they have carried the in game purchases over from the mobile version, which I personally think they should have included all content in the full price considering your charging an extra $10 just for the ability to play it on steam. But you can buy the game with all the optional content in the deluxe edition for $30 but seriously I don't need to be the one to tell you that this game is not worth $30 do I?\n\nOh and did I mention you can buy gold in the game for ridiculous prices, oh yes that's in there. Now I have yet to encounter a point where I could not progress in the game without purchasing gold however, the gold that drops organically seems low, not to mention the various reviews of the mobile version that claimed that purchasing gold at some point was required.\n\nThe pricing annoys me further when no real effort has been put in to optimize for the PC market. You control everything with the mouse which renders the keyboard useless which becomes particularly annoying when you want to scroll the map with WASD but can't and have to click and drag everywhere. The developers haven't even bothered with placing in higher resolution textures for any part of the game nor even upgraded the movie resolutions which makes the small CGI movies when entering a town look worse than awful.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple, take your group of adventurers through the dungeons of the Warhammer World in the search for wealth and glory. The standard edition of the game comes with four playable characters of a roster of eleven. The other characters are available to purchase, because of course they are.\n\nThis all being said the actual game mechanics are faithfully representative of the source material. Each dungeon you visit works from a grid system, by selecting your characters one by one you can see the available movement options. You will only be able to see the rooms you are either in or have been in, everything else will be shrouded in darkness until you step foot in it. This fog of war play means that you'll never know what enemies are waiting in the next room, it could be rats or it could be a giant blood hungry beast. While moving in the hallways room to room, you'll occasionally get attack by enemies that will spawn around you, which is fun towards the start but when your running low on health and out of potions, it becomes both frustrating and worrying.\n\nCombat revolves around basic attacks, inventory items, spells and abilities. Attacking a target requires a simple click as does using items and spells once you've selected them from the bottom HUD menus. Everything has a hit chance or some kind of roll involved and example would be a healing spell for which a roll occurs to determine how much or how little the spell heals. One of the most famous combat mechanics from the original board game was 'deathblow' in which should a character kill an enemy with one hit then they could continue to carry that attack to any other enemies in range. In game this mechanic means that should your marauder be surrounded by enemies you essentially have a chance to kill them all from one attack, potentially. This mechanic has saved me many times from tight spaces.\n\nWhile the combat mechanics in essence are fairly solid. The hit chance can cause you to have a run of bad luck and inconvenient times. It can make combat feel unfair, punishing and outright brutal when you need the hits to swing your way in an important fight. Once a character dies in battle you can use that character again once you complete the dungeon which on one hand is ok but in my opinion a permadeath state for characters would have been much for fun and meaningful. Mages and units that require things like mana or willpower for abilities will regenerate an amount at the start of each turn.\n\nWhen your not in a dungeon, there's the world map and town screens. World map travel consists of travelling from town to town eventually visiting all three regions. To travel to a unvisited town you must first complete the dungeon on the way, after doing this you can move from that town to a previous town freely.\n\nOnce in a town you have a few options available to you. First if any of your warriors have gained enough experience to level up then you can go to the training ground to level them up which requires gold to do so, clearly a mechanic for draining your gold to get you to buy some more. Each town also has a market where you can buy equipment and potions as well as sell your unwanted items. Usually markets will have a few unique items that are specific to that town or relate to that towns quest in name only.  The adventurers guild is where you can see all the characters that are available to use included ones that are DLC. In the towns temple you can pay gold to have one of your warriors pray for a chance to receive a unique buff that can be activated only once during the next dungeon.\n\nRandom events involving your warriors will also take place in towns that can end up having buffs and debuffs for the next dungeon. My witch hunter decided to get very drunk and ended up having a debuff for the entirety of the next dungeon. Finally Towns each have their own unique quests that have a short story attached to it. These quests are optional and incur some difficult dungeons but there's also the chance for some great loot too. These quests are presented in text form and are relatively well written with some interesting characters and humour stuffed in.\n\nAn big element that I feel is missing from the game is multiplayer. Having multiplayer in the game would have done wonders for re-playability. Its the perfect genre for multiplayer, I mean come on the source material is a board game for goodness sake. Multiplayer should have been a given for Warhammer Quest and yet sadly we have none.\n\nThe game overall is pretty solid yet I personally cannot recommend it. There is no reason why you would buy a mobile game from 2013 at an inflated price just to have it on steam. The fact that the game is riddled with micro-transactions plus no real effort has been made in both controls and aesthetics for the transition to PC leaves me thinking that it was an easy cash grab. Even if your a big Warhammer fan or a fan of turn based games and your dead set on playing this, there is no reason not to play it on your mobile device especially considering the price difference.","January 7, 2015","false","5.0"," 1,099 of 1,219 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","099","1","6","29"

Developers say they are "completely optional." This is halfway a lie.\n\nThe truth is that around level 4-5 you get to a point where you must buy additional gold for this game or else you will be stuck in a grind where you are raiding dungeons WITHOUT gaining experience. "How is this possible?" you say. Well, you must pay gold to level your heroes. If you don't pay to level them up, any XP they gain is *lost* until you do(!).\n\nIn my game, I did not buy a single item, but saved all gold so that I would not have to be stuck in the rut. But I was still stuck by a long shot (looking at 15-20 dungions to grind through without gaining XP if I don't break out the credit card and pay to play).\n\n***FAQ***\n-Q: Is what you say also true of the deluxe edition?\n-A: Yes. Even at 25€ the game is still rigged to get you to use the credit card if you don't want to waste all XP on ~30% of the levels you play (after reaching level 4-5).\n\n-Q: Why do I need to pay to level up? Don't heroes in fantasy games level up once you have *earned* the experience?\n-A: Yes, it is deliberately desinged this way as a way to get the player to fork over more money.\n\n-Q: Is it true that even the deluxe edition, has no PC-support?\n-A: Yes, it's a blind mobile port.

Avoid at all cost.\n\nIt feels like it could be a decent game (with horrible controls, broken game texts and serious balance issues, but still playable), but only for the first hour or so. After that you'll suddenly discover that you can not buy any useful weapons for your characters at the store at all. It's much worse than in any grinding MMO I've ever seen - one single good sword or shield will require HOURS of grinding. Guess why? Because they expect you to buy in-game currency with real money.\n\nMicro-transactions are not optional here. Developer is lying. You can not "play" without them, because it's not a "game" anymore - it's a tedious tortue, where your main enemies are horrible controls and boring unskippable movement animations. Without good gear you are doomed to re-grind (I can't use term "re-play") the same dungeons over and over and over again, untill you'll farm enough... And then a random city event happens, and you see something like "thief stole your money". And you can't afford your weapon AGAIN.\n\nThis is not a game. This is a failure that SHOULD lead to bankruptcy of developer, if there is any justice in this world.","January 8, 2015","false","5.5"," 68 of 95 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","68","95","4","2"

Unfortunately I'm sorry to say I don't have much that is positive to say about this version.\n\nOn the gameplay side:\n\nShort version: it does not do the original game justice, it's not quite the same, as other reviews say "a simplification", and some mechanics have been rename which is a bit alienating to existing Warhammer Quest fans.\n\n-The combat mechanics are OK (they have the deathblow mechanics in there), but for some reason your characters don't have an initiative order. Since it's a PC version of the board game it would also be nice to be able to see the dice (maybe even throw them by moving the mouse)!\n\n-The treasure, spells and equipment are not implemented in the same way as the board game, they are simplified a bit. Equipment is weird, you can only equip a certain number of items of a particular rarity that will be available during combat on each. I'm guessing they saw this as a balance thing... so they can kill you off more easily, or something.\n\n-Also where is character generation? You pick your party of four, from the four basic characters and any DLC characters you have bought, with random names you can rename (Feels a bit more like recruiting). I don't know if some of the DLC charactor are more intesting to "recruit" but things are missing like the Wizard getting to choose some random spells, at the moment you always get the same starting spells.\n\n-Levelling is also a bit different, feels slower to get gold than the original game, like they want you to use real money to buy their DLC gold...\n\n-Hot-seat or multi-play is missing complelty! At the moment I don't think the game is interesting enough to play with multiple people (without the lite character generation that the board game had it would be hard for a group of people to have much attachment to their characters).\n\n\nComments on the user interface/engine:\n\nShort version: a lazy PC port.\n\n-No-vertical sync!!!  The game is running at over 1000FPS on my computer.... I really don't need to burn out my GPU playing a board game on my PC.\n\n-The interface is odd. So the game was first released for a touch screen interface, it seems like they have made zero effort to make it suitable for a PC. It took me ages to work out how to open my inventory. It's an RPG, whycan't I press 'I' for inventory.\n\n-The artwork is very mixed. Some parts are nice, the world map, and backgrounds, and there are a few nice animations, but there are lots of things that feel like they should be animated on the UI that are not. The 3D models in the dungeons are adequate (who managed to paint all their miniatures for the original board game anyway?).  I found the board sections are a bit poor (resolution wise) especially given some of the other bits of art in the GUI, and town.\n\n-The biggest disappointment for me in the artwork was the lack of art from the original game, I would have liked to see the classic treasure cards, and spell cards, and some of the classic boards sections.\n\n\nSummary:\nNot a re-make of the original board game (it's simplified), there is also an aspect that it feels a bit like they want to milk you for money on DLC or gold. It's a mobile phone game ported to a PC. If you have not played the original Warhammer Quest you might want this game on your phone.","January 9, 2015","false","2.0"," 55 of 74 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","55","74","3","3"

The levels are short (a few rooms each), which is a good thing for this style of game. Aaaaaannnnd it runs flawlessly on my Mint Linux 17.1. The IAP is a tad bit pricey (e.g. 2.69 Euros for each additional character, and they don't seem to have any specific benefits over the default party of 4). Most turn-based fantasy-genre tactics fans are likely to enjoy this. But not necessarily for long...\n\nAfter over 14 hours into it, i've changed my mind about this game - i give up. The tremendous grinding aspect, combined with the spawn-wandering-monsters-every-2-to-3-rounds mechanic is killing it for me (especially when they spawn 2 rooms back and i've got to tediously backtrack to clean them up). To level up a PC to level 6 requires (in addition to his XP) 5000 gold. That's over 10 dungeons' worth of savings. During that time other PCs will gain enough XP to level up, but you won't be able to level them without gold to invest in their training. That's another 5k gold per PC for that level, and then even more for the next. And more for the next. The past 2 hours of play i've managed to save up only about 2000 gold. The measly treasure drops are a slap in the face compared to the amount of gold needed to level up.\n\nBefore i gave up, the following is what i had to say about it...\n\nAfter a few hours of play, a couple minor gripes:\n\na) the in-game costs of new equiment and healing is way too high. Saving up enough money to buy a single decent healing potion takes 4 missions. Don't bother with any buff potions: they cost 3-10 missions' worth of gold and are only effective for a single combat round(!!!).\n\nb) first-level wizards are essentially useless, as they only get enough mana (which is randomly rolled each turn) to cast a single spell once every 3 rounds, on average. They take a loooong time to get past level 1, compared to other classes. Once they hit level 3 or so, they can meaningfully contribute to the party. (That "archmage" is next to useless, though, as his powers are determined randomly each turn, so you never know what you'll be able to do with him next turn.)\n\nc) that bad-a&& add-on sword for the Marauder PC ends up wiping out your party because of its high damage and tendency to target PCs instead of enemies. i.e. it's a waste of IAP cash.\n\nd) the random encounter mechanism, which draws in more random monsters about every 3rd turn (often 10+ of them at once), whether you're in combat or not, is fu<<-all annoying.\n\ne) That mighty-looking Ogre IAP? Don't bother. He hits hard, but doesn't hit often and only gets a single attack. The Wizards (who eventually get multiple attacks) make better overall melee combatants than he does.","October 23, 2015","false","15.1"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","28","35","2","0"

Special abiltiies unlock as you level up.\n\nAlso, scrolls and potions add to this diversity.\n\nI went for the dwarf ironbreaker, marauder, wood-elf waywatcher and witch hunter. Witch hunter is ace for demolishing undead so he is a good choice when you do undead dungeons.\n\nGraphics are simple but cool, and overall a decent top-down representation of  a boardgame. Character animations could have been much better, but it's ok.\n\nThe Music is great, very warhammer dark fantasy: orchestra style fantasy from haunted melodies and charging trumpets. It fits very well.\n\nNow a major criticism of this game is gold micro-transactions. However,I don't see ever having to buy gold btw, as i get enough gold from questing and selling drops for my needs. So yeah there is the buying gold mirco-transaction malarky and this is not cool, but so long as it is unecessary to actually buy gold then criticism of this feature remains moot for me. If that situation were to change then I would reassess this.\n\nMy only real critcism is the lack of voice-acting. One of the coolest features of the warhammer universe is the over-the-top regional UK accents: Orcs being cockney hooligans; elves upper class English; dwarves Scottish working class; human warriors usually English northerners etc. So I really would have liked voice actors and thus the lack therein makes it a little less immersive.\n\nI would recommend this as a neat little game that you can dip into for 15-30 min sessions. For me it's reasonable value for money, but that is all relative to what one's budget is and what one considers a reasonable cost vs hours-of-enjoyment ratio. So, If the price seems steep for you then you know that at some point in the next year it will be on sale for 40%, 60% or 80% off, so just pick it up in a sale.\n\nI would like to see some meaty dlcs in the future and  voice acting added if that were feasible.

Completely played on Linux via Steam.\n\nWarhammer Quest is the PC version of the famous Warhammer Quest Tabletop game. You have a party of up to four warriors including a warrior, a dwarf, an elf and a mage. You delve into dungeons of various sort to either kill a special mean boss enemy or grab a precious item from the very depth of the labyrinth. All these “quests” are embedded into cleansing three rural regions of the Warhammer universe realm of Goblins, Orcs and Skaven. On some quests you come along some Vampires and Undead which provide a some more challenging task since Vampire Lords are very powerful and while wielding some magic spells they can also deal a very serious amount of damage in melee. Between the dungeons you travel from village to village where you can sell your loot, buy new equipment and visit the training grounds to achieve new levels and therefore skills for your character. As such Warhammer Quest presents itself as a typical Hack & Slay Dungeon crawler viewed from atop when navigating your party through the dungeons.\n\nIt is fun. It is entertaining.\n\nBut huge epic quests are not found in this game. The dungeon runner part of the game is good looking and plays well. Tactics is seldom an obstacle: leave your mage and the archer (elf) behind and rush in with a berserk and the dwarf. Usually this is solves any problem. On higher levels micromanagement of potions and spell points (healing) of your staff is a bit demanding but this game is not a real hard problem to get around. Graphics and sound are nice done and appropriate.\n\nIn a village the menu dealing with inventory and merchants goods could be solved a bit better. Buying and equip you fighters could have been done less awkward, though the way it is done may be better suitable for Tablets and/or XBox or Playstation. Not a real nuisance, but leaves you easily with an idea that it could be done slightly better than it has been done.\n\nThe real fun stops, when you characters reached the level limit. And that’s quite too early in the game. After this the game gets highly repetitive. You get the best equipment fast, learned all spells and even the toughest opponent does not bear and really real threat to your party. So about 1/3 of the game you simply do the same over and over again.\n\nBut as stated above: it still provides you with fun sweeping through a dungeon.\n\nI never played the original tabletop but I assume that this game strictly obeys to the rules found there and serves as a nice game for up to 4 players each one controlling his own character. This is different to a single PC player game. Here you lack the (unknown) decisions of your co-players but have full control. E.g. swapping one heal potion from one character to the next is not a matter of discussion and arguing among the players but rather a sole act within one, two mouse-clicks. Attacking the mean boss behind with the archer or the nearly dead minion in front of the archer so that the heavy berserk can right walk up to the dangerous mage nearby is not a group act, it’s one single player choice. So this is different environment and targeted audience to entertain. This is fun on a tabletop where social group interaction of the players contribute to the fun. On a single player PC game this is inherently lost.\n\nSo, Warhammer Quest succeeds in bringing the original tabletop game to the PC and creates fun. Could it have been done better? Yes, of course. But only if you bend the core rules of the original and this would then render another game, not entitled to “Warhammer Quest”.\n\nDespite some claims I read elsewhere I never had a crash or some technical difficulties encountered. The game runs smoothly.\n\nFun. With obvious missed potential.\n\nFinal verdict: 6/10","November 1, 2015","true","32.5"," 47 of 69 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","47","69","5","0"

Even if the game has good and bad points, it should be easy to make your decision on this title. Maybe this review will help.\n\n\nRight now it is technically a very good port, with free resolution and detailed characters, an easiness to control everything with the mouse, and does not actually feel like a port of a mobile game. I believe things have been fixed since release and it is now easy to recommend the game\n\n\nYou play a campaign across three regions, but you play it at your own pace.\nYou may head out for randomized side quests or the written quest package.\nYou may modify your team to feature very varied setups of pistol, blade, axe and sorcery.\nThere are random encounters and treasures, and a very interesting gameplay out there.\nGame duration is long.\n\nHowever, note that the best way to experience the game is with the full game pack, as you'll have pleasing options of character classes.\n\n\nNow to the problems within the game:\n\nThe price model itself is a disadvantage to the game on Steam. You should pick the game on discount, so as to have the full deluxe pack at an affordable cost (got mine at 7E on Steam, instead of 40E+ for each separate content).\n\nNext, there is a problem with the direction they took with the game.\n\nDespite the freedom you have in the game and the random encounters, it feels more like a completionist RPG than a roguelike experience. In this, they destroyed half of the Warhammer Quest experience, as there is absolutely no longer any incentive to "restart" a given game and feel a different experience.\n\nThis was a very bad decision, something we see very often these days so as to streamline the gameplay and open it for what they feel is "a broader audience". This was sooo bad and I condemn such moves with such a great licence.\n\nThey brought out many heroes out there and restored the strategic part, and even put it out perfectly. This means that the other half of the Warhammer Quest experience is definitely there and even boosted from the port.\n\nThe other problem now, is that encounters are not as random as in the original boardgame and from a restricted bestiary. This leads again to a streamlined experience, where your game just feels like the game of another player, which is  a stupid thing to begin with, and also feels more repetitive than it should. The game itself is much easier than the original Warhammer Quest, which I consider a bad thing too.\n\n\nOverall, I condemn such game design decisions.\n\nBut I also really applaud the technical delivery of Warhammer Quest, which as a game of its own stands out as a good completionist solo RPG. It is also very interesting to experience various character classes.\n\n\nI recommend the game but advise to get it on discount for the full deluxe pack so as to avoid the price model problems.","December 5, 2015","true","22.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

That said for those not fleeing in terror aready here is a more accurate review:\n\nAt it's core Warhammer Quest is not a bad little game, it captures the spirit of the old board game pretty well, it looks pretty good for the atmosphere it's going for, and runs well without any signifigant bugs. For about $5 to $10 it would come with a strong recommendation for those looking for a simple Strategy-RPG fix.\n\nThe problem is that the game is a money leech portal. Every character you buy will set you back additional real money in addition to the purchuse price. This is less of an issue for those who purchused the deluxe edition (like I did) which included all extra microtransaction content to date, but the game's greed doesn't stop there. This game also sells gold, gold is used in game for everything from training to buying gear for your party. The dungeons give gold out, but in very small amounts. What's more random events vampire your gold. One of the reasons I wrote this review so quickly was that I was sitting there after being irritated by the microtransactions thinking "well maybe this isn't so bad" and then while flipping through town menus I hit a random event telling me my character just got rooked by a con artist, and BAM there went a big pile of gold right down the tube, nothing I could do about it. "lukily" Chilled Mouse has included the option to buy more gold right next to the area where the gold is listed... all I need to do is pay them real money.\n\nNow in theory I suppose with the patience of a saint you could play this game and not have to buy gold from the devs, but from the way it seems the entire gimmick here is  the game being designed in such a way that it is a serious pain in the ♥♥♥♥ without buying gold for money. The game even stealing your gold (seriously, this happened) when you earn it in game with nothing you can do about it.\n\nWhat's more it should be noted your paying $13 to $23 for a game on IOS with a single digit price tag that has simply been ported to PC. This inflated price being you paying for the right to pay them more money to play what is admittedly a pretty goot lite RPG/Strategy title.\n\nTo be frank I wouldn't even begrudge them selling the characters or tile sets like they are as DLC assuming they were honest about it and listed it that way (DLC section in store page) but the gold system needs to go for this to get any recommendation from me.\n\nTo be honest I'll probably play it a bit more to see how it develops and perhaps update this, but right now all I can say is that if you are remotely considering this stay far, far, away.\n\nAlso I wanted to say that STEAM itself needs to be more attentitive to this kind of thing. It's one thing for MMOs with overheard to make money this way, as much as I dislike that (and begrudingly accept it) but with single player games this is ridiculous. One of the reasons why I stick to PC titles and "real" portable games (Vita, DS) is to get away from this garbage and I find it annoying to see these business practices sneaking onto steam.

This kind of practice should be banned. If you pay for a game that should be that, if the game is free then In-App purchases are an option.

There are Microtransactions for gold in the Delux version, and though I haven't had trouble leveling so far, it takes up essentially everything I earn to keep pace with my XP growth. The only things I have been able to buy from markets are the odd cheap healing item. So, unless you buy extra gold, you have to choose between using the market functionality or leveling your characters.\n\nI'm also about to hit level 6 or 7 with all characters, and I clearly won't have the gold to level them all. To the payout pacing seems to drop below the XP in the late-game, even if you don't use the market. I suppose grinding could remedy this moderately easily, but I dislike games that force me to grind - ESPECIALLY when there are microtransactions that alleviate the problem.\n\nIn summary, if not for the microtransactions, there would be better pacing, and if that pacing was better, I would recommend this game. There *are* microtransactions, though, and they affect the pacing, so I can't recommend it.","January 14, 2015","false","62.8"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","20","29","2","0"

Of course some people might still hate this game based on principle, others might not. So please do give this game a try if that was your hesitating factor.\n\nThis is a good game for TBS fans and more so fans of the Warhammer world and lore. In the game you're basically a dungeon crawling party going on adventures from places to place getting loot and levels while having good ol' adventures.The game has three levels of difficulty and perma death on the hardcore mode.\nThis game might be a big turn off for people who hate microtransactions. Warhammer Quest Deluxe is probably the recommended version, in my opinion, to avoid the microtransactions that actually matter. It gives you all the characters and tiles with enemy sets. Also I believe the Deluxe edition would cost less than buying all of those on their own\nThe only other microtransaction is buying gold. Which is completely optional it is quite easy to get more than enough gold if you do some of the randomly generated adventures for treasure and such.\n\nThere is a whole lot of RNG in this game, from leveling to encounters to loot drops and events. It is a bit sad since you don't get to see the dice rolls and the events seem to repeat a lot. If you can get past that, and are a big fan of turn-based games and/or warhammer it'll be a a lot of fun for you. Some of this might be a deal breaker for you or not. If the RNG and the microtransactions don't break it for you give it a try! You might have a good time.\nIf you buy it though I'd say get the Deluxe Edition, also watch some of SplatterCatGames' LP of it, seeing it first hand will give you a better idea.","January 11, 2015","true","41.5"," 50 of 85 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","50","85","0","1"

Nor does the game artificially push you to do so.\nIs there some grinding in the game? A lot in fact just like the original game. It is first and foremost a sandbox game with tons of short and long randomly generated dungeons. The tile system, the random events (punishing or positive) and the combat are all in the tradition of the original game. And this to its credit. Given the many available classes the replayability value is high and the game is ideal for playing bursts in between activities.\n\nThe graphics are somewhat lacking and the game could use a bit more pc enhancements but overall I am HIGHLY satisfied by the game.\n\nSo don't let yourself be fooled by the trolls. Check out some let's plays (several!) of early AND mid-game content. And after that decide for yourself. This is the sort of game you'll love or hate.\n\nEDIT: As of now the purchaseable Gold has been removed by patch. Hence you either buy the game barebone or the delux version.

Let's see how it stacks up with my hopes/expectations.\n\nThe positives:\n\n* It looks and feels a lot like the original (board) game (which I love).\n* It has a good selection of characters, if you buy the deluxe version...\n* The random dungeons/events mean that you get the same "I can't believe we survived" feeling I used to get from the original game.\n\nThe negatives:\n\n* You can only buy one of each item for each visit to a town (in the original you could buy at least D6 bandages, for example). Who stocks a single bandage?\n* Almost all the events seem to be negative, rather than the mix in the original, and non-combat events are few and far between. Travel events are almost non-existent.\n* You don't seem to get so much "objective room" (awesome) treasure at the end of a dungeon.\n* The special settlement locations are missing. As a result, the wizard can't change his spells or charge his staff, the dwarf can't get runes for his axe, and the elf can't buy arrows of sure flight.\n\nIn summary:\n\nIf you liked the original board game, you will probably like the feel of this, but long for some of the old mechanics.\nIf you haven't played the orginal board game, you might find it irritating at times, but it's a decent enough game.","January 11, 2015","true","27.9"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

It's incredibly newbie-friendly - the minimalism of the tutorials not really mattering, provided you've played one or two similar games before, be they in the digital and/or paper and/or board-game realms - and while I can't comment on the controversy regarding the pay-for-gold scheme and its alleged "necessity", thus far I can't really see that I'm going to NEED to expend such extra funds, as long as I resist the urge to jump straight to the more challenging dungeons and just stick to the easy-peasy ones for now.\n\nIn all honestly, I mostly lost interest in this kind of "high fantasy" stuff a long, long time ago (I'm in my early forties, and played the original Warhammer ROLEPLAYING game  - the one with dice 'n' paper - back in my late teens/early twenties!), but this brings back fond memories of murdering snotlings and orcs and what-not like it was only yesterday.  Ah, to be young and nerdy again...and sure, it might lack the STRATEGY of the otherwise quite similar Space Hulk (the first video game adaptation, not the unnecessarily convoluted Ascension, which I'm yet to make my peace with), but if it's a more casual, jump-in/jump-out turn-based game you're looking for, you can't go far wrong here.  Hell, I played for six hours straight the first night, and I don't do that with ANY games, ever.  Simple, fast-paced, addictive, and sure to give you a severe case of "just-one-more-dungeon-before-bedtime", even when it's already past five o'clock in the morning.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.\n\n(Oh, and PS...make sure you get the Deluxe edition, unless you really can't afford it...'cause I can only imagine that the variety inherent within the gameplay - hardly the game's strong point as it is - would be even more limited without it.)","January 16, 2015","true","38.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

Fun little game, I like the care put into the quest information and village and city graphics. The art and lighting is actually pretty good.\n\nMusic is pretty nice, really adds to the feel of the game.\n\nGraphics were done pretty well, I hear its a direct port so thats nothing to rave about, but I will say I did enjoy the fact that when you purchase or find equipment in the world, your characters generally wear that gear, which adds a lot to the game.\n\nEDIT: Over time playing the game, I found that the game had a lot more content than I expected, so of course this is a great thing. A lot more enemies then in the original board game, which was also unexpected.\n\nCons-\n\nEDIT: I'm certainly not a fan of micro transactions. That being said, when the game first came out the cost of characters and additional content was rather high. Apparently this has been a large complaint throughout the Steam community and as a result it seems that he prices have dropped for the extra materials. While I do think that the drop does show the developers are listening, I still believe that $3 a character is a little high. The additional content of Reikland and Averland for the Ork and Skaven set does add a lot to those purchases, though Im not sure if the price is right. I was lucky enough to have picked up the first set at $11 when it was on sale during early access.\n\nEDIT: The game reaches a cap point; every progression level for the characters of course goes up in training costs (as the original game did) but selling treasure does not give you enough to reasonably be able to maintain. You will get cash per kill and if you were to go back to the original dungeons you started with you can technically go through some pretty easy dungeons and get scraps that way, but its slow going to say the least. Values seemt o be silly to post since you dont maintain anywhere near that amount when trying to sell such an item. If you go on an adventure, for example, for some sword or what have you that has a value printed on it at 3500 coins (which is rare, even at 7th level), you will at most make around 1/4th that.  this slow down of cash inflow really pushes the gold purchasing micro transactions which I loathe.\n\n\nEDITED Summary:\nInitially when I reviewed this game I gave it an overall "do not recommend" based on the micro transactions alone and the prices of them. I have slowly changed my mind based on what Ive seen changed in the reduced cost of the microtransactions as compared to what you received, and how the developers have reacted to public opinion. I still dont like micro transactions and I still think the character prices should drop further, but based on what Ive paid versus the current content I have received for my money, I have to say Ive been swayed on this current product.","January 7, 2015","true","37.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I didn't buy Warhammer Quest but played it around a friends. When I saw this was coming out I took a complete risk and pre-ordered it. To be honest I can see  the positives and negatives to the game. The characters, monsters, places, stats and items stay true to the Warhammer Universe if you are a purist like me. You move around a board completing quests by killing monsters. This is quite fun but if you are not a fan I could see how this could get boring before you get far into the game.\nI am enjoying it though picking up new equipment and skills for my characters along the way. I also got the Deluxe pack so have all characters and some additional content to use and discover.\nThis game was originally designed for mobiles and I can see that the higher price tag for PC as well as the cost of DLC might agitate some people. I think the price I paid with a 20% discount was fair and am already getting my monies worth. I do think that the board and tiles used could have been improved with more traps and random enounters in the dungeons. There are random encounters in the city although these seem to just involved you losing gold (which can be bought for real cash). There are stories to some of the quests that are interesting to read and follow though. If you are a games workshop fan then I would recommend this game if not you may want to give it a try before you buy.","January 8, 2015","true","16.5"," 39 of 74 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","39","74","0","0"

This game is great for those who love turn-based combat (think XCom), especially great for those who love the Warhammer universe, and extra-specially great for anyone with fond memories of the excellent boardgame, of which this is a fairly faithful implementation. Anyone who does a little research will find that buying the Deluxe edition is the way to go, as this represents the best value for money - this is a lot cheaper than buying the same package on IOS (where micro-transactions are the only way forward).\n\nThe graphics can be pumped up from the main menu though it appears many people would prefer to ♥♥♥♥♥ that it's a lazy port with crappy IOS graphics than actually go in and look for that option. Mouse-based control works perfectly, so again any complaint about that is equally petty. True there are no PC key mappings, but the game doesn't need them. At all.\n\nJust bear in mind it is a port of a dice-based boardgame, with all the pitfalls that come with RNG, and the slow pace of a boardgame, and you'll be fine.\n\nSo then, a fun game whose depth slowly reveals itself as your party levels up and acquires new items and skills and items that give new skills. Frustrating at times, as you will wipe due to bad rolls, but there's a great sense of progression as you move from town to town tackling increasingly difficult dungeons with an increasingly potent party. I am really enjopying this.\n\nADDENDUM: After playing considerably further after writing the above review, I am changing me review score. As your party becomes more potent and yourselves and the enemies get a lot more abilities to play with, the game really starts to shine. ESPECIALLY as a single player experience where interaction between heroes becomes more interesting and thought-provoking. This allows the game to show some tactical depth as you start to worry about carefully positioning your party and ordering your attacks to maximise very large Death Blows from your heavy-hitters that sweep away a LOT of enemies at once. In the end this offers more tactical depth than, say, late-game XCom, which was a pleasant surprise. Raising my score to 8.5 (from 7.5) accordingly.","January 8, 2015","true","21.2"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","29","55","0","0"

If you don't know the Games Workshop board game, then stop reading this review now and go elsewhere.  This game isn't for you.\n\nSecond, BUY THE DELUXE VERSION.  The standard version is terrible, it's missing practically half the game.  No one likes in-game purchases, and I think it was a stupid idea to include them here.\n\nGold purchasing; like in the early days of Diablo 3, you are given the option to spend real money to purchase in-game gold.  This is a terrible idea, and is both unwanted and unneeded, you get plenty of gold just playing the game normally.\n\nThe game itself is excellent.  Turn-based dungeon crawling set in the Warhammer world with a huge range of heroes, skills, abilities and items to choose from.  Undead, Orcs & Goblins, Skaven and critters (bats, spiders, rats etc) inhabit the dungeons, all with an impressive range of monsters and their own skills and magic items.  The game becomes very challenging early on, which is great as you don't every dungeon to be a walk in the park.  One minor gripe is that the skaven claw leaders use the same model as the normal clanrats, which can make it difficult to differentiate between them when both types are in play.\n\nProtips: go for quests which have high-value items as rewards, the gold you get from selling them (as long as you don't need them for your own warriors) will help progress your characters.  Always play on hardcore mode, it's much more exciting than the other modes.\n\nTL;DR - if you liked Games Workshop's Warhammer Quest board game, then buy the deluxe version.  Otherwise, don't bother with this game and get something else.\n\n8/10","January 11, 2015","true","92.0"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

I think the dungeons are reasonably interesting and the enemies are reasonably varied. But it's only really good to play for, say, half an hour to an hour before you feel like playing something else. It's a time filler, but that's as far as it goes.\n\nPermit me to go off on a tangent for a moment: To me, it's a bit like trying to play Dungeons and Dragons solo. It's like you setup your characters, have a random roll d20 table to determine each of the rooms, and what's in them, and away you go. Now, if anyone has ever tried to play D&D in that manner, you'll know that it's fun... For about 15 minutes. Any longer than that and the constant move, random room, monster, move, random room, monster, move, random room, empty, move, random room, monster gets a bit dull. Playing D&D this way is fine with friends, or if occasionally the game is designed to do something to surprise the player, but nothing ever really happens.\n\nAnd, coming back to the main topic, that's what I find with Warhammer Quest. It's pretty much D&D-ish with a solo player and a random roll table to determine the contents of each room. Okay, they tried to spice it up by tying everything together with quests. But, for the most part, it really is just one random dungeon crawl after another. So. I do like it? Sort of, but only in small doses. It'll probably be one of those games that I play for a few days and then forget about.\n\nI do "recommend" it, but only because I can't choose any other option. To say "no" is a little unfair in my opinion,  but "yes" I think is a little too generous. If there were some way to choose a rating that's inbetween, I would.\n\nIf I was going to give it a star rating out of 5, it'd be 2.5.","January 12, 2015","true","3.0"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

Huge warhammer fan. Both fantasy and 40k. Have played table top and most of the video games for years.\n\nThis game is great because it combines two of my favorite games, Warhammer and D&D. You go to a dungeon and explore, killing mosters and getting loot/gold. Its kinda like a dumbed down version of Balder's gate but with Warhammer character stats. Its a fun way to kill some time.\n\nyou don't get to walk from place to place but you do get random encounters while 'fast travelling'. Could be you found bandits, get attacked, had to find shelter in a storm, rock slides you have ot avoid, or any number of other events. Event will also happen when you go to towns. Has that good ol' D&D feel for event setups.\n\nHowever it does have some bugs and major draw backs in a few areas.\nIt tends to be repetitive in the sense that all you do is fast travel around and only control the heroes while in a dungeon. I sometimes enjoy this when I don't feel like doing the old Balder's gate exploring games.\nThere are some minor glitchs in the game i noticed. Like sometimes your Mages spells/actions will reset his movement points.\n\nThe random monster encounters while in a dungeon seems to random. A few times I have been engaged by new enemies 2 or 3 turns in a row. Ending up with 20+ monsters in the area. At that point you just die and restart in town losing all xp you earned in that dungeon, But you retain any loot you found. The last few dungeons I entered were suppose to be Orc/goblins but end up fighting zombies and vampires. End up getting jumped by 2-3 vampire dread knights(which are the most powerful monster I have come across) at one time.\n\nIn the end the game can be alot of fun but can also be very aggrivating and requires ALOT of patients. I got it on sale for $2 and think its worth that but no more. Needs some major balance tweaks with the RNG for monster encounters.","February 11","false","32.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay has you moving node to node on a large land map, unlocking cities by completing a dungeon between them, then completing the city by doing a city-specific quest inside another dungeon. There are three major zones, each with 9 cities, and one zone-completion dungeon to do per zone. You can move between the zones before finishing the zone dungeon; I did this to get some upgrades to make completing the first zone's dungeon easier.\n\nDon't expect deep story or complicated stats or skills. The multitude of mini-quests and items have nicely varied descriptions, and you're almost always chasing a specific upgrade or another; you generally know what artifact you're going to obtain before entering a dungeon. This adds a nice motivation towards a successful run.\n\nHealing is a bit tough in the lower levels. Most of your XP comes from killing blows on monsters, which left my healer (I chose the Grey Wizard class) short on experience for a while. Lots of resting to to able to cast spells again resulted in lots of wandering monster encounters, which was somewhat irritating until I learned to manage it better.\n\nI can see how it would be more fun played live as a board game, but now I'll be familiar with it should that time come.","December 27, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you get it, especially on sale*, you will probably get your money's worth of game time. Will you spend hundreds of hours on it? Maybe not... but will you get a few enjoyable hours out of it? Almost definitely, especially if you remember the beutiful simplicity of it's origins. This was the gateway game to many a Warhammer or DnD player in the day. That nostalgia factor alone is worth it when it's on sale if you've got any old school or respect for old school gaming in you.\n\nI DO recommend the Deluxe version, the extra classes and gear are worth it [especially the classes, Trollslayer, Archmage, the Ogre were all worth it, a friend of mine likes his Witchhunter and Bright Wizard].\n\nOVERALL: It's a solid 6.5 of 10, call it 7.5 if you're a Warhammer fan, 8+ if you were fan of the tabletop version.\n\n*Wait til it's at least $5 off if you can, (9.99 or less for standard, 24.99 or less for Deluxe.)

At the 6+ level you need to grind gold to get you PC to level up (10K to level from 6 to 7, and 15K from 7 to 8).  You will have to grind as there is no "purchase gold" option on the PC game.

Loot in the game is mostly junk early on.\n- Could use more content.\n- Some harder monster types are just different colours (issue for me).\n- Animations are too slow (minor issue)\n\n-- Game Can Be Slow --\nIf you can play for hours and hours to finally get somewhere then the game should eventually get rewarding unfortunately by the time you get close to that you will most likely get bored as most gamers seem to have very short attention spans.\n\n-- DLC Spam --\nClassic game that split it's many parts into DLC where it should have included them. More characters and dungeons\monsters could have been added later. An annoying greed factor of the devs (or most likely Games Workshop!).\nTry to get as much DLC as you can as it will help your overall experience (more dungeons\monsters is best).\n\n-- Lack of Content --\nI'd like to see a wider range of dungeons early on further adding to the monster types you could face. I'm not willing to fight the same thing a million times to get there. Also the monster types can look the same but with different colours which sux but isn't too bad.\n\n-- Power Phase --\nEvery round you roll a dice for your wizards spells. If you roll a 1 an event happens (90% of the time its monsters). After many, many, many rolls of a #1 on your power phase you can be flooded with enemys stopping you from progressing the dungeon. This doesn't happen often but when it does, it's constant. Mostly though it doesn't happen so I think theres a bug in there somewhere. Overall not a big deal and if you do get through it you will have a ton of XP and cash.\n\n- Overall -\nOverall the fighting system works pretty well. New loot helps your thirst for more but don't expect constant item upgrades.\nFights can get tough giving you a sense of accomplishment if you survive.\nIf you like dungeon crawling this could be a great addition to your game.","January 13","true","42.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

IT is a turn based tactics game that get very repitive as it was orginialy an iphone game. However with that said if you like shallow turn based tatics set within the warhammer world, this is a must buy, but I stress only buy it when it is on sale and only get the delux edition for it adds a plethra of new quests, heros and tilesets that the base game is not worth the purchase a lone.\n\nIt is a very shallow game but it has a certian charm that will appeal to warhammer fans, and light tatics fan.

If you wanted hack 'n slash action and adventure, then you should have looked elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, Warhammer Quest is a computer game based on a board game, and a wonderful implementation it is! In fact, the computer version does all of the work behind the scenes that made the board game version fun but tedious after a while. Plus, there's music, sound FX, and some dismemberment...the latter a cringeworthy feat if such had happened to the miniatures of the board game.\n\nThe game is tactical, and each character has a role to play if the team is to be victorious in the many quests. Are those quest varied? Well, much like the board game, they are numerous, but do tend to resemble one another after a while. Thus, a faithful rendition has been made!

The gameplay has you moving node to node on a large land map, unlocking cities by completing a dungeon between them, then completing the city by doing a city-specific quest inside another dungeon. There are three major zones, each with 9 cities, and one zone-completion dungeon to do per zone. You can move between the zones before finishing the zone dungeon; I did this to get some upgrades to make completing the first zone's dungeon easier.\n\nDon't expect deep story or complicated stats or skills. The multitude of mini-quests and items have nicely varied descriptions, and you're almost always chasing a specific upgrade or another; you generally know what artifact you're going to obtain before entering a dungeon. This adds a nice motivation towards a successful run.\n\nHealing is a bit tough in the lower levels. Most of your XP comes from killing blows on monsters, which left my healer (I chose the Grey Wizard class) short on experience for a while. Lots of resting to to able to cast spells again resulted in lots of wandering monster encounters, which was somewhat irritating until I learned to manage it better.\n\nI can see how it would be more fun played live as a board game, but now I'll be familiar with it should that time come.","December 27, 2015","true","18.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I did for $6.99 and this review is on that.  It a decent casual game but has some flaws.  There are still bugs in the game and the same problems you read about the APP still exist here.  The game was a blast up to 5th level and at that point it becomes a casual game.  Around 6 level you come to a horrid truth.  The game was design for you to do In-ap  purchase of gold.  At the 6+ level you need to grind gold to get you PC to level up (10K to level from 6 to 7, and 15K from 7 to 8).  You will have to grind as there is no "purchase gold" option on the PC game.

Bullcrap.  Pure bullcrap.\n\nPerhaps if you only get the 'basic' version you run into this problem:  I can see extra characters and tiles/monsters are available for money in game, but I was a fan of the boardgame and invested in the 'deluxe' version.  I've not been bothered for microtransactions, nor have I run into any paywalls.  I could BUY extra gold if I wanted...but there's absolutely zero need to.  Your characters are perfectly competitive without the extra help.\n\nNow the game:  Turn based, based on a boardgame.  You control four characters and run them through a dungeon.  As you level up you pick up special abilities to help, and there are plenty of magic or special items, but this loot and kill scheme is pretty much it.\n\nThe four characters that come with the basic game are a marauder (barbarian/fighter type), dwarf ironguard (heavy fighter), elven...waywatcher? (bowman), and grey wizard.   This is a pretty good standard party composition.  All the deluxe pack adds here is more variety:  Ogre Irongut (massive damage fighter) or Archmage (another spellcaster) for example.\n\nThe game play is somewhat linear:  You go through a quest to find and get to new cities, and each city has a quest or two to go through.  Off the top of my head each adventure/quest takes around 30 minutes, so this is a good game when you need to kill a little time.  You earn experience for killing monsters, and get gold to buy supplies at market.  Hint:  Anything to do with healing is vital.\n\nThere are three levels of play:  Casual with easier combat - I suppose that's okay if you're new tot his genre or just experimenting.  Adventurer (I think...medium), and Hardcore.  In Hardcore you can permanently lose characters, whereas the others they're just knocked out for the adventure.  I prefer Hardcore for the sense of 'danger' it adds:   Just now, my party was TPKed.  In any other difficulty level, and most other games, I'd simply shrug and go back to my last save.  Now I have to keep going with new characters.  It changed my tactics towards the end as I realized I was going to lose, as now the objective became keeping one of my higher level characters alive long enough to escape.  (Damn zombies.)\n\nIf you're looking for a rich RPG with sandbox gameplay and side quests...no, that's not this game.   If you're in the mood for a throwback to when adventurers plundered dungeons, risked life and limb, and came out only to do it again next adventure?   This game and you can do business.  Don't worry about all this crap about microtransactions:  They're not there unless you WANT them to be there.\n","January 10, 2015","true","8.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

RNG all day long.\nIf you have fond memories of playing HeroQuest, Warhammer Quest or Talisman you might like this quite a bit.\nThe only real negative for me is that the contols are not optimal for PC (being thats it's a port from a touch screen interface).

They really did no research on the Warhammer universe, nor did they respect that excellent game from the 1990s.\n\nAlso, even with all the puny dlcs (or the "deluxe" edition, even though there is nothing deluxe about it) it possesses a maximum of 20% of what the BASIC original Warhammer Quest game had in the box. Their game is too easy to be Warhammer Quest. The rules are not the same. Their game is ruining the name of this nice game from the 1990s.\n\nThey have no respect from the Warhammar universe. The game feels like a Forgotten Realms universe where you can buy magic everywhere, even in villages! Anyone who has read just a little about Warhammer knows that magic is rare and dangerous, and you cannot buy magic just like that and certainly not in villages and hamlets.\n\nI dream of the day that someone with at least half a brain does the game entirely as it was in the basic box that I had in the 1990s.

Doing this is relatively easy, simply click on any area of the game that your char can not move to.\n\nInitially, the wizard class seems to have trouble attacking things. Because, as a wizard you tend to try to protect it from being directly hit in melee. But remember that on easy mode, if it dies, you just losee it for that round.

If you aren't going to spring for the whole thing you're going to spend a lot of time finding items you can't use...\n\nI've enjoyed it so far, (I've put in about 15+ hours), it's a straight forward faithful and fun realisation of the classic boardgame, and thats really all you should expect, theres nothing new here in terms of game play or features, its based on 20 year old GW rules. The interface is straight forward with nice imagery and presentation, you can pleasantly kill a fair bit of time grinding through some randomly generated dungeons stomping greenskins and assorted vermin, leveling up and collecting loot.\n\nThat being said, a word to the wise - I tried to level up ALL the characters at the same rate (by preferencing the heroes with the least experience).  Now I'm beginning to see the folly in the plan, the cost of leveling up after level 5 or 6 is exhorbitant,  and it would require an unbearable grind to level up everyone equally, not to mentiont that some characters (most of the Wizards and Ogre) are really not worth the time..\n\nFar better to just pick your 4 or 5 favourite heroes and ONLY run with them, then you can sell the other characters unique items and use the funds to pay the several thousand gold its going to cost to level up past level 4.\n\nIf you have a sentimental spot for Warhammer Quest the boardgame and you can get past the DLC ♥♥♥♥ery you will probably enjoy this.","March 21","true","19.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gets better the more you play.  If you  chose hardcore difficulty, it's intense enough  to play for hours on end.

(Wont be buying any ingame gold though on principle, that's just a dispicable innovation for this sort of game.)\n\nThe negative reviews still have a point. Animations are basic and movement is annoyingly slow.  UI is not impressive. There's no voice acting.  Music is good but not brilliant, same can be said of the written story.  Some of the still artwork is nice.  It's atmospheric, but in a minimalist way so you'd have to already be  a warhammer fan to appeaciate it.\n\nIt's a dungeon crawler with not much thought required,  but that can be a good thing if you like to happily grind away with no pesky puzzles.

It is exactly what it promised it would be, a recreation of the board game.  If you are looking for a grand, all-singing, all-dancing dungeon crawl with fantastic 3D graphics, smooth animations and glorious sound effects, then go elsewhere and stop complaining here.  The game isn't for you it seems.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a game that recreates all the little details of the original game, then this is it.  Warriors surviving against hordes of death-leaping rats, webbing spiders, orcs, skaven, necromancers and vampires; then nearly dying in town because of a runaway cart, just like the original.  Hunting for treasure, power-1-rolling-random-monster-magnet wizards, that infuriating snotling that won't die as your trollslayer just refuses to hit it after killing the orc boss; it's all in here.\n\nThe game runs in small little quests so it's good for a quick game whilst waiting to go out and just as good for a 2 hour time killing adventure.  There's no need to race through things and you can pick up just where you left off, play for 10 minutes and then leave it again.\n\nI'll come clean here, I could be accused of being a bit of a GW fan-boy, I bought the original box when it came out and then started collecting all the minatures I needed, even though they didn't fit into any of the armies I had.  I even worked for them for 7 years.  Does this make me biased, maybe, does the fact that all the games I have on Steam are GW based (except TW:Rome II) mean I'm inclined to enjoy the Warhammer worlds.  Yes it does.  Does this game bring about the same sense of futility that the Empire faces fighting against the countless hordes of chaos, not quite, but it certainly has the feel of belonging in that world.\n\nThe gameplay is quite straight forward, like the original.  Everything is clear, click&hold for more information works for almost everything.  The only annoying thing I've found so far is that I can't find out how much gold my party has whilst in a dungeon, except for the brief tally that appears after every mob kill.\n\nI didn't even know this was available on iOS, but then I steer clear of Apple, so I can't comment about price comparisons and how good a port it is.  What I can say is that it only costs about £20 for the full deluxe version with all the DLC contained, so man-up and buy that instead of the standard version and whining about the extras.  As for the microtransactions nonsense, you don't need to buy gold, just go and quest, that's the point of the game.  And anyway, it's hardly pay-to-win in a solo game, no-one is twisting your arm to spend extra money and there's no leaderboards so it doesn't matter if you're not advancing as quick as Billynomates Wannabeuberateverything.","January 10, 2015","true","12.9"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

It is the one boardgame that my kids and I can play together and enjoy. Is  this the same game? Not exactly, but it is fun. I love turn based games. There is plenty of loot to be had. some good some useless but all worth gold which you need to level. There are plenty of different characters to play although some are over powered like the witch hunter and bright wizard! The game is repetitive, but that is the nature of this game. Get a quest, pick four characters, traverse the dungeon that is revealed one tile at a time, fight monsters, get loot, go to town to spend your gold to buy items or level and basicly that is the game.  They do need different monster sets for more variety. I have the deluxe version and it comes with critters, undead, and orcs and goblins. A quest usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes to play, so if you don't have much time you can get a game in.

However, for the inflated Steam price it is a great let down that they couldn't be bothered to up the graphics resolution or give some extra keyboard controls.\n\nThe in-app purchases were fair enough when the game first came out on iOS.  The original board game came with four heroes and a set amount of monsters so you had to buy extra miniatures or quest packs.  Therefore I don't mind them doing this with the computer game.\n\nWhat I do mind though is the inclusion of content obviously meant for the purchased heroes littering the game.  By this I mean horribly over-powered undead popping up in supposed "orc & goblin" dungeons and unusable equipment found in treasure stashes.  Talking of treasure, the quest rewards seem a little light since they slapped a load of in-app gold purchasing in the game too.\n\nI still (just about) give the game a thumbs up due to the great dungeon experience but I am disgusted with how greedy the developers have got with this type of thing.

Perhaps because, despite its many, many flaws, it's quite pleasant to play.\n\nJust like in the other adaptations of old Games Workshop games, randomness permeates the gameplay to its very core: the FTL-like text events have saving throws instead of multiple choice problems, seemingly every turn there's a chance for enemies to suddenly appear right next to you (or far away, if they're ranged), all your attacks have a goodly chance of missing, the amount of mana your wizard gets each turn is random, and so on and so forth. However, the (randomness-soaked) events of a single turn are very unlikely to screw you over on their own. It's a very cautious game about threat mitigation where standing still for too long is guaranteed to make you lose eventually.\n\nNow, to complain about a thing other reviewers missed: the animations are stupid. Characters all walk with their legs splayed out in an awkward and uncomfortable fashion, and the attack animations should really have less build-up and cool-down time (it looks really awkward when this guy goes in for a big swing, steps back to his own square, does it again several times, then puts down his weapon, pulls out a bow, shoots someone once, puts back the bow, and picks up his weapon again).","October 25, 2015","true","18.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You get what you see on the wrapping, and the package inside is just as pretty.\n\nThere are no words to say how epic the lore of the Warhammer world is. The game events also seem to be set in an interesting period of the Old World's timeline, since the missions and environments of the game follow those of the boardgame, and the time it was released in. It is also nice for fans of the board game that the Reikland region seems to be loosely based on the rumored Skaven expansion that never saw the day.\n\nThis game is fun. It describes perfectly the classic 'just one more' emotion of when you know you should just stop and take a break, or have to, but you just want more, one more dungeon, one more treasure, one more quest for an experience level, and the music haunts you, it follows you and pulls you back towards the magic, and you don't want to give up, not until all that's offered has been done.\n\nIf you ever liked Warhammer, or wanted to play a video game version of a typical d&d style dungeon adventure...

I have no illusions whatsoever that my humble writing skills will change anyone's mind so I want to write a fair review of this so that folks who are willing to hear both sides can make an informed decision. So, once more unto the breach!!\n\nIn 1995, UK games monolith Games Workshop answered Milton Bradley's Heroquest with a dark, quirky, face kicking boardgame called Warhammer Quest. Set in the rich fantasy world of Warhammer, a party of four intrepid adventurers raided dungeons that were randomly created and more often than not, died horribly and rather creatively. Expansion packs were released and in those early days of the most holy internet, people even created homebrew dungeon tiles, monsters, and treasure packs that were as good looking and perfectly playable in the game. But alas, the joy was short lived as Games Workshop decided to pull the plug. The boardgame faded into the madness of the aftermarket and is commanding rather exorobitant prices. Sad.\n\nFast forward to January 7th and WQ is back! The game faithfully recreates the experience of playing the original murderous and funny experience of the boardgame in all of its gory glory. As you know, it's a port from iOS but does that detract from the core game experience? In my opinion, no. It's clear that developer Chilled Mouse put a lot of love into this little gem and given the fact that GW is very VERY protective of its intellectual property, Chilled Mouse has done a splendid job.\n\nBut every review must be fair so I'll point out a few negatives first. The omission of multiplayer was a very bad decision. WQ and games like it are BEST played with others. That said, it IS a fun singleplayer game and you can of course, play it hot seat! Imagine that; people actually getting together to play a game like the old days! The RNG is again faithful to the game but there should be an option to see a chart of the result of dice rolls as in the original boardgame.\n\nNow to the good stuff! First off, let's get this out of the way: there are NO mandatory microtranactions in this game. It is NOT "P2W." The option is there to buy in game gold for those who would rather rush through the game but all you gain is getting a higher powered party sooner, and, as this IS a single player game, no one is hurt if a person decides TO avail her/himself of the MT.\n\nThe game's dungeons ar randomly generated and faithfully retain the look of the original. If there is one thing you need to know to survive this game is to expect the unexpected and that the unexpected is usually quite nasty.  But the game has a sense of humor in all of the darkness too. There is one bit early in the game where a person hanging upside down is making a speech and that speech is cut short by a well thrown piece of cauliflower to his face.\n\nThis is a turn based game so don't expect to running like a mad person like the equally excellent Runers. This game's weapon is to make you THINK; to make you wonder what lurks in that next room or corridor. It's about positioning your characters for maximum face punchage to the great unwashed nasties that stand between you and glorious loot. The UI is simple: everything can be done with the mouse and unlike some other iOS ports, the game responds very well to mouse dragigng and other iOS strangeness.\n\nI only have three hours into this game and yet my party is leveling up very nicely and I haven't spent a single real coin of the realm beyondthe purchase price. If you are a WQ fan, this game is a no-brainer must buy; you will not be disappointed. If you are a gamer that wants to get out of her/his comfort zone and test the waters of something different; something that isn't the 900th iteration of CoD, and you enjoy tactical thinking, this game has it in spades.\n\nI strongly recommend this game and if you buy it, go all the way and get the Deluxe version. Contrary to what you may have read, this game is much less expensive than the iOS version when you figure in the additional DLC. And resist the temptation to OPTIONALLY buy gold or else you will rob yourself of a classic gaming experience!\n\nUPDATE: 9.2 hours in game and it just keeps getting better. But the main reason I wanted to update is for those who may not know, namely, that the optional MTs are gone. So, buy the Deluxe version and have a blast and not  pay another penny - unless of course later DLC becomes available and I for one hope it does!!","January 8, 2015","true","16.3"," 26 of 57 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","26","57","0","2"

Heres a few points:\n\nOn the Micro Transactions\n\n- Some of the MT are very nice to have, such as the extra characters but are not at all necessary until much later in the game when you may want a change of pace.\n\n- Gold MT is completely unnecessary so far, 5 hours in 4 characters at level 5 i have not needed a single coin outside of what ive gotten from dungeons, and even then its just to buy the healing items and the occasional nice treat.\n\n- Having MT in this game at all even though its a IOS port is still a massive kick in the teeth for PC players, dont do it again, you only damage yourself and any extra money you get is negated by those that didnt buy the game because of the MT.\n\nOn the Gameplay controls\n\n- Controls in game are simple, mouse click for everything.\n\n- Could have been optimized for PC far far better, no keyboard use at all so no shortcuts, would be nice as another user said to be able to use keys 1-4 for something such as selecting a heroe or to use a ability etc. Using arrow keys to move the map around would have been nice, but not essential.\n\nOn the Graphics\n\n- Clear IOS port hardly anything worth mentioning here, you could have at least buffed the resolution on the textures up some more and added in Effects for magic use, small animations added for diversity in melee would have been interesting and more engaging for relatively small amount of work.\n\nOn the Gameplay itself\n\n- Showing the player the dice rolls ala monopoly would have a been a nice touch and i reckon wouldnt throw off players much.\n\n- Some journal entries are clearly cut off at the bottom even after scrolling whether it was the porters that did this or original designers i dont know but shows bad quality.\n\n- More intuitive explanation of the UI would have been better as well as wind of magic, a new player would be more like wheres my mana bar and what on earth is this winds crap, a voiceover tutorial would have been better instead of written.\n\n- So far on adventurer difficulty i havent lost a heroe and would have appreciated more challenge, from what i understand hardcore is adventurer with permanent heroe death, if this is the case a future update with a 'insane' difficulty would be advised to keep players going.\n\n\n\nFinal comments\n\nSo far the game has been very enjoyable, and sticks fairly well to the original board games intent, however the MT addition has clearly damaged public opinion of the game to no end. The game could have been much better as a PC port with many new graphical and UI enhancements to take advantage of PC power, but has not been done in this game. Overall the game is worth playing, but only for warhammer enthusiasts, those who enjoyed classical board game or those who are after a light RPG in the warhammer setting.\n\n\nHopefully this will set people on the right path if they are thinking of buying the game.","January 8, 2015","true","23.7"," 30 of 66 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","30","66","0","0"

Doesn't require alot of mental stamina and can easily be walked away from to go and take care of whatever real life issues come up and then returned to later. Graphics are basic and if you are looking for some really good eye candy then you will be disappointed. Game play is true to the board game and alot of bad things can happen for absolutely no good reason (RNG) One of my favorites from the board game was the Dwarf trips over his beard and kills himself.... always a good for a laugh with my friends!\n\nThe biggest problem this game has is the inclusion of the MTs. Although not required (so far I have always had just enough gold to train) it sets a HORRIBLE precident for other game developers to put them in and it be almost required to complete the game. I wish the developer would just remove the MTs altogether, and I hope that the game itself sells well and not one person uses the MTs so that it will prove that MTs in computer games is a waste of time.\n\nThe other drawback is the absence of Multiplayer. This is one of those games where it should have been included so you could play with your friends from far away places and then laugh at each other over VOIP when the dwarf trips over his own beard!\n\nBottom line is..... if you enjoyed the board game when you were younger and just want an easy don't have to think to hard game, then by all means buy it.  Just don't use the MTs so the developers will see what a waste of time it is in computer games","January 9, 2015","true","50.9"," 13 of 32 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","13","32","0","0"

If you don't like pricey DLC then don't buy any of it. It's as simple as that.\n\nBut pricey DLC doesn't impact the gameplay, which is solid and good if you like light strategy games with RPG aspects.\n\nI do, so it gets a recommend.

True killing a rat would net you 15g in the board game and 4g in this game but then training costs are one tenth of the amount of the board game...\n\nIf you're impatient enough to want the best gear straight away then there is an option for that too but I won't be using it.  After four dungeons my four characters were all level 3 with 4000g in the bank. I can only assume those people raging on the forums about buying gold either don't like giving people an easy option to achieve what they did, assuming they've even played the game at all or they've missed their midday nap time.\n\nI would recommend the delux edition and ignoring the overpowered items for the additional characters it unlocks. At the current price it is still cheaper than the IPhone version (check which dlc the base game already incorporates) and if they plan to introduce further dlc to get past level 8 (Level 10 was the maximum in the board game) and introduce other characters (Everyone loves a Chaos Knight!) then I'll be buying that too.\n\nThe base game at £9.89 still includes the full game with the four original board game characters so is in no way an 'Incomplete game'.","January 7, 2015","true","40.2"," 22 of 63 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","22","63","0","0"

I foresee many hours of my life disappearing into this game.  Some people may find the interface a bit slow as it is a port from a touchscreen interface, but I find it no slower than picking up a miniature and trotting it across a board.  Some people may also miss a multiplayer option, but you can still invite a friend over and play hotseat (this option is made even more attractive in this videogame as they've removed the lantern rule, where all characters must stay within two board sections of the torchbearer or perish in the unforgiving dark), you can even have characters go completely separate ways if there's a fork in the road!  Go ahead, split the party!  What could possibly go wrong?\n\nYou may hear some complaints about "microtransactions" from other reviewers, but those people don't know what they're talking about.  If you buy the deluxe version (which is essentially a season pass for all the content available since 2013), I'm sure you'll never notice a single transaction request.   I don't notice these transaction points as they're very ancillary (just a small plus-sign next to your gold pool, you need never click it, but it's there if a truly awesome weapon appears in the bazaar, and you absolutley must have it RIGHT NOW --  me, I prefer to adventure for it).\n\nIf you loved HeroQuest and Warhammer Quest the board game, it's back!  They even have a hardcore mode where character death is permanent, just like the board game -- it's the only way I play.  Wusses have the option of turning off perma-death.\n\nNow you don't even need to bother getting people together to play!  No clean-up!  No storage issues!

Jumping into this was fairly easy nonetheless, though some of the mechanics took some getting used to (the wizard's maximum mana pool changes from turn to turn, etc.).  Knowing what I know of RPGs in general (melee in front, ranged/magic users in the back), I held my own on my first run-through.  The game, for the most part, switches you off between a dungeon run and the main map, the latter of which contains towns with which you can train up, buy/sell supplies, and so on.  My press key also came with the extra DLC, though you don't need to purchase them in order to get a lot of play time out of the game (if you do buy them, you can switch out party members while in town and level them up individually).  This isn't the prettiest dungeon crawler/RPG I've played, but it's got enough here to justify the price tag.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbB8LG4jLBw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NonS3L1w-z4","January 7, 2015","true","3.6"," 41 of 192 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","41","192","0","6"

Admittedly I've always enjoyed the Warhammer universe, turned based games and fantasy so I'm getting a little something extra there. There's a good selection of playable characters and quests to be completed and while some of the quests feel a bit samey there's enough of a story line going on and variety that, for me, it didn't become too annoying (that said there *are* a lot of quests too!). There's plenty of loot and booty to be had and I'd recommend holding off on purchasing weapons in some of the many towns you will come across because levelling up your characters in the latter stages of the game can become pricey and I found that I had a backlog of characters needing to be trained. I discovered that a lot of the quest reward weapons and random drops had me kitted out pretty well anyway. The game quests are designed to played through in a short period of time, about a half-dozen to a dozen rooms in total. Any of the general quests in the wilderness will likely only take a half hour or so if you don't find yourself getting into trouble and the story-line quests will take a little longer. While there's no form of permadeath nor any major punishment when your adventures die it can be annoying when your whole party wipes-out in a dungeon because you get swamped by monsters because of random spawns during combat. The vampires tend to be just as powerful, if not more powerful, than you so you really need to get your strategy right. Don't give up though as when all looks lost you can steal victory from the jaws of defeat (and only by the skin of your teeth) and that when I enjoyed the game the most. The only major annoyance and criticism I have is that some of the game mechanics (e.g. those pesky vampires and random spawns) could have used a little more testing and tweaking as occasionally it's a little unfair in its imbalance. I was fighting a Vampire Lord and just when I had his accompanying retinue sorted and about end his undead Lordliness another vampire spawned, around the corner and well out of my reach, and proceeded to heal, disable and resurrect until I was completely surrounded and outnumbered four to one. Slowly but surely my brave adventurers met a grizzly end. Frustrating but, like I said, no major penalty incurred (but man it sucks at the final stage of the dungeon). Well, more critters to be stuck with my blade. If you enjoy Warhammer and enjoy turn base roll playing then I certainly recommend WQ and also a simple introduction to the genre.","May 30","true","94.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the game comes with 4 perfectly serviceable characters for the asking price, at least a further $15 is required to open up the full set of classes. This would be acceptable if the first 8 quest rewards I got weren't all for classes requiring further purchase. It's mobile roots show through a little too clearly and while the asking price might be reflective of the time you'll spend with it, a very grindy feel quickly sets in and boredom quickly follows.","May 25","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does a really good job of creating a fun and faithful dungeon crawl experience for on-the-go play on my tablet. Very easy to pick up and put down. I got it on sale, and I think the price is a little high, especially since you have to buy the extra characters if you want them.","June 2","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
