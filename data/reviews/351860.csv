"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatrum/recommended/351860/","theatrum","Chrispea","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatrum/","673 products in account","I've been told some people are having trouble with grahpical glitches, I have a fix at the bottom of this review.\n\nI loved this game as a kid and can happily say this release works perfectly. It supports modern HD resolutions (up to 1080) and I had no problem running the game. Even the multiplayer still seems to work. The fps is still low which is understandable for a 2D game but it means window scrolling is a little janky.\n\nThe game itself is a commodity based city builder that focuses on population and resource management over combat. It's unique from other games I've played like that because you control the lives of individual people, tell someone to become a farmer and they will, then promote them to a miller, then to baker, or send them to school so they can learn to be a tailor or a brewer. This is central to the games mechanics. It's The Sims crossed with Anno or Age of Empires and although it's not quite as strategic as AeO I can remember sinking 60+ hours into single levels just because it's so fun bulding and running your colony. It could have some more depth but I enjoy it a lot.\n\n------BUG FIX------\nIf you're getting bugs while trying to play the game you can download a program called DXWnd found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/\n\nAs I said in my review, I haven't had any troubles so haven't done this personally but people who have told me this worked for them. I have used this method on other games so I trust it.\n\n- After extracting the file run the 'dxwnd' .exe\n- A little blank window will open, select the 'edit' menu and click 'add'\n- A window with a bunch of options and tabs will open, fill them out as follows:\n- "NAME:" = Northland (can be anything you like)\n- "PATH:" = C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\common\Cultures Northland\Game.exe\nNote: you may have the game installed at a different location eg. "Program Files (x86)"\nThat's it, Hit OK and you should see 'Northland' appear as an option from the window that was blank before.\n- Select it and go >edit>run and the game will run smoothly\nYou will have to launch the game using this program or have DXWnd open when launching it from steam every time.\n\nDXWnd is a hook program that you can use to get a lot of old games running smoothly on new systems. I didn't create DXWnd. Sourceforge.net is a trustworthy site for developers and you can get more support from the guy who made the program there if you need it.\n\n\nAs I said, I haven't had to use this fix myself so if you find any settings in dxwnd that improve performance even more let me know in a comment below and I'll add it.","March 28, 2015","true","13.9"," 76 of 82 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","76","82","2","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/351860/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Real-time civilization sims are generally pretty rare. Other than the Settlers series and a few other entries, there haven't been many attempts at the genre. This is often due to the level of data management required, as the games have to simulate NPC behavior, control AI factions with their own macro objectives, and contain scenarios that last for hours upon hours. Given the much easier alternatives for gameplay mechanics, it's understandable why few have popped up. So, aside from the fact that it's nice to see a new entry in the genre, how good is Cultures: Northland?\n\nIn this case it's best to start with how it's different from the alternatives. The primary difference is that each of the people in your village are unique. Each is either a male that can work or a female that tends the home when all the males are out working. The males are also distinct in that each one has a specific skillset that can be expanded through training or through just doing work around the village. This can be anything from a simple extractor gathering clay to a maker of fine furniture and enchanted jewelry for your warriors. As a result, you treasure your people much more in Northland. You don't want one of your strongest crafters dying because you didn't bother to put a defensive tower on their side of the village.\n\nAnother main change between Northland and the usual entries is that the missions have scripted events beyond the usual "enemy to kill" and "expand to here" missions. There are monster swarms, political decisions, trade opportunities, and much much more that you have to deal with during each story scenario. They also tend to have numerous sub-objectives along the way, so even the first mission can last you quite a bit of time. So long as you don't mind going through the grind of training your villagers to useful levels again at the start of each mission, the missions aren't boring at all.\n\nCombat is done a bit differently as well. Each unit has a specific set of gear that you either find in random chests scattered around the world or make yourself. The items are basically different levels of chest plate, magic amulet, sword, spear, or bow and different levels of healing potion. Fighting experience is gained the same way you train woodcutting, though, so you'll likely find yourself looking for tigers to grind up your combat skills on. It's at least easier for archers, as you can put them in a defensive tower and watch them rain down the hurt. When you have 3-5 towers close together, they can slaughter entire armies by themselves quite easily.\n\nStill, what it really comes down to is setting up signposts, building up a swarm of buildings and married settlers, and grinding out the total requirements for each level. The journey is still interesting in the end, but the fact that you have to start from scratch each time means that you'll end up repeating the process over and over again. It's entertaining, but it can get tiring if you play for too long in one sitting.\n\nOn the graphics end, Northland is pretty average. The sprites are reasonably colorful and the enemies look sufficiently menacing, but the buildings tend to blend together easily and are difficult to tell apart at times. In the end, the art style just blends together a bit too well. The wood is pretty much all the same color, the terrain is functional, and your units' only difference when of the same job is hair color. Not to say that Cultures: Northland looks bad. Far from it. The style is just a bit bland in the end.\n\nThe auditory experience is a bit better. The music tracks are very atmospheric, the ambiance is quite nice with rushing wind, random unintelligible chatter from your people, and the sounds of a town in action. It really does feel like a basic Viking tribe, even if that tribe gets along really well and has women that can pick whether or not to have a boy or girl. The kids can also be pretty interesting for the minute or two they remain kids, if just as another wandering mouth to feed.\n\nIn the end, what it all comes down to is what you're looking for in a Settlers game. If you want static roads, troops that fight one at a time, and the ability to use one villager in any job, Cultures: Northland isn't for you. However, if you don't mind a variant where roads aren't necessary, troops fight in large groups, and a more RPG-esque system for leveling your citizens, you'll likely have a blast.","January 9","true","6.0"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","40","42","3","2"

I perfectly remember how amazing the simulation was. Not even Settlers had the intricacies that Cultures has.\n\nThis is presumably the 2'nd game in the Cultures series although not shown explicitly anywhere. I did not find the original around, unless taking the GOG version.\n\nThis is the ultimate society simulation strategy game. People live, work, die - of old age, hunger. Each person has a profession. The game also involved standard resource collection but needs specified buildings to produce certain products.\nThere is also war, combat. It's not terribly complicated, but diplomacy with other people, micromanagement plays a huge role.\n\nThere is an interesting multiplayer mode. Today it won't hurt to use Hamachi or GameRanger to make it work.\nThe game is totally worth it if you like Black & White or The Settlers series. Games aren't made anymore like this. It's a niche that is appropriately maintained by this old clascic.","December 5, 2015","true","5.1"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","37","40","3","1"

Enough said! Regarded by many city-builder fans as the spiritual successor to the original Setters series; while I did enjoy Settlers 3 and 4 I feel that these were much better games. It's very similar to those however, albeit with a much more personal touch. From the micromanagement of the workers and people (e.g. you have to breed them and provide living spaces close to workplaces) and the RPG-ish elements (workers skill-up and professions/technologies are branching) along with a story-driven campaign, this under-rated classic is an absolute must-have for any fan of the city-builder style of strategy games.\n\nPros:\n- Vikings!\n- Excellent micromanagement\n- Decent 2D/sprite graphics that still look great today (despite being over ten years old you can still use 1080p resolution and the UI scales well)\n- Random banter and social dynamics of your little virtual Vikings; you actually care about each and every one\n- Detailed progression of technology/professions\n- Decent-enough story line to keep you engaged\n- Roads (not required for transport but beneficial), singposts, trade routes and remote settlements on large maps\n- Ships!\n- Can suck you in for hours at a time...\n\nCons:\n- ...can suck you in for hours at a time ;)\n- Can get a little repetitive if you don't care about storylines\n- Warfare can be a bit tedious and difficult (especially because it really hurts when just one of your soldiers are killed in battle *sob*)","June 28, 2015","true","0.2"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","28","29","2","1"
