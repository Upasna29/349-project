"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drury27/recommended/318230/","drury27","Drury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drury27/","144 products in account","Here comes another FTL comparison review. I just have to do it because reading the other ones is painful.\n\nI keep reading these reviews where people say the combat is easy or that there is no depth to it and I just have to wonder how far they've managed to get.\n\nBecause if you just order your vehicles to fire at random cars without giving it a second thought, you get shredded rather quite quickly about midgame, no matter how powerful weapons you might have.\n\nSo yes - let me start off with - the meat of the game, the combat. Let's imagine FTL-like is a genre, then this definitely fits in that genre. However, to make an FPS analogy, this is to more of a Battlefield to FTL's Team Fortress. The two games are undeniably similar in their mechanics, but the way you play them is completely different.\n\nLet's take a step back now - what makes an FTL-like game here? Take a strategy/tactics game where you have control of a large variety of game mechanics at once, with the ability to pause at any time without penalties to reasonably micromanage everything. You do that in FTL, you do that in Convoy. What you do is different in both games.\n\nFTL "overwhelms" you with it's combat mechanics. You are in charge of aiming and firing each weapon, distributing power between all the ship's systems, commanding the ship's whole crew et cetera et cetera. Point is - there is a lot of mechanics to keep a track of. If you had no pause you'd be drowning.\n\nConvoy is different. The mechanics are actually deceptively simple and, compared to FTL, much less varied, and this becomes apparent very early on. This is where the "but you only click at cars and watch" sentiment comes from. Convoy is complex in different ways, and this only becomes important later on.\n\nIn Convoy, each battle has you manage your MCV's abilities (weapons and shields) with a long cooldown time. This aspect of the game seems very insignificant at first as your starting MCV only has a stun weapon which, while useful as all hell, doesn't seem that important for newcomers since you can just blast your opponents to bits. Important note: In Convoy, Easy difficulty is actually medium rather than hard as in FTL, which I think is a pretty good idea. Anyway, MCV can't move at all, further emulating FTL behavior. The other vehicles under your control are where the differences really start to kick in. You can order them to move around an imaginary game grid and target their weapons at specific enemies, which is a pretty damn major thing. The whole game is built around the movement aspect and it has a lot of depth to it.\n\nWhereas in FTL you want to disable enemy weapons ASAP and then keep pounding them into the ground, in Convoy you can only do so with a stun weapon which you can only target one vehicle at a time with, so you have to strategize which one might be the most troublesome. And even then the stun only lasts so long, so you better focus your vehicles' fire on the sucker and try and take him out before he goes back online. But you can't because your MCV is blocking your vehicles' line of fire, so you have to rotate around it, but you can't because the slimy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s put up guards on each end of the MCV that you have to deal with first. And if you think you can just assign one of your vehicles to each one of them, let me tell you, you can't, you'll get heavily damaged or lose a vehicle. You want to always attack each enemy vehicle with multiple of your own, much like when boarding in FTL.\n\nExcept unlike FTL there is minelayer way in front and out of your technicals' reach (vehicles can't fire over the whole screen) merrily crapping out stun mines, there are some bloody random wrecks lying around on the road some of which you have freshly created, and you're fighting in a town so there are buildings you can crash into. All of above you have to dodge with each of your vehicles, good luck if you roll over a stun mine just before a bridge pillar, though. Oh, and the vehicles also block each other's line of sight, enemy or foe, thus you always want to build a car wall in front of your target in such a way that each of them can fire freely. Failure to do so results in potentional friendly fire, however most vehicles do not attempt to fire when there is something in the way, resulting in them pretty much being useless at that point in time. Keep in mind friendly fire can still happen with weapons like rockets or cannons. And once you manage to make a nice formation, you have to break it shortly after due to an upcoming bridge, and mobilizing 4 vehicles at once is a fresh artform - and there was actually a way to sneak one of your heavy haulers up to the side of an enemy vehicle and ram it off the road just before the bridge, but you only realize moments too late. It's a constant rush and there are always ways to improve your tactics.\n\nAs for upgrades, each vehicle has up to 4 item slots and can be upgraded in various ways. Make no mistake, only MCV weapons/utilities have FTL-long charging sequences, and there is no generator or anything like it. You don't need to upgrade your vehicle to use a super heavy plasma cannon. In fact, super heavy plasma cannon doesn't charge slower than a medium plasma cannon, either. It's a straight upgrade. Why would you not buy a super heavy plasma cannon right from the start, then? You can't. In FTL, an earlygame top tier weapon is a naive build and gets you killed, but here it would be gamebreaking, if it was possible. It seems in this game, top tier weapons do the same thing in lategame as crap tier peashooters in earlygame, just with bigger numbers being displayed. How does this even work? It seems it serves mostly to slow you down and try to grind events. I might be getting it wrong, though.\n\nIn FTL, you are being chased by the rebel army, which serves to set fire to your butthair. What sets that figurative fire here, if anything? Well, there are three unique factions on the map, each controlling a slice of it. These slices grow bigger with time. And the colored hexagons get more intense coloration. Very intense coloration = more random engagements. If you fail to collect all parts and return them to your ship in time, you stand no chance. And there's no upgrading on the go, either, not even equipping weapons you have found - you can only do so at camps, where you also buy stuff, repair and refuel. Finding top tier guns isn't going to be any help unless you manage to find a camp before you get destroyed. At the same time, there is no worry of spending scrap before jumping to store, since you literally can't.\n\nWhen it comes to events, FTL is a joke next to Convoy. The first thing that comes to mind is Fallout 3 vs New Vegas writing. Mechanically, in both games, the events provide fictional scenarios resolved by RNG, with some morals thrown in (being a mean person usually pays off in both). The writing though - in FTL, you randomly deliver parts for traders. In Convoy, you provide taxi service for hitchhikers who range from hippies looking to travel the wastes to dragon slayers looking to, well, kill a dragon (and kill a dragon you will), and you can shoot almost everyone you meet in the face.\n\nSo in short, how does Convoy compare to FTL? FTL is about forgetting to turn your oxygen back on, Convoy is about driving your cars into hoodoos. FTL is, I would say, more complex, but Convoy is more elegant, it puts everything into the movement which is much more intuitive and yet every bit as tactical, if not more. In terms of content, there is more to FTL, definitely, but to me it just feels that what Convoy offers is better, even if there's less of it. It's very much subjective which you would prefer, which is already quite monumental considering FTL is like, the ultimate game.\n\nI realize this is more of an analysis/comparison than a review, but it might be very helpful for coming FTL players which I believe you are if you're still reading this. So you're welcome.","December 3, 2015","true","20.6"," 260 of 277 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","260","277","13","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skitzoritz/recommended/318230/","skitzoritz","Nobu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skitzoritz/","111 products in account","I was one of the Kickstarter backers, I was very excited for another FTL experience. Unfortunately this is far shallower, and far less mentally rewarding.\n\nFTL had encapsulated skill, strategic choices, resource management, risk-assessment, fluid combat, prioritizing, transparency, compelling yet simple narrative, wealth of content, and no small degree of occasional panic. It's a fantastic game, and one that this game obviously aspires to be like. Convoy doesn't live up to the legacy, sadly.\n\nSkill does play a part in this game, but mostly it reflects itself in finding the most efficient way to shove someone in to a cliff. Which is good fun, the first fifty or so times.\n\nSadly, your choices can feel arbitrary or downright random, the same actions doing different things across the same play-through, interacting with the exact same NPC's in special events. After running into "plague guy" 3 times in the same play-through, it got extremely silly (Hilariously enough, this one has no random variance at all to it, even though it seems very risky. Silly, arbitrary.)\n\nResources are actually pretty annoying to manage, being unable to repair armor and health independently, I often end up at half armor capacity because I can't afford to drop another 30ish per vehicle to get armor topped off after a few run-ins with some cannons or plasma guns. You have NO indication at all of your fuel economy, and the lack of a world map makes long term planning very, very annoying due to inefficiency of the way point map system.\n\nRisk assessment is impossible: once you're in combat, you're stuck in, you can't leave even if you're stuck in a scenario where you can't hurt each other. For example, had a mine-laying enemy just drive at the front of my MCV which had no weapons, and kept dropping mines that did zero damage to my 100% resistant MCV. It wouldn't close the gap to finish the fight with its laser, so I had to quit out. From a game design standpoint, this is indicative of a huge balance problem.\n\nCombat is...messy, In some ways good, most bad. The explosive chaos is fun to watch, but sometimes the hitboxes escape the cars, or enemy vehicles both occupy the same hex (just decide to phase through solid matter, because that's fair), or the game loses track of who's where and everyone starts flying around like there's a huge tornado whipping through the battlefield. Having no control over your main ship is a huge waste of potential as well, but I'll save that for another day. The weapons fire slowly compared to hp totals, so combat can drag on, especially at low-levels. There's little strategic element to it, most combat being merely a dps race with some positioning shenanigans and ramming cheese. Fights are more often than not just gear checks, so you'll either stomp or get demolished.\n\nLikewise, your priority is always the same: kill the enemy with the least shields and biggest guns first, and road hazards aren't a risk at all: I love those skulls, they win me so many fights I would rather they showed an angelic choir instead. There's no true variance, because armor shredding weapons almost always do a heap of damage, and a machine at %1 hp fights just as well as one at %100 hp. In this regard it's a massive and disappointing departure from FTL.\n\nThe game also suffers from a transparency issue: No obvious hotkeys for MCV abilities, instead 1234 selects cars. The MCV abilities are labeled as 1234, so this feels stupid, and the cars aren't marked on the overview, so you're pretty much just reaching into a hat for on-the-fly selection. Some of the weapon descriptions are downright wrong, stating improper values or characteristics (heavy plasma comes to mind). You have no indication of weapon cool-downs on your vehicle, which makes deeper strategy impossible. Line of sight is a bit iffy as well, sometimes with a vehicle being able to squeeze shots around corners, sometimes not. No world map makes planning fuel more of a crap-shoot than it already is (with consumption rates being hidden). With dialogue being almost completely random, I've stopped doing more than skim because my choices feel insignificant.  Not being able to view vehicle stats outside of camp is stupid, stupid game design.\n\nThis game's narrative is run-of-the-mill, but the some of the writing feels like it was done by a few seventeen year-olds off of 4ch. Crammed with references and little actual content, it feels a bit like playing Fallout 2, only without the base narrative to support it. References should be used like sprinkles: Fallout 2 was over-sprinkled, sure, but the cupcake under it was great. This feels like making a cupcake entirely out of sprinkles. The references are cute the first time through, annoying after that.\n\nConvoy also has an issue with amount of content: you can expect to see every encounter and permutation of that encounter over just a few hours or so. With a lot of it being luck based, you generally just construct yourself an optimal choices flowchart and just don't even both with reading any of the boxes after a point.\n\nFTL invokes an immediate sense of panic: fire in oxygen supply, hull breach in weapons room, boarders trashing our engines, sickbay is offline and our shields are getting hammered with laser blasts and asteroids: what do you do?! Convoy invokes an annoying sense of dread: my vehicles are mostly unharmed, my MCV has 60% health, not much armor and I'm 100km from a camp after a single run in with a boss. My first thought: I'm dead. I can't mitigate all the damage going to my main unit, and two run ins with well-shielded raiders can very easily shred all the hp off it when they completely ignore the vehicles hammering on them to kill my main unit. The AI is spiteful and it's supposed to be difficult, but that makes no sense from a realistic perspective: when attacking a convoy, why attack the unarmed vehicle and ignore the lighter ones bristling with guns? When you attack a convoy are you throwing your life away to make the other guy "lose the game?" You're generally trying to rob it, not suicide bomb like you're trying to make the Emperor proud. It feels inelegant mostly because the MCV has the least ability to defray damage to it.\n\nAlso, bugs galore. Plague guy broken, found an infinite encounter loop with a repeating dialogue tree, previously mention vehicle bugs, getting robbed by Andy's goons puts you into negative 90k parts (instant loss with no way back), journal entries broken for duped quests, raider boss starting on a bridge with his reinforcement immediately tossing themselves off the cliff, EMP mines stunning instead of eating shields, ghost enemy vehicles following you around (!), 100% mine resist sometimes not working, stranded convoy asking for 30 fuel but the game wants 50... This was just in a few hours! This game is NOT ready for release from a bugfix standpoint.\n\nAnd just one word about insta-loss scenarios: It's hot! Your vehicle explodes! They're patching these out, but it begs the question: Who in their right mind thought this would ever be a good idea to put in the game?\n\nSo, all in all, this game is below average: buggy, unresponsive, insubstantial, and not very replayable. It's not a Roguelike at all, but a psedoRPG with some random encounter elements to it.\n\nIt has one saving grace: the boss is FUN! This is the only part that had me panicked and kept me on my toes. It really reminded me of FTL because he doesn't try to cheese you, and instead tries to pick you apart as you do the same to him. He feels FTL, and it makes the rest of the game feel all the shallower. (It's not fun when he chases you across savegames. Oh look, a bug.)\n\nSome might feel my frequent comparisons are unwarranted, but the makers were trying to make a comparably fun experience, and I feel it is warranted to draw comparisons. Or even required.\n\nThis game has a lot of heart, and still has potential to be good, but as it stands right now it gets a red thumb from me.","April 22, 2015","false","10.2"," 471 of 561 people (84%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","84","471","561","22","24"

Eventually, I stumbled upon this. This game has some pros and cons, but if you want the answer up front, I do reccommend it. It is fun, the events are amusing, and the battle mechanic is unique and similar to FTL. So if you like FTL or are just looking for a fun tactical roguelike game to play for a little while, I would highly reccommend this game.\n\nNow, the actual review. This game clearly took a lot of inspiration from FTL. It shares many of the same basic mechanics, even if many of them have their own unique twists. For those of you who don't know anything about the game, keep reading for a summary of the game. If you don't care, skip this paragraph to where the review starts. The game takes place in an apocalyptic wasteland, where you need to find suitable mechanisms to install on your broken down ship. In the game, you command a convoy of your MCV (Main Combat Vehicle), and up to four other vechicles. These drive around the wasteland, and you run into events and random encounters along the way.\n\nNow, I keep saying this, but it is worth mentioning: Everything is a spin-off of FTL, save a few minor features. The first things to talk about are the two recourses of the game: fuel and currency. In Mad Max, fuel meant survival. This rule of thumb carries over to this game, to an extent. Fuel is consumed as you move in the game. The game, however, is one big world map, compared to FTL, which had beacons. On the world map, the terrain varies from roads to ravaged lands to mine fields to cities. Your speed changes on all of these terrains, but fuel is consumed at the same rate. If you run out of fuel, you could be having to deal with hostile forces trying to scrap your convoy, or a walking engineer that will turn your crew into fuel, or you may just find a hidden fuel deposit in your MCV. Currency is achieved the same way, but sometimes at much quicker rates. You can play a game of chess with a guy, win the game by only moving your rook, and get 700 scrap (scrap is the currency in the game). This makes the game easier in the later part of the game.\n\nEvents are the next big thing. The good news is that there are a ton of varying events, and a ton of ways you can respond to the people you are forced to deal with in the wasteland. The bad news is that you have minimal to no control what events you encounter and how your response is taken. You can encounter the same event five different times in the same playthrough, answer the same way every time, and get five different results. This is good for the first few times, because it keeps you on the edge of your seat, and this is hypothetically good for the last few times, where if the events were not random in every way, you could just rig it every time to get the best result. This does get frustrating, however, where you search for an event, get the event after hours of playing your game, answer in all the right ways, and have it turn out that the odds are not in your favor that playthrough, and have to start over. This could be your thing, the risky nature of the game, and the idea that you are always gambling, and nothing is for sure, but it was not my thing, and after the few hours of playing this game nonstop, it got boring. It's like going to a casino, but instead of gambling money, you are gambling your time and patience, and instead of winning money, you are winning temporary satisfaction, just so it can be blown away when you die shortly after, because you spent all of your recourses chasing down that dream, with no escape plan for when it came true. To sum it all up, the event system, and how much you will enjoy it, are both gambles.\n\nNow, the best part: the combat system! If you have played Risk of Rain, the way you progress through it is similar to the way you progress through Convoy, but if you haven't played Risk of Rain, you should. But I will explain it anyway. In both Convoy and Risk of Rain, the battles get harder at the start, and then everything is dead easy. You get the good items, and the good vehicles, and things are upgraded, and you just don't die. Also, the pause mechanic carries over from FTL, which should always be used no matter what. So everything is really easy, and then you get cocky. And you die. Immediately. The mechanics of the combat system are that you have your four cars, and you basically play on a grid that is moving down a road, so the landscape is always changing, but your cars are keeping pace. The cars take up different numbers of squares on the grid, and you can move them to available spaces as it fits your needs. The MCV cannot move. Your cars and MCV are all armed with an array of weaponry, and each car and weapon has different stats (Health, Armor, Range, Mine Resistance, Handling, and maybe one other). These play into how your vehicles move, how much damage they deal, what they deal damage to (health or armor), how much damage they take, etc. If your MCV is destroyed, you lose.\n\nThere are sevaral different kinds of weapons; there are rapid fire weapons, rockets, cannons, lasers, melee weapons, and more. Each of these weapons have their own pros and cons, but the two things that make the combat system different from others is the line of sight mechanic, and the landscape. To fire a weapon, you need a line of sight, and the necessary range. This allows for your cars to form walls around your MCV, and allows you to come up with your own formations when an enemy is in one place, and a different formation when an enemy is in another. I enjoyed doing that, and there are sevaral, depending on what weaponry you are using. And the second thing that makes this mechanic unique is the moving map. There are times where you will be on a map, and a minefield pops up, or a rock. It is imperative you move your vehicles, lest they get destroyed. But, the only thing that is more important is making sure your enemies hit those obstacles. There are times where you will be so wrapped up in one corner of the map that you will just let your car run into a wall, and you will feel defeated. There are other times where you blockade four enemy vehicles to the edges of the map, and watch them helplessly drive off a cliff while you safely cross the bridge. Heh... Suckers. Enemies will also swerve to avoid mines, which your MCV can deploy. Will you make an enemy swerve away from a mine into a rock, or will you surround an enemy and pelt it with mines until it is dead and gone. There is a way to play the game where there is no strategy involved (one way of achieving this is by using only miniguns and chainsaws, and proceeding to use your imagination), but you can customize your vehicles in such a way that you will have winning strategies.\n\nNow, those were mainly pros, but there are some cons. First is that your Convoy eventually becomes the best it can be, and using those strategies that you formulated during the early and mid game are actually both more dangerous and more time consuming than just tanking your way through every situation. In FTL, you never really reached that point, because there was a time limit. Not in this game, though. Here, you can just waste away until you get the best everything, and then take down the big boss. The second main con is that the enemy doesn't use tactics and formations like you might. Instead, they start early game by swarming you with mediocre vehicles and cluttering the map, and they end in the late game by swarming you with slightly less mediocre vehicles and cluttering the map. Only bosses actually fight with some 'direction', if you will, and, like most bosses, they have four attacks that they just spam. So, to conclude, the battle system is cool, but redundant (just like the event system!!!)\n\nDespite all of this talk that makes the game feel so easy, I still have only won 20% of the games I have played. So, although redundant, it's fun but hard.\n\n7.5/10\n\n","August 2, 2015","true","14.5"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","30","35","2","1"

It reminds me a lot of FTL, complete with high learning curve. Convoy forces you to master the basics of the game and the importance of positioning your cars to the best possible location to take out the enemy. All while dodging enemy AOE attacks and giant lasers, as well as your own weapons. When I finally beat the game (On easy) it was the best feeling I've had after beating a game in a long time. The only downsides I have found so far is the fact that the map is always the same, which is understandable if a bit disappointing, and a lack of things to do. Even after a few hours of play I feel as if I've already seen about 80% of the game, and that isn't a good thing for this kind of game. I've ran into the same situation so many times I know the dialog tree that has the best possible outcome in it, and that stops making it fun.

Think FTL in a Max Max setting.    A very satisfying value while on 50% sale, but not at the full asking price. Several missed opportunities prevent this title from being an all-star, most notably the lack of content.\n\nPluses:\n+ Intriguing real-time tactical convoy-based combat.    You must maneuver your vehicles to protect your transport while giving them an optimal firing angle.\n+ Good battle pacing.  You *almost* have enough time to pay attention to everything, which brings to each fight just the right amount of harried eye-hand flicking.     (But see UX minus below)\n+ Varied vehicle builds.  You can build ramming tanks, light DPS machines, mine layers, and other configurations.\n+ Charming retro soundtrack.\n+ Witty writing and flavor text.   Some "choose your own adventure" gameplay that doesn't involve convoy combat.   Lots of geek references.\n\nMinuses (more of missed opportunities):\n+ Desperately needs more content.    There's only one base map which never changes, just the quest markers on top of it.   The 'randomized' quest comes from a small pool that will repeat often.\n+ UX and grpahics go a little too far into being retro, so that they don't provide the player with needed information.\n+ What's with the default resolution being boxed?  Yes, you can stretch to fullscreen, but then the retro graphics get really ugly.   Perhaps done for a future tablet port, which makes sense, but this choice cheapens the PC experience.\n+ RNG a bit too random, denying opportunities of player choice.   (You may never get a 3rd or 4th vehicle for your convoy due to chance, severely limiting your play.)   Some form of  crafting/salvage system would solve the random problem, and be very in-theme.","February 9","true","3.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","4"

It looks so excellent.\n\nThe writing in this game is nearly entirely references to other media. Sonic Screws, 1.2 GIGAWATTS, Murder Death Kill, Pylons, Power Overwhelming, Flux Capacitors, etc. It certainly feels like Convoy isn't willing to bring original ideas to the table. This sort of stuff is cute, when used very, very sparingly, but it shouldn't be the central fare of the game. I'm aware that I've had a limited time playing it myself, but in talking with others who have played it and watching LPs, it's pretty clear I didn't just have an odd streak of terrible writing.\n\nThe gameplay is ok, moving cars around is an exercise in frustration, as they'll sometimes move more than one car to the same space or move somewhere and display themselves in another. The weapons are good and punchy, but I found it difficult to assess their relative value.\n\nThe game's mechanics are archaic and far too detailed, making it very difficult to compare pieces of equipment or vehicles. (For example, 100 range == 1 box on the grid. Why not just use 1,2,3,4, etc.?)\n\nYour convoy retains the same formation it ended the previous fight with. Spent the last moments chasing down a raider and drew your vehicles off center? Hope you enjoy starting that way next fight. I know you just drove 200KM, but there's no ability to reposition your vehicles between fights.\n\nThe combat interface is missing some intuitive features -- you can select your cars with 1,2,3,4, but there's no numeral near their health bars to indicate which you'll get. When you use an MCV ability, it puts a 1,2,3,4 in the corner, but you can't select MCV abilities with 1,2,3,4. There's no way to view your vehicles out of combat (as far as I'm aware), and the results of combat tend to either be laughably easy or preposterously difficult.\n\nThe random encounters leave a lot to be desired. I ran into one, for example, where I saw a red barrel sitting a ways down the road. Taking the cautious approach, I decided to shoot it before we got any closer. The game laughed at me as it destroyed one of my vehicles, "What did you expect, shooting a red barrel!"\n\nThe different factions do have different flavors to their vehicles, which is a nice touch (the raiders, for instance, appear to have more but flimsier vehicles.)\n\nThere's a lot that makes me want to love this game -- the punchy audio absolutely melts into the rich visuals and the concept of a combat convoy roaming the desert is unique and compelling. But the game falls far short of its promise.","April 21, 2015","false","1.9"," 137 of 234 people (59%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","59","137","234","8","9"

After two more hours I had completed the main quest a second time, and had 59% of the achievements.\n\nPros:+Fun "roguelike-like" gameplay, every run will play out differently\n+Engaging combat, there's a lot happening, so the ability to pause and issue commands is something you use all the time\n+There's a lot of humour in this game, and I encountered a lot of enjoyable pop culture references\n+A very simple and quick to learn upgrading system that combined with the random weapons/support items you'll come across still gives you reason to plan out your upgrades and loadout\n\nCons:-Replayability isn't excellent. You will definitively want to play this a few times over, but after 10-15 or so hours, you've seen much of the game. I can see myself returning for a new run every now and then, but there's not enough content to have me playing 10 more hours with the same enjoyment the next time I launch the game.\n-Like many other rougelikes, it doesn't have a particularly deep story\n\nMain review:I was very curious about Convoy when I first found out about it, since I enjoy roguelikes, and the strategic vehicle combat seemed like a nice touch. I was lucky enough to get a review key for it, and after spending a bit more than 10 hours in the game, here are my thoughts:\n\nThe story is simple enough. Your spaceship has crashed, and you need parts for repairs, so you set out on an unknown planet to find the parts and get the spaceship operational again.\n\nFrom the map view, you plan on where to go next, either to your quest markers, camps (for shopping, upgrading and resupplies), or random encounters marked at the map. The locations of all of these are random each time you start a game (although the map structure: roads/mountains etc is always the same), and what happens at each place will also differ.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631616200\n\nSooner or later, you'll get into combat, and this is where you'll spend most of the time in Convoy. You have a main vehicle to protect, and you use smaller escort vehicles that you can command and attack the enemies with. The strategy you have to use differs, depending on what weapons and special items/abilities you manage to find during each run. If you find lots of weapons and extra escort vehicles, it's easier going full out, while a run where you're not so lucky will make you take a more cautious approach.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631616250\n\nThe combat is show from an aerial view, and most of the time you're best off pausing the game, issuing commands, selecting and aiming special attacks/abilities, then unpause to see the chaos unfold. Battles normally last between 30 seconds and two minutes, depending on how well equipped you are, and how many enemies you encounter, so it's quite fast-paced, and you'll see many battles when playing the game.\n\nRoaming the map, doing both main missions and sidequests, upgrading your vehicles and finding new ones can be a lot of fun. The upgrades are very basic, but together with the equippable weapons/abilities you can go for a certain approach, but towards the end of each game, chances are you've maxed many of the upgradeable skills for each vehicle, and swapped weapons/abilities for the best ones you could find during your run.\n\nThe random aspect of everything means you can't play the game the same time each run, you won't find the same things. One game I found no shields at all, and had to adjust how I engaged in battle according to that. This can sometimes be a bit frustrating, but as in all roguelikes, success isn't a guarantee.\n\nOne thing I enjoyed is all the pop culture references in the game. When you find different random encounters from the map, you will get a text conversation (no voice acting), where you'll often find something you might recognise from films, other games, books or TV shows. A nice touch that keeps you entertained.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631616347\n\nI had lots of good fun with the game, but after a while, I got the feeling I've seen most of it. You get some persistent "upgrades" (choice of starting vehicles) after completing certain goals, and that makes you come back for more, to a certain extent. I would love to see more content, with even more options for returning players. A shop allowing you to tailor your starting convoy with exactly the vehicles and loadouts you wanted, where you would afford a more expensive convoy the more times you've played the game (with modifiers for difficulty, achievements etc) would have been very nice.\n\nStill, it was a very enjoyable game, so if you know (or think!) roguelikes and strategic combat is your thing, you would probably enjoy your time with Convoy!","February 24","true","14.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","2"

Well, you're in luck because they had sex and produced the two-headed, roguelike love child that is Convoy.\n\nThe game is set on a post-apocalyptic world where 80's and 90's film and television references pepper the skies. Your ship has crash landed and you're tasked with finding replacement parts to get the old girl flying again. This puts you in charge of the MCV and two combat vehicles, making up your convoy. Your convoy crawls across the map chasing down leads and getting into trouble. You can upgrade your vehicles with new weapons and equipment and even purchase more vehicles to add to your convoy. You must protect your MCV at all costs, for once it's destroyed the game is over.\n\nWhen you get right down to it, Convoy plays very much like FTL. The difference is Convoy gives you more tools to help you determine your fate. You can manoeuvre your vehicles into cover or out of the range of your enemy's guns, spend extra fuel to escape ambushes you don't think you can win and you can track down a camp at any time outside of combat in order to repair and refuel. This doesn't mean the game is easy by any stretch of the imagination, over confidence is the biggest killer out in the wasteland and sometimes you'll find yourself in situations where you just can't avoid losing one of your vehicles. All in all, the best weapon you have in Convoy is being prepared.\n\nThe Good\n\nYou're presented with a lot of options throughout your travels. Maybe one of the factions hires you to transport a crate for them. Will you deliver it no questions asked or look inside? It turns out the crate is holding a shipment of undernourished slaves. Will you set them free, make them work in your convoy or put them back in the crate and sell them on the black market. All options are viable and not at all bound to a linear morality system. The choice is entirely yours to be noble, pragmatic or sinister. Furthermore, almost all interactions with NPC's allow you to shoot first and ask questions later or not ask questions at all. This is really where Convoy shines, its no-holes-bared willingness to let you be a complete and utter d@#k to everyone around you.\nBosses take the form of enemy MCV's or giant flying machines of death. So long as you make liberal use of the pause button, though, the boss fights aren’t infuriatingly difficult, you always feel like you have a chance. But if you're not prepared and the enemy starts attacking your MVC on low health it's all over.\nAs stated above, Convoy is littered with film and television references. While some might find it cheese or cheap, I personally enjoy that style of writing a great deal. It's a game that wears its influences on its sleeve and, as a fan of those influences, I'm A-ok with that.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe game has bugs. Nothing game-breaking, but it is a nuisance nonetheless. Sometimes the UI will freak out and overlap on itself or if your MCV is destroyed a moment after you defeat an enemy the game will keep going even though you can't actually do anything without the MCV. Restarting the game seems to fix these issues, but it is a mark against the overall polish of the game.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nBugs, bugs, bugs...\nThere are a lot of customisation options for your vehicles. Different guns do different things and fire in different ways and with different arcs and line of sight requirements. You can even turn your MCV into a glorious, throbbing weapons platform of death!\nMore MCV and side vehicle options and variants can be unlocked by reaching certain milestones in the game.\nThe game can get quite dark in places, especially if you're selling slaves or shooting innocent people. Something to be wary of, if you're soft and sensitive.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll that being said, I've had a lot fun with Convoy. It's a great concept and I'm thrilled that games like this are being made.\nIf you enjoyed FTL and like the idea of that concept being translated to ground vehicles, or if you're a Mad Max junkie and you enjoy tactical roguelikes, you might want to have a look at Convoy.\nAs the bugs aren't game-breaking I have no problem recommending the game, but do keep in mind that you are likely to come across annoying little hiccups here and there. So, if that kind of thing really bothers you, you might want to wait until they're patched out before buying the game.\n\nFor more reviews, gameplay videos and shenanigans visit  The Roleplay Gamer  YouTube channel.","April 21, 2015","true","17.1"," 45 of 72 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","45","72","5","4"

One large transport vehicle capable of carrying the supplies your ship will need to repair, a pair of smaller escorts, and a few leads on the major components you need. Now, go out into the world, and either return with the items needed to repair your ship, or die in the process.\n\nThis was a really simple game to get into, just like FTL, and also like FTL, it is difficult to master. All of the locations on the global map are randomized, featuring settlements (where you can stop for much needed repairs, but new items to equip your vehicles, and something even a new vehicle itself), distress beacons (which can be good, bad, or worse), and random encounters (again, can be good, bad, or worse).\n\nQuite a few of the distress beacons and encounters can provide you with side missions to complete, which in turn can provide you with bonus weapons, or extra vehicles for your convoy. Excluding your cargo transport, you can have a maximum of 4 vehicles to protect your convoy. That said, I have seen screenshots of people with more, but I believe that is from a mod.\n\nFor being so simple, this game is highly addictive.

I can envision Mad Max in all his glory with every explosion! :)\n\nWhile the combat it fun, the vehicle upgrades are goal-oriented and the sheer amount of primary objectives and side quests keep it interesting my favorite part of it is the randomness. Random encounters, random loot.... you can't head in any direction without bumping into something or someone which could be both beneficial or deadly depending on your luck. Your choice of responses to encounters often produce very random and unexpected results.\n\nI like the level of detail into the back story for not only your own crew but for all the warring factions and even some of the NPC's that you encounter along the way. My first objective brought me to Andy who after completing the objective joins your convoy and he has a badass vehicle!\n\nI found the tutorial was heavily focused on the combat aspect of the game and as a result I had a hard time figuring out how to repair my vehicles once hitting a camp. I also found I was slow to upgrade my vehicles as most of my currency (bolts) was being eaten up from repairing combat damage. You also need to keep an eye on your gas supply or you could leave yourself stranded in the middle of nowhere and find your convoy vulnerable to attack.\n\nOverall I very much enjoy this game. I write this review after just having been blown away by a large gang that clearly had me outmatched. Having learned from my mistakes I'm planning on starting over and altering my strategies.\n\nGreat game!","February 25","true","3.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Convoy is not so bad, but it could have been better (a classic). After 7-8 hours of playing there is an high chance that you will leave it, it just becomes a bit repetitive. I practically know all the quests, weapons, items, vehicles etc. and i am that kind of player that plays only during the weekends for a few hours. Also the map is not so random like i hoped (its shape is always the same, only the quests and camps changes locations).\nHowever fighting and trashing the enemy vehicles is fun, at least...\nConvoy is like the youngest brother of FTL, with a great potential but it still needs to grow up, it needs some more contents.

I like the fact that you can steadily improve upon your convoy as you go...though you can lose it all in a blink of an eye.  Therein lies my sole complaint...even on "easy", the game can punish you mercilessly.  For example, you could be wondering along a road when an unskippable, unavoidable event takes out one of your buggies.  I can see if this were a thing on "medium" or "hard", but on "easy"...ouch!  There are also insta-kill canyon walls/structures that pop up during battle that, if you're not careful, can wipe out your support buggies with no way to retrieve them afterwards.  "FTL" is admittedly no stranger to difficult encounters, but I felt like I had less control over my destiny while playing "Convoy".  This randomness could very well be what the developers of "Convoy" intended, but I think "easy" could be scaled back a bit for the sake of casual players like myself who just want to have fun.  Other than that, the game is fairly enjoyable, what with its various sci-fi references and "choose your own adventure" dialogue style.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHb_TvmNuZY\n\n---\n\nPreview Build Videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqb6nGL-DCI\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3QZQ1r67Pk","April 21, 2015","true","3.8"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","0"

On a rough mad-max style/fallout style world you must collect certain items to repair your starship and get off the planet.  Sort of like that Pikmin game, only with more violence.\n\nThe combat is much more position oriented, and you can outfit each of your vehicles with new weapons and gear.  You move your vehicles around avoiding obstacles and pushing other vehicles into obstacles.  Again, positioning is crucial.\n\nThere's no real 'rebel fleet' to run from in this game, but encounters do seem to get more difficult as time goes on.  You can choose to go after the objectives in any order.\n\nThe boss fights in the game are pretty well designed, with the final boss being an extreme challenge, giving the mothership from FTL a real run for its money.\n\nThe music in the game is top notch, and the graphics are very functional, sort of like a cherished lost game from the early 90s.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend the game, it's a little on the difficult side at first, but things become clearer with additional playthroughs.","April 22, 2015","true","10.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It's The Bugs.\n\nI know that the Devs are working hard on these bugs and i will probably edit my review accordingly.\n\nGame Play\nThe setting for the game: Your ship is broken and has to emergency land on a Wasteland planet. You are tasked with searching and acquiring the parts for the ship, along with a few other members of your group. You travel across the planet battling enemies and doing tasks for people to get the parts you need or the money to get them.\n\nYou control a  Convoy  of cars across a desert, the game is mostly mouse orientated, and has a FTL: Faster Than Light feel to it, random encounters, factions and shops even Tonnes of extra weapons that you can equip to your ship.

From what I've personally seen, exiting the game causes your units to multiply, for some that can be very helpful but it gets out of hand when you have 40+ units. Another Bug is particle effects, when you are driving, there is an effect to the back of the wheels, a dust type effect, once you go into the map it is still there, and even in the shops.\n\nTl;dr\nA fun game, If you can avoid the bugs. would get if on sale","May 20, 2015","false","2.7"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","11","16","2","0"

I came as a big fan of FTL, and while I found some issues, Convoy is a resoundingly successful, innovative, and fun experience.\n\nIn many ways, it doubles-down on the original formula: exquisite levels of immersion are reinforced with well-written mini-text adventures for encounters.  The map is designed to be open-world, allowing the player to make decisions on-the-fly in any order they desire.  The dynamic music is absolutely thrilling, and amassing strength feels great.\n\nHowever, with its changes come shortfalls.  Games longer than in FTL, and on non-Easy difficulties, grinding and running out of fuel become events that happen all too often.  It inhibits the player from advancing in an already long game.\n\nSomething else you might balk at is the micromanagement necessary for combat.  Though there is a pause feature, it can be overwhelming to perform many necessary actions simultaneously.  But this becomes less of a problem with practice - though the final boss is extremely difficult regardless.\n\nI am so happy to have bought Convoy, and though the higher difficulties make for a grueling playthrough, this is one of my favorite games.","January 16","true","20.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Yes it takes a lot of directon from FTL and it does an ok job of mimicing the style. However, for people who havn't played FTL then I would suggest playing it if you think you'll like it.(if you're on the fence just go play FTL cause it's much better)\n\nHowever what this game lacks is the same, I'm gunna say, detail that FTL had. FTL was vastly more focused in the strategy of combat than this game. WIth Convoy you have what you have, and if it's inferior to the enemy then you're screwed. With FTL they really grasped that conflict of weakness and strength. If I knew I couldn't out gun an enemy, I had the choice to power down my weapons and focus on defense, or I could chose to power down my engine and add my third weapon to help defeat the enemy.\n\nEvery situation had some kind of "positive" result that could be encountered. I chould choose to run if I knew I wasn't going to win the fight. And Convoy lacks that freedom of choice. I was playing through a mission set, and I was dominating every battle I got into while driving towards a goal point. However when I got there I realized that my set wasn't gunna cut it with the three round fight hta I had before me. So I had to sit and watch the game end. This kind of a challenge isn't a bad thing FTL had it with the boss fight, however it takes so much longer to do stuff in Convoy that when this happens it just ruins all the time you spent playing.\n\nThere's also no means of changing style within combat as well. With FTL, I could switch out weapon types depending on the needs of the fight. This ship has high shields, so I should equip a bomb weapon to bypass that, and not use my beams. That logic doesn't come into play with Convoy. Every defeat I saw during my play time was because I was outnumbered, not because I had a crappy weapon set. All of the changing of styles hads to come outside of battle when you get to a camp, and because of the vast difference in styles to play, there's no way to pinpoint a "jack of all trades" style.\n\nThat for me turned me off of the game after only 2 hours of playing(compared to the 200+ hours I've sunk into FTL). Now with that all said. In Convoy's own rights its still a pretty good game. If I hadn't played FTL then I would have enjoyed it more, but I have so I didn't. It was like playing the last Borderlands game, while it was good, it wasn't as good as it would have been had I not played the 2nd game first.","December 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 28 of 53 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","28","53","0","0"

It doesn't actually need a lot, but the issues that it has keep it from being a game that I want to come back to, like FTL.\n\nI'm not going to repeat the overview of the game, since everyone's already done that, but here's my main points.\n\nGame is too hard, for the wrong reasons. Fuel is used in a way that will either bankrupt you, or leave you stranded. It starts you off with terrible cars, and you have to fully repair after each combat or else you're screwed. On normal (which is what I play and should be the most balanced), you frequently lose within two steps of any mission. Compare this to FTL, where on the median worst playthough, you can at least get through about half the sectors.\n\nCombat has great potential and is probably the best part of the game, but aside from dodging enviro hazards, feels far too shallow.\n\nOn the plus side, most of the game is well built technically, and art, animations, etc are fine. There is a little issue with ambiguity in the UI, but it's not awful.\n\nI don't think this game deserves a Very Positive right now, maybe a positive/slightly positive. It definitely deserves the ~70 metacritic score that it has. With some easy tweeking by the devs though, it can be much better, and more worthy of very positive, and if it does, I'll change this to a reccommend, but as of now, it's not an enjoyable enough game to play over, say, FTL or another challenging roguelike.","May 10, 2015","false","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

From this humble group, you can wander around, complete missions, buy stuff, add new trucks, upgrade your vehicles, and eventually find all the parts you need to fix the ship and leave the planet.\n\nConvoy has a similar to narrative-driven mission system as FTL. You have random encounters and encounters you can drive to on the map. All of the story points in these are driven through narrative choice, giving you a sense of agency in the game. The story points were cute and fun, and I have to assume have an element of randomness to the results. In one game, you choose option A, in another you choose option A again and perhaps get a different result.\n\nUnlike FTL where you're constantly moving right and difficulty scaling the further right you go, Convoy is more open world. This makes the progression feel less fun overall and focuses that progression solely on your convoy. The difficulty didn't feel to scale very well either, but that might change with subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe combat system is where Convoy vastly differs from FTL. Instead of a static ship to ship interface with your little dudes moving around the ship fixing and working systems, you have little trucks that move around the map, shooting and ramming things, and environmental hazards along the way while the combat always is moving to the right. It's a good idea and well executed, but outside of a select boss fight or two, even on one playthrough the combat got super repetitive.\n\nAt the point of this review, I played about 2 hours, only 1 game, and beat the scenario on Easy during that playthrough. For comparison's sake, FTL on easy took me about 70 hours to finally beat once. I'm sure the game is much more difficult on harder levels, but similar to FTL scaling difficulty just means fewer resources, maybe a bit harder of enemies, but nothing more interesting.\n\nI enjoyed my playthrough. I'm not sure there's enough content to keep me interested in achievement-based unlocks, which is all of the progression left in the game after you beat it: be able to start with a different core unit and different trucks. I don't believe the core 4 missions change at all.\n\nI enjoyed it. It's a fun experience. This will definitely get a lot better with more variety, and I will definitely come back to it in the future.","April 21, 2015","true","2.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

That's the definition of a rogue-like game I know but Convoy does it very well. The mix between the genre and the future post-apocalyptic setting (Mad Max) works wonders, you feel you're in danger all the time. It keeps you on your toes by providing a lot of thrilling moments. Events happen at any given time, how to react, what's the outcome, that depends (almost) entirely on you and your decisions. I would like to point out that it is an extremely difficult game to get on to (apparently they are lowering the difficulty of some events in a patch), just to give you an example, after the tutorial I managed to be defeated 3 times in about 30 min (I'm also a terrible gamer). A last word to the fighting mode, it's immensely fun and still very tactical.\n\nIf you wish to see it in action you're more than welcome to check this video (warning: it's a let's play, not a review, please bear that in mind before clicking):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a15dTVrDXk","April 21, 2015","true","12.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

You have a main 'transport vehicle' with support items typically, and then you collect other smaller battle vehicles to protect yourself.  Your mission is drive around on a map finding parts for your broken spaceship and fighting or bartering with other forces on the planet. Customization feels a little low. There are linear upgrades for your units, and a selection of different weapons.  The reason I don't recomend this is the combat. It feels so... loose? Like the opposite of FTL where you know what your weapons can do, what the enemies weapons can do, and how to effectively use them or try and counter the enemy.\n\nIn convoy the weapons just seem to range from "this is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ starter weapon" to "oh yeah this kills things good". Yes, this one weapon might do more armor damage over another but honestly it's all irelevant. You just find the biggest weapon you can put on things and go with it. You can move your smaller battle cars around on the map but it's also very straightfoward and unrewarding. Move them into firing range, don't let them crash into cliffs. Focus fire on enemies.\n\nThe writing is pretty bad. It tends to range from boring to "ha ha LOOK A REALLY BLATANT REFERENCE, ARENT WE CLEVER?"\n\nOverall convoy isn't a terrible game, but you aren't missing anything but skipping over it.","August 15, 2015","false","2.4"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

Most of the time, any choice made for the smallr, more common events seem to have little effect, and the larger, more detailed ones usually have a consitent path to follow for the best result.\n\nAdditionally, once your vehicles are decently upgraded, the gameplay becomes a little too easy (but this may be fixed by playing on the hardest difficulty).\n\nIn my opinion, it just doesn't have enough replayability, but it's still fun to waste a few hours with, especially if you like a mix of Mad Max and FTL.","May 26","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After completing the game on easy/normal (6 hours) i feel like i've seen everything about it. Once you know what you are doing the game even feels really easy maybe playing on hard would fix that feeling.\n\nThe thing is the core mechanics of the game gets "boring" really fast as there is not much thinking for every fights except dodging rocks/mines and destroying opponents one after another. Offense is really much more rewarding than defense so you end up smashing every unit with your whole force before going for the next.\n\nWhen i compare this game to a "rogue like" like FTL it feels really underwhelming. You may move "freely" on the map but it feels no different than going from waypoint A to B to CAMP to C to D to camp to ... (Z).\nIn FTL your playthrough might change a lot depending on your chosen ship, in Convoy unblocking MVC just make your begining easier the rest feels unchanged. Variety in missions helps a bit but not enough to make another playthrough interesting.\n\nAll in all it's a fun game while it last. I might play another run on hard but i'm pretty sure after that i won't touch the game ever again wich is kinda sad.

But it cries out as a roguelike the loudest. If you lose a vehicle it is GONE. There is no way to recover it, hope you get a chance to buy another. If your MCV is destroyed, it's game over. There is no save point. You have to start over.

The graphics and gameplay of FTL, which I am a big fan of, and the plot of a Mad Max movie. The vechicular combat is enjoyable and the strageties that you can employ are varied. Set up your crews cars with many different guns and utility items and rush into combat. The constantly moving battlefield is a great setup, as you'll have to dodge rocks, mines and rock walls. Ramming enemy cars into those things are a blast too.\n\nThe problem I have with this game is that it constantly freezes. I'll get stuck in a message telling me what loot I've earned from the previous battle. I'll click the command that lets me move on and it will deposit the rewards into my holdings, but the message doesn't go away and I cannot continue playing. If I'm lucky I'll quit the game and it will pick up where I left off or right before. Other times it'll still be stuck and I have to discard my progress and start a new game. If you're about it you can sit there and collect the loot over and over and after you max out fuel and scrap you can try and quit. If it works you'll have so much resources you won't know what to do with them! But what's the point of the game if you do that? It removes all the fun. I've been playing for about 5 hours now, 4 separate games, and I've lost once. The rest of the times I had to restart my progress because of bugs.\n\nI'm running a AMD 6-core, Radeon HD 6800 and 8Gb of RAM. No reason to have the freezing and some framerate issues that I've seen.\n\nI like this game, and if you enjoy FTL you will too, but it needs some patching to take care of some of the bugs.\n\nEDIT: Hours later and I have successfully beaten the game on easy mode. Unfortunately I feel that I have to change my reccommendation of the game to a thumbs down. This is due to the fact that the game just does not run properly. Not only did I have the same problem that I described when I first reviewed the game, but there were multiple times during my playthrough that when I selected a dialouge choice nothing happened no matter how many times I click and had to pick the choice I didn't want in the end anyways. Other times I didn't receive rewards for completing a mission. They were displayed, and I had a choice to either not take them or abandon a weapon I already had. Even worse is when I would discard one of my weapons to free up space and the game still didn't give me my reward, effectively making me lose two good items at once because a game bug. After many,MANY times having to save, quit out and continue the game I finally made my way back to the homeworld ship that I had been repairing the entire game. I encounted the final boss in a truely excellent battle that had me thinking "Good thing I stuck it out. This is great fun!" I lost all but one of my weaponized cars in the battle and my MRV had no armor to spare. I clicked on the last dialouge option the said I was leaving the planet. However, the ending credits did not roll when they were supposed to. Instead I was dropped back down on the map and charged by a duplicate final boss? I had to beat the ending boss AGAIN with far less resources to do with. I barely pulled it off in the end, and after winning a second time I was awarded with achievements for completing the game and was treated to the credits.\n\nGames like this are meant to be hard. Perma-death and a high difficulty is part of the charm and adds to the replayability of the game. However when you cannot complete a game most of the time because the game is a buggy mess I can't consider it a good game any longer. I did play through most of the sidequests in the game and bested one of the three mini-bosses. If I had not beaten that boss the second time I'm sure I would have been much more frustrated.\n\nIn short I like the game, but it's a buggy mess with gamebreaking issues. If they patch the game and improve I'll be sure to update my opinion, but until then unfortunately can't reccommend Convoy.","June 7, 2015","false","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That's from the game crashing, entering into unending event loop or the inability to load a saved game.  23 minutes into my game play I was compelled to visit the forums, and the answer was to submit error logs.  2 and a half hours of gameplay later and roughly half of the games ending due to bugs.\n\nKnowing what my experience has been, I would not buy this game again.","June 3, 2015","false","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics and gameplay of FTL, which I am a big fan of, and the plot of a Mad Max movie. The vechicular combat is enjoyable and the strageties that you can employ are varied. Set up your crews cars with many different guns and utility items and rush into combat. The constantly moving battlefield is a great setup, as you'll have to dodge rocks, mines and rock walls. Ramming enemy cars into those things are a blast too.\n\nThe problem I have with this game is that it constantly freezes. I'll get stuck in a message telling me what loot I've earned from the previous battle. I'll click the command that lets me move on and it will deposit the rewards into my holdings, but the message doesn't go away and I cannot continue playing. If I'm lucky I'll quit the game and it will pick up where I left off or right before. Other times it'll still be stuck and I have to discard my progress and start a new game. If you're about it you can sit there and collect the loot over and over and after you max out fuel and scrap you can try and quit. If it works you'll have so much resources you won't know what to do with them! But what's the point of the game if you do that? It removes all the fun. I've been playing for about 5 hours now, 4 separate games, and I've lost once. The rest of the times I had to restart my progress because of bugs.\n\nI'm running a AMD 6-core, Radeon HD 6800 and 8Gb of RAM. No reason to have the freezing and some framerate issues that I've seen.\n\nI like this game, and if you enjoy FTL you will too, but it needs some patching to take care of some of the bugs.\n\nEDIT: Hours later and I have successfully beaten the game on easy mode. Unfortunately I feel that I have to change my reccommendation of the game to a thumbs down. This is due to the fact that the game just does not run properly. Not only did I have the same problem that I described when I first reviewed the game, but there were multiple times during my playthrough that when I selected a dialouge choice nothing happened no matter how many times I click and had to pick the choice I didn't want in the end anyways. Other times I didn't receive rewards for completing a mission. They were displayed, and I had a choice to either not take them or abandon a weapon I already had. Even worse is when I would discard one of my weapons to free up space and the game still didn't give me my reward, effectively making me lose two good items at once because a game bug. After many,MANY times having to save, quit out and continue the game I finally made my way back to the homeworld ship that I had been repairing the entire game. I encounted the final boss in a truely excellent battle that had me thinking "Good thing I stuck it out. This is great fun!" I lost all but one of my weaponized cars in the battle and my MRV had no armor to spare. I clicked on the last dialouge option the said I was leaving the planet. However, the ending credits did not roll when they were supposed to. Instead I was dropped back down on the map and charged by a duplicate final boss? I had to beat the ending boss AGAIN with far less resources to do with. I barely pulled it off in the end, and after winning a second time I was awarded with achievements for completing the game and was treated to the credits.\n\nGames like this are meant to be hard. Perma-death and a high difficulty is part of the charm and adds to the replayability of the game. However when you cannot complete a game most of the time because the game is a buggy mess I can't consider it a good game any longer. I did play through most of the sidequests in the game and bested one of the three mini-bosses. If I had not beaten that boss the second time I'm sure I would have been much more frustrated.\n\nIn short I like the game, but it's a buggy mess with gamebreaking issues. If they patch the game and improve I'll be sure to update my opinion, but until then unfortunately can't reccommend Convoy.","June 7, 2015","false","17.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is still in it's early stages, still getting updates, and unlike FTL, it has a steam workshop for mods. Has a huge amount of potential, and if you can't wait, get a mod. Although, the community is smaller than some, so finding many mods will be hard. It has a  certain RTS feeling to it, when your convoy vehicles speak to each movement command and selection. The RPG stlye of FTL's weapon system and the unique pausing, turns into a RTS fight system, still with the pausing. You can challange yourself to do certain things to make the gameplay harder, and there are even achievements for them. As I said before, it has a huge amount of potential. Not sure what the devs are planning, but there can be more: events, vehicles, weapons, enemies, maybe a new map, and basically anything. It still feels like a "polished" game, a glitch here or there, but the devs are working on it.

Shops where you can repair and buy stuff are shown on the map the whole game and you can visit them whenever you want. There's no random chance to miss for weapons. Loot is fairly consistent and there aren't many instances of "must have" items where you restart if you don't find them (crew teleporter in FTL).\n\nCons: The combat is much, much more tedious than FTL. FTL had a cool Wrath of Kahn feel to it. The combat in Convoy is mostly just watching vehicles plink away at each other's health bars. You order a vehicle where to move, and who to shoot at. That's it. You can try ramming people into the path of oncoming rocks to crash into, but it's so hard to do and the payoff so small that you don't bother. Buy the highest dps guns you can, upgrade your range stat, and that's it. There's no real variety to the weapons either. They all have the same range and no unique properties. All you care about is the dps stat.\n\nAnother flaw they imported from FTL is a frustrating final boss battle that's 20 times harder than any previous fight and you need to learn the "trick" to beating him. You can breeze through every fight in the game (even the mini-boss) without a scratch but still get slaughtered by the final boss. It starts to feel like the final boss is the only real challenge and the hour you spend getting up to him is just a filler waste of time to get another shot at it.\n\n\nIn the end, Convoy takes the FTL experience and does away with the harsh RNG but at the cost of interesting combat. Watch a Youtube video of just how simple and tedious the combat is.

In fact, the theme is a crashed space vessel (FTL), salvaging for repairs (FTL), and collecting guns and drones to help (FTL).\n- Drab story, alond with tedious bumps and missions with more bumps to slow you down.\n- Repetitive with no real replay value to show for.\n\nConclusionSave your money on this one. If you are an FTL fan, you'll be very miffed by the similarities and if you are not, you may reach a half hour in and quit to never play again.

I think it's a tall order to beat Normal and Hard at this point, and I'm sure it will be adjusted over time. The damage you do to enemies and the battle rewards are simply too low to be feasible.  But don't let that deter you---each and every playthrough, whether I've won or not, has been addicting and genuinely fun. I always come back for more.

Maybe not, but if FTL left you wanting more rouge-like-like action, this game definitely fills the gap.\nThe combat is fun, I wouldn't call it amazing but it's defintely fun still. Especially the smug satisfaction you get from ramming an enemy armored car that's been giving you trouble off a cliff and into oblivion. Like FTL it's real time action with a pause, which I personally enjoy alot as it feels more fast paced than a turn-based game but still gives you enough time to think and manage rather turning into a reaction time test like in some RTS games.\n\nThere are a wide range of scenarios with a wide array of possible outcomes depening on your choices and sometimes the whims of the Random Number God, some short, some long, all generally well thought out. No problems here.\n\nThere have been a good number of bugs, but the developers have responded very quickly to bug reports and feedbacks. Notably the lack of V-Sync support has been fixed, and the randomness of the game has been given a hefty nerf after complaints about random events taking out vehicles without warning, which would basically mean a loss. This is no longer the case, fortunately.\n\nThe games biggest failling is it's writing. Instead of taking you to another world with it's refined finesse, it seems to throw  as many unsubtle references in as it possibly can, like a kid shouting 'THE CAKE IS A LIE!' in an attempt to look cool. We all love a good reference devs, and especially a salute to Terry Pratchett, but only when they are more rare and subtle. Having them in every other sentence just takes you out of the game.\n\ntl;dr\nThe game isn't perfect, but this first release from the indie company Convoy Games will provide you with plenty of hours of fun for your £10 if you don't mind having to endure some clumsy writing. An easy reccomendation for me.","April 22, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then I started getting good at the fights, took more care in prowling around the map, and started making real progress - though ultimately still getting horribly wasted at some point - and began to think, hey, actually, maybe this *is* a game for me. But then after twenty or so tries I finally built a fully-escorted fully-upgraded fully-armed convoy team and got all the items and then, of course, hit the final boss and, ugh, no, this is not my kind of game. I know there's plenty of gamers out there who are, above all things, into brutal final boss fights that go on forever with like twenty different phases of all-new brutality, but I'm not one of them.\n\nEDIT: Changed my thumb from down to up after playing one more game.

Thankfully, the frustration you go through can eventually pay off with the numerous things to unlock. Your main convoy vehicle (MCV) can be changed if you unlock the others.

You're probably going to like Convoy.\n\nThe overworld is a risk/reward game, in terms of balancing fuel stores, unit status, distance to bases where you can repair / refuel, and relative 'danger' of different territories and factions - play it safe and stay on the road? Or risk investigating that distress signal deep in Raider-controlled mountains?\n\nThe battle system is like an action-packed mini-RTS - there's just enough to micromanage that you stay frantic the whole time, but not so much that you feel overwhelmed. Assigning targets for three of your units, then microing the fourth to recklessly ram another enemy to run it off the road and into the minefield, while firing off your own defensive laser superweapon and stunning EMP blasts, basically an ongoing triage that makes each battle pretty freaking thrilling.\n\nEasy to get started on, but very very difficult to master, very Roguelike in its own way (weapons and their capabilities are a complete mystery at the beginning of the game, as are factions and the riskiness of each encounter, and everything is shuffled up in a sufficiently procedural way so as to keep each playthrough fresh-feeling) and very very satisfying if you're into that sort of thing.","May 8, 2015","true","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When I saw the kickstarter I was a little intimidated by the seeming complexity of interface, but I found it simple to jump in and start playing. Most of what needed to be figured out I was able to get a handle on in the first 20 minutes. While the game starts off being mostly resource management, it quickly switches gears to exploration and powering up your convoy about midway through your first playthrough.\n\nThe graphics are a bit lackluster and they don’t really get across the wild atmosphere the rest of the game is striving for. The grayscale hex based landscape feels more like you are exploring a desolate moon rather than the psycho-punk desert wasteland described in the text.\n\nSpeaking of which, while I hate reading walls of text, they weren’t a problem here. Most of the text is short and to the point.\n\nTotal playtime will run you maybe 6 hours to beating it on easy, and 30 hours to completing most of the challenges.

It is well-made, with lots of attention to detail including many sci-fi homages.\n\nUnlike FTL, the challenge doesn't come from fighting fires and redistributing power, but instead moving your vehicles around in the tactical space to ensure line of sight and blocking as you protect your MCV. You also don't appear to be under any time constraints--you aren't being chased. It gives you plenty of time to explore without making the game overly easy.\n\nDefinitely worth a purchase if you are a fan of FTL.","April 24, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Convoy is oozing with pop-culture reference in an oddly charming way, as they really do feel like they've been written in by someone with a great affection for the source materials. Some of the writing even had me reading dialogue in the voices of original characters.\n\nMuch like FTL, there is a surprising amount of depth to the seemingly simple mechanics, and for me, at least, it scratches that same itch, but I've always been a fan of vehicular combat over ship combat, so maybe you'll take something different away from your experience.\n\nI love the unlocks, the random events, the snippets of detail, even getting owned by RNGeezus from time to time, it all comes together to provide a rewarding and addictive experience, even in spite of the occasional bugs. From what I've seen, though, many bugs get squashed pretty quick, and I'm desperately anxious to see what the community can do in terms of mods, or an official expansion somewhere down the road.\n\nIf you want a perfectly polished experience, you might consider waiting until some of the post-launch teething problems have been, but if you're looking for the kind of indie strategy game that never lets you rest on your laurels, then I strongly suggest you give Convoy a try.","April 24, 2015","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not only that, but it was my first Kickstarter that I supported so this game will always have a special place in my library of games. Anyway on to the review... The pitch of this game was that this was FTL on wheels with an open world aspect. As someone who put in more than 200 hours into FTL I was sold  on the idea within the first few minutes.\n\nI believe that you will have a different experience depending on whether or not you have played FTL. If you have not played FTL than I think you will find this game very difficult but also very enjoyable. If you have played FTL, you will find this game to be easy (if you have beat FTL a few times already) but definitely not as great as FTL. FTL had a lot more depth to the game. Unfortunately this game is only a shell of what FTL is, for now. On the plus side the devs have been very active and posted 3 different patches within the first week of launch.\n\nOverall though I'm still proud that I backed this project, and I still have fun with this game. I just won't play it for 200 hours like I did with FTL.","April 30, 2015","true","46.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a mix of two amazing things, Mad Max and FTL. A lot of it's mechanics come from FTL, but it puts a spin on it that works so well. The movement in the battles works so fluidly, especially with the pause-whenever mechanic. Very micro-managey, but not so much that it feels overwhelming , even with 4 cars being controlled at once. It's very fair, which is how a game should be. It's mean, but it's fair. Anytime you loose, it wasn't because you were underpowered, or the enemy was overpowered, it was because YOU weren't prepared, YOU weren't fast enough, YOU weren't good enough.\n\nThe upgrade system is good. The weapon choices are kind of small, but that's excusable, since the game only came out a month ago, and they're updating every week. The replayablility factor is strong with this one. Each session fells different, but not too different. Which is perfect. It can be grindy, at some points, but that's mostly optional. I recommend grinding, but it's still optional. Strength in numbers sounds good, but I've definitely found that having 2 super strong cars is much better than having 4 sort of strong cars. The game does many things, and it does all those things very well.\n\nNow I'm gonna talk about the best part of this game: The boss. Oh my god. That boss was one of the best bosses I've ever seen. The game is worth buying on that boss alone. I'd compare it t that of Intrusion 2's final boss (which was the best boss I'd seen until I found this game's boss). It's powerful, as a boss should be, and if you're not prepared for it, you won't get past it's scouts. But here's where the boss shines. Short of the laser blasters at the back (which are standard lasers that other enemies have in the game) EVERY ATTACK CAN BE DODGED. The missiles? Dodgable. The Beams? DODGEABLE! The mines? YOU BET THEY'RE DODGABLE! Which means if you get hit, IT'S YOUR FAULT. Which is how a boss should be. But this boss is still mean. I had 4 completely upgraded cars with amazing weapons and shields, along with a fully upgraded MCV with 2 super-shields and a giant laser, and I still lost. Why? Not because my cars were too weak, not because the boss was too strong, but because I wasn't good enough. And that's how a boss should be. I survived for 20 min (it's long, but it in no way feels drawn out.) and got through most of it's stages, but I still lost. BUT I WAS HAPPY! Because it was the first time I'd ever seen this boss. And you'll get angry, and mad, and frustrated, and you'll feel overwhelmed by everything, BUT YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST FIGHTING THIS BOSS.\n\nOkay. The actual game. The game is a blast, the difficulty can change in an instant, and the whole ride is a rollercoaster. You might win one fight without loosing a single health point, only to loose in an instant in your next fight. You might be richer than Bill Gates one second, only to find yourself with not scrap and an empty tank a second later. It keeps you on  your toes. If you aren't ready for this game to be mean to you, don't expect to get far. But that just makes it that much more fun. One thing I always hated about FTL was it felt too fast. I felt like you were pushed to go too fast due to your pursuers (which is why I prefer to play with Infinite space on). But with this game, you can take as long as you want. You wanna try and speed run, you can try that. I mean, you'll die, but you can try. You wanna grind for two hours, never accepting anything less that nukes on all your cars, that's cool too. You can very much play at your own pace.\n\nThe battle mechanics: The battling is wonderful. It feels different than anything else I've ever played. Its easy to learn, but just short of impossible to master. it feels fast paced and slowed down at the same time. Almost nothing is automatic. you can target a vehicle, but if that vehicle goes out of your range, your car won't move up into range until YOU tell it to. It does a very good job of making you feel in control of every part of the battle.\n\nPros: AMAZING BOSS, great battling mechanic, open world, goes at your pace, fair but mean, high replayablility.\nCons: Weapon choice is small, main objectives aren't numerous. AKA Things that can be, and most likely WILL BE, improved in updates.\n\nIs it worth $15? No. It's worth a lot more than that. But the devs are only selling it for $15, so BUY IT. BUY THIS GAME. STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT. NOW. DON'T HAVE ENOUGH? GET ENOUGH. THEN BUY IT.  Already have the game? THEN PLAY IT. NOW. GO. GET TO THE BOSS. FIGHT IT IN AN AMAZING BATTLE. INEVITABLY LOOSE. THEN PLAY IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH FUN!","May 21, 2015","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's mostly important that you like games like this.\n\nRNG play quite important role here, even if you choose the same options in random encounters it may end differently.\n\nIn my first few attempts I got cars and mods that were less than suitable to handle the late game encounters (as in the encounters were grindish because I was lacking firepower), but then suddenly one new restart and got few cars with double red offensive slots got a "dragon" + hovercraft from the missions and I was set. I had enough firepower to take out everything in my path, camps were also selling MCV guns/missiles. Felt like I was getting the super easy play session.\n\nFinal boss fight was also nothing I was prepared for and it was a blast.\n\nI do hope they keep adding content, more random events, more variation to it, new equipment that would create interesting combos, maybe even mechanics where two cars were needed to be effective in something.\n\nAnd it was quite interesting to watch the Mad Max: Fury Road after completing this game.

Seriously, when they said FTL and Mad Max they were wrong. There are random events both marked on map and while driving called, "Scenarios." These things can make your day or even destroy it. Thankfully, the frustration you go through can eventually pay off with the numerous things to unlock. Your main convoy vehicle (MCV) can be changed if you unlock the others. There are also many escort vehicles to unlock as well.\n\nLike FTL it is imperative that you spend your money wisely. You may need it for certain encounters. That being said, it's a good game.

Maybe not, but if FTL left you wanting more rouge-like-like action, this game definitely fills the gap.\nThe combat is fun, I wouldn't call it amazing but it's defintely fun still. Especially the smug satisfaction you get from ramming an enemy armored car that's been giving you trouble off a cliff and into oblivion. Like FTL it's real time action with a pause, which I personally enjoy alot as it feels more fast paced than a turn-based game but still gives you enough time to think and manage rather turning into a reaction time test like in some RTS games.\n\nThere are a wide range of scenarios with a wide array of possible outcomes depening on your choices and sometimes the whims of the Random Number God, some short, some long, all generally well thought out. No problems here.\n\nThere have been a good number of bugs, but the developers have responded very quickly to bug reports and feedbacks. Notably the lack of V-Sync support has been fixed, and the randomness of the game has been given a hefty nerf after complaints about random events taking out vehicles without warning, which would basically mean a loss. This is no longer the case, fortunately.\n\nThe games biggest failling is it's writing. Instead of taking you to another world with it's refined finesse, it seems to throw  as many unsubtle references in as it possibly can, like a kid shouting 'THE CAKE IS A LIE!' in an attempt to look cool. We all love a good reference devs, and especially a salute to Terry Pratchett, but only when they are more rare and subtle. Having them in every other sentence just takes you out of the game.\n\ntl;dr\nThe game isn't perfect, but this first release from the indie company Convoy Games will provide you with plenty of hours of fun for your £10 if you don't mind having to endure some clumsy writing.

Not to mention, you'll just get better cars from quests anyway or shops so what cars you start with only dictates what style you'll pay initially.\n\nTo sum up my opinion, it's okay. If you're looking for a rogue-like to kill time, try it out but don't expect too many playthroughs.","June 28, 2015","true","36.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are a bazillion pop-culture references which add a sense of humour but also detract slightly from the consistency of the world, and the randomness can work both for and against you - I died very quickly on my first attempt but on my second I managed to win a drone in a "guess what's behind the door" puzzle which allowed me to destroy everything I met for the rest of the game... but I doubt I'll be so lucky if I have a third attempt. For now, I'm going to move onto the other zillion games in my Steam library and if I feel the urge for a sci-fi tactical rogue-like... then I'll play FTL instead. Also, some of the language and scenes in the game made it very unsuitable for small children (which wasn't immediately obvious) - shame, because if those weren't in it the playing audience would be much bigger.","March 16","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the world map, you simply move your convoy to the objective points in a top-down view. In battle, you have escort vehicles which you can command to move to protect your convoy, as well as command said escort vehicles to attack enemy vehicles. You can gain bolts (the currency in the game) and fuel (which allow you to traverse the world map) from battles and events, and you can use the bolts to buy new weapons and upgrade your vehicles at camps (i.e. stores) scattered throughout the map.\n\nThe game is very entertaining with moderate replay value, but within 3 or 4 playthroughs you've experienced everything the game has to offer. The combat is nice, but gets very repetitive and monotonous rather quickly, and the 'random events' all feel the same after a while.\n\nMy overall thoughts:\nYou probably wouldn't enjoy this game if you didn't already enjoy FTL, as the replay value is restricted only by your desire to unlock the other vehicles and/or achievements. I think it has a lot of potential; similar to the Advanced Edition update of FTL, I feel this game could definitely benefit from such a content update.","December 26, 2015","true","16.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Convoy has some design flaws - the biggest one of them being the insta-kill obstacles which your drivers won't automatically avoid and are very difficult to dodge if you wait until theyre onsreen. Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed things nearly ruined the game for me. It does warn you with flashing skulls on the right edge of the screen, but they are easy to miss in the heat of combat, and to be honest I didn't realize what they indicated until I reached the boss for the first time. Your first time through, I HIGHLY recommend pausing every 2 seconds to look for skulls so that you can move out of their way in time.\n\nCombat is hectic and intense. It's very different than FTL - there aren't nearly as many layers to it, but I wouldn't say that it is necessarily much less challenging or tactical than FTL. Instead of moving around crewmembers and choosing which parts of the enemy ship to disable and when to fire your weapons, you're telling your escort vehicles where to move and who to shoot at. When limited ranges and line-of-sight weapons come into play, combat actually becomes very complex and exciting - especially if you can manage not to pause for long periods.\n\nYou can put weapons and utilities onto your escorts - though only some support utilities - and your main convoy vehicle (MCV, which I don't think actually stands for Main Convoy Vehicle...). There isn't as much noticable diversity to the weapons as in FTL, because you don't need to time your shots with the escort vehicles' weapons; they boil down to their HP DPS and their armor DPS. However, whether they require line of sight is also an important factor, and choosing the right weapons for each escort can make a big difference.\n\nThere are relatively few weapons for the MCV, but those function more like weapons in FTL - they have long cooldowns and you have to carefully choose when and where to fire them.\n\nThe ability to ram enemy vehicles can also come into play, although I'd only recommend it if you have the utility that negates ramming damage to your own vehicles. Once cool aspect to ramming is that you can occasionally use it to force enemy vehicles into instakill obstacles, although to be honest you can accomplish that about as easiy without ramming them.\n\nOne thing that bothers me about the game is it is chock-full of random pop culture references. There are sooooo many of them. It hurts the ambiance of the game, and it's a sign of laziness on the part ofthe developers - copying some dialog from Back to the Future or A Clockwork Orange iis easier than thinking of your own dialog. Unlike FTL, I quickly found myself skipping all of the dialog.\n\nThe inexperience of the developers shows in the sometimes clunky game design - it's obvious that they copied certain mechanics from FTL without fully understanding them. For example, the scrap costs and rewards use very similar numbers to FTL - but shields are the exception rather than the norm in this game, and consequently you have to spend much more on repairs than in FTL. If you start a Normal game with the wrong vehicles, you'll lose more than you earn on every encounter, and unlike FTL there is no way to escape an encounter without completely killing the enemy.","November 29, 2015","true","24.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, you will have to concentrate on keeping your trucks alive, sometimes it's harder then it first seems, but the game can be very unforgiving at times and give you a bad time. For an example you wont have any ways of finding out how much HP your trucks have in midfight, you will just see a Red/Blue bar telling you what you might expect.\n\nThe game is very random it seems, and the first two times i played it i lost in less then 10 minutes, but on the third try i played for over 3 hours and unlocked 2 Main trucks and two convoy-trucks, beat the dragon went through the main mission got a mini-boss down and i could never feel i was being treated unfairly, but you have to be very lucky.\n\nThe only thing that made the game possible for me was a random event where i met a girl in a colloseum alike thing and got some artefacts, then she would join me once i found her truck, so a definite tips for you too make early.\n\nSadly the game has things where you just travel, and an event pops up and you only have one choice: Dodge the mines, you get no saying in "Burn extra fuel to make it easier to get out" or anything, you just get to hope that they wont take away your best vehicle, with your best weapons, with full upgrades, and you wont even get the scraps the vehicle has become.\n\nIf you like to Micromanage while having all the time in the world, or liked FTL but wanted it to be easier, this might be it for you, however it's still roguelite and you might fail miserably until you start to get going.","May 2, 2015","true","19.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The devs have addressed some of the issues since then, and since that did affect some of my grievances, I am confortable with recommending this now.\n\nWhen you hear this is similar to FTL, think 'vaguely similar'. It has equipment management, it has general storyline, it has bosses, it has unlocks. What is different:\n* This game is significantly different in 'easy to learn, hard to master' area, because it's harder to learn, and, being open-world and all that, is somewhat easier to master... on Easy difficulty at least.\n* Time pressing isn't really pressing, so you can farm. The game does gets tougher the tougher you are, but you can still hang around the camp and repair after each combat.\n* Backtracking. You will do a lot, but that's rogue-like open world to you.\n\nWhat will ♥♥♥♥ you off early on:\n* UI and controls. Especially vehicle behaviour early on. Hint: invest in vehicle handling.\n* Different outcomes for the same decisions. Hint: deal with it, it's the designer having fun with you.\n* Boss difficulty. Hint: try to drop your starter cars for something tougher.\n* Endless cultural references with next to no original writing. No remedy for that, guys.\n\nWhat you should look forward to:\n* Multiple 'Hell, Yeah's as you build up, one-shot enemies, hit everyone with a single missile or push a foe into a rock face.\n* Flexible difficulty\n* Unlocks that actually matter\n* Solid replayability.","April 22, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays much like FTL: Faster Than Light, which is one of my favorite games. It is a scrolling, 2D, point and click game but has great value. I have not yet currently beat it but I am very close. Convoy has good story line and funny narratives. It is strategical and is a game I have been looking for. Think of it kind of as a mixture between games like FTL an and that mission in Halo 4 where you you have to protect the elephant. You are a convoy (hence the name). You are supposed to protect the main truck – called the MCV - by moving your convoy's trucks around destroying enemies while avoiding projectiles, wreckage or natural elements. There is a mixture of upgrades and chooseable vehicles. I highly rate this game. 9/10","December 2, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From an overworld system vaguely resembling Fallout 1 overlaid with FTL-like radio beacon events, to the engaging vehicle battles (with a handful of sometimes optional boss fights), Convoy presents itself strong.  My only real complaint lies in the games overall attitude and atmosphere; it's serious and silly in a very Borderlands kind of way, but it becomes a bit tiresome when EVERYTHING in terms of scenarios and dialogue is some kind of unnecessary reference to a tv show or meme.  There's still plenty of room for this title to grow, mainly just in terms of adding more weapons and making scenarios more subject to chance rather than always having one right answer.  I feel Convoy will do just that, whether it be by the developers or mods.  Bottom line:  if you need a strategic rogue-like, look no further.","December 6, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Convoy is a fun real time strategic vehicular combat game in a randomly generated world with charming pop-culture and gaming references (although they can sometimes be a bit too much). The random encounters can make or break a game, but fortunately, even with permadeath, the campaign is short enough that dying and starting over is not onerous. The pixelart graphics suit the world perfectly, and combat is fun, exciting and strategic.\n\nRecommend.","December 6, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My opinion on it has changed a few times and after a lot of hours I really, really like it.\n\nThe combat is fun but I also found if you do play it a second time it can be different. I found new cars and weapons and my experience was different. I'm now looking forward to playing it a 3rd time (completed it once). Quests change and can be full of surprises giving you some cool cars\weapons\boss fights.\n\nPro's ---\nFree roam\nBattles are really fun and original\nInteresting quests\nGood boss fights\nCool looking cars\nGood weapon\combat system\n\nCon's ---\nFuel bug (dont run out!) plus first time game-start fails. Alt-F4 and restart required each time.\nGame is too short (minor issue)\nCars look different but are pretty much the same thing.\nWorld map looks dull and repeditive. Quest pointers required to get around. No landmarks.\nI'd like to see more car types. Maybe bikes as well. (very minor issue)\nThe sounds and music are terrible. Recommend play on Mute with your own music.\n\n____\nOverall a damn good game and could be expanded upon. After the last boss battle I'd love to fly to a new world and do it again. I'd love to see this as a much, much bigger world or with the ability to visit new worlds (new maps), new vehicles and weapons.

Very enjoyable.\n\nAs you can probably tell by my avatar, I really really like the inspiration taken from the art of Dune 2. Combat is viscreal, explosive and satisfying.\n\nWhile the game is very good, and I recommend it, there are two areas of weakness I felt could have been improved. For one thing the writing isn't very good, relying on pop culture references rather than standing on its own two feet and telling its own story. You'll see the same quests each time you play. While some of the progression through some quests is randomised, it's always the same text. That's not really a problem for a one-shot, linear, throwaway game where you're only meant to play through it once, but for a replayable game taking cues from roguelikes it's a bit annoying to read the same text each game.\n\nThe other problem is the gameplay balance is a bit off. If you have the good fortune to find the best vehicles/weapons in the game then you pretty much slaughter everything you come across from that point on. That's still fun, I guess, but not very deep.\n\nStill, I had a great time and do recommend this game.\n\nedit: one more thing: this game is NOT FTL. It's not a successor to FTL. I don't know anything about the developers' intentions, but the game they have created is not FTL nor apparently trying to be, though it takes some stylistic inspiration from it. The two games play totally differently, FTL is much deeper and better written, and comparing the two does neither game any favours.\n\nIf you liked FTL you may or may not like this game. If you didn't like FTL you may or may not like this game. Take it for what it is, on its own merits.","December 30, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You travel with your combat vehicles and convoy across a wasteland to find parts needed to repair your broken spaceship. During your journey you will encounter strangers in randomized scenarios by picking up radio signals.\n\nDepending on the choices you make, signals can either lead to tactical combat, text based dialogue or chance based role-play.

Overall 8/10.\nThat's the summary, here's my review.\nI thought this looked really enjoyable and bought it the second the trailer finished. My one and only regret is not waiting for the price to go down. This game isn't worth $15. It is easily worth $7-10. So if the price goes down, jump at it. Here's why.\nThis game is intensely engaging. The atmosphere is oppressive, even on mute. You start obsessing over that kilometer counter, praying for those digits to tick faster. Your spine will be wrecked as you sit on edge praying that a chance encounter won't pop up because your Man Carrier Vehicle is shot half to hell and your squad doesn't have much left before it falls the rest of the way. It's wonderful in that regard.\nThe combat is endearing but not a real selling point. You fight by managing your vehicles, which means directing your fire and your position, as many weapons need a line of sight to shoot, obviously. This can be irritating as first, but once you get good at it it starts to be a thrill as you abandon the pause button in favor of high speed maneuvering (within the screen limits) and rapid fire combat.\nThe story is fairly engaging. You are a spaceship stranded on the planet of Omek Prime due to an on board catastrophe, and must take your MCV and vehicle squad traversing across the planet to find the parts necessary to repairs. One of them is a flux capacitor. 'Nuff said?\nThe random encounters are fairly well spaced and don't ever strike me as unfair. But they are incredibly repetitive. It's not that there's only a handful; there's at least a dozen special ones and a fair few "just fight" one's. And at all times in negotiations/quests/encounters you have the option to flip ♥♥♥♥ and start shooting. The problem is that the dialogue trees never get changed up; the same path always leads to the same result. So once you play once or twice you know exactly how to get the desired results from the encounters.\nIt would really be great if future updates would include some combat overhauls. The ability to target weapons or wheels in the same way you target compartments in FTL would be wonderful, as would the ability to shove a car into the way of an oncoming building instead of trying (and usually failing) to trap them in front of it. And I will warm that I have effectively made the game unbeatable due to a combination of starting vehicles and weapon choice. I don't know how to fix this, but I really hope a way is found. It's kinda boring now.\nThis really is a great game though. As soon as it goes on sale, get it.\n","May 23, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the movement and the targetting, swerving out of the way of wrecks and mines and blocking shots on your main convoy - truly engrossing. The storyline was entertaining enough, and the factions each have a distinctive and interesting culture.\n\nThe Bad:\nI finished the game on my first run, without any help or guidance. I guess that means that the game's easy to pick up, but I can't help but feel sorely disappointed to have run through the entirety of the main storyline in my first try - I guess I expect roguelikes to be tougher than this. FTL definitely ate more time before I managed to get anywhere with it, SanctuaryRPG took a few days to get through and I'm still struggling through Out There.

When I played it however, it did not meet my expectations. Maybe I'm just not a very good player, something entirely possible, but even the easy difficulty was fairly difficult. I found the event system, which was wonderful in FTL, to be instead here an irritation. It becomes mostly a game to see how far you can get before you get jumped by bandits, T.O.R.V.U.S, or privateers, with the random event usually requiring several crap tons of fuel to avoid, which is a rare resource in the first place. The story component is identical, requiring you to do the same meaningless tasks for the same people in order to get that one elusive part for your crippled ship. However, the graphics look very nice, and the animation when starting a road battle is pretty impressive. I would recommend it, but only if the price dropped significantly. 4/10.","February 8","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is also balanced like FTL in that getting to the final boss isn't that hard, but the final boss cheats, pulls out multiple forms and ultimate weapons, and crushes you to death even if you play correctly. I've always hated that about FTL and I am disappointed that this game went the same route. Overall, the game is fun to play, so I recommend it. However, if an impassible barrier at the end of the game ruins it for you, stay away from this one. If you like the challenge, then go for it.","January 8","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This comparison is best for highlighting the combat system.  Like FTL, Convoy's combat is real time but can be paused at any time so you can issue commands.  What makes come back to Convoy more than I did with FTL is the lack of pressure.  Convoy has a much stronger exploration element with forgiving RNG.  I feel more curious as a drive around the wasteland, wondering what kinds of bandits and weird constructs I will encounter. This makes Convoy more of a fun experience and less of a trial.  With a strong sense of humor, nerd-culture references, and heap of unlocks, Convoy is a different and rewarding experience each time I play.\nCheck out my playthrough here: https://youtu.be/3GbLKv6GGZM","December 24, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My opinion on it has changed a few times and after a lot of hours I really, really like it.\n\nThe combat is fun but I also found if you do play it a second time it can be different. I found new cars and weapons and my experience was different. I'm now looking forward to playing it a 3rd time (completed it once). Quests change and can be full of surprises giving you some cool cars\weapons\boss fights.\n\nPro's ---\nFree roam\nBattles are really fun and original\nInteresting quests\nGood boss fights\nCool looking cars\nGood weapon\combat system\n\nCon's ---\nFuel bug (dont run out!) plus first time game-start fails. Alt-F4 and restart required each time.\nGame is too short (minor issue)\nCars look different but are pretty much the same thing.\nWorld map looks dull and repeditive. Quest pointers required to get around. No landmarks.\nI'd like to see more car types. Maybe bikes as well. (very minor issue)\nThe sounds and music are terrible. Recommend play on Mute with your own music.\n\n____\nOverall a damn good game and could be expanded upon. After the last boss battle I'd love to fly to a new world and do it again. I'd love to see this as a much, much bigger world or with the ability to visit new worlds (new maps), new vehicles and weapons. Thats a bit of a game changer but shows a lot of potential.\n\nA fun, casual game with car battles.","December 25, 2015","true","71.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Excellent sound effects for the weapons. When using the cannon or machine gun it sounds like there's real power behind\n\nThe world map could use some variety and the same goes for the battle map. For example the world map could have really hostile terrain that is dangerous to enter, reflected in the battle map with far less space to manoeuvre and more obstacles, including moving obstacles, i.e., fireballs of magma.\n\nHoping the devs will make another game or expand this one with even more content, including open-ended gameplay, something the FTL devs have not done to my disappointment.\n\nRecommended for the current price. With the achievements and unlocks you could easily squeeze 50 hours out of this.","January 23","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes some practice, but after that it was a lot of fun. Strategy is an important aspect of the game  with one deciding which enemies to engage during combat at a moments notice, or figuring out which route would be safest. Many times I had to decide whether it is worth the fuel to travel to a nearby activity. Be wary, factions spread their control fast, it is rather surprising they didnt have much control before I arrived.","April 20","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me 3 hours to beat.\nThere are 3 factions but they all use exactly the same handful of vehicles.\nThere are a dozen starting MCVs to unlock, but the differences are things like 5% more armor or 50 more hitpoints instead of anything gamechanging or worth the hours investment.\nThe few scattered allusions to other sci fi games are just verbatim quotes of the dialogue (from Fallout 1 for example)\nThe dialogue is completely generic, using modern internet lingo. Makes me cringe. Not immersive.\n\nFTL by comparison has totally unique factions, unlockable ships that mean something, storyline that someone put effort into.\n\nThis game is worth getting on sale. It's neat, but $15 is too much, when every advertised feature is a dissapointment.\n\nWhat's good: The combat is fun","May 29","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
