It doesn't have anything game-breaking inside of it, but the fact that in order to unlock *anything*, you need gems.  I played for 20 minutes on a dungeon and couldn't find the exit (seemed almost like a bug, but could have been my fault) and I got no gems.  I then downloaded a map created by the developer and I was able to complete it 100%, and I got 0 gems again.  So I'm not exactly how you get gems, but it's just absolutely disgusting that they sell the gems behind a partially hidden payway.  If you hit the escape key on your keyboard, there is a button that says "enable purchases", and a new button on the main menu will appear which you can buy your gems in bundles are high as $49.99 US.  I couldn't imagine someone actually wanting to pay to unlock these characters.  They are just models available online, you may recognise them in other games such as Tap Tap Infinity.  That game also got criticism for using assets, but I have no issue with their use, except to actually have a pay wall in place to unlock them just seems bizarre.\n\nA side note, the developer is also the one who has created the Esenthel Engine, some sort of next-gen gaming engine which probably very few people use but judging by the screenshots it shows great promise.  But then why, as your second project, would you create this game with premade assets and charge to unlock characters?  I could see MAYBE having this sort of business model on a free-to-play game.  It just took my opinion of the Esenthel Engine itself and flushed it down the toilet if the developer can make such a simple game and expect people to actually want to invest money into it.  Why would someone want to pay $50 for in-game gems to unlock characters if they can actually buy the real Might & Magic games?\n\nI can understand that the developer is not a 3D artist and had to source the models from somewher, but why not just create the Dungeon Hero game "as is" and let the players unlock everything without any option to pay at all?  Also, I see other users claim that it is possible to earn 3 to 5 gems per dungeon, although I didn't get any, still you are going to spend many, many hours here trying to unlock stuff.\n\nThe price of the game is fair, the quality is acceptable (being generous), but the microtransactions model is confusing and has prompted me to leave a thumbs down on this title.","September 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 34 of 41 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","34","41","0","0"

It plays like a gridder movement-wise, but unlike a gridder, you do not choose a party of characters whose skills complement eachother, instead you play as a solo adventurer and you click on the screen to swing whatever weapon you have equipped.\n\nThankfully, there are no longer any monetary purchases to unlock content.  All content is unlocked via gems which are only obtained by completing dungeons.  There are a number of different adventurers to unlock as well as cute little pets which will actually help out in battle.  You can also unlock the various dungeon skins for the randomized dungeons with gems as well.\n\nThe game includes a 16 level, well-crafted dungeon filled with puzzles, monsters and treasures, but it will probably only take a few hours to complete.  After that you are free to run it again, but there are also randomized dungeons to play through.  While not crafted as in depth as the main dungeon, they do at least offer some variety and exploration.\n\nWhile playing you gain any number of dropped weapons and armor, and no matter what character you take, you are free to equip anything you want.  The problem with this is that every character roughly plays exactly the same way making little need to unlock other adventurer types.  As you progress through the dungeons you find higher and higher leveled equipment.  When you start new dungeons you find equipment based off of your current level or equipment stats.  This means you have little need to upgrade your weapons and armor outside of the dungeon, which is available to you, but mostly uneeded.  It also means the dungeons never really get challenging.  This really is just a casual game with little strategy or skill required.  The only challenge in playing through is figuring out the puzzles which hinder your path to the end of the dungeons.\n\nIf that was all that was offered with this game, I would probably say there just wasn't enough content for the gem grinding required to unlock everything, but I think what saves this game and makes it a worthwile game to play is the ability to make your own dungeons and then upload them for other players to play through.  As of right now, there is not a huge player-base creating dungeons, but there is still quite a list of player-made dungeons available.  Obviously the quality of these dungeons is entirely dependent on the skill of the designer, so they can vary in how fun they are to play through.\n\nAll in all, this game makes for a fun, satisfying jaunt through a dungeon, but it probably isn't going to hold the interest of players looking for any real strategy or character building.","February 13","true","4.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

It has cute graphics and the game mechanics are just trivial. There is a ton of weapons and enemies, but it really doesn't make much difference which weapon you will use and which monster you're fighting, you just need to click and move forward and backwards to avoid getting hit.\n\nLiterally >everything< in the game has to be unlocked by spending 'gems'. Additional heroes, pets, weapon and stat upgrades, even dungeon graphics(!) etc. You can obtain those gems via microtransactions, or you can just play the game for a bit. For example, completing a random-generated small dungeon (takes about 10-15 minutes) earns you 5 gems. Unlocking most basic hero costs 10, unlocking a basic pet 5 gems. And it gets much more pricy along the way. But then, there's really not much difference between them, so it's mainly aesthetical matter. At the start you get only 10 gems, which you must immediately spend on unlocking your first hero. The amount of time needed to unlock everything without spending real money on microtransactions is ridiculous, I really doubt anyone over 12 years old will have the mental condition needed to mindlessly click for that much time.\n\nWhile I understand this business model on mobile devices when game is free to play, it doesn't make much sense on PC, when you actually paid for the game. I got the game dirt cheap (under 0,5 euro), so it doesn't bother me, but people who paid the full price of 7euros have every right to be really, really angry about it.\n\nI decided not to recommend this game. It basically doesn't meet standards of the genre and PC gaming, becomes repetitive and boring quite fast and has pesky unlocking system that feels more pay2win the further you get in the game. On the other hand though, it has somewhat nice infantile graphics. If you can get it >very< cheap and want something for just a couple of hours, get it. Otherwise, you will most likely end up feeling ripped off. Also, you may want to check the free2play version on mobile devices to help you make up your mind.","November 3, 2015","false","5.5"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","1"

There is no cash shop and you don't need to pay real world money to unlock the content despite what other reviews state.\n\n\nIn long\nSo I like this game on mobile and while yes this is a port with a cash shop ( that I don't think exist in game) you don't have to pay real world cash to progress. The gems are easily aquired with a bit of grinding and loot selling. The game is fairly easy more so since the gems are easily given per play. People seem to not want to put the effort of earning the gems to progress. Also the gems are used to unlock EXTRA content as the MAIN game is unlocked from the getgo and it has puzzles and a story. It's not a terribly deep game but it's a nice little time sink . There doesn't seem to be a weight limit to the loot you can carry and your character is customizable stat wise. Want to be a dual weilding sellsword that can cast heal spells you can, Just know that based on the character you pick any stat that deviates from it's class costs gems you need to earn. As mentioned I've played this game on mobile and love delving to see what loot I can grab and stuff I can unlock and never paid a dime in the cash shops. Playing on the steam version is more liberating cause instead of gold I earn gems and it's easier to unlock things.\n\n","February 2","true","9.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I ended up with Dungeon Hero, simply because the developer removed all microtransactions, and I wanted to support that decision with real-world dollars. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with it.\n\nDungeon Hero is a casual (and pretty shallow) but fun Action / Gridder (think: first-person, grid-based RPG-esque games such as Legend of Grimrock, Eye of the Beholder, or Dungeon Master). There is NO story, just dungeon crawling, monster bashing goodness. The main draws are the randomly generated dungeons / loot (as in Diablo) and unlockable characters and pets (gems are picked up by completing dungeons and used for unlockables). I've put around 8 hours into it, and I've still got a lot to unlock.\n\nThe assets are pre-purchased (meaning, you've likely seen them before) and a bit cartoony looking, if that sort of thing bothers you. I wouldn't enjoy them in a more serious gridder, but they seem to suit the casual aspect of this game pretty well.\n\nThe addition of a quick-n-dirty level editor is smart, and you can bring everything out of the dungeons with you and transfer gear to other characters. Dungeons are completely randomized; however, if you feel like playing through a designed dungeon the dev has included a few of those, too. For me, $6.99 is a bit steep for a casual game (I bought it at a sale price of $3.49), but if it fits what you're looking for, it might be worth it for those times when you just want something light to play.","April 14","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With its simple control and a its simple combat technique, this is a casual dungeon crawler. If you're looking for dark creepy tunnels, high action and intense combat; I recommend you look elsewhere. But, if you're looking for a simple, easy to play, casual stroll through a dungeon with a little fighting thrown in; then this is a game you will like. You could say it is perfect for children to enjoy and master. It has a nice, bright atmosphere and the layout is fun to run through with just enough expanse for the explorer in you. The maps are not very vast but intriquate enough to occasional lose where you are and where you came from. By completing the dungeon, you are awarded gems to which you can purchase objects in the game. Also by collecting and selling items, you gain gold to purchase items in the game as well. (Weapons, armor, potions and more)\n\nAlso, the VR compatability is a huge bonus in my book. I am currently using Oculus Rift DK2.

The game is designed as a simple hack-and-slash game.  A casual game to play during dead time.  As such, combat and dungeon exploration are the key components - not unlocking heroes.\n\nThe random game modes are easy enough to complete without your hero dieing (which only costs two gems for revival), and these modes provide you with the gems needed to advance your hero with enough left to go to your stockpile for the occassional death or weapon improvement.  With leveled up characters and some spare potions, the large random maps and the more complex, 16-level, hand-designed dungeon provide you sufficient gems to unlock higher level pets and heroes.\n\nIn addition, the main benefit to higher level characters is greater starting stats and base stat ceiling.  Lower level heroes can be as powerful as higher ones by buying stat boosts at the cheaper price of 1 gem per stat increase.  Personnally, I like to get higher level heroes for astestics and completeness not gameplay benefit.\n\nWhile the game could be defined as pay-to-win (assuming you define winning as a complete unlock of all heroes and pets), this would miss the main focus of the game, which is casual combat.  As a player, the micro-transcations primary purpose is to allow you quickly unlock a particular hero or reduce the time needed to reach a certain self-imposed goal; while at the same time, supporting the developer.\n\nMicro-transcations aren't inherently bad, they just have been implemented in ways to force players to pay often or suffer significant wait times.  As I have presented, this game doesn't suffer from this problem, so micro-transcation shouldn't be the reason you don't play it.\n\nIs this game great?  No, but it doesn't set out to break new ground or have complex gameplay mechanics.  It does intend to provide hours of casual fun and I would say it does this quite well.\n\nAre there areas that could do with improvement?  There are definitely a few aspects that could be changed to improve the fun.\n\nIt would be great if custom dungeons of sufficient size and monster quantity provided gems (even if it is just 1 or 2).  This would reduce the dependence on the simple random dungeons to boost gems.\n\nGiving players more potions in the store would also be a huge benefit especially for warriors who suffer from the lack of sufficient spell-casting to stay healthy and deal damage.\n\nThe last area that could a little work is customization of dungeon details - most notable props and chests contents.  The ability to have force certain chests to include a health or shield potion would allow dungeon creaters finer control over the dungeon progression and puzzles.\n\nAlso, this game could practically designed for achievements.  Achievements act like added objectives in lot of games, and these could reduce the repetitveness of the default game modes.\n\nWho would I recommend this game to? I would recommend this game to players seeking a well-made hack-and-slash with simple combat mechanics.  Also those you enjoy dungeon crawlers would probably enjoy this game as well.","October 12, 2015","true","125.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnvondraugr/recommended/366810/","johnvondraugr","johndraugr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johnvondraugr/","249 products in account","Quick review. I'll write a more detailed one later.\n\nWarning it's not so quick. I'd still like to edit this review and give more details later after playing a few more hours.\n\nIn short this game is A LOT of fun! I'm an old school dungeon crawler and never liked the cutesy graphics like those of Dungeon Hero RPG, but I gotta say so far I love it! The dungeons can be either user created, or randomly put together so each time the adventure is different. Of course with the actual hand made dungeons you can get more in the way of puzzles and details than in a randomly designed dungeon. Either way, both methods work fine and I had a lot of fun playing tonight.\n\nThe game comes with an editor to design your own dungeons and there are multiple skins for the dungeons. Ex: Classic, Prison, Crypts, Castle, etc... I only tinkered with the editor briefly but gotta say it looks very easy to use. I whipped up a quick level layout and placed some basic objects. I really like the ease of use with the editor. Again, I'll try to write a mroe detailed review later.\n\nNow for the one bad point....\n\nYou start the game with some gems which you use to purchase heroes, change the name of a hero, or to upgrade weapons, increase the level cap of your hero attributes, and to gain access to larger more dangerous and rewarding dungeons (random dungeons). These gems you can obtain by completing the random dungeons. For example: Small dungeons give 5 gems, medium 7 gems and large I believe grant 10 gems. Now, here is where I am not to fond on gems. Like many Android and iOS games/apps, you can purchase gems with REAL money. To me games like that always ruin the fun. Further, why did I just pay to purchase the game then I have to find out after purchasing the game that my purchase doesn't get me anything but access to the game. If you want in game currency to improve many aspects of your hero, the dungeon, etc... you must have gems and you can either obtain them through game play (slow) or spend REAL money to obtain lots of gems. Some people might not mind this, others like myself may. At least in Dungeon Heroes RPG's defense, they allow you to obtain gems freely by simply playing the game. As mentioned, I'm old school, so I like obtaining my rewards the hard way...by actually earning it, so obtaining gems in game doesn't bother me much. On the other hand the idea that some people can simply purchase many gems for real cash and upgrade their heroes in an instant does bother me. Alas, there doesn't seem to be any real competition between players, so it may be of little consequence.\n\nIn closing this is a really fun dungeon crawler and while I personally prefer serious, scary monsters, the cutesy graphics don't really hurt that much. I like the sounds and music as well. Very well done there!\n\nI love the amount of monsters I've encountered so far and hope DLC will be released in the future that adds, new dungeon skins, monsters, and items.\n\n[The Future]\n\nHere are some thoughts on the future for this game.\n\n1. Add the ability to remove the directional arrows on the bottom left of the screen. Currently they are there and the game looks like it is made for touch devices as well as desktop/laptop PCs. I found that my hero would move instead of attacking a target because my cursor was accidentally over the arrow/directional buttons on the screen.\n\n2. Lots of potential for DLC in the form of dungeon skins, monster types, items, pets, spells, etc...\n\n3. Perhaps have some of the random dungeons randomly add a end boss that the hero must beat before he/she can exit the dungeon and claim their gems.\n\n4. This is just my personal wish. Multiplayer! Allow players to host their own dedicated server with their own pre-designed dungeons and then have friends play together, or compete in the dungeon. A High Score table or some such scoreboard would be neat so players can see their score and compare it to other players who have played on that server. AGAIN, this is just my personal wish, the game is currently single player and I doubt it will become multiplayer. Perhaps Dungeon Hero RPG 2 may add multiplayer capability. :)","July 7, 2015","true","47.3"," 27 of 63 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","27","63","3","1"

I have played similar games like DM1, DM2, Eye of Beholder, Lands of Lore, Stonekeep, Legend of Grimrock etc. so I have few games to compare to.\n\nGenerally the gameplay, design, atmosphere is quite nice and I hope this game will develop further and end as something to be remembered, but there is still long way to go.\n\nHere are my suggestions, I guess and hope majority of it is well known to you and will be done(there might be something that is there but I haven't yet encountered it as I have the heroes around level 7):\nFirst of all, do not make the gamers press the W key to move forward so damn often. This key is stressed enough.\nSound and music volume control is a must have.\nKey binding for spells, potions, attack. I suppose it is designed for tablets also, but why to skip PC users.\nMore types of equipment. Give equipment some more stats, abilities. You know what I am talking about.\nGive weapons special attacks - for example dagger from left to right for 50 percent for open wound. Blunt weapons from bottom to top for chance to knock back the enemy. Swords could have a chanceto disarm the enemy for some time etc.\nThe monsters are nice, but I am lacking the skills like throwing, spell casting, poisoning, paralyzing one hand, special announced strong attacks, resistances etc.\nTo change the play style the ranger could be faster to avoid the spells, arrows, the mage could have spells for that - shield, counter spell, and the warrior bonus to shields as magic resist for example.\nI read about the boss at the end of dungeon - great idea. Do not make the game too easy. No one will remember it, enjoy it and play it long enough.\nAnd last but not least. If you insist on the farming of gems(if not buying them for real money which seems in this phase of the game a little over the top), make it better. The random dungeons are too simple.\nAfter writing the things that bothers me and I would like to see improved, it seems hard to recommend the game, but I would like to see the future of this game. You have my recommendation.","July 8, 2015","true","5.0"," 8 of 25 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","8","25","0","1"

They make clear in the storepage the game has micro-transactions. that is fine. but let sumarize it: want to upgrade your equipment? need a gem. want a pet? need gems. want a new hero? need gems. want bigger random dungeons? need gems. It is a fun and charming game. I give it a thumbs up as I do like the game. But for the love of steam, please tone the micro down a bit. If they tone it down a bit, I would wholeheartedly support this game.\nAnd to all you spoon thinking people out there: the game gets a thumbs up as it is besides the micro a fun game. it do not deserv a thumbs down IMHO. and since steam has no "meh" button, I went with the thumbs up.\nUPDATE: After a patch from the dev, he removed the buy gem messages, and made the buy gems optional in the options menu. Huge pluss. He removed some gem costs for some basic things. also a huge pluss. This is shaping up to be a good  little timesink after all :) Continue to do small changes like this dev, and this will become a good game to have fun with :)","July 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 24 of 65 people (37%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","37","24","65","4","10"

The dungeon itself - I tried a few random dungeons - i didn't make it to far on the "story" dungeon. If you liked grimlock, or EotB, you'll enjoy the story dungeon. Teleporters, Secret things to open doors, The only thing i didn't see were traps. But i am assuming the game is in early release and things will be coming along.\n\nPlease note - You have to use "gems" to purchase characters, Pets, Character improvements past thier max (ie, Knight strength is max 6. Gotta pay 1 gem to get it to 7) Now, You can earn gems by playing random dungeons - The small ones take about 1/2 an hour to complete  and net you 5 gems. So you can finish the game with out paying a cent. The purchase just lets you speed things up.\n\nWeapons and potions and things like that - Everything is identified. I would hope that in the future it would become fully random so you could have the true rogue experience,  But right now what you see is what you get.\n\nAs far as leveling goes - You can level you character, You can level your pet, There seems to bee some "hidden" characters and pets that you can eventually earn by unlocking the other classes - I haven't seen any "magic or legendary weapons" yet, but keep in mind that i've just scratched the surface of this game.\n\nMonster models are interesting, They are definatly fleshed out, though they seem cutesy instead of threatening. Granted don't take the cute models as easy push overs, some of them hit tremendosly hard.\n\nMy take is right now 7/10 Needs some improvment.\n- No back Stabbing - You can sneak up and hit things but there dosn't seem to be any bonus\n- the random dungeons make no sense some times. But hey, It's random\n- Equipment is limited.  3 slots.\n- No hot keys for potions.","July 8, 2015","true","2.2"," 9 of 32 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","9","32","0","0"

You then have the option of exploring the premade dungeon, a randomly generated map, or a custom created map that the community or you have created (yes there is a map creator). All different types of loot will drop for your character but the combat and equipment system is very simplistic which adds to the game's casual laid back nature. The enemy and gear models seem to be endless and adds to the ambience of the cartoony themed artwork. When I first started the game, I thought this was going to be a dud but I learned quickly that it's a lot of fun. Controls are extremely wonky, so spending a couple minutes switching them around will make your time with this game all the more enjoyable. There are micro transactions but they are 100 percent not necessary, as you can earn gems by beating the game. If you're looking for a serious big boy RPG, look elsewhere, but for 7 dollars this game hits the mark.","July 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 9 of 32 people (28%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","28","9","32","2","0"

If the devs read this, the idea of monster collection might be interesting, so it could inspire us, to find all monsters out.","May 28","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
