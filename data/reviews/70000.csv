"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Happymartin/recommended/70000/","Happymartin","Happymartin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Happymartin/","308 products in account","Nazi Dinosaurs with Cannons and Machine Guns on their backs. What more do I have to say?\n\n\n\nDino D-Day is a humorous WWII Multiplayer FPS about what would happen if not only did Adolf Hitler's science teams brought the dinosaurs back to life, but also gave them nerve controlled weapons, the intellegence to comprehend language, ideology, nationality, and not eat their masters? You get this silly game where Dinosaurs have cannons, machineguns, their own claws and abilities, and even suicide bombing mini dinos; I'm not kidding. The game got it's start as a single player mod for Half Life 2, but it was scrapped apparantly and it's assets turned towards a multiplayer game.\n\nThere are two teams, The Allies, and the Axis. With some memebers of either having special abilities to use.\n\nThe Allies are John Hardgrave (The Leader), who uses either the M1 Garand or the M1 Carbine. His ability is when he gets three kills, he can go into a Patriotic beserk spree! Punching facists with his super fists high into the air!\n\nThen there's Joe Spencer, he uses either a Tommy Gun or a Grease Gun, his specialty is calling in artillary strikes onto a part of the map, which is useful for either clearing a certain chokepoint of enemies, or dealing damage to critical targets.\n\nUp next is Nigel Blythe, English Gentleman with a Shotgun, and his choice of either a rocket launcher or a flame thrower to light those jerries up!\n\nSupporting from the rear is Ilona Vike, cute as a button but sharp as a razorblade. This Soviet Rose is the sniper of the team and utilizes her rifle, her revolver for back up, and a dead rabbit to distract certain dinos into losing control and eating, leaving them vulnerable to either Ilona herself, or her comrades.\n\nSupporting at the front is also Camille Brun the medic, she heals nearby teammates with her special or can chuck heal oozing medpacks for teammates to gather around.\n\nFinally, there's Trigger, the wonder dino! Liberated from the Nazi Army, Trigger is the only Dino the allies have, and he's as deadly as he is cute, getting revenge on the long long hunt from carnivores millenia ago, Trigger uses his nerve controlled, swivel mounted 30. Browning Machine Gun on Facists, wether beast or man.\n\n\nThe Axis forces only have three humans, being mostly comprised of Facist dinosaurs!\n\nKurt Streicher is a simple soldier with no abilities to speak of, Armed with his rifle, his MP40, and some grenades, he does good on the front on his own.\n\nKarl Hissman is the more interesting German, being a falconer, he's trained explosive, suicide Pterosaurs to fall onto where ever he points at, killing anyone nearby (Did I mention you can, if lucky, lock the Pterosaur onto an enemy?). Aside from that, he serves as the team's sniper against Ilona.\n\nThe final Human is Don Graff, the Medic and Vetrinarian for the Axis war machine. be wary that even though he is a simple medic, he is armed with an STG44.\n\nThe Facist Dinos include the classic Velociraptor, who can use his speed to surprise and overwhelm enemies, and even pounce onto them to rip their throats out.\n\nThe Dilophosaurus can pick up one of the many goats (did I mention there's goats in this game?) and lunge them at enemies for damage and laughs, as well as the ability  to knock down enemies, pick them up, and toss them for a double kill!\n\nThe Desmatosuchus is a walking tank, armed with a medium but still powerful tank turrent, he can supress enemies and kill with splash damage. Be mindful that he and his spikes are big, so it's not easy to get through certain doorways.\n\nThe Stygimoloch is the Desmatosuchus, but more mobile, agile, less bulkly, and has a MG34 Machine gun instead of a cannon. He is the German Trigger.\n\nThe Microraptor can do it all! He can fly, claw people to death when they don't know it, and blind people with a deadly acid spit, while clawing them to death!\n\nThe Compsognathus, or Compy for short, is a suicide bomber dino, though small and his bomb is just a stick grenade, he is still fanatical, and with three kills from his claws, turns his grenade from a weak firecracker, to a powerful bomb that can kill many, and set others aflame!\n\n\nFinally the grand daddy of them all, only avaliable on certain maps, The Tyrannosaurus Rex! You can't spawn as him, rather there's a "waiting list" on the Axis team where a random player gets selected to become the Rex until either the end of the round, or death where upon another player is randomly chosen. He is nasty, Armed with two MG42s on the sides of his head, able to pick up and toss airplane bombs, he also uses his might roar to knock down enemies and if they're unlucky enough, The T-Rex can pick them up and eat them for health! His only problem is his pure size and slowness, making him a target for everyone.\n\n\n\nThe game comprises of three modes. Team Deathmatch (First team to 50 kills wins), King of the Hill (The side that controls the hill point for 3 minutes wins.), Control Points (First team to capture all points wins.), and Objective mode. Otherwise the game is your typical FPS combat, with the Allies being more for group tactics and shooting, while the Axis Dinos are more arena shooter.\n\nOverall this is a fun cheap game, I got this for $1.99 when it was on sale the other day, and it's worth the money if you can find a crowded server. The game is active with a couple of players, so no worries about finding a big game. I would indeed reccomend this game.\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun Gameplay\n-Gunplay is good\n-Dinoplay is amazing\n-Cheap\n\nCons:\n\n-Weird Control choices (Holding the aim button while in toggle mode won't let you fire your gun, this can be switched to hold down though.)","October 2, 2014","true","25.3"," 171 of 183 people (93%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","93","171","183","45","4"

Nothing seems to fit in, you can't score any kills and seems like everybody is out to get only _you_. Then you start to learn the maps, game modes, classes and the speed of games. Kill-Death ratio starts to turn, as hours spent in game pass. No dinosaur, big or small, poses a threat to you. And every dinosaur you handle, reaps through the ranks of your enemies. You run, fly and pounce through fields where bullets, grenades and goats fly. This has become your another home.\n\nAnd after all this, you notice that the fun hasn't disappeared even for a moment.

Dinosaurs have been resurrected by the Axis to be the formidable foe against the Allies. I bought this game years ago and went in thinking it was a single player first person shooter. You vs dinosaurs! Maybe I should read descriptions. Dino D-Day is a multiplayer online first person shooter set in the 1940s. There are 9 maps to choose from and a server list to find a game. You can even play offline or alone with bots and its every bit as fun.\n\nThe teams each have their own characters. I hesitate to say classes, because everyone feels unique. Sure both teams have a medic, but they're both different. Each of the 16 characters are different and relegated to humans and dinosaurs. The Axis has six dinosaur characters and three humans. The Allies have six humans and one dinosaur named Trigger. The dinosaurs have longer stamina to run around the map, so they don't run head on into gunfire from humans. Humans are weaker, but to balance it, they're smaller. The bigger the dinosaur, the more health it has. Changing between characters is easy like Team Fortress 2.\n\nThe dinosaurs all play differently and it doesn't take that long to understand how they work. Maybe 10 minutes to be effective and efficient killers. Trigger, on the Allies side plays in 3rd per-dinosaur. He can jump and use a machine gun that needs to cool down. On the Axis, there's a Stygimoloch that plays similar with a cool down machine gun. Desmatosuchus is a slow tank that takes a lot of damage, fires very slowly and murders quickly. To balance him, he's a slow mover and so wide he can't fit through normal doorways. There is a raptor that is fast, plays in first per-dinosaur, melee kills quick, can leap, a high jump and pounce with the alt fire button in the air. A bigger dilophosaurus in 3rd person that can quickly run and head ram things to death. Not just that, it can pick up one of the goats found in most maps and heave them at the Allies. Compsognathus is the smallest third person dinosaur. Because of this, you're under the sight line of most humans. Your lack of health is gained in stealth. Plus, you can simply explode at will. Its beautiful. The final dinosaur is the Microraptor that plays in first dinosaur. It has wings and while it can't fly it can flap to keep it in the air to spit acid that blinds enemies. Not just that, but it can cling to walls and ceilings. Cling, but not wall run or anything like that.\n\nIt is the gameplay diversity and the uniqueness of all characters that really set this game apart. The humans all have their own weapons that not only feel good to use, but effective too. Most of the weapons except the shotguns have iron sights with their alt fire button.\n\nOn the Allies, you have Hardgrave, with a gun, a pistol, a grenade and his bare fists to box with dinosaurs. Spencer has his primary weapon, a pistol, his fists and a sticky bomb. Lob it out, stick it to an enemy and watch as they bring it home. Piat is the heaviest human, he uses a shotgun, a rocket launcher that only holds one rocket at a time to balance it out and smoke grenade. No fists, no melee, just big damage. Vike is a sniper, with a pistol and a rabbit. Why a rabbit? Its bait. If a carnivorous (or omnivorous) dinosaur finds the rabbit, they eat, disabling them, which gives Vike time to user her sniper rifle for one dead dino. Camille is the medic of the Allies, but in Dino D-Day the medic packs are different. She throws out the pack and when her team is near the pack, they regenerate health. So she can help her team with a machine gun, luger and fists if need be. Frank is the last member of the allies, he has a machine gun, a one shot shotgun, grenades, his fists and his devilishly good looks. Over on the Axis side, you have Streicher with a gun, machine gun, stick grenade and knife. Allies use fists, sissies like the Axis use knives. Hissman is the sniper who has a luger, stick grenade and knife. He can also summon a pterodactyl to dive bomb and explode. Wolfgang is the medic of the Axis with a machine gun, luger, knife and medi-pack.\n\nDino D-Day has undergone a major graphics change and the artwork looks fantastic. It has an art style true to the 1940s propaganda. Ole time radio broadcasts on the main menu go a long way for making an immersive experience. The game has come a long way in three years. There are more maps and better graphics, even after all this time. The game also has taken out references to Hitler and swastikas. There are now black crosses in white circles on red banners. So it still feels like Nazi swastikas, but its not. That's still okay. It doesn't hinder the fun.\n\nIn case you haven't heard, the game uses the Source engine. So there are a lot of comparisons between this game and other Source games like Counter-Strike: Global Offense and Day of Defeat. It plays as easily as those games with a lot of freedom to tailor the controls to what you want them to be. A lot of the maps feel like they could be in CS:GO. They feel like deserts and small villas, all while having elements of dinosaurs in them.\n\nThe Axis is the red team with blue health and the Allies are the blue team with red health. It is a bit confusing in the game. I say red and blue, because of the color of their logos. There are no actual team colors. Characters have their own non team specific attire, which can make it confusing on the battle field. How does a new player know what team that player is on? If they're on your team, they have a logo floating above their head. Anything else should get shot and killed. The problem is seeing things. A lot of times the players blend in. The night maps make it difficult to see other players, which is good for a stealth advantage. Shorter dinosaurs can hide in grass.\n\nEach of the maps has three or four modes: Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Control Points and a few maps have objectives. The objectives in those maps are pretty simple. The allies will pick up a bomb in their spawn room and set the bomb at a specific target. The bombs take a few moments to arm, then throw and then they explode after ten seconds or so. It doesn't feel like a game changer. Speaking of the spawn room, you can find unlimited health and ammo. Outside of the base, its tougher to find health. Enemies drop ammunition. Even if you're a raptor that doesn't need ammunition, by picking it up, you're denying the enemy from having it.\n\nSome maps are designed for T-rex deathmatches. These maps have the deadly giant under Axis control. A player from the Axis is randomly selected to be the tyranical beast. As T-rex you move slowly through the streets in a third person view, using a dual machine gun that needs to cool down. The T-rex can also belt out a roar that knocks the human Allies off their feet. Not your allies, I mean 'the Allies.' Once they're off their feet, you can slowly march over to them and eat them for extra health. You'll be lucky to eat someone, it doesn't happen that often. Playing as the T-rex is a lot of fun and even playing against it is a lot of fun. Sure the rex is only on the Axis team, but its balanced to the point where its so giant that all you need to do is run to a smaller area where it can't get you. Then its forced to waste time walking around buildings through giant openings to find where the action went to.\n\nIn all, it might sound like a gimmick, but there is fun here. Not just the premise. The game feels balanced. There are a few ways to play to have your own fun. There are now dinosaurs on both teams so people don't flood to the Axis side saying, 'dinoz yay the new kittenz of the game world!' The developers have updated and upgraded the graphics. The Source engine is a great engine to play a first person shooter. The community is still playing the game. Give it a try again if its not your first time. It has been on sale for $1.","December 18, 2014","true","4.6"," 129 of 147 people (88%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","88","129","147","18","3"

Pitting the Allies vs the Axis in an alternate history where Germany clones dinosaurs to fuel their war effort, the Axis forces have a near monopoly on the Dinos. This doesn't mean that the Allies are any less fun to play though. Trigger, the Allies sole dino is one of the better ones, with a charge ability, and a solid machine gun to use.\n\nPlaying at the Allies is more a straightforward FPS, with relatively standard classes. There is an assault, a sniper, a medic, all the regulars, and they do quite well against the dinosaurs, to the point that with a competitive team, the Axis forces have a bit of a harder time of things. Shotguns end dinos, sniper rifles end dinos from a distance. The Allies have a clear advantage on range in general. With a female french resistance medic, and a female sniper, I am also happy to see that I can play as a woman for once in an FPS. One that isn't merely relegated to a healer or noncombat class. This is pretty rare, and most people won't care, but I think it is pretty cool. Also of note is that several classes have area of effect buffs, such as accuracy or healing, allowing small squads to become even more deadly.\n\nWhere the Allies have an advantage in range and teamwork, the Axis have a huge advantage in variety. Want to be fast and do melee? Try the Velociraptor, which can pounce, and generally kill people (if they are not killed during the feast animation) or the Microraptor, who can glide about the battlefield and spit poison. Want to bring in the big guns? Play as a Stygimolochs with a heavy machinegun or as a Spinosaurus, who is a miniature, low slung tank. On some maps you can even play as the legendary T-Rex.\n\nBoth teams are very asymmetrical, but when dealing with new players, it seems the Allies will always get the win. Learning how to move as a dino is difficult, and many of the more powerful ones are large to the point that missing them is harder than not. My favorite thing is that the Allies are not seen as a writeoff. With some games (Pirates Vikings and Knights II comes to mind) there is a clear preference for the "cool" team, which the Axis easily could have been.\n\nGladly this is not the case, and both teams have excellent up and downsides, encouraging you to play on both sides.","July 24, 2015","true","247.0"," 58 of 65 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","58","65","7","1"

No matter your skill, no matter your system, no matter the class you choose. This game embodies the ultimate dream of all young boys and I can assume many young girls. WW2 mixed with Dinos I mean it's magic! I awaited this game from the moment I heard of it. It's surprising a game like this took so long to come out. But the similarity to UT is what really makes this game fun for old school gamers. Let's be honest ever since Halo and CS ruined gaming forever people have been waiting for a game that isn't realistic. If I wanted to crouch and steady myself before every shot I'd go play paintball. I want to jump and flip like a jackass while some poor sap tries to shoot the ball of rubber I've become. It's simple the matrix was cool that's what I want from a game... any game. That said the graphics are ok at best but the gameplay more than makes up for it. The only real problem I have is getting hung up on walls and corners it's sort of the one button mouse of gaming. A nearly unforgivable sin since it was fixed in most games long ago.

This game has some kind of sarcastic humor and trys to show the people the worldwar-topic on a funny not serious way. Like WTF THE NAZIS ARE SO OVERPOWERED and have MAGICALLY POWER…!!! HAVE YOU HEARED THEY RESURRECTED THE DINOSAURS FOR A NOT STOPABLE DINOSAUR ARMY?\n\nEhm… yes thats the game about. xD\n\nGenre: Multiplayer, first person shooter\nGraphic: 9/10 good graphic with funny details\nAudio: 10/10 realistic sound, historical sound\nTeams: Allied nations and Nazis\nCharacters: 9 different humans, 7 dinosaur classes\nAll with special abilities and weapons (26 classical weapons from WWII).\n\nGameplay: 8/10 for the controls; primary it’s a bit confusing but when you are better with the controls and you have a better overview about the map ist pretty funny.\n\nCons:\nI don’t know why but some controls don’t work for me: For example I looked for the keyboard controls and it said „F = weapon option“ but with a human nothing happens when I press F and when I press F with a dinosaur he pees. O: Really…. He pees!\nAnd the R for reload also doesn’t work for me… I have just played it for 2 hours but it’s still a bit confusing for me (so I would be really happy if someone of you can help me out ^^).\n\nAn other negative aspect in my eyes that there are just a few people playing this game so there are a lot of server with no players and you don’t have much choice on which server you want to play. It’s also sad that there is just ONE Server with BOTS and I asked myself if this server is in china or where because first time I couldn’t connect and the second time I waited for 5 minutes till I connected with 900+ Ping and frozen pictures / teleport (you maybe know this feeling).\nHowever I still think its a good game because I was 2 hours on a good working server with uhm around 20-30 players the whole time and I had a lot of fun.\n\nYou should make your own opinion from the facts but if you play it please let me know!

I bought this game when it was a dollar, but I guess to popular demand it's 10$ now? I don't know, but I will say I would pay 10 dollars if I had to. Very fun game. It's a cartoonish depiction of WWII pitting Allies, and Axis against eachother with an authentic WWII arsenal. There is a spin on the game however... The Nazis have dinosaurs at their disposal.\n\nThe Nazi Dinosaur classes are hours of fun. Whether you are a goat throwing Dinosaur, or a Dino-Snackbar self exploding compy. You will have plenty of fun with the Axis classes. I have to say the Nazi classes are my favorite in the game. The rifleman is my favorite class, but Sniper, and Medic are fun too. On some maps you can even be a T Rex! Equiped with machine guns.\n\nThe Allies have only one dinosaur class, but have some fun Riffleman, and machine gunner classes. I will say however that the Riffleman class is extremely overpowered. (Hardgrave) and gets annoying really quick. You just have to use stealth, because the M1 Garand is extremly OP. The allies are not my favorite class, but fun none the less.\n\nThe game is best known for it's online mulitplayer which is a few game modes. Ranging from Deathmatch to Capture the Flag. The DLC is okay if you have some friends, but is not as fun as the regular online multiplayer.\n\nThere is my review. I highly encourage everyone to get a copy.  See you on the battlefield!","March 4","true","435.2"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"

I dare to say that they are so well done compared to the dinosaurs that you won't even feel the urge to play as a dinosaur despite the fact that the chance to use dinos is available on both sides (yes, the Allies are having a singular dino type as well just for da lolz).\nThe game is just as fun to play as a human as it is as a dino and I'm really glad that they didn't screw this up. It is truly up to the player's skills that what he/she can accomplish as I found myself exterminating everything that moved all over the place once I got the hang of a certain class, let it be a dinosaur or a human.\n\nI, being a dinosaur and Wolfenstein appreciator instantly fell in love with the sheer concept of this thing.\n\nAaaaand pretty much that's it. It's a well balanced Multiplayer based Wolfenstein-ish dinosaur game which is absolutely worth a try if you like any of those things.\n\nOh, did I mention that you can use goats as a physical weapon and they're instakill if you throw them at another player?\nThis game used goats for offensive measures 3 years before Goat Simulator made it cool.","December 7, 2015","true","118.7"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","22","25","4","0"

But I must assume that most likely I won't be playing this much because of the lack of it.\n\nI think the graphics are ok in this game. I don't like most of the games based on Source engine because of it's look, this wasn't the case with this one. At least it's very fluid and there are many servers with people playing in my area so I didn't encounter any lag issues because of high ping.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather plain and I must say I like it that way.\n\nThe setting and the overall feel of the game does have some funny momentum to it as the game doesn't take itself serious what makes it more enjoyable than many other games of the same genre. The sound are ok and it gets you laughing nearly every time you play. Wether this is good in a competitive online first person shooter you must decide for yourself.\n\nAs this game seems to be on sale quite often I can easily recommend it to you if you are into this sort of game.\n\nI would have enjoyed it more if there weren't that damn dinosaurs in it ... but I guess then it would be another game ...\n\nFor a few bucks you can get this game and have quite some fun with it.

I got it for free, didn't expect much from it, but was quite surprised. Would have definetely paid for the old version. Not for the current one, though.\n\nDon't listen to the reviews of people that have sub 10 hours of gameplay on this game and/or bought it recently. They don't know anything about the game. It used to be completely solid and a couple tweaks away from being a very well balanced class based FPS. They basically threw it all away for a COD-like gameplay with better graphics, that is what the major update in the end of 2014 was.\n\nEveryone that buys it now gets the game because they sell it for sub 1$ dollar prices every 2 weeks and  they think "dinosaurs and guns are funn4y, i must buy this cheap game XD" and then play 2 hours and make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review with positive feedback and funny stupid comments, you know, the typical Steam reviews As someone who has 1800+ hours of gameplay on TF2 and 200+ hours on DDD with a couple different accounts, I really enjoy class based FPS games and DDD was for sure my favorite hipster game.\n\nDevs, please, roll back the update. Or at least allow us to play the old version too... Gifting everyone that already had the old version renaming it as "Dino D-day 2014" or something would have been a better idea.\nOr maybe just change the name of the game to COD: Dino D-day. Or... Call Of Dinosaurs: D-Day\n\n\nI will list a few of the problems with the update. I don't have the old version anymore, otherwise i would try and make a video comparison.\n\n\n\n- New branch of the source engine (same as Portal 2, i believe), which changed how the game works entirely (movemement, hitboxes, appearence). It is hard to explain exactly why and what exactly feels off, but they did a very bad job with this change. Imagine switching from CS 1.6 to source (not really the best example since it is source to source)\n\n-Undocumented change to status of weapons and health points. Now sniper rifles do A LOT more damage and can often 1 body hit kill human players (COD). Not to mention many bugs that allow you to shot extremely fast with unscoped sniper rifles, which basically allows you to use it as a shotgun and kill the T-rex and the other giant dinosaur (forgot the name, sorry) very fast.\n\n- Even more bugs with the game launcher/server browser. The game crashes a lot more often now... Principally while entering servers and switching maps. The game will go unresponsive and take several minutes to load a map and sometimes even the SERVER crashes. So yeah, when you have the luck to find a server with more than 10 people playing, eventually it will crash and people won't bother to find a new one, or spread to different servers making it impossible to find a consistently full server to play.\n\n-Changed the HUD to the top of the screen.... really? i would understand if they added an option for people that prefered it that way, but nope, they just randomly decided to force change that. Probably seems like a small thing, but it really affects the game. It is much harder to notice when you are low on health.\n\n------------------------\n\n- Default rates and interp are ♥♥♥♥. as if the small dinosaurs weren't hard enough to hit. (rate 10000, cl_updaterate 20, cl_cmdrate 20, cl_interp 0.1, cl_interp_ratio 2)\n\n- No way to change the zoom sensitivity and scoped sensitivity of guns in a user friendly way, which  makes it hard for people that don't know the console commands to play the game. (scoped_sensitivity and zoom_ratio_sensitivity are the commands)\n\n-cl_fov is completely unlocked. you can easily make a script that allows you to have a sniper like zoom with any weapon.\n\n-viewmodel_fov and r_drawviewmodels locked. makes a lot of sense that they blocked these but not cl_fov... yeah.\n\n- Hardgrave is a broken class. By FAR the strongest weapon in the game, the M1 Garand clearly needs to be nerfed for this game to be playable, principally after the garbage 2014 update. It doesn't even make sense to play as any other class on the Allies, because none are as strong. The damage dealt by it and its fast firing rate make it almost like a semi-automatic kar98 (Streicher's main gun), which has a high damage for a reason, since it is so slow to fire and actually requires you to aim carefully and not just spam like a noob like the M1 garand.\n\n- Oh yeah, and did i mention that after you get 3 kills as the hardgrave you get a "power up" that allows you to become pretty much invincible for 10ish seconds and 1 PUNCH KILL most of the classes? You can even kill the t-rex in 5 seconds with this.

The game had me on the edge of my seat the entire way through! Every time I think of turning the game off something amazing happens and sucks me back in. The only thing I really think this missed out on was deep and envoloping romance, this is just a personal perference that I want all my dinosaur games to have so I was a little disappointed. However the game makes up for lack of romance with it's amazing cast of characters that I have never been more attached to in my life! (they actually make me feel like I have friends) All in all Dino D-Day really captures the Friendship and captivating story most games miss out on. Just wish it had romance :(\n\n8/8 gr8 game.

(BOTTOM HALF) About the game\n\nThis is like COD WAW mixed with Jurasic Park.I personaly am having tooo much fun playing this. spending hours slaying britts with my Velociraptor and Desmatosuchus with a 20mm canon strapped on the back of it.I HIGHLY recommend this game if you are a fan of un-usual FPS games such as Team Fortress 2.AND as for classes there is 7 Allied customizable clases and 9 Axis customizable clases. This game IS NOT! just Dinosaurs vs Humans. Both teams can take Dino's and Human's. It is ESSENTIAL that you have a mix of both if you are wanting to win. This game in my oppinion is a 7.5/10\n\nFun as hell, Much differn't to i first thought.\n\nDino D-Day is a frantic, action-packed multiplayer game that transports you to a World War II that should have been. You and your friends can battle online choosing to serve the cause of the Allied nations or the Nazis. The Allied side includes seven playable characters including Trigger, a Protoceratops rescued from the Nazis. Each Allied class has unique weapons and abilities to use in combat. Gun down a Dilophosaur with your trusty M1 Garand, blast a kamikaze pterosaur out of the sky with your Thompson sub-machine gun, or toss out a dead jackrabbit to lure a raptor into a trap.\nAs an Axis player you will have your choice of three human classes and four dinosaur classes. Ambush your enemy with speed and stealth as the Raptor, mercilessly pound the enemy with a heavy 20mm gun as the Desmatosuchus, rampage through enemy groups as the Dilophosaur or pick up a body and throw it at an enemy for a double kill! Or if you prefer a rifle in your hand, the German soldier classes are the perfect complement to their dinosaur comrades.\nYou’ve played World War II games before…but have you played a World War II game with dinosaurs?","December 16, 2013","true","13.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I think they should never have this game on sale again it should be $50+ the developers deserver much more than $10 (2.49 when its on sale) this game could possibly be the CoD killer with its great graphics phenomenal soundtrack if you thought transistor had a good soundtrack this one beats it by a boston marathon. This game AKA the CoD killer I can almost see into the future and I am going to ditch TF2 for this It has the freezecam everything you'd want. Speaking of TF2 this game is just like it there are like 6 classes (not sure) all different to keep the game fresh you might not like one because of it's race just like me and the demo man (only kidding) and neglect it but then play it when you have invested 600+ hours into the game and it could possibly be your favorite dinosaur in the game. Also if you're going to play this grab some friends out of the 10  minutes that I played this 5 were with my BB and I was dying of laughther but then he just randomly left the server and through his mic all I heard was ALLA ACKBAR hope fully it was just his brother and not the al kiedas so I can keep playing this marvlous game. I'm really wishing he was here right now so I can skip hygeine and sleep to keep playing this and not be spending my time with this poorly structured reveiw. Anyways thats my 3 cents please do your self a favor and buy that for back for you and some pals. If you don't have anyone one to play with just google Rent A Friend and for roughly $20 a person you can have the great expereice this game has! So what are you waiting for man hit add to cart and have some fun!","July 7, 2014","true","1.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It's pretty damn remarkable after nearing 5 years now, this game still gets plenty of love from it's developers, despite its lack of traffic lately. It's a pretty well balanced shooter, and will give you some fine moments. Of course, the dinosaurs are very unique, not many cut and paste popular dinosaurs here. The gameplay, although lacks a variety of maps, is still refreshing for a good 20-30 hours of play before it runs off.\n\nOverall, A pretty damn solid and fun game, get it now! only $0.99!

Dino D-Day offers a somewhat unique outlook on FPS games. I can't think of any other game that involves shooting a gun off the back of a dino. Something that lacked was varity and some style.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/absurdlogic/recommended/70000/","absurdlogic","Absurd Logic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/absurdlogic/","543 products in account","NOTE: I haven't bothered with the Last Stand DLC, so this is only a review for the base game.\n\nAt first glance, I thought this game would be a pass. It had nothing I would typically be interested in: I rarely play MP or co-op because I find the competition/survival aspect stressful, I tend to avoid historically-based war themes (especially involving Nazis), and while dinosaurs are cool, they haven't been a draw for me since I was a kid.\n\nBut as Dino D-Day was free for a weekend, I figured what the hell, I'd give it a shot. The dinos+WWII aspect was at least enough to make me curious.\n\nLo and behold, by the end of the weekend I had sunk over 14 solid hours into the game, half in online MP matches and half messing around in SP with bots to get the hang of classes and mechanics at my own pace ("dinomon" difficulty mode is a hilarious godsend). The fact that achievements unlocked for me even though I didn't own the game yet was pretty cool too.\n\nAs for my dislike for WWII themes, it was surprisingly a non-issue. While in a match the Axis/Allies thing kinda dissolves into the background and simply becomes red vs blue. It helps that they don't flaunt or overuse Nazi-related imagery or buzzwords. There's the occasional themed comment from a character after a kill, but otherwise any blatant "historical" references are primarily in the menu text and voiceovers.\n\nI really like how you can seamlessly switch classes or sides at any point (, and . keys respectively). It's not something I'd abuse if a match/team is working together really well of course, though the game sometimes auto-balances teams and swaps you unwillingly. Not really a biggie, but less fun if you get saddled with teammates who don't know what they're doing. You can always switch back when a slot opens though. :)\n\nWhat sold me however, was how laid back MP matches were. Not at all like your standard CS:GO/Halo-type level of stress and hair-pulling: it didn't feel like there was a competitive urgency in matches, the voice chatting I did hear was free of gratuitous cursing/whining/trash talk, and "newbie abuse" in text chat was very, very minimal. I think the absurdity of the dinosaurs is a big part of all that, honestly. It's difficult to take the game as seriously as one with a completely human cast, so "failure" becomes either amusing/inconsequential or just simply a temporary annoyance till you respawn.\n\nParts of the game were more frustrating, but mainly the class-balancing issues, like how much of an edge Compys and Raptors have over humans based on their size and speed. Being pounced to death over and over can get annoying - especially when you know the people playing the small dinos are just using them because they're easy and OPed, and require almost zero skill to rack up kills. (Obviously that's not always the case, as good players do play small dinos, but you can tell when someone doesn't quite know what they're doing. I'm more impressed when I get sniped by someone from across the map.) Either way, it's still not even close to the amount of stress I expected.\n\nConclusion:\nDino D-Day, despite boasting themes and genre/play-styles I wouldn't normally even take a second look at, managed to enthrall me so much that I bought it. (The 90%-off sale was also a factor, but I actually did want the game.) I even considered the 4-pack, but that kind of requires that one a) has friends, and b) they would even be interested in the first place. I guess I'll stick to making friends in-game for now. :P\n\nBtw, if anyone needs a buddy for some of the trickier two-player achievements (Nigel/Microraptor, Ilona/Raptor, etc), I'll gladly assist.","February 1, 2015","true","14.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Do not let this fool you, though. The game itself is actually quite fun. The game is akin to the play style of TF2 and CS:GO. It offers a few different gamemodes as well as a nice array of characters to choose from (everywhere from run-n-gunners to snipers and...DINOSAURS). The best thing this game has to offer is its raw concept, dinosaurs in WW2. Let me tell you, that stays enjoyable.\n\nIgnore the Critics: The game does have poor reviews from Metacritic and a few notably bad reviews on Steam. Don't let this deter you. These reviews were written a LONG time ago and the game has since fixed (not all but) most of the bugs that ruined gameplay.\n\nShould You Buy?: Personally picked up the 4-pack at $3.00 coming out to 75 cents per copy (90% off). This is a more than acceptable price for the game. I would highly recommend the 4-pack when the game is on sale. Playing with friends is a blast and the DLC (Last Stand) is decent if you have some buds to play with. The DLC is definitely not necessary for you to enjoy the game.\n\nQuick Pros:\n\n-Playing as a dinosaur in WW2 is just as fun as it sounds.\n-Really good deal when it's on sale (90% off).\n\nQuick Cons:\n\n-Small online community.\n-Couple bugs here and there.\n\nAll in All:\n\n8.1/10 Would Recommend (on sale...)","January 20","true","6.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Dino D Day is a funny little indie game that puts you in online multiplayer fights between humans and dinosaurs, axis vs allies. There are dinosaurs and humans for both sides however - unlike primal carnage and extinction. This also means you get less annoying people going AFK so they can switch teams. But anyway, this game is pretty fun and has an amusing story shown through news clippings on loading screens. However everything does a little too much damage, so whatever you are you die pretty quickly. This does get a little annoying...\n\nPositive\n+ Dinosaurs\n+ Team Variety\n+ Lots of game modes\n\nNegative\n- Graphics\n\nConclusionDino D Day is interesting and fun enough but can get very frustrating as everyone dies so quickly, so a lot of your time will just be spent waiting for the respawn screen. Also, there are bots in the game.","February 19, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was released as a digital download, via Steam, on April 8th 2011. The game is developed using Source.\n\nThe premise of the game is that during World War II, Adolf Hitler found a way to resurrect dinosaurs for use in the war effort. Players can battle online choosing to serve either the Allied nations or the Nazis. The game has been described as a new twist on "the overdone World War II FPS ... that has become a running joke in the industry and gaming press".\n\nGAMEPLAY\nDino D-Day is a first-person shooter where players join one of two teams of other players as they attempt to complete their goal. Players have the choice between the Allied nations or the Axis powers, the latter represented by the Nazis and their dinosaur soldiers.Upon the game's initial release, both the Allies and the Axis had six different classes of soldier. The Allied classes range from assault troops, medics and heavy support. However, the Axis have three human and three dinosaur classes. The human classes comprise assault troops, snipers and medics; while the dinosaurs comprise an attack Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus, and a Desmatosuchus with a cannon mounted on its back. Additional classes were added to both teams at later dates bringing the total to seven classes for the Allies and nine for the Axis. The Allies gained a dinosaur class of their own, a Protoceratops with a mounted machine gun. The Axis gained a Stygimoloch with a mounted gun, a Compsognathus that acts as a kamikaze bomber with a grenade and a flying Microraptor. In certain maps, an Axis player can also be chosen at random to play as a Tyrannosaurus with a jaw-mounted machine gun. While powerful, the class counts as three kills in a team death match.\n\nThe initial release consisted of five maps and three game modes that included: team deathmatch, where players must reach a set number of killed enemy players; king of the hill, where teams fight for control of a section of a map; and objective mode, where players are given specific goals to capture including a Fortress Objective where one Axis player takes control of a Styracosaurus with a Panzer IV turret mounted on its back and with his team must make it to their objective point while the allies must stop it with explosives.\n","April 1","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After some time, you'll be given the chance to play as a big dinosaur and make lots of kills (or be just an idiot dino and wander around the map).\n\nHowever, at least without the DLC Last Stand, I couldn't find lots of servers, but I had some fun with it in some of the official servers. And it's obviously unbalanced.\n\nI also experienced some performance issues and long loading times, both unexpected, especially the loading time (in my first play it takes 1 minute to load the map/server, then 30 seconds on the next plays).\n\nAnyway, I really recommend it for it's price.\n\nThis is a 8.0/10 for me.","June 3","true","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Unlike many games set in this time period, this one has a lot of humour to it (even i, who thinks WW2 isn't something to joke about, got quite many laughs when playing this).\n\nAs for the game, what sets it apart from most WW2 games (easy to guess with the name it has) is that it has dinosaurs. You can be a Compsognathus and sneek up on enemies, bite them to death. Or you can be the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex and mow them down with your MG-42, or roar them down, incapacitating them and then eat them up. It's unique and hilarious.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are not the best i've seen, but they're passable. It is obvious that it uses the quite dated source engine, but who cares?\n\nMusic: The music is quite good, it sounds pretty much what you can expect in a WW2 propaganda movie.\n\nOverall, Dino D-Day is a unique experience that i can recommend to anyone. It's of course not as good as some other Source Multi-Player FPS's, like Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but it's nothenless a fun experience. Pick it up if you have the money for it. :)\n\nEnd of this review.","December 1, 2014","true","5.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Nazis alone don't make for an edgy enough plot anymore, and zombies are a garish pink vibrating strap-on of an angle that's been utterly exhausted. Despite this, it still remains on the throne, an idea selling like hot cakes much like that decayed ol' king from warhammer 40K. So, What's next on the list? Dinosaurs? Sure, why not.\n\nMy first impressions are that the game plays rather nicely. Controlling dinosaurs and humans alike  feels fairly fluid, though the 'runts' and humans are fixed in first person while the bigger dinosaurs take third. It would be nice to have the choice if there's variation to begin with. So You've got a mix of human and late cretatious characters to play as, and each team has a fairly unique roster to offer. Unfortunately, it's the Axis that are milking this historical re-jigging for it's worth, as they have around six or seven full dino variants to pick from. Allies only have the one, and the rest of your team is comprised of pink-♥♥♥♥♥ honkeys. This alone can sap the joy out of playing as an American, bar the fact the world hates you, but I wouldn't say it presents a significant disadvantage. I suppose there's just no satisfaction in beating on a dinosaur as a dinosaur, but rather playing Godzilla and crushing the fleeing people on a whim. This is presumably why teams are reversed each round.\n\nMy main gripe with this game as it stands are the maps. They seem lackluster in design and rather sparse. Vantage points are obvious and don't really appear to be very thought out, and you can't even sling a few shells through glass windows. Overall, the game seems a tad shallow and lacking potential for interesting, engaging tactics. It's a pretty standard formula (often likened to Team Fortress 2) with nothing terribly new to offer.\nNevertheless, I can't say it isn't satisfying to flatten a few yanks using a goat flung from your gargantuan jaws, or with another yank that you'd previously managed to keel over. There's fun to be had in this game for sure, but it's a quick, silly fix of entertainment and not one of any real lasting value. Would I recommend the game?

A TF2-like game is always welcomed in my library and I don't like, but LOVE dinosaurs so 10 points.\n\n-You can play as a suicidal bomber. My newest job in TF2 is to scream ALLAHU AKBAR and laugh as they kick me. This will make it funnier to blow myself up. 20\n\n-Runs greatly with normal graphics. I have stated this above. 30 points.\n\n-Huge diversity of characters. TF2 has 9 classes. In this game it's 8 for each team (Allies and Axis). 16 total classes. 40 points!\n\n-Cons:\n\n-Game can be hard for newbies like me. -10 points.\n\n-None other than above. No points.\n\nOverall: 9/10. I'm still exploring the game, so more will be added soon. Also you can grab goats and kill people with them by throwing them wich reminds me of Goat Simulator and thus, a huge boost.","May 30","true","2.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","11","19","3","0"

I have had more fun in Dino D-Day then most other games. Sure the game is in the Source engine, but that's ok, dated grachic's don't make a bad game. The only problem I have with Dino D-day is that there are not that many people playing it, other then when it's got a free weekend. I hope People pick it up more and play it. It's way better then most multi-player games out there. It's one of the few good dinosaur games out there, and the consept is great!

Yes, this game may not have tons of modes or fancy-smancy graphics, but so what? This game is pure fun. It can be summed up as this: Imagine a game that is multiplayer only like Warhawk (PS3) & is a class-based Team Deathmatch game that vaguely looks & feels like a PS2 era Medal of Honor game. Now, here's the twist that you can see a mile away - as the game name suggests, dinosaurs are indeed involved (& yes, I know. It's not historically accurate. Again, who cares?). Specifically, the axis has various dinosaurs that you can play as. Some have guns strapped to them, while other dinos rwly on their claws/talons. If you're tired of the modern era, relatively realistic FPSes like the CoD: Modern Warfare orBattlefield series & want something a little different and semi-retro, give this game a try.","December 20, 2013","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Dino's blend perfectly into the mix, and never do you feel at a disadvantage to the human faction.  For the normal price of $9.99 Dino D-Day is a good investment, and in the case of a sale you just can't beat it.  A great game for online play, and even fun when fighting bots.

The game has issues, the most obvious the lack of people I find a steady amount of people usually you'l see a server list of around 8-10 games being played by players around 4-12, so that's good. There are a lot of empty servers which can be used to play with you'r friends easily. The most irritating problem I had with the game was the game would crash on 1024x768 after a minute of gameplay, and the cursor is known to pop up while shooting from time to time. Should you buy it?

Yes, this game may not have tons of modes or fancy-smancy graphics, but so what? This game is pure fun. It can be summed up as this: Imagine a game that is multiplayer only like Warhawk (PS3) & is a class-based Team Deathmatch game that vaguely looks & feels like a PS2 era Medal of Honor game. Now, here's the twist that you can see a mile away - as the game name suggests, dinosaurs are indeed involved (& yes, I know. It's not historically accurate. Again, who cares?). Specifically, the axis has various dinosaurs that you can play as. Some have guns strapped to them, while other dinos rwly on their claws/talons. If you're tired of the modern era, relatively realistic FPSes like the CoD: Modern Warfare orBattlefield series & want something a little different and semi-retro, give this game a try.","December 20, 2013","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll tell you what could be better. Shooting a bunch of one-testicled Dinosaurian reptiles who have been trained to gun down the enemy and/or throw goats of death at them by Adolf and Fegelein themselves AND can ♥♥♥♥ on you. This is a wonderful game where the objective is to kill these cryptorchidic reptiles before they can rip your face off and ♥♥♥♥ down your throat, or throw goats at you until you are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that you desert the war. Or, on the other hand, if you have ♥♥♥♥ed up- I mean... highly right wing political views, you will have to throw goats at and ♥♥♥♥ on the enemy, but here's the catch, the brits have captured and trained their very own dino as well, and he is out there to kill you along with the stereotypically british/american/french allied troops. Although to be honest, it's not a catch, he in fact has no testicles, as opposed to the mighty cryptorchidic dinosaurian reptiles of the axis. Also, one of the Americans thought it would be fun to circumsize him while he slept. Eugh. Anyway, you must guide your one-balled reptiles into war and have them defeat the nasty hoomans, because, you know, hitler. Make sure you throw enough goats to bring their spirits down, after all, NO ONE wants to see a flying goat covered in blood with bite marks in it screaming as it whacks them in the chest. And don't even get me started on those microraptor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, after all, being Micro isn't always good.\n\n9/10 would get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on by a one balled micro-penised raptor with a goat in it's mouth again","October 29, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","2","2","4","2"

It was released as a digital download, via Steam, on April 8th 2011.\nThe game is developed as a total conversion modification on the Valve Corporation's Source engine.\n\nThe premise of the game is that during World War II, Adolf Hitler found a way to resurrect dinosaurs for use in the war effort. Players can battle online choosing to serve either the Allied nations or the Nazis.The game has been described as a new twist on "the overdone World War II FPS ... that has become a running joke in the industry and gaming press".\n\nUpon the game's initial release, both the Allies and the Axis had six different classes of soldier. The Allied classes range from assault troops, medics and heavy support. However, the Axis have three human and three dinosaur classes. The human classes comprise assault troops, snipers and medics; while the dinosaurs comprise an attack Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus, and a Desmatosuchus with a cannon mounted on its back. Additional classes were added to both teams at later dates bringing the total to seven classes for the Allies and nine for the Axis. The Allies gained a dinosaur class of their own, a Protoceratops with a mounted machine gun. The Axis gained a Stygimoloch with a mounted gun, a Compsognathus that acts as a kamikaze bomber with a grenade and a flying Microraptor. In certain maps, an Axis player can also be chosen at random to play as a Tyrannosaurus with a jaw-mounted machine gun. While powerful, the class counts as three kills in a team death match.","January 8","true","6.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The reason why I bought it was for 3 reasons:\n1. 3 of my friends already owned the game.\n2. It was on sale for less than a dollar.\n3. Most of the reviews were positive, and the ones that weren't were spelled wrong and didn't give me any reason to take their opinions into my decision process (aka they were incredibly stupid)\nBut when I played it, it wasn't that bad. Sure, there are assets and sounds used from other games (ie. TF2), but the game was pretty fun! Raptors were like playing as Hunters in L4D and L4D2, Trigger handled pretty well, and the armored dino was like playing as a tank! Only smaller and more mobility. All in all, give it a shot.

For the price I would pick up CS:GO or something with more polish. I have to say though killing and Nazis and Dinosaurs can never be that bad!\n\nI've found its way easier to play as the dinosaurs/Nazis. Some of the dinos are too small and prove impossible to kill with your gun alone. (Being one is way fun.) You will do more dying in this game than many others. For that reason I can't give it too high of marks.\n\nMultiplayer still has a few servers rocking; these players for the most part have played lots and will crush you at first.

You get to play as one of two sides, the Allies or the Axis.  When you're the Allies, you will play as soldiers, though there is one dino available to play as.  The fun part of the game is when you play as the Axis, since that is where most of the playable dino characters are available.  My favourite dinosaur is the small flying one, and you get to rekt snipers since they never pay attention to their surroundings.  If you like class based shooters, then you'll probably like this game .  If not, then maybe you'll like the dinosaur gameplay.\n\nALSO:  They recently updated the game, bringing it to a newer verison of the Source engine from what I know.  There is also a new DLC called Last Stand which is just survival, seems cool but I haven't gotten it yet.","January 30, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I played a few years ago there weren't a lot of other people playing, so there's that.\n\nBalance, eh.  A lot of classes, particularly the dinosaurs, just seemed straight up more powerful than other classes.  But then, it also feels like tf2, where the classes aren't supposed to be equal: they're supposed to counter one another, so it's hard to say they might not be balanced.  I'm not really sure, but I know most of the people only played one or two classes so that definitely helped contribute to feeling like some weren't very useful.\n\nGraphics aren't the best and totally feel dated, but I think that's for the best as it gives the game more of an early 2000 feel.   The gameplay matches that aesthetic so all is well.\n\nBut yeah, I had a lot of fun with this.  Very silly game.","July 5, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found learning the controls a bit tricky and the in-game help was a bit hit and miss on that front (perhaps it is geared more toward people who have fps experience rather than a beginner), but the game itself is pretty forgiving.\n\nMy chief complaint with the game is the load time - I am used to tabbing in and out of games and found I needed to do it on this one to try and look up help with the controls. Trying to tab back in? Forget about it. The screen can take a number of minutes to load again, and with quick games this can mean you're out for an entire session (your teammates *love* that).\n\nThe group I was playing with also was having a very difficult time setting up our own game with our own controls (we wanted to play in a group with a bunch of bots as our first experience with D D-D), and we never did manage to do it.\n\nIn spite of the little quibbles, this game really is a lot of fun. I laughed quite a bit at someone in the chat complaining that the gun on his dinosaur wasn't as accurate as he wanted it to be because, well, Nazi dinosaurs.\n\ntldnr; NAZI DINOSAURS.

Its far better than some would have u belive and is also very playable on a pad (certain classes suited more than others , I did very well for a first try with a pad) . Its very fun for a few hours at a time . I have only played one decent session with a most classes (no idea how to be a big trex yet) but will be back for more fun many times .. If we were back in the 80s/90s I would of spent my money 5 times over in the arcade already so walking away on day one chuffed . And many players . Not loads but at least 4 to 5 full rooms at all times I was on (early evening) with many more half full lobbies , which I found abit more stealthy and fun\n\nIf u see it cheap then just grab it . If u Really Really love dinosaurs I see no reason why a full price purchase wouldnt satisfy your dino thirst . And if u are kinda sick of the same old modern shooters and miss the old days abit .

However, I would happily pay for this game.\n\nAs a kid, I am sure you would often play with your dinosaur toys and your army-men action figures. You probably had some crazy scenario where the bad guys controlled the dinos and the good guys were the army men trying to stop the bad guys.\n\nThis is that game.\n\nThis is the awnser to a question I never knew I had, and that question is "What would I call the Peak of humanity?"\n\nBrilliant gameplay, great ingame chatter between the NPCs, and amazing matches.\n\nI never knew I wanted to be a 25 foot T-Rex with Gattling guns strapped to the side of my head before today.","July 2, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely unusual.\n* They just gave away a million copies on PCGamer, so its no longer dead.\n* It's sense of humour is great.\n\nCons -\n* Parts of the interface look like they are ripped straight from TF2\n* [Scratch that, found a setting in graphics. By default it has a "film grain" setting turned on, it makes a mess of graphics and I recommend getting rid of it.] Graphics don't look anything as good as in the promo-pics on the steam page.\n* T-Rex aren't actually truly playable. There is just a rare random chance on some servers (not sure which) that someone may be picked to be one.\n* Pricey for what it is.\n\nConclusion?

I looked it up on Metacritic before committing, and saw it was only 55% with lots of negativity, but I loved the concept so installed it.  Some 3 hours later I'm only stopping playing because it's now early AM and somehow the time has flown by, mostly with a big cheesy grin on my face.  Sure the graphics aren't AAA super-realistic, but that if anything adds to the appeal and the fun - the stupid, stupid fun. In what other game can you play as a veloceraptor and  hurtle round the map in a very alien-esque fashion causing mahem?  Or as a human run screaming from a tiny compy that's chasing you with a grenade strapped to its back.  Or spawn as a giant T Rex with machine guns?  Or bust out a flame thrower just when a dino thinks it has the better of you?  Or beat the stuffing out of a dinosaur with your bare fists?  Or kill someone by spitting on them and then dino-wee on their dead corpse.\n\nHaving playing this game, I say absolutely is it worth a few quid if you like quirky teamplay FPS.

However, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. There are strengths and weaknesses in both groups which helps balance everything out. The levels are pretty fun and inventive and smooth to play through (though sometimes the Dinos get stuck on objects... especially the big ones!). The graphics are also very nice, and the little details that they put into the Character models are pretty cool too... the T-Rex's belly jiggles when she moves! All in all, I am very happy to have bought this game and have a lot of fun playing whether I win or lose. But... remember that this is all coming from someone who hasn't played a shooter game since 2009. So I can't compare it to other games and have no other shooter gaming experience.\n\nAs with most online shooters, your experience will vary depending on whomever is on the server at any given game.

When it first came it out was overpriced, glitchy and insubstantial, but since then it's improved a great deal. The developers are obviously pationate about the project, and it is quite a bit of fun. It's a surprising amount of fun to control a machine gun firing T-Rex, a kamikazee Compy, and especially to throw a sheep at a soldier's face as the Dilophasaurus.

While Allies only have 1. I think there should be more variation and make things balanced. Just my opinon. Plus there is the 40mm dino that is to OP, although spamming it is alot of fun. It also hurts the game when its easy to spawn camp the other team, and vice versa spawn camp at your own base. But overall this game is fun, its casual, and with the right people it can be a good game to play at any night.","February 21, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter how fun it is, the game needs these to be great.\n\nLuckily, the controls are very tight and the game seems very balanced.  Each class is unique, and the dinosaurs are great to control and are more than just gimmiky, they offer great loadout options and are great for gameplay.  Furthremore, while the Nazis have dinosaur classes, the other human classes have a wide range of weaponry to counterack the dino-threat.  Playing as humans in this game is not as boring as you would think it is.\n\nIf you like TF2, then you'll really dig this game.  It feels like a TF2 with dinosaurs, as you'll often see every class from TF2 implemented in this (Save for the engineer and spy).  Whether or not you want to spend 10.00$ for a class based shooter that plays similarly to TF2(Which is free), that is up to you.  However, if you're itching for another multiplayer shooter where you can play as Nazi dinosaurs, or just looking for a really good time, then pick this game up!\n\nKim Jong Un Approves.","February 1, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the humor is just enough to serve as the draw, not the reason to stay. Despite the complaints of many, the classes are quite well balanced, and there is a wealth of fun to be had experimenting with the dinosaurs as well as the humans; that's right, in a game with DINOSAURS, they managed to make humans fun to play as. There is a skill to each class as well: snipers have to hide well, machinegunners have to press back against those DAMN little dinoaurs, dinos without guns must combine stealth with brute force, and the little dinsaurs have to watch out for explosives or shotguns (while everyone else cowers in terror before them). There are issues with polish, but the gameplay is worth the occasionally muddy textures, and (with the current $0.99 sale) it is perfect for budget gamers; it's a Source game after all. Players used to more high-end products may scoff, but hey, dinosaurs in Battlefield are an Easter egg; here they are reality. And don't get me started on the hilarious loading screens and radio announcements on the title screen. This game has grown a lot since 2011 (when it was, admittably, not very good) and it's worth a shot for anyone. Take advantage of the sale, and hope to see you in the field (you filthy Hun!).\n\nP.S. With the recent sale, the community is ever-growing, and we would appreciate any further enlistment!","January 30, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The multiplayer is fairly balanced, as camping snipers/soldiers can get mauled by a walking tank triceratops. The dinosaurs are mostly adorable and don't know how a 44 HE Shell doesnt rip off a back of a teeny dino, but y'know, logic. There are quite a fair lot of maps, and a decent set of modes. My favourite one is the T-Rex mode. Also you can lob sheep at people.\n\nGraphics - Pretty meh, the game mostly depends on the Source Engine\n\nMultiplayer - Hands down, one of THE most fun experiences you'll have.\n\nIn final, is said game worth 10 euros? In my case, pretty solid. If you want you can wait for a Steam Sale, as they are common with Source games (CS:GO, CS:S, L4D2...)\n\nFinish rating: 79.5%","March 7, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if you already have a ton of FPSs, then I do recommend skipping it, as it really isn't anything too special. That being said though, it actually is pretty okay. It has pretty common updates, so that's a plus, as well as trading cards and achievements, if you like those. The diversity between the teams is also pretty cool, as the Allies are mostly humans, so you can play it like a generic FPS if you want, but the Axis is where the game REALLY shines. They have dinosaurs for all kinds of people. Like rushing in with a machine gun? They have that. Want to literally BE a tank? You can do that.\n\nAlthough, as I mentioned earlier, it does have some flaws. Most notably, it can be pretty hard to find a populated server, and it doesn't have great graphics, if you care about that.\n\nTL; DR:  It's actually a pretty decent game, as long as you look past the obvious flaws.","May 13, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's essentially TF3, good classes, simple and fun gameplay, and I just LOVE the concept of a WWII with a T-rex and 5 velociraptors running around reking everything.\nHowever, that can be a problem, the game is fun, but the Nazis are slightly op, because they have an army of small, fast, quick-hitting, and deadly dinosours on their side. (not to mentain a mother♥♥♥♥ing T-rex.) so they have a huge upper hand. And the only way to combat this is if the Allies have blast or fire weapons.\nWhich they do, but they either reload slowly, kill the user as well, or are confusing to get to. (the game has no real tutorial or really tells you haw to get around the menus, so it may be a while untill you find a way to change your ♥♥♥♥ing weapons.)\nother than that, the only real complaints are that there isn't enough customization, cmon Dino D-Day, at least give us 10 new weapons to choose from instead of the same boring ♥♥♥♥. there's no weapon shop or anything of that manner. so your stuck with the basic couple of weapons that can be switched out to a couple different weapons. there's no more than 10 weapons, and probably not even that much, so don't expect much variety in combat.\nOther than that, it has it's flaws, but the gameplay itself is fun and fast-paced. All I can really say is, if you get stuck with allies, choose the flamethrower piot. =P","March 1, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get to play as one of two sides, the Allies or the Axis.  When you're the Allies, you will play as soldiers, though there is one dino available to play as.  The fun part of the game is when you play as the Axis, since that is where most of the playable dino characters are available.  My favourite dinosaur is the small flying one, and you get to rekt snipers since they never pay attention to their surroundings.  If you like class based shooters, then you'll probably like this game .  If not, then maybe you'll like the dinosaur gameplay.\n\nALSO:  They recently updated the game, bringing it to a newer verison of the Source engine from what I know.  There is also a new DLC called Last Stand which is just survival, seems cool but I haven't gotten it yet.","January 30, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Playing as the various types of dinosaurs is seriously fun and they are all different enough to give good variety to the gameplay. I was surprised at how solid the gameplay as the soldiers was as well. The gameplay reminds me of kind of like Day Of Defeat mixed with the Versus Mode from Left 4 Dead, except with dinosaurs instead of zombies.

The learning curve is... well, gone, as there aren't really any actual tutorials, but its controls aren't much different from any other FPS.\n\nI would like to return to the comedic value of the game.\n\n- You get to shoot dinosaurs with guns attached to their heads.\n\n- You get to shoot, AS A DINO, with guns on your head.\n\n- You can either battle or BE a freakin' Nazi dinosaur.\n\nI believe this game's main humor is in that it DOES take itself so seriously (Which I see as a joke in itself). There are some implements of humor that were meant and obvious, such as death taunts and an action a dino can do to a human when he's knocked over (Don't think too dirty here. Just a little bit). But, that's enough of the humor.\n\nThis game is smooth to play, and has rather good graphics. You can communicate with your team through a Microphone, and having a simple, FPS shooter with no extra equipment or hats or whatever is actually quite a change after some heated MMO battle.\n\nNow for the bad part, the Cons.\n\nThe AI of this game is really, really annoying. It's either really smart, sometikmes even flanking you, or it just sits there while you snipe at it, which can be disastorous for the other team in the mode of deathmatch. Plus, sadly, over at least a year or two no new maps have ben added, and no new dinos or characters, so don't be expecting many huge updates.\n\nOver all, I love this game, and it's taken a place in my heart as one of the best games I've ever played. I hope you find it just as well","June 20, 2015","true","112.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

There's no unlocking anything or improving weapons. You start the game with everything and it's just straight up who is better. Snipers are AWESOME and actually require some degree of skill. Also there's some dinos with guns strapped to their back. Random game modes on random maps. Changes it up quite a bit. It's never TDM over and over. Scoring is off for the rounds. You switch sides but the sides themselves are scored, not the teams that control the sides. So if it ends in a tie for the match, it can mean one team was just dominent.","January 2, 2014","true","70.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found learning the controls a bit tricky and the in-game help was a bit hit and miss on that front (perhaps it is geared more toward people who have fps experience rather than a beginner), but the game itself is pretty forgiving.\n\nMy chief complaint with the game is the load time - I am used to tabbing in and out of games and found I needed to do it on this one to try and look up help with the controls. Trying to tab back in? Forget about it. The screen can take a number of minutes to load again, and with quick games this can mean you're out for an entire session (your teammates *love* that).\n\nThe group I was playing with also was having a very difficult time setting up our own game with our own controls (we wanted to play in a group with a bunch of bots as our first experience with D D-D), and we never did manage to do it.\n\nIn spite of the little quibbles, this game really is a lot of fun.

It is based on performance, not graphics(which I prefer). You basically take part in online battles; choosing to be the Axis or the Allies. Most people will choose the Axis because they have the majority of the dinosaurs. The Allies are more soldier based, only having one dinosaur. Overall, besides a few glitches here and there, it is a great game.\n\nP.S. Goats are awesome.","December 19, 2013","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can get it on sale for $1 and it is entertaining but I don't feel it's something that can be played for a very long time. May be wrong about that though.\n\nPros:\nOnly $1 on sale\n\nFunny\n\nThey have a tiny dinosaur that has a stick grenade taped to it's back to suicide bomb. That falls under funny but it deserves it's own.\n\nCons:\nMost servers seem empty, only like 3-4 populated ones.\n\nMy ping will randomly jump from ~40 to over 800, it did this in every server and turned the game into a slideshow making me a free target for the other team.\n\nThe axis gets most of the dinosaurs and the allies only get one. This wouldn't be too terrible if 2 of the axis dinosaurs weren't microscopic and a pain in the ♥♥♥ to shoot.\n\nThe teams aren't exactly mirror copies, obviously because axis gets the most dinosaurs you'd expect that. The allies have a flamethrower which the axis has no similar class for, meanwhile the axis raptor is close to an assassin since you can pounce people for a near instant kill. The most annoying part is that the classes that do exist on both sides aren't necessarily lined up. Both teams have snipers and medics for example but when your team switches you'll be something else because they're not in the same location on the selection screen.\n\nSo-So:\nThe graphics aren't the best but that's to be expected.\n\nSome of the gun animations look like crap to me.\n\nA bit odd is that some dinosaurs are 3rd person and others are 1st person.\n\nCommunity, I put this hear because I couldn't get a read on them. Some of the chat seemed joking and friendly but then other times it's a flame fest I tried to ignore, and I had to turn voip off because I couldn't take the stupid conversations.","March 7","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The moment i loaded the game i wasn't really expecting much, oh how i was in for a treat. I got into a game and i chose a Compy as my first character. As soon as i spawned i screamed like a fangirl, it was amazing. I spent the first hour screaming over the characters you can spawn as and the abilities they have. It seems to be themed around  WWI/WWII but with a twist of the opposing teams to have dinos as their allies.I totally recommend this game to everyone, you can even kill defensless goats and pretend your doing a satanic ritual, i mean you can throw them. Heh heh.

Now, when I say "fun," I mean that it is FUN.  Pure, unadultered FUN.  It's the sort of game where you can play as an exploding compsognathus, which should say enough.  Of course, there are some people out there who want realistic, serious games.  People who get offended because someone else's dinosaur does not match what they pictured as said dinosaur.  This game is very tongue-and-cheek about everything it does.  It's a war game with dinosaurs, and it knows it.  It's a beautiful sense of humor that also makes this game a winner.  As well as the community; it's a small, friendly group of people who will help you out if you're a beginner.  In short, if you have a sense of humor and a love of dinosaurs, then this is the game for you.","December 27, 2011","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some of the controls aren't completely obvious making it a little hard to play the very first time you play but once you have played a game or two it's easy enough to learn from there.\n\nOne thing that makes fights very interesting is the varied time to kill between classes. Some classes will take siginificantly more time to kill however it is easy to do constant damage where as others have a low time to kill but a longer set up and lower health. These combine to make the game very interesting. There are some issues where there are a handful of classes that give better results to skill ratio than others but seing as these classes have limitations at higher levels of play they can't quite be called OP. This game reqwards tactical and strategic thinking and team work but these aren't necessary to play at the average level of ability.","October 21, 2015","true","65.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
