Its unique gameplay mechanic involves utilizing two throw-able axes as climbing tools while managing their cooldowns.\n\nGameplayPlatforming\nAfter a quick slideshow introduction, a tutorial guides the main character through the first area. The player’s move-set includes 2-D movement, jump, sprint, sprint-jump, attack and throw. The sprint-jump is able to be processed with almost no movement space, ideal for areas littered with stationary spikes and small amounts of wiggle room. Along with jumping onto them, throwing the axes will also damage enemies. The respawn time for each axe seems to be about a few seconds, which also happens to be the approximate amount of time an axe will stay lodged into a wall for stepping purposes. This cooldown management provides a method of chaining multiple axes together to provide traversal up larger walls. Currently absent, it would be nice to implement some sort of cooldown meter for each axe to help plan out the next move.\n\nLevel Design\nTraditional platforming elements are included, such as: moving platforms, stationary/dynamic spikes, melee/ranged enemies, boulders, cliffs etc. Elements of side-scrolling endless runners are glittered throughout the game starting upon triggered events (rolling balls, geysers etc.), such as: falling ceilings, collapsible floors/platforms, chasing objects, jump obstacles etc. Combined with sequences requiring axe throws or axe jumping, this game can get very difficult extremely fast.\n\nCheckpoints\nA checkpoint is provided in each level to help alleviate the difficulty. Once the checkpoint is crossed, it’s not possible to go backwards, making coin collection a bit pointless. Upon death, everything is reset to the beginning of the level/checkpoint. This includes removing any obtained items/keys or coins. Most of the time spent in this game will be tediously running back to the two or three difficult sections of each level. Methods of reducing the tedium without removing the difficulty would be to either shorten the extraneous level length, or provide more checkpoints at difficult to reach locations/off the main path.\n\nPresentationGraphics\nThe graphics and aesthetics for Where's My Helmet? is very cutesy and dense. Elements of Nordic culture are implemented with the snowy scenery, along with boxes and barrels presumable filled with ale, and various runes observed throughout the game. Brighter tones are used for the most part, contrasting with many of the other difficult platformers out on the market that use eccentric colors and undertones.\n\nGame Options\nThe game only contains three configurable options: SFX, Music, and Full screen. These options can also only be turned on or off, no sliders are present for variable modification. Having this type of configuration is a bit primal as the music and sounds effects can get really tiresome at times (it’s the violins), yet maintaining some form of audio feedback is desired for precise platforming.\n\nAnother disconcerting feature is with regards to starting a new game. There is no confirmation input required, only one save slot is used at a time, and the button to start a new game is located immediately above the button to continue the game.\n\nControlsController Support\nWhere's My Helmet? contains full controller support, but the controls are not as integrated as they should be. For instance, the tutorial only presents keyboard prompts. Also, there is no method of varying the reticle/aim sensitivity. This makes playing with a controller extremely difficult for certain sections of the game, especially when two axes must be immediately thrown (while in mid-air jump) into a wall for stepping purposes. It is almost as if the game was only intended for M&K users. Initially playing with a controller, after switching to a M&K, the controls seemed to be a little more fluid, yet not having any mouse sensitivity controls is rather off-putting.\n\nPrecision Handling\nThe biggest downfall of this game pertains to precision handling. With the difficult nature of the platforming sequences, a poorly designed controls system makes playing this game way too frustrating. Too many deaths are caused from poorly designed controls rather than player skill. Some of the prime examples of this game’s poor precision handling are listed below.\n\nExamples of Poor Precision Handling:\nNo aim/reticle/mouse sensitivity option\nCharacter must come to a complete stop before attacking is allowed\nAxe hitbox/image map is too small; requires throwing at a much lower distance to ensure successful use as a stepping tool\nConclusionCurrent State of the Game\nCurrently, there seems to be no effort in fostering community feedback – a necessity for blooming indie developers. There are no pinned threads in the Steam Discussions for updates, announcements, suggestions, bug encounters or planned improvements. Nothing is seen in the Steam News section either; however, Where's My Helmet? was just recently released (as of the posting of this review), so the player base is still growing.\n\nVerdict\nIt is very difficult to find an audience that can manage to overlook the frustrating and imprecise controls in order to enjoy this game. It is imperative for any challenging, difficult or eccentric platformer to have precise maneuverability and handling of the character, otherwise, deaths will start to manifest from poor design instead of a player’s skill. Even taking the game’s low price point into consideration, Where's My Helmet? is not recommended for the ordinary gamer at this point in time. This game has so much potential though, that if the precision handling and gameplay options were improved/implemented, this review might change.\n\nFollow Giveaways Reborn curator for more reviews\nThis game has been given away in Giveaways Reborn","May 22","false","1.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"
