This is not the original disk version of the game that was released by other publishers instead it's been optimized for tablets and ported over to the PC. The mouse controls run too fast and there is no way to adjust this. The way you advance through some scenes makes it impossible or next to impossible to advance to other areas of the game. It's like you almost have to click through everything in the scene your in just to see if something happens where your character can advance. Some NPC characters in game you interact with have limited amounts of animation, but mostly have speech bubbles with audio voice overs. At least most of the FMV is here. Shame since this is a great game that you may want to play through once more - but only if all the bugs present in this game are gone.","April 27, 2014","false","0.2"," 68 of 76 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","68","76","0","3"

You'll find yourself tracking down tiny prerequisites you missed a lot. Kind of a hellish experience when dealing with such a linear game, especially considering it's imo one of the most enjoyable point and clicks I remember ever playing, plotwise.\n\nYou'd be a lot better off tracking down a disk version of the game.","May 30, 2014","false","5.7"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","50","54","0","0"

You can pick up the first 3 of the series for 10$.\nSecondly this is a good game you should definately check it out BUT get it from gog.com.\n\nStory is certainly interesting and the graphics aren't half bad, but unfortunately it's a cheap IOS version. This isn't the full game and really waters down the gameplay which makes you really miss out on some key mechanics. I was extremely disappointed to see that this was the case but figured I would stick it out anyway as I had bought on sale. Puzzles, dialogue, and danger have all been cut from this release. There are only 2 areas where you can actually die, but given the system for progress you'll  litterally just come back to the moment prior to said demise. As for the gameplay itself it will allude to what you need to do but there were a few moments where I was just entirely lost. Trying to refer to a walkthrough is difficult as they point you to the puzzles that are absent here. There's just too many headaches here to warrant this purchase on steam when you could get the same thing and more from the gog release.","August 3, 2014","false","4.4"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","8"

FIrst it was The Last Sanctuary, THEN RESURRECTION. AND NOW THE PATH OF THE DRAGON...

These games were known for being puzzle games. Well, they've removed the puzzles from this version. That means you're going along playing when suddenly you hit a snag because you have a feeling you're supposed to do something to progress. Except the thing you're supposed to do has been removed or - worse - half removed. I spent this entire game bumbling through almost-puzzles that made no sense. You better hope you don't get stuck on a "puzzle" because any walkthrough you find will be useless, since the "puzzle" you're working on will be some ramshackle version of the one from the full game.\n\nI was very excited to play this game, but was not excited to experience a game so hacked up and broken it's virtually unplayable.","December 26, 2014","false","8.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

At first, playing the first and second games, I was skeptical because of the graphics. Then, I saw there was a third that was released in better times with much better graphics... AND HOLY CRAP DID IT BLOW!\n\nLet me just get something off of my chest here... I REGRET buying this game. It- it shouldn't even be considered a game! No, a game is multi-graphical art that includes puzzles and/or problems to solve, missions to complete. THIS! This piece of trash is a clutter of shredded pieces of puzzles and missions that are incomplete! Do NOT even try to use a guide, you'll get even more lost and confused... because THOSE are guides to the REAL game, NOT THIS MONSTROSITY!\n\nI looked up the real game. It is LITERALLY $2.67 (plus shipping) on amazon.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dreamcatcher-16694-WRP2-Dracula-3-Dragon/dp/B001SSKJB8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1448173681&sr=8-1&keywords=dracula+3+path+of+the+dragon\n\nSee? I ain't lyin'!\n\nThe game is messed up on an atomic scale. ALL of the immersement is gone! Even talking to the NPCs has been watered down to freakin' speech bubbles... SPEECH BUBBLES! This wasn't done in the first two games at all! IT WAS ALL ANIMATED!\nNO! Just... no.\n\nWho did this? Who? And why? Seriously, why?\nWhy ruin a game and take out everything that's good about it and leave this shriveled husk of a... "non-game".\nWas it too costly to just take the entire game and put it on today's modern PCs for everyone to play?\nNope, not all.\nI mean, on Amazon, again, the actual ENTIRETY of the game for PC DOWNLOAD is only $9.99.\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dracula-3-Path-Dragon-Download/dp/B00895AJN6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1448173681&sr=8-2&keywords=dracula+3+path+of+the+dragon\n\nFreakin' worth it than wasting hours playing this piece of crap!\n\nDo yourself a favor, always read the reviews of games you put onto your wishlist. It'll save you a lot of money.\nI may have gotten this for less than a dollar, but hey, that could have gone to a much better game.\n\nIn Conclusion: THIS GAME IS A WASTE OF MONEY.\nI'd advise you to NOT purchase this game. At least until Steam finds that ONE piece of their brain they lost when they let this piece of garbage be sold. If Steam can fix this and put the REAL PC version of this game up for us to enjoy, purchase it when that day comes. As for now, go look at better games than this.\n\nIf you like vampire games, go look at Vampire Bloodlines: The Masquerade or Vlad the Impaler or ANYTHING BUT THIS GAME!!!\n\nHopefully you've read this before purchasing the game. And I hope this review helped you to the fullest extent.\n\nThanks for reading and happy gaming to you!","November 21, 2015","false","3.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This visually is better than 1 & 2, but the story and horror aspect is just as weak.\n\nIt implements a slight hint system, which helps offset how buggy the game is, but it's not enough.\n\nI'll not give you any spoilers but I would say it's a better game than 1 & 2, but that isn't setting the bar very high.  I wish it was scary, or tense, or something. Yes it's a point n click which makes it hard to build atmosphere but still.\n\nI encountered a few bugs and even a crash.  I got past all but the last one, and that was because I was tired of working for this game.  To me it's not horror enough to be fun.  The puzzles don't add enough to the story to make it worth them being there, the cut scenes could add so much .... but they just keep the story plodding along.\n\nThis game is 8 years old and that's fine. But there is just so many little things I don't like about this game for me to give it a thumbs up.\n\nGrab it only when it's $0.25 or less and be prepared to be underwhelmed (in widescreen though).\n1¢ Review Pro:\nNow in 16::9 HD\nBetter graphics than 1 & 2\n\nCon:\nJust as weak of a story as 1 & 2\nPort, port, port, remake\nBuggy\n\nOverall: 5/10 -1 story, -1 buggy = 3/10","May 29","false","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I like being part of a good story but pausing it to solve a tile puzzle or anything like that seems just an annoying way to prolong it. So this version on Dracula 3 was really enjoyable. It has a pretty decent story, much more interesting and twisty that the one of "Dracula Origins" that i recently have played, that flowed like a charm.\nBUT, the port was SO AWFUL! By removing the puzzles, they completely messed up the continuity, like they just deleted parts of the game and stitched up the rest together. The gameplay was a real pain to get used to and not get dizzy, the backgrounds were pretty decent but the characters were extremely low-rez with no lip movment, voice performances were pretty good but they lacked sound quality and the sound was like a 5-second atmospheric music that looped again and again.\nDid I enjoy it? Yes. Did it really ♥♥♥♥ me of with all the sloppiness? Definitely. Can I recommend it to someone? Only if they know what to expect and they are prepered to forgive all the crap for a good story.","September 3, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
