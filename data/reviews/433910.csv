The game looks so awesome...i mean ‘radical’. The game will test your reaction time, your twitch reflexes and your timing as well as memorization of where the obstacles are in a level.\n\nGraphics:\n\nAs it’s name “Neon Drive” and being an 80’s inspired theme, everything is neon, the car is neon, the road is neon, the obstacles is neon and it looks EPIC. I mean when i started this game I literally said out loud “woah!”. Superb graphics. The game is pure eye candy. I was constantly getting above 100 FPS with V-Sync off. Game is smooth as silk. Such type of game requires the smoothest gameplay because timing really matters in this game. Even the start menu is really nice and the level selection screen are a bunch of arcade cabinets. The backgrounds in each level also look amazing, from city skylines, to abstract art to night skies. All of them look beautiful and pleasing to the eyes.\n\nSound:\n\nTotally awesome 80’s techno music. Each level features it’s own track and all of them are equally good. I especially like the 1st and 6th level tracks. It’s got awesome sound track and I don’t even lick techno music that much but this music was really cool.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGame is basically different modes e.g one is where you’re in third person and you have to avoid obstacles coming your way. Another mode is top down view where you have to avoid cars. There is also modes where you get to go on a plane and even a 2d robot scrolling mode etc. There are 4 lanes which you can move in, the timing of your lane switch matters as if you do it too soon or too late you will crash into the obstacle and die. Once you die you restart the game from beginning of the level or if you have reached the checkpoint, you’ll start from there. Usually the checkpoint is at 50% through the level. Level 7 is quite unique as in that level you’re on a dynamometer and 2 robot arms are producing blocks in different lanes and you must avoid those. That said there is a lot of variety so you won’t get bored doing the same thing over and over.\n\nThere are 7 levels total and you can play them in any order. I highly suggest start with the first one as it’s one of the easiest, later levels are extremely hard. There’s 3 difficulty modes in every level, normal, hard and insane. The normal and insane difficulties are locked and once you beat the level in normal mode these will unlock. The hard and insane difficulties will increase the speed of the car. This game is very hard and will test your reflex, reaction time, timing and short-term memory (and patience :P )\n\nThere’s also an endurance mode which lets you play all the 7 levels in order back to back. So you can even beat all the levels in one sitting if you’re skilled enough.\n\nLevels 1-3 will give you the same car but in different colors, the last 4 levels will give you a different car in each level. You can also customize your car number plate with upto 4 letters. Just scroll to the left in the main menu and edit the number plate.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682621768\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nA very fun arcade type game with 80’s theme and music. Can be difficult so if you like a challenge this game is the one for you. Definitely recommended.

P.s. this is not really *racing* game, its a rhythm game.\n\n+Visuals - are solid 10/10, there are 7 different *areas* you play, and each has its own neon style and its very own feature, so every other level is special.\n+Music - simply awesome, instant addition to your winamp playlist for a long time + all the music tracks has very solid bit which is good for rhythm based games\n+Variety of different styles - each level has its very own design, you can find them in the trailer.\n+3 difficulties - 1st of all this game is very hard at least for now at the lowest difficulty - the choosen difficulty sets the speed of the level something like 75%-100%-125% so music goes faster as well as obstacles so you have to react faster and stuff. (At normal difficulty you have 1 live now)\n+Practice mode - it has VHS filter for visuals and sound and unlimited lives, so awesome i'd rate 5/7\n+Endure mode - infinte mode where you have to survive as long as you can\n+Steam achievements\n+Steam cards - backgrounds, badges and emotes are awesome (backgrounds that you can find in the games website or in the game menu)\nUpd 23.05\n+There were the issue when on different PC you had music desynced from the obstacles, now you can correct this if you have delay by increasing of decreasing the music delay (+ -). So insane difficulty relies only on your skill now :)\n\n\nWhat can i say after all - you can run from the 80's, but you cant hide!","May 15","true","12.0"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","17","23","2","0"

Many complain about the difficulty but it's really all about muscle memory, like most rhythm games. However timing is everything with this game, so unless one is pin point precise with their key strokes, some may struggle with the very steep learning curve. If you feel up to the challenge of learning how to adapt to this title’s difficulty, then eventually you’ll breeze through the levels no problem. Alongside it’s engaging presentation and aesthetic this game can be very satisfying...that is, if you have the grit and the patience to give it a chance.","May 22","true","22.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's difficult, yes. It's VERY difficult, especially comparing to modern PRESS X TO WIN games. No wonder there are so many negative reviews complaining about Neon Drive's difficulty - kids novadays just don't have any will and ability to surpass difficulties. This game is perfect for any gamer who like and want a real challenge - when you try for like 50 times and finally complete the level - it is the only way to have a real satisfaction and to feel that you've really earned your victory. 99% of modern games don't give you that feeling.\n\nGameplay itself is simple, but very good - I just wish there were more levels. 2-part levels with totally different gamedesign must be the highlight of this game - developers showed a massive creativity here and I hope they have a few more ideas for the future. Music is just awesome - it fits game perfectly and it's really good for listening outside of the game.\n\nSo far I've completed all levels on all difficulties and without any checkpoints and I have only endurance mode left to be beaten. Definitely want more levels :)\n\nSince I've bought the game there was only 1 update that fixed music sync and also my personal problem with launching on the wrong display on my setup (thanks for the quick fix!), but game seems to be very promising on future updates.\n\nI'm all yours for the paid sequel with more awesome levels and challenges.","May 24","true","14.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","2"

Neon Drive captures some kind of retro many faux 8bit and 16bit remakes miss: it is a modern game that evokes the arcade spirit of Outrun and marries it to some pretty sweet, extremely tight rhythm-gaming. Two buttons (that's all there is, folks) meet two gazillion color explosions.\n\nBut apart from the excellent neon graphics, it is the level design that wins it. Each level is carefully built, with a bit of a slow starter to set you up on the beat, some harder warm-up manoevres to get you hot and then... after the half-way the seven levels completely change and use the simple left-right mechanic for some astonishing level twists. You might take a jet through strange loops, flee a laser-beaming spaceship or do the Fifth Element city traffic dive scene. While there are only seven levels right now, this keeps you motivated and busy for some nice hours until you can perfectly shift your car through all obstacles.\n\nI only played the game after its large controls update, but from what I see now they are extremely responsive and allow for super-crisp play (which of course is necessary if you aim at the harder difficulty levels).  And btw: forget about the difficulty - the levels perfectly fit the music and want to be played much more with the ear than with the eyes. While the visual input surely helps, it is the songs that hold the key to the patterns the game throws at you. Of course, "insane" is a difficulty that carries its name with pride, but fun is to be had even with the occasional rage quit and "normal" feels right enough to hook you. When you nail it, the endorphine shock of riding the perfect wave through a glittering stylized cityscape is tremendous and makes this game a highly satisfying experience.\n\nThe nutshell\nIf you have a penchant for the 80s, this is no biggie: just buy it. But even if you are cautious when bloom effects burn neon holes in your screen, this game might be worth checking out: it is one of the very few almost perfect music games out there.","May 29","true","3.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's just a shame that the actual game design sucks!\n\nI wasn't expecting much, just a nice drive through a beautiful landscape with a retro synth soundtrack; but what I got was hectic non-stop obstacle avoidance. The obstacles all fly at you thick and fast and not entirely in time to the music. The margin for error is incredibly narrow and making one mistake means you have to restart.\nThe biggest problem here is fatigue; if you blink you're going to crash, so keeping your eyeballs open for long enough to get to the next checkpoint is the main enemy here. After you've completed the level on Normal you can replay it at a 'harder' difficulty level, but that only changes the speed at which the level moves - honestly I found going through them faster to be slightly easier, it meant my eyeballs didn't have to spend so long drying out.\n\nI can't overstate just how beautiful the music and visuals go together. Driving through a gorgeous landscape that changes in time to the music would be wonderful, but you don't have time to appreciate it, and after restarting the level for the sixty eighth time it really just starts to get on your nerves.","May 14","false","1.3"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","13","25","3","1"

The object of the game is to dodge incoming colored section of the race track without hitting them. If you hit it twice it's officially game over and you must go back to the beginning or start at a checkpoint if you have the option enabled.\n\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous as well and it's various themed levels are not only beautifully detailed but they're also fun to play.\n\nThe soundtrack is definitely one of the best features in the game though and I really wish it was available for purchase here on Steam because I'd buy it instantly. The soundtrack is also one of the things that will keep you playing as you try to master the level in question.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels to choose from as well, Normal, Hard and Insane. Normal mode was recently made slightly easier but it's still going to challenge you and probably utterly destroy you in the process but the higher difficulty levels are truly for the hardcore.\n\nIf you're looking for a rhythm game that feeds your lust for punishment then definitely check this game out, it's one of the best rhythm games that I've played.\n\nIn our review we gave Neon Drive 4.9 stars out of 5 and we're definitely giving the game a recommendation here on Steam.\n\nWe also recorded a gameplay video for the game as well which you can watch below:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_vtcU5xJZA","May 28","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The difficulty is also very reminiscent of the games from my childhood, because there used to be only one type of challenge: pattern memorization.  You play it again and again until the pattern starts to stick in your head, and your subconscious can start pressing the buttons faster than you can processes the visual information.  It feels difficult because I takes a comparatively long time for a pattern to sink into most people's brains, but finally completing a level is all the more rewarding for it.\n\nThough there's a design choice to some levels in these types of games that I hate, which is the long, tedious first half of a level.  It doesn't require much memorization and learning, as it's pretty much just the same thing over and over again.  But it does require me to execute it perfectly every time, otherwise I die.  So once I finally get past it and reach the more mentally stimulating second half of the level that requires learning complex patterns, my brain gets distracted and I then die repeatedly on the tedious portion.  This happens over and over, making the learning of the interesting second half take forever as I slowly memorize piece by piece after repeated early failures.  And then parts I thought I had down give me trouble, and by that time I've played the level 193 times.\n\nI'm enjoying the nostalgia despite all the expletives I've hurled at the screen.  But I'm glad that this isn't the only type of difficulty in games any more.  Learning a skill, for example the skill it takes to play a game like Rocket League, is much more fun, in my opinion, if slightly less rewarding.  It makes the journey the entertaining part of the game, instead of just the end goal of completion.  But I'm having nice addictive fun all the same.","May 29","true","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Level 7 is still crazy hard though.\n\nI love Synthwave music & I love this art style.\nI also like a lot of twitch control lane-switching games.\nHowever, the controls are such a letdown in this game, it's a big part of why this is so hard; the car feels too unresponsive that if you make any mistake that you can't correct it at all, you can't change lanes quick enough which takes out all the close calls that make lane-switching games fun.\nThe controls lack that tightness that makes these things great & it is such a disappointing thing because it looks beatiful, it sounds great & some of the obstacle design is really great (level 7 with it's Klax design is inspired & incredibly difficult).\nI also don't feel that the music does sync up at all with the obstacles despite what the Store Page says.\n\nTighter controls would make this the total package for me, pretty much everything else is fine.\nAlthough I don't really consider a website link & a Facebook link to be Extras, but that seems to be a thing with mobile games in general, so whatever; the Wallpapers are nice though.","May 12","true","1.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","3"

You'll find it to probably be too easy or right on the money. For the tone deaf among you or those who don't play rhythm games... you may find this a bit hard.\n\nCase in point: the first level has a "classic" mode that was "too hard" - but it took me 3 attempts, only because the end has traps (i.e, move the wrong way and you die) and two of my failures were to that.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nNot actually as in-sync with the music as it suggests! If you're tapping dead on the beat you'll typically be slightly too early - and if you are slightly early, you'll clip the obstacles with the rear of the car. Bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nAs a result i find it hard to really slip into "the zone" like you normally would with a rhythm game like this, which really hurts my enjoyment. However... it's still fun and while it's on sale i'd pick it up.","May 13","true","4.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Also even though gameplay videos may indicate that it is a rythym game, the music is actually not in sync with required movements needed to navigate the levels, which give playing the game a weird jarring feeling.\n\nREVISED 24/5\n\nAfter playing the game following the recent update, the music offset slider has seemed to really fix my major gripe with the game and music sync, levels feel much more in tune with the music now.\nThis coupled with the added single chance allowed when playing the game have really changed my experience with the game to the point that I am now really enjoying it!
