A good number of the sound effects are highly annoying to the point where you will just end up muting the game which is actually lucky for you since the music isn't all that great either. Sound aside this game basically is just a rush to find and match 2 "special" tiles and nothing more since the game just auto-completes the rest of your matches when you do. I don't know about you but I kinda dislike having the game played for me like that. Do yourself a favor and play the free Mahjon Titans or whatever you have on your windows comp by default.\n\nEditing this in because I forgot something else that was rather annoying... the tiles lack a proper sense of depth so it's a pain to tell tiles that are or are not covered in some way. In a lot of cases stuff that looks like it's free isn't and other that look like they can't be used are actually accessible.","June 5, 2014","false","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you don't like Mahjong, you wont like this game either, but for fans of the game LUXOR: Mah Jong offers stylish graphics, several modes of play, period specific egyptian music and a wide variety of power-ups that tweak the traditional game just enough to keep things interesting. The game also supports the Steam Overlay although true widescreen is not available.  In most respects, LUXOR: Mah Jong is a polished puzzle game and deserves to be in the library of any serious Mahjong player. I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre, or even casual newcomers who enjoy a well done casual game.","April 28, 2012","true","50.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/32110/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","For puzzle enthusiasts\n\nLuxor Mahjong basically sets you up with solving a series of 'Mahjong' puzzles.\n\nIf you're not familiar with mahjong (like I was before I began), basically gameplay involves clicking on two familiar looking tiles. You need to keep selecting the same looking tiles until you find two golden ones. After selecting the two gold ones, you will win the level and proceed with the next. The complicated aspect of this is that you can't select tiles which are underneath or blocked off by tiles to the left and right (so you need to clear the other tiles first). To assist you there are a few red tiles which allows you to manipulate the game a bit such as changing position of two tiles or showing you available combinations for a limited amount of time. The aim is to reach the two gold tiles with as little moves as possible as the remaining tiles will get added to your score.\n\nThere is an egyptian sound track that makes you feel like you were in that ancient setting. There is no story or voice acting though, which isn't a bad thing because this game is just about puzzles.\n\nIf you love puzzles (especially mahjong) then you should pick this game up, else you should stay away.","February 18, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
