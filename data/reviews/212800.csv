If that is tough to digest, the game is played in a single screen. The point is to get crates. Once you get a crate, a new one spawns. Inside each crate is a random weapon that you've unlocked. Why do you get crates? To unlock new weapons, characters and levels to play on. There are only three levels, but I'm happy with that. The first level feels so good to play on that you almost don't need the other two.\n\nEnemies drop from a hole in the ceiling of the level. Standard left and right moving enemies, when they get to the edge they fall off to the next one. There are bigger versions of the standard enemies that take twice as much damage. Finally, there are hovering skull enemies that bounce around. Its a nice simple variety that still adds challenge. Since the enemies work their way to the bottom, there is a fire pit. If the enemies reach the fire pits, they come back red, angry and twice the speed! In a way it feels like the original Mario Bros. arcade game. One screen levels, and enemies that get angry, doubling their speed.\n\nThe major difference is the guns. Each gun has unlimited ammo and feels fun to use, with their own pro and con. Dual pistols will shoot left and right simultaneously, but do 1 bit of damage. The revolver shoots one bullet at a time, but does double damage. The machine gun shoots straight forward very quickly, but pushes you back. The flamethrower will effectively light platforms and enemies on fire, but if you stand in the fire, you can't jump. The katana has short range, but does a lot of damage and sends big enemies the other way. The shotgun has short range, but sends out a big blast of randomized bullets. The bazooka fires rockets that are slow to reload, but they do a lot of damage in a radius. Grenade launchers do the same thing, but they reload faster and arc when you shoot them. Mines take a while to arm themselves and can only drop straight down, but do the same big radius damage as rockets and grenades. Lasers take a long time to fire once you pull the trigger, but go through everything. The disc gun bounces off the first wall it hits and goes through enemies, but it will also kill you.\n\nYou can only carry one weapon, so when you get a crate, its a different weapon. Some weapons are better than others, so there is a dynamic of not getting a crate to use a good weapon to kill a screen full of enemies vs just getting the next crate.\n\nYou will unlock new characters, but they all play the same. They just different. The game will give you a random character when you play. One hit will kill you, but that's the balance. Guns vs swarms of enemies. With every death, the game will tell you what you've unlocked, how many more crates you need and send you right back in as if nothing happened. The whole thing takes a second or less. If the game gets too easy for you on normal mode, there is a hard mode.\n\nThe game keeps track of your high score in crates, but there are no points awarded. Hopefully there will be a more complete sequel with support for co-op and points, but that is in no way a complaint for this great FREE arcade game. In all, its a fun free game. If it came out in the 80s, Super Crate Box would have made millions of dollars in quarters. Not just that, but this free little game is enough to make me want to play other games from the developer.","September 16, 2014","true","1.9"," 84 of 95 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","84","95","4","0"

You play a character and your objective is to collect as many crates (which contain different kinds of weapons, which one uses to defeat the monsters.) before dieing. This game can be frustrating though, considering the fact that your character dies in one touch of any of the monsters, one has to be carefull in jumping around a small map and firing guns at monsters, who can sometimes be in groups of many and can be difficult to take out.\n\nIn each crate, there is a weapon. The player has to use the weapon until they obtain another crate and get a different gun or dies. This is a cycle of repetition, since the game can go for infinite amount of time, with one's score going higher by one with every crate obtained. With the higher number of crates obtained in one life, the more guns and different kinds of characters one can get. There are three ways to die in this game. First is touching a monster and dieing quickly. Second is falling into a fire, which is at the very bottom-middle of the map you are placed in. Monsters follow a continous pathway down into the fire, but appear at the top, faster and turned red/purple. Third is by one of the guns one can use. It fires a bullet that goes completely horizontal back and forth twice. If one character gets hit by the bullet, it gets sliced in half, killing it.\n\nAlthough this game is rather violent, there is no gore whatsoever in this game. There is no blood or organs coming out of the  body of the character or the monsters. If either one die, they just fall of the screen with no blood spilling everywhere, so I'd say it's an E10+ game (if it's rated).\n\nI recommend this game to people who love Indie games and who also love a good repetitive game of endless enjoyment in blowing up or knocking off monster with a whole loadout of many weapons at random. The only downside to this game is that it can get a little frustrating with dieing so quickly when one is so close to unlocking a different character, but is nonetheless a fun game to play.","February 12, 2014","true","5.8"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","40","46","0","0"

While "free" means ALL of the FEATURES of the game) I don't see any part/weapons or stuffs that needs "real money" to get it.\n\nGameplay's very simple; run, hide, shoot, repeat, don't get killed by those monsters/your own weapon (i.e: disc bullet, fire), and get those crates. Go for a highscore, unlock arenas, weapons, and random characters.\n\nI have 1 problem. TOO SIMPLISTIC. If you've unlocked all unlockables, it would be boring to repeat gameplay. You guys should add another gamemodes in DLC/free updates. It's OK for DLC releases which would cost around 10 cents/1 dollar as long as it add gameplay, or maybe Storyline?","October 13, 2014","true","1.5"," 51 of 65 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","51","65","3","0"

Yes, it's free. Yes, it's only 23 MB. But this game is boring, repetitive, tedious, un-customizable, frustrating, unintelligent, and unrewarding.\n\nIn Super Crate Box, you're a short, pixely character who seems to move way too loosely given his size. You start off with a basic gun and you have to shoot enemies who drop down from the top and inevitably come at you from the left and right sides. If they make it to the bottom, they fall into a pit of fire and drop back down from the top of the screen in a frenzied state where they move much faster. It's easy to get swarmed and some enemies take more than one shot to kill. You're going to die quickly and frequently. Your objective is collect boxes (crates) that each contain a different weapon and which instantly replaces your previous one. You can't change back to the one you just had, and you MUST use the new one (sometimes down-grading you). You can unlock better weapons, but the one you get with each new box is random. Now, gameplay-wise the control is all right (I find the jumping to be somewhat awkward) but my main issue gameplay-wise is that you can't customize the controls. Come on, this is 2014, players deserve better (and before anyone rushes to assumptions, let me just say that some people are left-handed and prefer using WASD for movement over the arrow keys; thanks).\n\nLet's be honest here, this is one of THOSE games, the kind whose sole purpose is to be more frustrating and challenging than interesting, involving, or innovative. I honestly don't know what others see in this game. It's more like a game you'd use to play a trick on your friends than one you'd actually take seriously. At its core, it's simply an arcade game where you see how long you can last. That's it. The "official" reviews make it sound like it blew the reviewers out of the water: "Slightly less addictive than crack cocaine"? Hm, speaking from experience? "...[C]ondensed milk...only with fun instead of milk"? Is that really a review? "Elegant, explosive, and truly unmissable"? Huh? Were they playing the same game as me? Now, I realize that I'm complaining about something that's free, but after playing Super Crate Box I had to write this review. I frankly don't see any features that would keep me coming back to it, and so I can't recommend it.","July 15, 2014","false","6.8"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","18","33","0","0"

It is one hell of a game, with a charming 8-bit look and suprisingly fluid controls. The gameplay is fun and fluid with extremly responsive controls and fun weapons. There are only two problems with that I had with this game. The first is that you do not have the option to keep the weapon you currently have, but always have to switch them when you get to a crate. The other part is the difficulty which could easily get players not intrested in this game due to you not progressing that quickly. Even the tutorial is challenging and that is supposed to introduce players to this. Overall it is a great game with a reto 8-bit feel that feels sort of arcade like. If you are looking for a fun but challenging retro arcade style game get this, it may be difficult but it is fun.","August 9, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a large arsenal of weapons that you can acquire by collecting crates. Each time you collect a crate, your weapon changes randomly. The goal is to get as many crates as possible without being killed by enemies.\n\nThoughts: This is a fun little game. The gameplay can end up being pretty addictive. I personally really like the piexl art style used. As it's just a quick free game, there's not much it needs to do but it does what it needs to do perfectly.

The game also does provide its challenges, and the multitude of weapons can really make the game a lot harder or easier, dependent on perspective and skill. Overall, it's a wonderful game, and if this is any indication of the quality that comes from the makers, look out for any other titles by these gentlemen, and support their works.

Sadly, almost too adictive. It might suck up all your other attention. The weapons are fun and silly and the unlock system can be challenging due to its basis of requiring more and more survival time in an increasingly difficult match. My opinion on the disc gun is that it can be useful to clear floors of enemies, it is hilarious when it kills you, and it's outright silly. Many people hate it, as other reviews will show. I believe this is due to the hazard it poses to your character because it will bounce back and can kill you, but this same mechanic is useful for massive clearing capabilities, and can be timed correctly to deal with large enemies. Overall, I'd warn against its addictive powers but recommend it as a time/boredom killer. Oh an prepare to die, because that will happen often.","January 21, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Barely anything at all, in fact. Graphics are pixelized(which serves it's purpose well). Here's what you do- avoid/kill enemies, collect boxes. That's it. It's ****ing great. There isn't a single reason NOT to get this game. STOP READING THIS AND PLAY IT. NOW. It's free anyway, so try it for yourself!

Look no further! There's no guarantee you will actually stop after just a few minutes: Despite its simple concept (or because of it), Super Crate Box is addictively fun and challenging making "just one more try" turn into 10 tries more. I said that the game is simple, but that doesn't mean there isn't variety in gameplay - you'll be picking up a new weapon every five to ten seconds and each one behave distinctively from the others so you'll be varying your behaviour dozens of times every time you play.\n\nTry it out, you won't regret it!","February 24, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The aim of the game is to collect as many crates as possible without dying, as 1 crate = 1 point.\n\nYou soon realise that some weapons are better than others, and therefore you have to collect crates quickly in order to replace the bad weapon with a better one. However, at the same time you are being bombarded by green creatures and floating white skulls whose touch equals instant death. This game involves multi-tasking, and improves hand-eye coordination at the same time.\n\nI would recommend this to anybody who has a lot of spare time on their hands, or is just looking for a retro-style game which can be played over and over again. :)","February 5, 2014","true","35.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sadly, almost too adictive. It might suck up all your other attention. The weapons are fun and silly and the unlock system can be challenging due to its basis of requiring more and more survival time in an increasingly difficult match. My opinion on the disc gun is that it can be useful to clear floors of enemies, it is hilarious when it kills you, and it's outright silly. Many people hate it, as other reviews will show. I believe this is due to the hazard it poses to your character because it will bounce back and can kill you, but this same mechanic is useful for massive clearing capabilities, and can be timed correctly to deal with large enemies. Overall, I'd warn against its addictive powers but recommend it as a time/boredom killer.

In fact it's a very honest game in that it's free and it's about running around getting crates and blasting enemies, though the twist: getting crates is how you score points.\n\nIt may be simple but it certainly isn't easy as the enemy hordes will increase in number while you have them and your current weapon's limitations to deal with. Even when you lose, you make progress towards new weapons (that you can randomly get) and new characters (also random), but with how the game is, this works pretty well. (Protip: Launched disks can kill you as well as your enemies)\n\nThe only issue is how the jump and shoot buttons are z and x instead of the other way around, that may throw you off.\n\nEdit: Up can jump, making things easier\n\nIf you want quick and easy game to get into with a classic vibe, you can't go wrong with this.","December 19, 2013","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll eventually get used to it.\nThe game is very repetitive but has a strong, addictive core mechanic. You'll want to bring up your high score and find ways to efficiently keep up with the enemy spawning while you pick up crates with different weapons in them for points. Each one of them is good except for the dual pistols.\nTry to quickly switch from the dual pistols.\n\nkthnxbai","May 16, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to avoid being touched by waves and waves of enemies while getting boxes from around the level. With each box you get a different weapon, sometimes the weapon is sweet but other times the weapon change really jacks you up and is hard to fight with. When you get so many boxes on each level you get to progress to the next level. The enemies come at you fast and you have an option to avoid them or shoot them. Shooting then is alot of fun, and avoiding them can get hard in the later levels. The overall games is alot of fun and can be played with a controller or keyboard. I prefer the Xbox controller because it felt better then keyboard.

Your objective is to collect as many crates as possible, while using any and every gun you have to kill the enemies falling from the ceiling. Everytime you grab a crate, you gain one more point and receive a new random weapon that you have unlocked. Each weapon is unique, fun and has its own reasons for use. Guns have unlimited ammo and deal different amounts of damage to the enemies. For example. Pistols take about 2 or 3 shots to kill the standard enemy of Super Crate Box, but an explosion from the rocket launcher is a one hit kill.\n\nThe way enemies move in this game is in a simple left and right motion. They continue to walk in the same direction until they come across a wall, then they will turn and move in the opposite direction as they make their way down the map towards a fire pit at the bottom. If an enemy makes its way to the pit of fire, they won't die, they will just fall throught the ceiling again. However, they will be angry allowing them to move twice as fast making for a adrenaline pumping challenge as you continue to collect crates and receive weapons.\n\nThere are three different enemies in this game. one you may already know is the small green guy, but there are larger green enemies that take two times the damage to kill. Finally there are floating skulls that fly around and also make their way down to the bottom of the map. The effects that fire has on enemies is the same for all three.\n\nThe game itself is addicting due to the fact that you must collect a number of crates to unlock new weapons, new characters, and new maps. You start with a fair weapon arsenal and will gain more guns as you play and develope your skills. Every game you start, you will have a random character picked for you, and every time you die you will have a new player modle. With this fact alone you will almost want to die just so you can see the new silly modles the game has in store for you. You start on a simple map with nothing much to see, but as you unlock more maps (three in total) you will find there to be more platforms to jump on and die on. The unlockible content is great, but if you find yourself playing with friends, you will be more worried about getting that amazing high score just to rub it in their face.\n\nWARNING\nSuper Crate Box is almost like flappy bird. Fun, addicting, and will make even the most calm and collected people burst into anger.","December 24, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You are fighting skulls.  Use weapons to kill them!  Collect weapons from crates.  Small platform levels.  Different weapons give you a different approach to combat; from bouncing buzz-saws to landmines and more.\n\nThe Good\nAn incredibly small game with a lot of bang for it's byte.  The gameplay is fast and fun, though very roguelike (like most arcade games).  It doesn't try to be anything else, and delivers on some simple, mindless fun.  Enemies have a bit of variety.\n\nThe Bad\nRNG can kill you bad.  It's entirely possible to get a weapon that does nothing to help you.\n\nThe Ugly\nNothing really.\n\nSuggestions\nA bit more variety in level design, and improvements on the graphics (16 bit, even).  That said, it's a tiny, simple, free game.  Seriously, like picking at the bread on a free lunch.\n\nThe Summary\n8/10.  The developers set out to make a simple 2D platform shooter and nailed it.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 12, 2013","true","1.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I didn't have any technical issues with the game, playing on Win 10 with a Logitech wired gamepad.\n\nI found that even playing the tutorial was challenging, especially when every time you pick up a crate your weapon changes. The shotgun was probably the worst weapon - VERY short range. The machine gun has kickback to it, so beware.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game was myself - too accustomed to playing Mario Bros.-style, where you can jump on the enemy and kill it that way.

Your whole goal is to get the next crate (Which has a different weapon inside of it) and not die while doing so.\n\nEach weapon has unique attributes, like exploding, or leaving a wake of flames, but some can even effect you! Weaponry like the 'Disc Gun' and 'Flamethrower' can actually end up getting you killed where normally you'd have been fine. Each weapon you have is usable in a different situation, and each situation can be taken differently. The weapons don't have an alternate fire-mode or anything like that, but each has an ability that none other does. (All of which are explained simply as you unlock them)\n\nThere are a number of maps, and when things get out of hand (IE, Lots of the critters start falling into Hell, and coming back angry at you) this game can be hysterically fun, and only gets better as you master the weapons and maps.

Steam tags this game as "free-to-play" but rest assured this game is purely free with no microtransactions involved.\n\nThe gist of the game is that you need to collect crates but each crate grants you a new weapon. Enemies will continue to spawn so while collecting these crates you will need to keep the enemy population in check. Not all weapons are created equal so the challenge becomes learning how to use each weapon and situations you should avoid getting yourself into with a particular weapon.\n\nIt appears this game was designed with keyboard in mind but it worked just fine with a USB controller.\n\nThis game comes up a little short in terms of content. Of course this is to be expected being a free game. If this game was a little more fleshed out I'd say this could go for $5.\n\n7.5/10","December 3, 2013","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You destroy enemies, with different weapons coming from boxes, and get different hats, wigs, gear, etc. It is very simple, move and shoot. You have to get 10 crates (which include weapons) to be able to acces the door. You have many maps. Very fun soundtrack, and, works on EVERY computer. It works really fast. It also only takes 32 mb, which should finish download really quick.  But the thing is, if you don't have dll, you can't uploadd your scores. That might be the problem for "record-breaker" gamers.

In super crate box you controll a charecter through three levels where you try to rack up a huge high score by collecting crates. There are enemies to stop you but each crate you pick up gives you a diffrent weapon to fight them off, So How is Super Crate box ? Its a really fun arcade style game. The game follows on a simple platforming style and then you collect crates to progress to the next level. No with every game there are small issues. The game has Really unfair Balancing issues. Some guns are useless and will provide no help at all and some of them are way overpowerd. But minor issues aside a really fun game and its a time killer and plus its absolutly free.

I will tell you that I would not recommend you spending your time on this game. On the list of issues with this game the most obvious is the technical issues, the game crashes if there are too many particles on the screen usually (from the flamethrower), I have heard on the forums that downgrading your entire computer from windows 8 to windows 7 but there are other issues besides the technical ones. This game is yet another instant death platformer, now sometimes this works games like VVVVVV or Super Meat Boy where you have a great ability to avoid hazards all while gravity drags you down. Games where instant death platformer does not work is this game where your jump ability is really limited and gravity drags you down to your death so quickly. I guess that all of these problems are a product of it being inspired massively by Mario Bros and trying all the wrong original things so they conflict with each other. You may be able to play this game if you are on Windows 7 already without any issues and may even like it otherwise do not waste your time on this game.","October 12, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Super Crate Box sends us to another dimension in a world of only a few pixels (however the game still looks awesome) where you can fight aliens of all different kinds; big green, small green, angry little red ones etc. aliens kill you in one touch, so you the survivor has to gather guns with unlimited ammo that are supplied in crates to kill off these wretched creatures. You start off with a dead on ordinary pistol to then find loads of other random weapons in the crates, these include but are not limited to: the minigun, dual pistols, machine gun, laser gun, etc. At the bottom of the platforms there is a hole with some fire in it -for no apparent reason, if the monsters fall into the fire it turns them angry and they travel much faster making it a harder time for you.\n\nNot only has the creator's given us so much already, but they provide us as well with not 1, not 2 but 3 maps to play in, each one getting harder as you unlock them.\n\n\nSuper Crate Box also gives us a range of characters to play as and to unlock as you get a higher score. For each map you get normal level or SFMT level, normal is obviously average and SFMT is… absolute carnage.\n\nAnd last but not least the leveling up is spectacular, you would think that how many aliens you kill provide you points however it is actually how many crates you collect, you can tell the developers were really thinking out of the box this time. Players of SCB have reached miraculous scores, you can see their scores at supercratebox.com.\nDespite the lack of textures in some places of the map Super Crate Box has well earned its place in in the hall of AWESOME games. I have 32 hours on the game now and I am looking forward to spending many more.\n","January 11","true","33.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

With a large range of weapons, characters, and maps, along with awesome retro graphics and music, this game is a great adition to anyone's collection of games.\n\nPROS - Great music\n- Pixel graphics that suit the game well\n- Almost everything not default is unlockable\n- Great weapons\n- Awesome unlockable characters\n- Unlockable maps\n- Extra unlockable difficulties for each map\n- The rest of the game is easier once you master the learning curve\n- Lightning fast download speeds, boot up speeds, and FPS on my potato toaster\n- Large amount of replayability\n- It's free, so you won't lose anything if you don't like it\n\nCONS - Has a large learning curve\n- The other difficulties seem to have their own learning curve\n- The game becomes a little bland once everything is unlocked\n- THE DISC GUN A.K.A. SUICIDE GUN!\n\nIn Conclusion, 9/10 This game is an absolute gem, and is among some of the best games I've ever played. The only thing that stops this game from being perfect is the difficulty curve that almost put me off of this game the first time I played it. AND THE FRACKING DISC GUN! If you are a fan of 2D platformers and/or shooters, get this game. It's free, so the only thing you will lose is your time, especially if you like it.","December 20, 2014","true","88.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And that's exactly what Super Crate Box is, and arcade style shooter game where you need to get as many crates as possible, while dodging and killing enemies with the weapons you get from said crates. Now, it's important to note that as this review is being posted, (January 16th, 2015) there is a major bug in this game where it crashes after a couple minutes. I'm not gonna say don't get the game, cause it's free, so I can't argue. But, that does dissapoint me alot, as there's alot of things I wanted to talk about, but I'm constantly getting crashed on while playing. Now, if you're reading this months after this has been posted, and they fixed the bug. Then this game is absolutely fantastic, and I do recommend it totally. I've been on links that claim to fix the bug, but as I tried using it, Norton said it was a virus, so I don't think you should try using that option. I suggest just waiting for a fix to the problem, and enjoy those couple seconds of great fun while you can, cause it is a great game!","January 16, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
