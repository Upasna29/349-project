The tedious slowdown I get when attacking screamers makes for extremely difficult combat, which is essentially the bulk of the game, so it's quite difficult to enjoy.  The concept and art style is cool,  just the game itself requires more polish.","May 29, 2015","false","5.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","9"

I realize this game is for a specific type of gamer. I've only just put a bit of time in but the game is solid. Definitely an unusual artistic style, simplistic, but I think it fits the game. Play this game on fantastic, and it looks pretty great on a 1080p screen. I like how the screen kind of rotates to give a more 3d  I think the art style emphasizes solid clear lines, and a lot of white, because fighting outside can be pretty hectic. Having a white/grey background really helps enemies stand out.\nGame play wise is where I think this game shines. The combat is responsive, and I haven't played a game where you can hover with a shield and use it to block bullets. It is definitely unique, and the developer has nailed a good feeling with it.\n\nThe whole resource system is pretty neat, with you starting with few resources at the beginning. How well you fight the initial monsters sets the tone for how well you'll do. It can be pretty easy for the generators to lose power quickly at the beginning, and then the doors are forced open, allowing enemies to attach antenna. Combat is hard, but can be learned quickly and after a few try's I was lasting much longer.\n\nOnly gripes  I have:\n\nIf you reach negative level 10, you fail and get sent to the main screen. Starting a new game is fast, but having to go through tutorial is a small drag. Thankfully you can skip pretty quikcly, but having the option to start in a new game right away would've been nice.\n\nSome advice:\nI think the game is vague on purpose on some mechanics like saving, and being able to teleport to the top of the base. But to save basically generator needs to have enough power, and when you do save it takes a lot of power so be strategic when saving. To teleport I will let you guys figure that out on your own.\n\nPlaying I reliazed how long it would take to escape just staying at base. It would take hours! Then I realized I could venture out to collect antenna boxes. Collecting one adds 5 percent to total antenna progress. Not sure what happens when reaching 100% but I can't wait!\n\nOverall I'd highly recommend this game. It is really challenging game, and innovative how and indie should be. Don't think this is a roguelike or any other genres you've played, it's been an awesome mixture of many it seems. The price was worth it to me.\n\nps. Being the second reviewer or third, I really wanted to write an in depth review.","May 18, 2015","true","2.3"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","2"

Repeat over and over, killing one more enemy each time. 11/10 hardcore survival indeed.\n\nA friend gave this game to me and I was excited to play it because I enjoy base management and survival gameplay. I had a pretty mediocre experience, which is why I am not recommending this game.\n\nPros:\n\n-very challenging gameplay; emphasis on bullet dodging\n-encourages advanced techniques (ex: bunnyhopping on your shield to propel you to or away from enemies)\n-interesting HUD concept (zoom in to player character to see all relevant details like health bar, resources, etc)\n-no hand-holding - brief tutorial, most interactions in the game you must find out for yourself\n-good amount of base management elements - every action requires some type of resource\n-decent sounds and music\n-not demanding on the hardware at all\n-has Steam trading cards\n\nCons:\n\n-brutal difficulty means you will die often while you get your bearings, potentially turning people off\n-understanding what to do inside the base can sometimes be unintuitive, prompting use of more trial-and-error\n-a bit lacking in aesthetics; simple designs\n-better base management survival games available as alternatives\n-current price - $5.49 CAD - is a bit too steep in my opinion, better to wait for it to be in a bundle deal or discounted more\n\nDo not recommend.\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\nMy Website[theroguereviews.com]","July 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's a bit unpolished, but overall I think it's a decent game. I personally recommend it, but if you want a taste of the gameplay, you can check out this Youtube video about it.

Once you take out the weapon, if you press the wrong key you just cannot fire again. No way to open the "doors", just wait until they open themselves?\nI used a few bullets, little bit of armor and then something put me back in the beginning. I guess the fella died? At some point without doing anything the poor robot was floating in the air.. Was there an air duct? Who knows..\nThis is weird..\nSad because the artwork is kind of interesting but there's nothing to it to actually play and enjoy..\nNote to self: I have to write a few positive reviews as I'm getting on the negative side of this steamy pile..","March 23","false","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a scene with some crappy objects flying to you and making stupid noises. The "developer" made sure that it is not possible to progress to any other level within the game as you just die without reason after a certain amount of time passed. There is nothing to achieve within the game. There is no point to this and definitely not worth buying, even for $1.","August 8, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
