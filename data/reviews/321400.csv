When the playercount increases to the point where you can fairly easily get into a game with people at similar skill levels to you I'll remove this edit. Just bear in mind the low playercount if you're considering buying the game.\n\nInnovative, addictive and incredibly satisfying. Whether you have played for 1 hour or 1,000 hours the awesome feeling you get from being a part of epic plays never fades. The game is quite unpolished but if you can see through the clunky UI and lacking features there is a great game beneath. As with a lot of Early Access games, it's a diamond in the rough.\n\nSupraball in comparison to Rocket League:   "Deathball..." (the predecessor of Supraball) "... was one of the main reasons why Rocket League exists" - Psyonix Adam on Reddit\nI expect this comparison is what a lot of people will be wanting to know. I'll preface this section by saying I have about 650 ingame hours in Rocket League and about 2,000 in Supraball.  Rocket League gave me a very similar feeling of excitement that I got from Supraball when I first started playing.  Deep down at their core they are essentially the same game - put the ball in the goal, just with different methods of doing so. Both are very pure, simple games which give you some basic controls and then set you free to do what you wish.\nI feel like Supraball gives you a lot more ways to be creative  and play the game though to the degree that every second of the game you are holding the ball the tree of your choices branches 100 times: will you do a little rollspin to juke a defender, will you pass to a teammate who is boosted and flying across the map for a volley combo, will you panic and do a horrible pass back to your keeper and score a hilarious own goal or will you do the countless other things available to you?  More complex plays are also far more accessible in Supraball,  within 100 hours of play you can be setting up strong charge to volley goals to score 300km/h screamer goals, whereas in Rocket League setting up a pass play like this is far, far more difficult.  The autolock pass also makes passing very easy and allows new players to perform teamplay quite easily.  Now let's move onto the pro's and con's of Supraball in it's Early Access State.\n\n\nPros: +++  Every match plays differently.  There are so many different ways to play that you never end up playing the same game twice. It has the "just 1 more match" feeling and so can be very addictive and has huge replayability.\n+++  4 unique positions to play: Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder and Striker.  You can sink thousands of hours into a position and still have room to learn and innovate. Or, don't conform to the meta, you're free to play however you want!\n++  The skill ceiling is disgustingly high , I have sunk probably 2000 hours into goalkeeping in the Alpha/Beta and I'm not even close to the skill cap. The skill floor is pretty high too, but even when you first start playing and have no idea what you're doing it is still really enjoyable\n++ Applying curves and combinations of curves to your shots gives huge variety to the gameplay and  lots of opportunities for creative, unique and flashy plays\n+  Intuitive and fairly simple controls  similar to most FPS games\n+  There's something for everyone . Public matches are more casual and relaxed and ranked is more serious. It's enjoyable to play even if you typically don't like sports games like myself.\n+ Multiple varients of the 3v3 and 5v5 maps (similar to Rocket League) with different visual styles\n+ Even if this game does not do too well and has a small playerbase (eg. 50 to 100 players) it can still be fun. The whole time I have played from 0 to 2000 hours there has probably been an average of 40 players online and even so it is a blast.\n\nEhhh: ~Only 2 game modes (3v3 and 5v5) though both gamemodes focus on very different ways of playing\n~ Curved shots bouncing off of walls are unintuitive but add a huge amount of depth to the game  that allows crazy solo wall jukes and is why the striker position is viable\n\nCons: ---  A clunky UI and missing lots of useful features such as easily partying with friends, good matchmaking and team matchmaking (these features are planned).  The lobby system has matchmaking within it to balance teams but there is no way to easily queue and join a match like you can in Rocket League.\n--  For some people the optimisation is god awful even on a monster rig, for others the game runs perfectly on a terrible computer.\n--  The price is based on the gameplay and potential of future content, not the amount of content it has right now.  This game is priced similarly to Rocket League, but doesn't have any of the extra features. You may want to hold off on purchasing until these features are added if they are important to you.\n-The devs "rely on the community renting the majority of servers", which is certainly not something I'm used to in my games and seems very strange to me\n- Despite what the steam store says  the game is fairly unpolished,  lacking a lot of nice little features like cosmetics or unlockables\n- Whilst the game can be played by ignoring your teammates, utilising them properly is the best way to play. This might not appeal to some pure solo players\n-  Some bugs can affect the mid to high level of play,  include random weird bounces off of walls and occasionally your shield not working. These are almost entirely unnoticeable in the first 100 hours of play though and will hopefully be patched\n\ntl;dr: It's basically meth\n\nEdit: The default controls can be a bit wonky, I would advise changing the following:\n"Pass" to RMB, "Kick" to LMB, "Pull-Catch" to left shift, "Quickshot" to Middle Mouse. "Shield" to RMB and the others whatever you feel comfortable with. If you want to goalkeep, turn "double tap dash" off and set the "Dash Jump" key to something you feel comfortable with.","May 2","true","808.6"," 79 of 99 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","79","99","7","2"

Unfortunately it has been abandoned for a UE4 version that probably will never see the light of day. The game itself hasn't had any real updates in about 6 months or more. They worked on nothing but the launcher, which came out very confusing and poorly done. It's quite buggy, crashes a lot, sometimes buttons don't work and you have to restart, losing your spot in the process.\n\nThere is NO TUTORIAL, so new players quickly get frustrated and leave, never to be seen again. The game is largely dead already, a failed release brought us a 96 player peak on the following Sunday.  It's priced next to Rocket League with very little to offer in comparison. It's unfortunate because the gameplay itself is far more versatile and deep than Rocket League and the skill ceiling is very high, especially in a team capacity.  I personally offered to work on the tutorial, I have a great voice for these things, unfortunately the man in charge DavidM spent his time making maps that nobody likes instead of something the game truly needed, A TUTORIAL.  He decided to release it on the same weekend as OVERWATCH without even the tools for players to learn how to play.\n\nIt's truly sad watching this potentially great game get ruined by DavidM's unwillingness to listen to anybody, or even consider other's opinions.  Throughout the history of Deathball and Supraball it has been the same. Multiple helpers/coders have quit due to DavidM, I've heard first hand stories from multiple people who no longer can take DavidM's attitude and quit over it.  It's a shame that Marenz, who is the one who actually does most of the work won't take a more active/public role and make DavidM give him more power in what happens with the game. Honestly most of the mistakes are just completely uncalled for, such as releasing it on the same day as Overwatch with no tutorial, he even changed the default controls so old players have no reference to helping newer players.  The average child would agree that this was a huge mistake, but not DavidM, who told everybody he would get at least 700 players on launch day...well Steam charts is already showing a decline day by day, never reaching over 200 concurrent players at ANY time.\n\nStreamers tried to play, couldn't find players to play with and gave up and went to play Rocket League, another blown opportunity. Let's give our dead game to a bunch of popular streamers so people can laugh at it when they can't actually play because it's DEAD.\n\nI wish there was more time to get into specifics, all I can say is the game is worth $5 and until it's actually polished and completed they have no business putting themselves into Rocket League status.  The store page claims they've developed it since 2012 and it's a "polished game".  Far from it, the gameplay itself is more or less complete (other than bugs they refuse to fix) but nothing about the experience is polished, at all.\n\nThe Project Leader DavidM has resorted to deleting reddit posts, banning users, deleting comments on the Steam forums and banning people from posting on Steam all because they gave the game a bad review. He's an immature person who has no business leading a professional project and he's just abusing his powers to try and hide the negative comments at this point.","May 9","false","94.8"," 57 of 75 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","57","75","5","24"

The competitive nature of the game made it very fun but little has been added to the game from the 2 years I've been watching it. There is no match making system like my favourite mp games have. You simply can choose your opponents and team mates making the rank system irrelevant. There were plans to move the game over to Unreal 4 engine which the devs said would help them massively but that didn't happen as "it would take too long" the devs said even after they said it would speed up development (this is most likely due to the success of Rocket League and a panic to release the game). The only thing added was a few average looking (the stadium is fantastic mind) maps, a start up launcher (which is not great) and some small gameplay tweaks.\n\nI'm not a fan of the art style which I honestly thought the stickmen were placeholders and the arena's seem rushed and uninspired.\n\nThe game still has potential like I thought 2 years ago but in the current state at the same price as Rocket League I recommend not buying this. The devs saw the success Rocket League had.. panicked and rushed the release of this and slapped a 'Early Access' title on it.\n\nPlus the ranks have not been reset from the alpha which is quite unfair to new players. Don't be fooled by the hours of other reviewers too.. a lot of players sat in lobbies for hours at a time as a chat room.","May 2","false","5.5"," 58 of 90 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","58","90","3","3"

No game has given me more pleasure in competing and drived me to become the best player I can be for my team. I don't think there is another game with the same emphasis on teamplay that Supraball has. It's like soccer mixed with hockey but with cannon guns that can shoot the ball really fast. The graphics may be a turn off for some individuals but I hope that people can look past the cartoony looks as there is more to gameplay than just graphics. There are still a few bugs but that is why this is only the early access release and not the final release.

However I don't really recommend doing the same thing for new players. But let me explain.\n\n\n\nI have no clue when did I get hooked into the game. Probably I saw someone streaming the game and decided to try it out. It was free to download, it was in alpha and it was quite fun. A few skilled players taught me the most important moves and tricks and I slowly figured out how these things work. And then I got a Closed beta key for free and after that, we're here.\n\nI knew what awaited me when I bought the game. No risk for me (aside from the usual "it's a dead game *hurr durr* waste of money"). I enjoy it because I know what I am, and other players are capable of. As a new player it's risky because you'll either like it or not. A free weekend or a lowered price definitely needed for "the casual" players to try this out.\n\nAnd yes, the price. It's quite high for a game that "lacks content". True! But the developers will add more and more and it will be more diverse, especially if we'll have a bigger community to play with. I bet they're not going to stop right here, when they're halfway through the marathon.\n\nThe development also seem a bit slow. Maybe they'll release everything at once, and that's why it takes so long? I don't know. However I'm not a programmer, I don't know how hard it is to create a game and new contents so I'm not judging.\n\nThe early access misses some really needed content, like tutorials. Of course, there's an online "How to play" article which can be found on the official website but who reads that. It would be a really good idea to read it, though... :D You might not know what those things are but after you try those in-game, I'm sure you will figure it out. If not, and you need some advice, most of the skilled players are there to help. We currently have a small playerbase and we surely don't want to lose it because of some confusing game elements.\n\n\n\nBut the core of the game has been layed down for a while now. It's lovely, it's simple and yet so fun if you get a hang of it. Of course you are going to get a bit frustrated if you get knocked out like 10 times in a match because you weren't fast enough with the ball, but as you progress these frustrations will be gone and you start enjoying the game (like I did). You start feeling that you can do better, whatever happened can be done in a different (and better) way even if it was your fault. You'll watch out for it next time. And who knows, maybe you'll score that winning goal or you save a last second shot in a tight match. ^_^\n\nEven though there's a few cons about this game and can be considered risky, I definitely recommend this game if you like what you see.\n\nEDIT: Fixed some grammar mistakes ( I hope xD ).

I've played this game since August of 2014 and have never experienced a dull moment. If you are into competitive games then Supraball is a must. The amount of teamwork and the infinite amount of strategies you can come up with has made this game an all time favorite for me. It's a great game for both casual and competitive players with some of the most complex and unique game mechanics in any game i've ever played. Playing this game is like entering a time machine. 5 hours feel like 30 minutes and each game plays out differently from the next. Supraball also has a very high skill cap and incredible e-sport potential. I'm telling you guys, this game is a gem and there is no other game like it.\n\n10/10 would recommend","May 2","true","324.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

It's my favorite game/experience in all my years of playing games.\n\nIt's easy to learn, but impossible to master. There are no advantages for one player over another in this game. Everyone runs the same speed, jumps the same height, etc. You are in complete control of your character; therefore, the opportunity to be great is in your hands. This is the only video game I've ever played that makes me feel like I used to feel as an athlete. Other games have you controlling a character, but in this game, you are the character. Your play on the pitch is a vehicle for self-expression. If you want to outsmart your opponents, bully your opponents, be a playmaker, break ankles, or be the glue that holds a team together, you can do it.\n\nAll that being said, this is a game in which one player cannot dominate the game without a team. Teamwork is arguably the most important factor in the game. The teamwork element is another area in which a group of people can express themselves in the game. Just as one player can play a certain style that is all their own, teams have their own styles and strategies that distinguish themselves from each other. There are many different strategies that are equally valid.\n\nThis game has an individual and team skillcap that hasn't been reached yet. I can't wait to see what all you new players bring to the game I've loved for so long. The only limit is your creativity and your willingness to work at the game.\n","May 2","true","123.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","12","19","2","0"

You definitely need to give this game time to figure out how it is properly played. It might take a while, but it is worth it. After that you propably don't want to play anything else anymore. It's addicting. It's unique. I have played this game nearly half of my life (started with the Deathball Mod - and still haven't mastered it) and I just can't stop playing it.

However, as a beginner you may struggle for a bit since currently the game doesn’t include any tutorials or tips for newbie players. The community is quite friendly but nobody is going to teach you how to play so you will find yourself danced around, juked and generally outplayed as there is no ranking system yet and you are getting matched up against good players. They wont allow you to possession of the ball nor will you be able to catch it just running around. It’s not a very hard game to understand but I found it really hard to catch up at the beginning. The game itself seemed pretty fun and enjoyable even though I was running around without the ball most of the time. It’s in early access and has some bugs and a lot to improve upon like any other game but it definitely has a future. It can be filled with a lot of content.\n\nPROS: Team play – (the game is so far custom server based eligible to play 3v3 and 5v5)\n\nAble to play with or without friends – (you can invite them in 3v3 or 5v5 lobbies provided by the game itself – I think you have to purchase ownership)\n\nSmooth, fast and enjoyable – (I found it really hard to get bored of this game even though I couldn’t catch up to the players that I got matched up with and yet I still find it enjoyable)\n\nCommunity – (so far I haven’t met anyone toxic flaming teammates for their mistakes, everyone seems to be friendly to each other, giving each other tips)\n\nFuture – (the game has a lot to improve but it has the potential to evolve into something bigger. I can see a lot of features which can be added in my mind and so it is up to the developers to where they drive it to).\nCONS: Tutorials – (the game doesn’t have any tutorials or tips for beginners yet so it is hard to catch up for a new player against decent players who are usually premade and only pass to each other so you can become frustrated and feel useless)\n\nMinor in game bugs – (encountered only once with players getting stuck into each other)\n\nProblems with video settings – (I have encountered this a couple of times – it doesn’t save the options and settings you change and resets to default when you reset the app)\n\nRanking – (currently there is no ranking system which defines the skill group of players and separates them from each other to make the game more fair which means you might get matched up with higher ranking players and that probably wont end well for you)\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified[www.steamified.com] Community Reviews.

I have made some awesome friends, and some great memories. I have played in tournaments, ranked matches, and just messed around on a public server. All 3 totally different experiences with this game, and all equally enjoyable. Some matches end with my palms sweaty, my heart pacing, and my armpits soaked. Nothing I have ever played before has matched this intensity. This game can be really fast if you have the right group of experienced players. If you love sports, and are competitive in nature, this game is for you.\n\nYou have the ability to create teams, particiapte in tournaments, build up your rank and stats, and become a legendary goalie, defender, or midfielder that others will look up to. There's just so much to say about this game, that I can't even begin to explain it.  If you're interested in the least bit, take a chance on this game, I highly doubt that you will regret it.\n\nI hope to see you on the pitch!","May 2","true","808.9"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","10","19","2","0"

I get absolutely spanked most games, but I don't rage quit. Instead I strive to be better, so that I can be the spanker someday. Obviously there are veterans on here that have played much longer than most people, so expect to get tag teamed by gorillas every now and then until you hone your skills in a practice server. Don't be salty about losing, because you will adapt overtime and become a more adept player. You have to work as a team, and you have to have fast reflexes. The movement is like that of Unreal Tournament, so 12 year olds be damned. You can strafe dash left and right, and you can quad jump in the air, which is incredibly useful in avoiding a nice kick to the face. You can put a backspin, front spin, or a side spin on the ball, which confuses even the most hardened gods sometimes. Passing is easy too, but it's also very easy to intercept as well, so git gud. All in all, it's a great game with some relation to Rocket League, but don't call it a Rocket League rip off, because this came out before it.

These are just a few descriptors that I feel accurately represent the state of Supraball.\n\nWhen buying a new game, I am often curious as to what creative energy went into bringing it to fruition. Supraball is a downgrade from the original mod in terms of art direction. This being the case primarily because Deathball used UT2K4 assets. Deathball had hundreds of user-created maps, a plethora of player models, replays, pausing, and in-game ready system, a more sophisticated kickoff system, better in-game stat tracking, and more gameplay variety. A UT2K4 mod, that had been in development for two years, had far more going on for it feature-wise than a standalone game that has, according to the dev team, been “in the works” for four years. Being a programmer, I understand the challenges behind creating something like this. However, the dev team chose to price the game at $20. Rocket League also costs $20. Rocket League is far ahead of Supraball in almost every area one could think of, and the dev team has invited this comparison via their pricing decision.\n\nGameplay-wise, Supraball is nearly the perfect type of game for me. That I cannot recommend it to most gamers should be a red flag. If you put in the time, a high-level game of Supraball can be more interesting and enjoyable than perhaps any other game I’ve played. It’s that you have to look past the poor art direction, underdeveloped visuals, missing features, nonsensical rank and lobby system, and the very steep learning curve (assuming you want to play in the higher-level games, which is where Supraball becomes far more interesting). In the hands of the right dev team, this type of game could be very successful, as you’ve seen with something like Rocket League. The Rocket League dev team listens to their community, has been a lot of creative energy into their game, and seems to generally “get it”. I cannot say the same for Supraball’s dev team. If you’re looking for something similar to Rocket League in concept, that gives you more control over what’s going on, and has, in my opinion, superior overall gameplay, buy Supraball. Just know that there are several glaring things that you must overlook, and I don’t feel that the vast majority of players are willing to or should have to. If you’re buying this game based on an expectation that it will continue to evolve, don’t. If the game were priced under $10 USD, I feel it would be easier for me to recommend.

Personally, I've played this game for 2 years, and have spent many countless hours in it, and enjoyed a good half of it. I'd give this game a chance if you're into competitive, skill dependent games and you have the patience to wait for things to come in order development wise.","May 2","true","786.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

He took on board my thoughts, put in a bug request from an issue I had and really professional the whole time. I will probably try the game again on a free weekend in the future.\n\nI'm not really sure how this game has been in development since 2012. The launcher is horrible, the graphics could be beaten by a flash game and it is all basically an eyesore.\n\nI know a lot of people really seem to like the game but I just can't understand the hype. The game was boring, felt clunky and didn't feel worth the £11 or so I paid for it.\n\nI know somebody is going to say "Oh, but it's in Early Access!!1!"..
