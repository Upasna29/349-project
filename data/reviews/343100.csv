"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lotlock/recommended/343100/","Lotlock","Lotlock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lotlock/","615 products in account","Overture is a  top-down bullet hell roguelite. It cites Diablo, Binding of Isaac, and Zelda as inspirations, but the easiest comparison is to Realm of the Mad God. It has almost the exact same gameplay style and even uses the same sprite pack. I'll start this review with a quick pro/con list for those with short attention spans and elaborate on some of those points afterwards. I've also marked each bulletpoint with the paragraph in which I elaborate on them.\n\nPROS:\nFast, kinetic, screen-filling combat (p1)\n24 classes, most of which are relatively varied (p3)\nGood soundtrack\nDev seems to actually be paying attention to what people say on the forums (p7)\nIncredibly difficult (might not be a good thing) (p8)\nPermadeath actually causes you to lose something, unlike some games touting roguelike elements (p5)\nFast running mechanic adds a tad of depth, albeit fairly little (p2)\nCONS:\nRandom level generation is essentially window dressing, having very little impact on how you actually play\nRPG mechanics are simple and boring (p5)\nOverused artwork (p6)\nSome bosses don't seem totally balanced, maybe I don't understand them yet (p8)\nMore cluttered than it needs to be (p2)\nNot many bosses or minibosses (p8)\nBoring class unlocks (p4)\nCited inspirations might imply this game is something it isn't (p5)\n\nAlright, now for the wordy rambling bits.\n\n1. While similar to Realm of the Mad God in combat, the way you progress through the game is fairly different. RotMG tends to have a slow and fairly boring start as the usual strategy is to farm fairly easy areas up to level 20 and then go into actually difficult areas. Overture is quick and difficult from the start and progresses at a much more enjoyable pace, even if it rarely gives you a chance to breath. By the 4th floor it's already of a fairly absurd difficulty.\n\n2. The combat is quick and more satisfying than I'd expect a game like this to be. There's just something simply enjoyable about wreaking havoc on everying within eyeshot. That said, some classes have skills that make the game nigh incomprehensible, completely filling the screen and destroying any clarity. Most bullet hells tend to increase opacity on your bullets and various other things that can't hit you, since strictly speaking you don't NEED to see them in order to not die. It's a really good way of increasing clarity that this game opts not to utilize. The game introduces a fairly innovative running mechanic which keeps it from having the brainless "don't stop shooting" style of gameplay a lot of bullet hell games do. After all, if there's no reason to ever NOT be pressing the button, then why should it be player-controlled instead of automatic? Minor but I like it.\n\n3. With 24 classes there's a lot to try out and I haven't quite given everything a go yet. For the most part, they all play differently. Some transform, turn invisible, summon minions, CC, but most just utterly destroy everything you can see. There is some overlap though, the worst case being the Duelist and the Bandit which for whatever reason have effectively identical kits. There's no reason for them both to exist in this game, as far as I can tell.\n\n4. You can unlock every character by paying gold which you'll be picking up constantly throughout the game and they're all fairly cheap. Some people will like this ease of access, but personally I find it incredibly boring. I would have preferred some form of unlock system beyond simply paying gold, like getting to a certain floor with a certain class or beating a boss.\n\n5. The game says it's an "action-adventure Roguelike. Drawing heavy inspiration from hits such as Diablo, The Binding of Isaac, Zelda". Though this is fairly misleading, at least it was for me. While deaths are more punshing than in some other games claiming to be rogue-inspired or "roguelite" (I'm looking at you, Rogue Legacy) claiming that this is a Roguelike is an absolute falsehood. It lacks the varied and game-changing itemization common in most Roguelikes as well as Binding of Isaac and since most items have little variety and impact it lacks the loot-based thrills of Diablo. Some items grant proc chances to, say, drop health potions or create poison novas, but most of it is fairly uninteresting. Without even a simple skill tree to offer choice and variety in character progression, the RPG elements end up being fairly dissatisfying.\n\n6. The game uses the Oryx 16-bit fantasy sprite set. If this looks familiar, it's because you've seen it before. Everywhere. It's the same one that RotMG uses.  If you haven't managed to grow sick of these sprites yet, then you'll be treated to fairly good sprite art. If you have, then the art here might be a bit boring.\n\n7. At the moment this game is a bit content-thin. I've only seen 4 or 5 main bosses, one stair-guarding miniboss (though it has a few variations on what attacks it can do), and not a lot of shiny loots to get excited about. Hopefully over time this content will be added (hopefully for free, though it's only $4 to begin with), but at the moment there's not a lot. That said, the devs seem to be active and attentive on the forums with plans to continuously add content and patch the game, so it seems likely that this will improve.\n\n8. This game is hard. You can go from full health to dead in an instant, even just against a group of normal mobs once you're a few floors in. By floor 4 it's hard as hell and I'm told it goes up to 10 (if this is wrong, please let me know). I honestly don't know if the difficulty is within reason, but if this game takes anything away from the roguelike genre it's difficulty and punishment. For the most part, this is good. It keeps you attentive and engaged. That said, if it continues to ramp up the way it does for floors 1-4 all the way up to 10, I'd expect it to go well past reasonable. It also seems like some of the bosses are not terribly well balanced. By the 4th floor bosses do so much damage that with some attacks they could kill you instantly, especially on low-HP classes. Combine this with a fast and nigh-impossible to dodge melee attack that all bosses seem to have and I start to have to wonder if I'm doing something wrong. All of my good runs have gotten to this point and simply been destroyed with no apparent way of achieving victory. Maybe I'm just not good enough at the game, but at this point it sure seems unbalanced.\n\nI think this review was probably more bad than good, but honestly, that's mostly just because I like to complain. The game is engaging, frantic, and frankly hard to put down. For $5 you're getting a really good game. I've gotten my money's worth and I've not even given half the classes a go. With more content and balance patches likely to come, it's easy to recommend this game for it's hectic, challenging, and borderline eye-melting fun.","January 29, 2015","true","7.0"," 111 of 128 people (87%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","87","111","128","9","2"

Overture isn't a bad game, but it definitely isn't a good one.\n\nOverture is a hoard-time grinding game. No, not a dungeon crawler. No, not a puzzle game. No, not an RPG. This is a grinding game. Progressing in this game isn't determined by skill, choices, or even luck, but how much time you're willing to put into this game, which honestly isn't worth it. You will NOT be able to clear this game without grinding for what seems like forever.\n\nYou collect gold in each stage, gold is used to unlock/purchase or level up a character of your choice, which becomes more expensive each time. I've only put a little over an hour into this game and even then, I had to force myself to keep playing. The only difference between floors is that enemies have more health as you progress.\n\nPros    Game is easy to learn to play\nTons of characters to unlock\nMusic is pretty good\nCons    Only fun if you want to spend hours spam clicking\nCharacters aren't very different from each other\nGame gets old very quickly","September 10, 2015","false","1.3"," 57 of 73 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","57","73","2","0"

I would not recommend this game to anyone.  It is a simple game that has 24 classes where you play and fight against hordes of monsters.   The main problem with these 24 classes is that they function too similar.  This meant that you somewhat feel like playing the same class but with a twist.  I have only made it to 6th floor but the difficulty is very high.   I put in ~15 hours, being a masochist, into one of warrior classes.   I dedicated all gold loots to upgrading it but I still could not get past 6th floor.   This is a point where I realized that this game is essentially a grindfest galore.  All 24 classes start at level 1.  To upgrade them, it cost 500*(Level number) so at first, it'll cost 500 coins, then 1000 after that, 1500 and so on.   I managed to reach level 40 on one class.  It was very expensive to upgrade at that point.  Upgrading only gives +5 attack, that is it.   Level 1 does approximately 200-240 damage.  So +5 is hardly anything but at level 40, I doubled my basic attack power.   I would think I win the game with it easily.  This is not the case.  The difficulty is really high at level 5 and on and I only made it to level 6.    That is why I said this game is really a grindfest galore.   After a while, I finally got tired of doing this.\n\nI cannot reasonably recommend this to anyone even though this game is very cheap when discounted.  It is not worth of your time as the game is repetitive because all floors have similar monsters so you would be going through them over and over.  When dead, you upgrade to get a tidbit more power and start all over again.  Rinse and Repeat.","December 11, 2015","false","16.7"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","40","48","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/343100/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","It took me an hour to get past the first level of Overture. Hard doesn’t begin to cover it really. It’s a fast paced, action ‘Rogue-lite’, with a lot of monsters, a lot of loot, and not a lot of story. While the game is certainly fun in short bursts, you are going to have to sink a lot of time into it before you can progress.\nThere are 24 playable classes split up into four types: warriors, rogues, mages and shamans. At the start, you will just have one option from each of the four types, the standard warrior, a ranger, the wizard and the cleric. The others are unlocked using the money you accumulate each time you venture out into one of the randomly generated dungeons. This money is also used to upgrade the attack power of a character once it has been unlocked.\nEarly on you will probably only be getting a few hundred goal per run, so it’s quite a limited resource. It seems odd therefore, that money is used both to unlock new characters and upgrade them. If you want to get anywhere in the game, you will need to upgrade a class a fair number of times before it is powerful enough to take on the end boss of each level. This means you will need to unlock a character you actually like playing, which is impossible to know beforehand. If you don’t get lucky, you will probably end up feeling like you have wasted some of your time, and money, on a class when you could have just been upgrading another one.\nThat said, the classes aren’t all that different when it comes down to it. You move around with WASD and attack by using the mouse buttons, where the attacks will go towards your mouse cursor. Right clicking will use your class’ special ability. You will either be up close with a melee weapon or firing from afar with a ranged weapon or a magic spell, but there aren’t a great many differences between these. You will be safer firing from a distance, but you won’t be able to make as many hits, so it balances out. However, even the sturdier characters can die pretty quickly in a bad situation.\nTo get out of a bad spot, you have the ability to run fast. In order to do this, you stop attacking, and run towards your mouse cursor. Dust picks up behind your character and you start hightailing it away. It is a clunky mechanic that could have been improved by just having a button assigned to it. It’s just too finicky to get right in a high pressure situation. It’s also not helped by your cursor often being lost in the mayhem on screen. This also hinders you in situations where you need to quickly attack in another direction.\nHowever, when you are in the thick of the action, it is a lot of fun. Damage numbers fly out of enemies and gold and items pour out of corpses and chests in a hugely satisfying fashion. Equipping items is as easy as walking over them and pressing a button. They will be ‘identified’ when you step on them, and some green or red text will tell you whether it’s better than what you currently have equipped. It won’t tell you deeper stats such as special powers, like a weapon which has a chance to reanimate slain enemies to fight for you. But this information can be viewed from a pause screen.\nWhat you get is just the luck of the draw though, so you will sometimes find yourself woefully underprepared for the final boss of each level, and even some of the smaller enemies will pose a tough challenge if they manage to gang up on you. The randomness of loot drops doesn’t help the overall difficulty. It’s obviously supposed to be hard, but the difficulty invariably comes from not having the right stats for the fight, rather than based on player skill.\nOverture is frustrating at times and has some odd ways of doing things, but when it works, it really works. It takes cues from the likes of Diablo, Zelda and Realm of the Mad God, and there are many reasons for fans of those games to check this one out. Just know that you will be spending a lot of time in the game, and much of it may feel like a grind. There’s no story, and no other modes to speak of. Thankfully, the action makes up for it in most places.","August 21, 2015","true","10.6"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","34","43","0","1"

I don't play rogue-likes nor even really understand what that even means, to be brutally honest.\n\nHowever, it's hard to not fall in love with Overture. There are so many different classes that offer a lot of variety in how you approach the game. The music and sounds are fantastic. The gameplay itself is smooth, fast-paced, rewarding, and frustrating (in a good way).\n\nWith that said, the game obviously has some kinks to iron out still (at least, I hope). Difficult games are a thing of the past, and I enjoy the difficulty of this one. The bosses are near impossible... They can hit you, slow you down, and kill you within seconds. It's often not fair, but you can go back for revenge a thousand times over. What I don't like is that loots can spill and spawn into poison swamps or large spike pits. What's the point, really?\n\nAnother complaint might be that the difficulty scrolls upwards so incredibly quickly. Floor 1-1 is simple to navigate and make through alive with any class, but to beat the boss and do anything below that floor takes more luck than skill. The blood and whatnot that enemies leave disguise spike traps and other traps on the floor. That isn't real difficulty, that's just being annoying -- and I hope it gets fixed.\n\nI would also like to see more statistics become upgradable in the game. I have one class at Tier 10, and I find the advantage minimal at best. I don't know if armor or items really make that big of a difference, which makes the loot and upgrade system feel a little empty -- which is a huge problem. After playing this game for X number of hours you begin to realize that the developers don't really want to reward you for playing the game, they just want to make it impossible to navigate. It's a little frustrating... Because again, what is the point?\n\nWhy have armor when it does nothing? Why collect gold beyond unlocking all of the classes because it feels like it does nothing? Why grind out levels and xp when it does NOTHING. Developers biggest issue is making the game, the items, and the grind feel like it matters... Feel like it all is worth it because your character will kick major ♥♥♥. That is lacking right now.\n\nOverall, I wish there was more to do with collected gold and the game keeps track of scrolls for some reason I don't understand yet. It's a fun game that you can sink a few hours into, but right now it's nothing to get too serious about. It's worth the $4 or $5 dollars though.","January 27, 2015","true","10.1"," 37 of 53 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","37","53","4","0"

It's only a baby step in the right direction for Black Shell Games, but a step nonetheless. I love this game. But I cannot deny that it is flawed and actually oddly enough is being flawed even further. Upon playing build 1.1.1 l had a great time. Sure, many things were unbalanced. Some classes were far better than others. But that was part of the charm Overture brought to the table. But when the developer cranks out an update literally every single day, sometimes two in a day, with a few bug fixes and many class nerfs, that charm fades away. Overture is crazy hard. Only gets worse with each update. I've been playing for 19 hours so far and get slaughtered on the fourth floor. Ten floors in total. Upgrading your character once grants you a 5 damage bonus for each attack you land. 500 gold is added to the upgrade price each time you upgrade. Honestly, l am not very fond of the upgrade system. Hard to call it a system at all. Maybe if you could choose which stat to upgrade instead of attack all the time it would be better. But if you don't get good gear in your run, then happy trails, because you're dead. I don't know what the objective of the dev is. Is it to make the game brutally difficult? If so, mission accomplished. This game defines the grind. You can play for half an hour and have enough for one measly 5 damage upgrade before going off for another half hour. It's ludicrous. I've really enjoyed what a class does and upgraded that character a bunch just to look at the patch notes the next day to see the one aspect l liked about that character revoked. The graphics are pretty nice, they look good. Bright and colorful. But the recycling is so heavy. Bosses are basically just reskins of eachother with one unique attack thrown in. But why do the bosses get so many advantages? For example: Reanimator. Reanimator is a necromancer boss. He rushes you incredibly fast before you have time to dodge, so there goes half your health bar. He summons 2 dragons at once, prepare to be distracted. He summons skeletons, prepare to be annoyed. He is protected by revolving orbs, prepare to stay away. Why on Earth does he do all those things? How about just skeletons and the occasional fireball or two? Oh, and how 'bout the fact that there's ten floors and five bosses. Real good for the Earth, this recycling. The music is the one thing that's pretty much perfect. Props to Rafael Smith. 24 classes in total, and the variety is nice. The nerfs just ruin 'em though. All in all, Overture is a potentially great game ruined by its flaws, made way too hard, and treated like an early access game. If I had to give a verdict, l'd say 6.5 out of 10. I wish l could recommend this game. Good for a few hours, but don't get sucked in.

I've seen them used in dozens of games and I can't help but be tired of them at this point. I understand it's a sprite pack, and there is a reason this one is so popular, and that reason is why you should consider using something else.\n\nDamage numbers are inflated to the point of irony right off the bat. The numbers cover the screen in a way that feedback is difficult to deliver on things such as damage dealt, whom it is dealt to, and who is on the verge of death. In the midst of combat it is hard to tell who is actually about to die: you or the dozens of enemies around you.\n\nHaving the camera so close to the player certainly doesn't help either. The fast running is a neat mechanic, and is utilized fine in boss fights, but in any other scenario the camera is unable to keep up with the character, making it feel like a gimmick. If the camera were to lead in front of the player as he ran rather than slog behind, this wouldn't be a complaint.\n\nUpgrades and class unlocks are, as far as first-impressions go, pointless. There is no real progression - all classes cost the same to unlock, are all available from the start, and all "tiers" do the same thing as far as I know (a flat damage boost, maybe some other stats are raised). The only real differences between the classes is the sprites used, accompanied by a small change to the attack used, though they all basically function identically, filling the screen with massive damage numbers and not enough feedback to the player. Compared to games such as the obvious Realm of the Mad God (c. not 2014-15), this is extremely lackluster.\n\nOverall, disappointing with some challenge. Fun to look at for a little while, but nothing to consider a favorite for any genre - and especially not as a roguelike. Would be worth it if it were cheaper, but with how shallow the progression is I wouldn't consider a purchase at this moment.","March 2, 2015","false","0.0"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","25","42","0","0"

I am the 99%.\n\nOn the one hand, the core of Overture's slash-em-up fantasy bullet hell gameplay (with a great soundtrack to boot) is incredibly addicting. Heck, I'll probably go back to playing it after I finish this review. On the other hand, there's not much else to it. The level are all randomly generated squares where the enemies slowly rush you. The bosses (all of which are simply scaled-up versions of normal enemies) all require exactly the same strategy: kiting in an extremely confined space. The upgrade system is one-dimensional and gets very expensive very fast. Some of the classes are unique and fun, but others are only slight variations on other classes and many are simply not viable if you want to get anywhere in the game.\n\nIf you buy this game, you'll probably have a few hours of fun with it.

But as you play more and more that feeling that you'll never get beyond the first three floors and are stuck grinding more infinitesimal stat increases that you know, deep down, will never give you the edge to win the game, gradually eats the fun out of the experience.\n\nSo, how would I improve Overture?\n-Better boss designs that required more dynamic strategies and larger, more varied boss rooms (perhaps with traps?)\n-More coherent enemies and map combinations to combat the utter randomness. Being rushed by armies of skeletons, spiders, oozes, yetis, ogres, necromancers AND minotaurs in a single level is ridiculous and completely immersion-breaking, especially when the game has several clear map themes (forest, dungeon, lava, etc.)\n-More varied enemy behavior and skills, especially for melee enemies\n-Permanent stat increases beyond attack power (health, mana, etc)\n-Stat and mechanical improvements for the game's less viable classes (Knight, Invoker, Bandit, etc.)","April 27","false","8.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Play Hero Siege, instead.\n\nBoth games sort of hinge on the same principle by going overkill with destructibles and number of exploding enemies. Honestly, while this game would have been something neat to see as freeware and a developer's experiment on making a game satisfying to play, it's simply not worth paying for, at all. This is, of course, my opinion - other people seem to be enjoying this, although this game is being given away for free.\n\nThey use particle effects, permanent bodies and bloodstaines, screenshake and overall a buttload of money and numbers on the screen to make the player feel overpowered. That aspect is quite nice, although it's very clearly an amateur take on it. With some refinement it could be really satisfying.\n\nDespite having this one nice aspect, the whole game seems like simply filler, and it doesn't do anything new.\n\nThe games has probably dozens of classes, which sounds like a lot. However, they mostly play the same. There are only 2 attack: main and special. Special attacks drain mana. The main attacks between classes vary simply in range and power, but they're all essentially the same.\nThe game has one mechanic: you run faster is you're running in the same direction as the mouse pointer - i.e., you can't aim while running away.\nIt's an interesting mechanic, for sure!\n\nBut the game just swarms you with enemies, it's too zoomed in, attacks are way too big and obfuscating, as are the enemy corpses. Nothing interesting in the environments, you can't see what you're getting hit by, you often get stuck in random terrain that you can't see properly...\n\nIt was a fun game to play for 30 minutes. Again, if it was a freeware game like Cactus' or JW's, it would have been cool. The developers gets to create a name for himself while trying something new, and people get a couple of minutes of enjoyment. Once you have to pay for it... it's just not worth it, at all.\n\nVery unpolished and bland, in general. Again, try Hero Siege - not perfect, but far better than this in every respect.","June 26, 2015","false","3.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Really.\n\nAt the beginning the game looks very challenging because thousands of enemies come to you and you die very quickly. It looks like the only purpose of the game is you accumulating ``money'' to invest in better characters. However, after you realize that leveling up makes you way stronger than investing money in your character, you can just obtain the right objects to level up fast and grind your way through the floors.\n\nIt does not help that, every time you save, you lose your progress on the current floor and have to kill all the enemies again, but keep your level. Thus, you can actually trick the game and become insanely powerful just by loading, killing monsters for a while, saving, starting killing monsters again.\n\nI spent several hours on this while thinking about something else, just for the sake of beating it.

Has potential but a lot of issues right now. Spawning of enemies is too eratic (I've pretty much died before my screen was fully visible) and it's way too difficult to see anything, especially when you die in only a few hits. There's not much of a tutorial and the game starts at a pretty fast pace without a lot of explanation about anything, but it's fairly intuitive so that's fine. It would be nice if there was a health and mana bar that wasn't right below your character, because it's almost impossible to see when you're swarmed. Could also be improved if there was a simple replay button instead of bringing you back to the main menu when you die (which you will do a lot). A more complex upgrade system would be nice, I only got my ranger to level 6 or so but from what I saw it only increased damage, but being able to upgrade armor, health, and mana as well would be nice. There are 5 item slots that are nice for a little bit of customization but each type of armor slot all provide the same buff (weapon is attack, armor is def, etc.) and maybe a random chance buff (8% more gold or something). There are 24 total characters I think, and there is enough variation between them where for the most part they feel unique, but ultimately the gameplay is all the same: hold left click and dodge, with an occasional right click; how oftten you right click is probably the main difference. Overall it's decently fun but it doesn't seem to have much depth and as others have pointed out, it's just a bit of a grindfest.","March 26","false","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've never played such a well done and smooth pixel RPG in my life. So, I can imagine whats going through your head right now. What did this game do wrong to make me rate it poorly?\n\nThe answer: It has no purpose. I spent the first few hours playing this game completely enthralled. But after about 5 hours of constant playing, I unlocked every character, played with them for awhile, but then, with every single playable class at my disposal; it got boring. At this point, I realized the entire point of the game is to gain money to buy and level up the characters. But do the characters get new skills to try out? No. Is the story interesting? It's not even there. Well, is the dungeon layout interesting? There is only two things that can even come close to stopping you from getting anywhere in the dungeon is water, which slows you down, and walls, which would be interesting if they walls were in ramdom places, which they are, except for the fact that YOU AND EVERY SINGLE ENEMY CAN BREAK THEM WITH THREE HITS MAKING THEM BASICALLY NON-EXISTENT. If you want a solid 5 hours of fun, buy this game right now. However, I would save that money to buy a game that this game should have done better, like Nuclear Throne, or any other pixel RPG out there.

At least, that's how I hope if functions. The game also has a "gold" feature, which is gained by playing and dying eventually. The gold can then be used to purchase more classes or alternatively to purchase upgrades for classes that you have already unlocked.(edited in)\n\nThis is a great concept done rather poorly.\nThe RotMG feeling is unmistakable, yet confused. The gameplay is extremely cluttered, so that you struggle to see what is in front of you. Furthermore, the enemies and bosses mix into each other so well that you can't distinguish between your character, your allied NPCs, the boss, enemies, and obstacles.\n\nWhile the game features a large cast of classes, their gameplay quickly becomes extremely repetitive. With an extremely cluttered screen, you can barely see how your abilities and attacks function. The loot system is pretty nice, but it is difficult to tell what exactly each item is.\n\nNonetheless, this game is packed with action and, while I criticized the clutter above, it is simultaenously satisfying to see gold and equipment covering the screen as enemies die. However, Overture contains a steep learning curve that almost requires you to spend at least an hour gaining enough gold, to get past the first level or two.(edited in)\n\nAlso, gameplay can get old very quickly as the characters(i.e., classes) are not too different. And, as I have breifly crossed over above, the game forces you to sink hours into it if you want to progress. This is not a game where you get to have luck or choices determine how far you get, this is a game where your progress is measured through how much time you put in. (edited in)\n\nHowever, the game does have trading cards, which is nice, and also has a decent soundtrack.\n\n\nAnd, TL;DR: This game has a cluttered screen that hinders the rather fun gameplay. However, the gamplay gets old fast, and you are forced to put hours in to progress - you can't get very far with just skill or even luck.\n\nI rate this game a 1.5/10. I have a rather low rating for most games, so this is not as bad a rating as it seems. Try this game out if you have a chance, as it is worth a try. If you like it, get it, but by no means should you buy it otherwise.\n\n(last two paragraphs edited in)","August 29, 2015","false","3.9"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The game is a great dungeon crawler retro type.  You can play as many different classes - Warrior, Rogues, Mages, and Shamans.  Each category has several character types with their own unique weapons and perks.\n\nEach dungeon or level, I should say, is generated randomly.  Here you rescue NPCs who will fit with you and you collect gold and mana and health from killing enemies and destroying vessels.  The enemies are all unique, some move slowly, some sneak up really fast, some have ranged projectiles.\n\nThe game is simple, but made of the best possible ingredients.  And the game is challenging!  The game ramps up it's adrenaline as you do.  When playing it can get to an insane level of enemies requiring accurate attacking while moving and seeking safety.  There are no true safe areas and thus the skilled player must be alert and quick.  With the gold, you can upgrade your character(s).  You also use the gold to unlock other characters within a class.\n\n\nIt has the feeling of retro goodness.  It surpasses retro goodness in my opinion.  It's one of those games that could easily eat through many stacks of quarters with no regrets.\n\nThe original soundtrack is great.  It is hard to please everyone with a soundtrack, but I think they did a great job and I enjoy my Overture sessions with headphones on as great detail was put into the audio.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

The game itself is easy to pick up, as the mechanics are rather straight-forward (in a good way), and the controls are easy to learn.

Initially very satisfying and overwhelming, the veneer of big numbers and particle effects wears off a few hours in. The movement and attacking is well-done, and it's a genuinely challenging and usually fair game.\n\nThe coolest part is unlocking and trying out all the different classes (24! wow!) which generally do play slightly differently. Once I did that, I tried to focus on beating the game. A few dozen deaths in, I came to realize that the only way to really have a chance at winning is to grind, grind, grind on each of the giant floors with thousands of monsters to click on. Levels are king, and the most correct way to play is also the most boring. This is unfortunate.\n\nA floor time limit, diminishing returns on experience per kill per floor, etc would go a long way to making this less of a slog, and more of the "pick up and play coffee break roguelike" that it wants to be.\n\nI recommend this game all the same, because it is a lot of fun and I maintain that there's potential here, if the developers are still interested in it.

So that means whenever you get killed, everything will be gone except the money you earned. You can then spend them on two things, unlock new sub-classes or level up individual sub-classes.\n\nThe cycle is simple but addicting. The combat is intense like a bullet-hell style so some may get distracted on the shiny effects so be careful guys. But I don't have any personal issues with it since I've already played games like Beat Hazard.\n\nSome classes have different combat styles and not everyone appeals to certain players. Some do damages on close range and some are from afar. They also have different speed of mobility so in the end, each has their own strength and weaknesses.\n\nDon't worry about having issues with certain classes in the game.

After that you're thrown head fisrt into the action. You can move around a medium sized arena and your goal is to descend 10 floors and kill the final baddie. Combat is simple: hold LMB for your basic attack, which can be a quick slash or a stream of fireballs depending on who you chose to play as, and RMB is your hero's stronger ability, for instance the Druid can shapeshift or the Arsonist can randomly lay down flames that continually damage your enemy. There is also a sprint mechanic where you make your character follow the mouse cursor and it will give you a small speed boost as long you don't attack during the sprint.\n\nAction can get a bit hectic, because sometimes there is so much going on screen: enemies, damage numbers, loot, fireballs. It can be a total mess at times, but it won't last longer than a few seconds, either you kill all enemies or the trample you. After the battlefield calms down you can pick up t3h ph4t l3wt left by the enemies. Items like armor to raise your defense, heal you or boost your attack power are all present here.\n\nAfter you die (this will happen a lot) or beat the game (this takes some practice to do) you will be shown the result gravestone telling you how many enemies you've defeated and how much gold you were able to snatch. Gold can be used to unlock new character classes and permanently increase their attack power - you will need to do this to stand a chance at the later stages of the game.\n\nFinal verdict: A simple and hectic hack&slash that can get a bit repetitive, but overall a nice time killer. :>","March 9, 2015","true","3.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

It's fast pace and though the mechanics are simple enough, it still manage to offer a fairly high skill ceiling experience.\n\nYou'll be entering a procedurally generated map where you'll be hacking, shooting, and casting against hordes of enemies. The bosses are often tough and offer a fair degree of variety in strategy. You'll also be collecting money and loot as you travel. Though your loot get reset with every play, the cash you collect carry on, allowing you to purchase new classes and upgrades.\n\nThe game is mechanically sound. It's addictive, it's tough, and it mixes it up enough that each play through will offer it's own set of challenges. Where the game lacks a tiny bit is in the visuals. It's by no means ugly, and certainly has it's charm in it's pixel art, it it does look pretty standard issue. I didn't find the art direction to be very memorable. This is one of those games where it's "mechanics over graphics".\n\nOverall Overture is a pretty enjoyable little romp, with some addictive qualities to it.

Your goal is to kill a boss of each floor to advance the game by using stairs to move to another floor. You'll be killing hordes of monsters first though, to level up and get loot. Once you kill the boss and enter stairs you get to fight what I'll call "in-between-floors-boss" that happens to be quite challenging, especially for some classes. Once IBFB is down you get to move down a floor and then repeat until you finally beat the game.\n\nThere are currently 24 classes in the game split into 4 categories of classes: Warriors, Rogues, Mages and Shamans.\nEach class has it's own perks and Left and Right mouse button attacks. Left mouse button is your normal attack that doesn't consume any mana while Right mouse button is your special attack that consumes mana to use.\n\nIt's a simple game with rather quick learning curve but it's very fun, addicting and challenging at the same time.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that even though the game is finished the developer has said that he will continue to update the game for as long as he can financially sustain himself from sales. He listens to suggestions on forum and he already implemented some things into the game that we players wanted (ability to change the key for picking up gear, quit&save feature that saves your progress when quitting the run so you can continue it later).","February 1, 2015","true","8.5"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

Don't let the graphics fool you and this game is the perfect example of the wise old saying  "Don't judge a book by its cover"\n\nThis game is an action packed rogue style dungeon hunter where no two games are exactly the same due to the procedurally generated levels.  There are tons of mobs, mid-level bosees, and each level has a gigantic mega boss that can be pretty difficult if you aren't prepared to dodge a massive assault of elemental damage thrown at you.\n\nThis game is challenging right from the first level you'll start at, and while it is a very easy game to learn, mastering it requires good hand-eye coordinationand practice.  It never feels "too tough" to conquer however, and you always seem to have that feeling like if you had only moved here or done that, you might have won.  So you try again, eager to defeat the evil forces the next time!  What I am saying is that this game is challenging enough to keep you focused and alert, while at the same time rewarding you heavily for your success for however long you live with massive piles of loot, gold, and virtual goodies.\n\nYou only have a single life, and once your health runs out, your game is over.  The good thing is that you can release NPCs who will follow you around and shoot at whatever it is you are shooting at to assist you along your journey, and they will help you until their very last breath.  There are also loads of health potions dropped and found in barrels, chests, and other breakables to keep you alive and going.\n\nThis game mixes old school classic arcade goodness with gameplay similar to Asteroids, Galaga, and Centipede but with much more responsiveness and action then any of those golden oldies could have ever have been able to do.  This game offers relentless exploration of dungeon levels  that are filled with fantasy RPG baddies, massive loot, and non-stop choatic action.\n\nI would pay three times the regular asking price of this game and still feel that I got a good value for my gaming dollar, but with a regular price tag of only $4.99 you simply cannot go wrong.  On sale, this game is a no-brainer, and I give this game one of my very rare "MUST BUY" ratings.  The price paid versus the solid gaming fun you'll receive in return is nothing but pure 'win'.\n\nThere are a lot of rogue action games like this one out there, but few do it as well as Overture.  My score is an easy 9.5 out of 10, and for it's asking price.. to not buy this game right now should be a gamer's sin.  Overture is a massive pile of glimmering loot to be had for the small fee it asks you for!","January 26, 2015","true","5.3"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","21","42","2","1"

The stats, gold, upgrades, seperate character classes, and equipment are just a ruse, a clever illusion to make you think that you're actually playing a game.\n\nNope, this is just an interactive screensaver with pretty music.

Well...I only beat the 1st boss with the rogue. This game is pretty difficult and dying seems cheap because at least 80% of the time you die you have no idea what the hell is hurting you because it's chaos on the screen.\n\nThere are 5 sub-types of each main type of character to unlock (i.e 6 warriors, 6 rogues, 6 wizards, and 6 priests total), and each sub-type can be upgraded to do more damage. All of this is done with gold that you gather while playing levels and you keep after you die. So there is a lot to do in this game if you want to unlock each type of character.\n\nEdit: I unlocked every rogue. I need to say that the different characters actually add to the game.

Within that amount of time I played about 20-30 rounds and realized that there were golden monetary value I had been picking up. Realizing this I had a lot of coins (or what I believed was a lot), so I started upgrading everything not carrying what I was going to end up choosing to be my favorite class (which is mage) I upgraded everything in my site. I then proceeded to die over and over building up coins.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ctetters/recommended/343100/","ctetters","Bangers n' Mash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ctetters/","148 products in account","Overture is honestly fast becoming one of my favourite games.\n\nFirstly, I'd describe this game as being simple to control, but nigh on impossible to master. The control scheme is as straightforward as they come, only using WSAD and the mouse, but the difficulty lies in coping with the colossal amount of enemies on each level (supposedly up to 10 levels, but in my first couple of hours, I never got past 2). There are 24 different classes, divided between warriors, archers, mages and shamans, and I found myself using mainly the standard ranger. I did also try some of the others, and it's clear from the get-go that used properly, you can get through swathes of enemies regardless of which class you choose.\n\nThere are also power-ups scattered around, which can either be better equipment (letting you deal more damage, increasing mana regeneration etc); or NPCs who follow you around and help you deal damage. As well as this, you can collect gold as you go through the game, and use it to buy new classes or upgrade the ones you already have.\n\nMy only slight complaint would be to do with the bosses, which must be killed to progress from level to level. Given that no class has a huge amount of HP, fighting such absurdly tough bosses in such a small room can become frustrating.\n\nUltimately, this game is brilliantly fast-paced, very punishing (although rarely unfairly so), very well presented in a 16-bit style, and utterly painfully addictive. For £4, you can't go wrong.","June 22, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I myself have played realm of the mad god for about 2 years and i can Directly relate it to this game! Good Job Game Creators!\n\n\n\nTips: I would recommend a few certain classes of you are looking to go far.\n\nCleric: The cleric is an amazing starter class and probably one of the best in the game and definitely the best starter class, his amazing primary attack summons little yellow attacks that home in on enemies so you can be hitting enemies while not hitting enemies! To top it off when you step on a trap just hold right click for a second and all the enemies in the area get completely wiped out! This class is great to play and really good if you are looking to go far!\n\n\n\nRogue: The Rogue is a good class if you are not good at getting out of sticky situations. His primary attack is a force to be reckoned with at close range as all 4 daggers hit and do massive damage! His ability causes him to freeze all enemies in the vicinity so if you step on a trap dont worry. The only problem i have found with this is that a ranged enemy will insta shoot you when you let go of the right mouse button but overall it is still a good class to use.\n\n\n\nPaladin: Lastly the paladin is an AMAZING class for tanking because his Primary attack shoots extremely fast and deals massive amounts of damage. His secondary ability however takes the cake, his secondary ability causes any enemies that come in touch with you to freeze and take damage so if you get in a pickle you won't die with this class! I have noticed one bug where if you stand on an enemy while it is stunned you will take damage so beware! He is a good class if you are maybe just starting out and wanna farm alot of the little enemies for gold in order to purchase classes and upgrade tiers!","February 7, 2015","true","6.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

You get to pick from four starting classes and 20 other unlockable classes. Then your set in a randomly generating dungeon where loads of enemys spawn from all edges of the map. when you have spent enough time (or killed enough enemies, not sure) a boss appears, its a slime but dont underestimate it, you can die quickly if you dont pay attention.  I wont tell you more but its like this through alot of the game.\n\nOne complaint that i have is that there is no multiplayer, me and my friend got this to play together but it wasnt co-op\n\nsince this game just came out i would give it a 10/10","January 31, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

If you dislike Overture, you'll call it unremarkable and derivative. Both reviews, I think, are absolutely fair.\n\nAs is standard for the genre, you're a pixelated fellow with far too little health and far too many foes, and it's your job to wander through a series of monster-infested fields to find and murder a miniboss guarding a staircase, which will take you to a boss fight. It's played from a top-down perspective and feels at times like a hack-n-slash and at other times almost like a bullet hell.\n\nGear drops occasionally, and with the exception of the occasional item with a special ability attached to it, each piece of equipment does the same thing; a sword, for instance, will always increast your attack power, while a ring will always increase your mana regeneration. Though shallow, this is good; you absolutely don't have time for any deeper item comparison than figuring out which number is bigger and going with that.\n\nEach class has a (usually) fairly generic left-click main attack aimed towards your mouse cursor, typically some variation on the theme of either a fired arrow or a sword swung mercifully halfway across the screen. Each also has a right-click ability that consumes mana and is unique to its own class; the rogue, for instance, becomes invisible while right click is held, while the Ranger fires a spread of arrows. It's all quite straightforward and follows the equipment system's example of not being a lot, but just enough.\n\nAs a longtime fan of Roguelikes, Roguelike-likes, and whatever else you want to call procedurally-generated games that hate you and want you to die, I can tell you that Overture doesn't do anything particularly unique. It's a variation on the themes of its predecessors, and if you've played the Diablos, the Realms of the Mad God, the Zeldas, or the Bindings of Isaac it cites as its inspirations, you're not going to see anything you haven't seen before. However, whether or not it does anything new, Overture does what it does very well.\n\nUltimately, if you feel like you have enough action-Roguelikes, you can pass this one by; while good, Overture is by no means unmissable. However, if there's room in your life for another entry in the admittedly crowded genre, Overture is a good choice, and I heartily recommend it.","June 20, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meinac/recommended/343100/","Meinac","Meinac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Meinac/","565 products in account","I haven't played this game for too long, as thus haven't gotten very far, but I believe I've grasped how it plays.\nThis is a light-rogue, hack n' slash, with minimal RPG touches. If you've played them, it will probably remind you of Hero Siege and maybe Quest of Dungeons.\n\nControlsThe controls for this game are very easy, specially since there are only five actions you can take:\nlist]\nMove (WASD)\nBasic attack (LMB)\nSpecial attack (RMB)\nPickup item/ Equip (RMB/F/Space)\nCharacter sheet/ menu (C/esc)There aren't many options to customise this, but they're really not necessary anyway.\n\nDifficultyThat said, although it's easy to get the hand of the controls, winning/ not dying? Not so easy.\nThe game doesn't have true permadeath, you get to keep the money of your runs and use this to unlock other character classes and upgrade them.\nIt can be a bit slow at first as you get familiar with the classes and the game. As far as I've gotten it seems progress is slow too for a while (I haven't made it further than the second floor). Luckily though, the floor is randomly generated, so at leats you're not stuck with the same layout/design each time.\n\nGameplayAs I've mentioned above, there are many classes: a total of 24 divided into 4 subgroups of Warriors, Rogues, Mages, and Shamans. Each have their small differences which are fun to discover.\nSeeing the trailer or the screenshots in the store page the game might seem very messy. Once you start playing though, it's not so hard to know what's going on. It might still get a bit confusing if you're playing a ranged character and you get yourself in the middle of a mob, but it's not so crazy.\nTo help with your questing, different types of NPCs can be freed. These NPCs follow you around and help beat monsters up. They die easily though.\n\nArtThe game has a nice pixel art from Oryx Design Lab (thus why it reminds me of Quest of Dungeons so much) which you might have seen in other games. It's a nice pack and it's fun to see how it's used here if you've played other games with the same one.\n\nMusicAwesome bit music that keeps you exited while hacking everything.\n\nOSAs of the date of this review the game is only available for windows.\nHowever! It seems like it works perfectly with wine :)\n\nMoreEven though the game has left early-access, the development pace is still very fast, with many updates being released. It's great to see a development team that listens to players and keep working on the product even after it could hold its own.\n\nOverallThis is a great buy if you enjoy fast paced rogue-likes. You can play this taking advantage of the upgrade system to make advancing easier, but you can also ignore it if you enjoy permadeath experiences.\nEach game doesn't take long, so it's a great game to play when you don't want to/ can't spend too long on it.","February 26, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Areanynamesnottaken/recommended/343100/","Areanynamesnottaken","Celerity, Executor of Impunity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Areanynamesnottaken/","276 products in account","I bought this game just because it was made by the same people as SanctuaryRPG, heavy action games aren't normally something I favor but this one really impressed me.\n\nLet's start with the good:\n\nReally hard early on. There's people complaining about not making it past the first level out of 10. You actually can die there without being completely bad at the game.\nVery gameplay dense. For a game with such simple mechanics as move and launch one of two different attacks it really does a lot with them and requires a lot of focus or you'll die.\nVery gameplay focused. How many games regale you with their shiny water and copious offering of exposed breasts and then when you actually play them it's just a buggy, incomplete, boring trainwreck? You won't see that here, the focus is purely on the game itself - and the game itself is solid.\n24 classes that can be unlocked fairly quickly, each of which feel and play very differently.\nSteadily increasing intensity - the higher levels both have more enemies and more dangerous enemies, combat gets very chaotic very fast.\nThe developer is extremely active and maintains direct and regular contact with the userbase.\n\nAnd now the bad:\n\nFairly weak graphical optimization. Even though these are SNES graphics they will still cause serious slowdown when there is extremely large amounts of activity on screen, and there almost always is later. The developer has tried fixing this, and it's usually fine but extreme activity will still cause performance problems.\nExcessive graphical clutter from on kill/destroyed effects can obscure important parts of the screen.\nExcessive graphical clutter from certain heroes' special abilities can obscure important parts of the screen.\nHas the standard Roguelike problem at a very extreme level. You'll either die early or win in 99.9% of cases. The first time I reached floor 5 and didn't die near instantly because I got swarmed was the first time I won. Why? Because not only does the player have good tools at this point but also you start vastly outscaling the enemies, such that they do low or even single digit damage per hit while you hit for over 1,000 by endgame. You can't lose at that point no matter how bad you are even though those late game situations would otherwise be extremely dangerous.\nNot a lot of enemy variety. Once you hit floor 4 or 5 you quit seeing new enemies and attacks until the end, which means once you know how you deal with the early game you know how the rest of the game works. Bosses start repeating as well, there should be 9 in a random order + the final boss at minimum, instead there are 6 + the final boss.\n\nOverall I'd still recommend the game - it's one of the few on Steam worth full price but if you can get a sale certainly take it. I believe the developer will reduce the amount of graphical clutterr, add more content, and make the later game harder which fixes every problem on that list.","June 29, 2015","true","34.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

This one seemed like it could be fun given the classes etc...\n\nHowever such is not the case in this game. It's fun when you boot up. Walking around and slashing and killing mass enemies, but when you find the boss it tends to be a different story. Sometimes the bosses can end up over poison, and they don't move which makes it hard to kill them without dying a painful death. Even if you manage to kill the boss that leads down the stairs, you end up fighting another boss that if it manages to hit you, locks you down until you die.\n\nWeapons don't seem to add much of anything to your attack value as the damage numbers rarely go above 300 even after picking up a weapon.\n\nThis game has an excruciatingly bad boss system with zero chance of staying away once you get hit as they slow you down. If you're looking for a rogue lite or like game, this is not the one to play.","January 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 32 of 72 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","32","72","0","8"

The random layouts can be fun, until it drops you into a pit of acid that you can't get out of in time and you did 3 seconds into the game. The mechanics here are not really different then anything you've seen before, and honestly were disappointing in a whole.

I know how difficult it is to make a game, but if you make it to sell for actual profit, please take your time to polish it a little.

There are no sprites. It's a lot of single  static sprites moving around the map. What? The characters and enemies are too upclose to pull that off. It looks plain weird.\n7.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/343100/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: A seemingly simple, brutally hard, speed roguelike that has unexpected depth and unlockables as you play.  A fast, twitchy grab-the-gold, kill-the-monster, go-as-deep-as-you-can game great for people looking for that experience.  Has a lot to offer, but takes some patience.\n\nOverture is the classic, stereotypical dungeon crawler/roguelike boiled down to its basic - go into a dungeon as a given class, slaughter monsters, level up, grab treasure, live as long as you can.   It's for fun, fast, short-term play - though you may be surprised how long you may play it.\n\nYou pick a class, which has two different attack abilities, and wander across a randomly geneated field, battling monsters of many kinds by using your various abilities.  The monsters themselves have different abilities, though most are cannon fodder - but watch out, some more powerful versions (who have titles or are different sizes) and special monsters may surprise you.\n\nMonsters and various chests, jars, and barrels will drop treasure.  Most of this is gold and healing and mana potions, but the occasional piece of equipment drops as well.  The equipment often has little game-changing rules and additions that can make a different and require some thought.  You may even find NPCs who join you - until the inevitable onslaughts kill them off.\n\nEach level has a boss monster guarding a stairwell, which leads in turn to a REAL boss monster.  Defeat these much more difficult opponents and you get a bonus to mana or health, a chance to buy random equipment, and then move on to the next level.\n\nThe game at first seems overly simple and overly hard, but rewards retrying.  Classes are different - radically different.  You can learn strategies for different enemies.  Gold and scrolls (which can become gold) that you recover can unlock new classes and level up ones you already have.  There's a lot to the game, its just often concealed beneath the frenzy and the randomness.\n\nThe game's biggest flaws are erratic difficulty and limited documentation - made more painful due to the randomness.  It takes patience to get into it enough to really enjoy it.  More polishing and documentation would definitely help.\n\nDo I reccomend it?  Like many games, the question is "is it your thing."  It's not something everyone must play - it is something for people who like dungeon crawlers and action, and want a "hardcore casual" game that's challenging, but can also be picked up and put down.  In the latter case, Overture delivers.\n","March 7, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was asked to leave "an honest review", so keep that in mind.\n\nSo here's where I'm at with this: It looks and feels similar to Realm of the Mad God. If you liked Realm's gameplay, you'll feel right at home with Overture - it's like Realm on crack. I haven't seen any indication of multiplayer functionality though, which would be pretty neat.\n\nI pretty much have nothing to complain about mechanics-wise, controls are responsive and simple. I do have some usability/gameplay gripes though:\nHealth and mana bars are difficult to see. When my character is getting swarmed by mobs, I generally can't tell how my health is until the screen goes red, and at that point I'm pretty much toast.\nIt's impossible to know what your newly-unlocked character's abilities are until you start a new run with them - you have to open the character sheet to know exactly what you can do.\nThe font on the in-game character sheet is hard to read.\nWhen two items drop on the same tile I can only pick up one of them if I already had a piece of gear in that equipment's slot.\nFiguring out if I just picked up a stronger or weaker piece of gear is a matter of dropping and picking back up and checking the character sheet to read the stats and abilities on my gear. It breaks the flow since I can't immediately tell what I just got.\nSome of the bosses (especially the blobs) seem really unbalanced for certain classes at lower levels/upgrade tiers. Maybe I'm not playing cleric right though.\nApart from that, I really like this game a lot. The classes feel varied enough to keep me bent on unlocking more of them, I love the soundtrack, looting is addictive, and it just feels right. Like a perfect cross between Hammerwatch and Realm. If you're a roguelike fan, definitely give this game a go.","March 9, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/343100/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","There is a subset of gamers that really intrigues me: the type that slaves away hunched over their monitors, doing the same repetitive task over and over, with only the faintest glimmer of hope for a reward at the end of their trials. I’ve never much been into games that require excessive grinding, or for the  player to invest a lot of their time for that shiny trinket that is only marginally better than the previous one, but each to their own I suppose. So, when Overture landed in my inbox I wasn’t exactly overcome with joy, but I wasn’t filled with trepidation either.\n\nOverture is reminiscent of Realm of the Mad God, Diablo and even, to an extent, The  Binding of Isaac. It sticks you in the middle of a vast, randomly generated dungeon with hundreds of bad guys and tasks you with fighting your way out, and that’s pretty much a wrap for the game’s main features. You’ll do all the usual Action RPG things, like collecting better gear and upping your stats, but, ultimately, not much changes as a result of that. Yes, you will be fighting horde after horde of bad guys, and bosses, over and over again, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. My dislike for repetitious games aside, Overture is a well designed, smart game that will give a certain crowd of gamers with hours of action.\n\nWhile the game is certainly a one trick pony, there are lots of ways you can approach it. With 4 different classes and 24 different characters, each with their own attacks, there’s something here for every type of player. So, whether you want to be a warrior right in among the action with blood dripping from your blade, or an archer taking potshots from a safe distance, you’ll find a character to suit your tastes.\n\nOnce you have chosen a class you are slung straight into the action, but not before you’ve seen the handy control scheme tutorial. Playing the game is as simple as using the left mouse button to attack and the right mouse button to special attack. If you find yourself in a pinch you can hot tail it out of there by moving toward your mouse cursor, which will send you off at great speed. There’s a bit of a knack to mastering Overture‘s “hit and run” style of gameplay, but once you have you’ll be tearing up countless undead, blobs and other indescribable evil doers.\n\nGameplay is simple and formulaic, and you’ll wander through each floor looking to pick a fight with scores of different mobs at the same time, and the odd elite as well. You’ll occasionally come across a mini boss which are harder to kill than normal mobs, before having to take on a much more difficult boss.\n\nYou’ll be accruing experience and levelling up as you kill enemies, increasing your stats ever so slightly, whilst bolstering them further with various pieces of armour you’ll receive from chests and enemies. You’ll also gather companions  that you’ve freed from the clutches of the enemy, and they’ll fight alongside you.\n\nIf Overture was a candy bar it would be the most sugary, mouth-watering bar on the market, the kind that dilates pupils and causes synapses to fire uncontrollably. Its action is swift and meaty, with just enough danger to keep you on your toes. It also rewards even the slightest amount of skill with lashings of blood and a hail of gold coins, that is sure to intensify the “candy bar” effect I mentioned above.\n\nOne thing I don’t understand though is why it features no local coop, though, Overture is  the perfect game for playing on the couch with a buddy. I’ll call it an oversight and not a missed opportunity, in the hope that Black Shell Games adds this feature in later.\n\nWhile Overture hasn’t made me a total convert, it has, at the very least, allowed me to understand the appeal of difficult grindy games, and that’s a beat I can dance to.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThanks to the Black Shell Media for proiding a reviw copy.

Still every class I played is fast attack which makes the game seem quite action-packed.\n- Can be a matter of luck, sometimes you get a spawn with 2 bosses near you.

The pixel art is really beautiful and also the music is very suitable.\n- Very nice camara mode. Might be sth one first needs to get used to. On the other side.. if you played games before with a free camara mode (or sth similar) it's quite comfortable (like in LoL). It actually gives you more vision to all sides.\n- I personally like the almost daily updates from the developers. They keep the game alive and changing + hopes to see more implemented in future.\n- The levels difficulty increases alot, which I think is actually positive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seraphyx-/recommended/343100/","seraphyx-","Seraphyx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seraphyx-/","210 products in account","[Update 2-15-15] - Many issues have been addressed by the developer and he is very active in the forum. There are constant updates, sometimes multiple per week it seems. I've changed my recommendation from not recommended to recommended. Enough has been fixed with the game and there has been enough support by the developer(s) that it's worth a purchase for anyone interested in this type of game.\n\nI want to get some negatives/gripes I have with the game off my chest first. Don't mind the description, it's misleading imo. It has little to nothing to do with Zelda or Binding of Isaac and the only thing in common with Diablo is the way loot/money explodes out of monsters and chests. The game plays like a mix of Hero Siege mixed with Realm of the Mad God. The "vast" dungeons are just square levels, decently sized but still just square levels.\n\n- There is a big lack of options currently.\n- The game runs in something like a 700x400 window. You can't resize it but you can fullscreen if you want.\n- The window constantly gets centered in the middle of your monitor after you die and start again even if you move it to somewhere else on your screen.\n- The camera automatically pans the view when you move your cursor away from the center. This is especially annoying with longer range characters. It's hard to aim at enemies far away when you have to keep your cursor in the middle of the screen to have a decent view all around yourself. You can get swarmed and killed very quickly. The panning should occur only when you hold down a button like Ctrl (similar to how Project Zomboid does it).\n- There is now an option to disable screenshake. There is quite a lot of screenshake. The screen already gets very very busy with everything going on, add screenshake on top of that every time you get hit and it's a bit too much.\n- The game is fairly difficult and punishing but doesn't feel as rewarding as some others in the genre for the amount of effort it takes to progress. Items are mostly bland and boring (have only gotten to level 3 but things don't seem to change). Need far more effects on items, right now it seems like there are only a small handful of them. x% chance to cast poison cloud, some dagger skill, potions on kill, exp, and that's about all I've seen. Boring overall.\n- I believe this has been fixed or mostly fixed. You can now walk through walls (as can enemies sometimes) based on certain conditions(?). I assume if an item lands on it it becomes passable. I have no idea how exactly it works but at least you can grab your loot. Chests and crates can spawn inside walls. Item drops can fall on walls as well making them impossible to get. Sometimes you're able to sometimes you're not, depending on the exact spot it dropped/spawn on.\n\nWith all that said, it's still not necessarily a bad game. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and I hope they add more to it. The game can get very very repetitive with all the dying so you need more variety. The gameplay overall IS still fun, there is plenty of variety with the characters and you can unlock all of them within a few hours of gameplay.\n\nMy absolute biggest problem with the game currently is the camera. Second is resolution. If at least the camera is changed so it pans only when you hold down a key I'd consider recommending the game to others. If resolution and how far around you you can see is increased I would definitely recommend it. Hero Siege is the only other game I can think of that has come out recently in this style and right now, I feel like that is much more polished and fun. Overture feels like a beta rather than a fully complete game, there is a lot more to add to really make it fun and rewarding but if the devs support the game it can definitely get there.","February 3, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not sure if this makes me more or less qualified to write a review. On one hand, I don't have buyer's bias which would make me feel obliged to think it was good, but on the other hand, I got it for free, which might make me obliged to write a good review. But I'm going to be honest.\n\n\nIt's a time-waster, and I love it. This is one of those games that you could pop in and pop out of. Whenever I needed to decompress after a lot of studying, I would just open up this game and play as a cleric (my favorite class as of right now). There are a lot of classes and a lot of subclasses that really make the game feel unique. You probably could find one that would fit your playstyle.\n\nOne of my gripes with this game is that it was kind of odd how I came to learn about many things. For example, it took me a long time to figure out that you could right-click to attack and even longer to learn that there was a limited magic system. It also took me a while to figure out that you could equip stuff you found on the ground.\nYou'd say I'm just stupid for not figuring this out when there are indicators that you could do that stuff. But there's so much other stuff happening on the screen that it sometimes just gets lost on you. I'm not saying make a sign in bright pink neon, but maybe just a little optional tutorial for noobs like me. That's why this isn't lowering my score of the game.\n\nThere are numerous other sources to actually learn about the more in-depth stuff about the game to see if you'd want it. But this is a Steam review, so you're probably looking at a bunch of other ones on here. That's why this isn't all-inclusive. But I believe that it is worth it at the point it's at right now. I would still be fine if there were no more updates at all to this.","February 15, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Punish the player for not playing to the weaknesses of each individual boss and give the bosses phases in which they can bevery hard to kill, or very vulnerable. The key here is making each boss difficult and unique.\n- Bring more variety to the regular grind in stages. This doesn't man you have to overhaul each minion, but elite mobs may be a good focal point in improving this area. Maybe try bringing in more elite mobs that are weaker, or making it so that elite mobs always drop something, giving players an incentive to seek out this chalenge.\n\nClass balance is something that will come with time, and looking at the patch notes I can tell that the devs are putting a lot of effort into it, and I'd like to commend them for that.\n\nThis game has a bright future, and for its low price I would definitely recommend it.","February 10, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only difficulty I had is it is sometimes very difficult to see enemy projectiles, especially if you are a mage class which is filling up the screen with magic effects.

Worth the $5 entry fee for a couple afternoons of entertainment.\n\nIt's a fantasy-themed bullet hell with random loot, terrain generation and boss fights.  There isn't a great deal of depth and that's to be expected.  Most difficulty stems from the fact that enemies come from all angles and bosses take up a huge portion of the screen.  If that doesn't sound appealing, it probably won't be.\n\nThat said, what it does, it does very well.  The gameplay is addictive, fast-paced and very streamlined.\n\n---Best parts:\n\n*Pretty substantial class variety changes your optimal attack range/attack speed and such, making for substantial gameplay changes (for a bullethell)\n\n*Fantastic music\n\n*When loot drops, it shows its relevant stats in red or green---if it's green it's an upgrade, if it's red it's a downgrade.  You simply swap the gear by walking up to it and hitting the hotkey.  There is no loot hording.  This system keeps the fast-pace going.\n\n---Worst parts:\n\n*Boss fights are pretty much just "Here's a giant thing to take up your entire screen, shoot it and dodge the green bits"...while most game boss fights could probably be broken down to something similar, they usually do a better job of hiding it.  I'm not sure how you could do boss fights better in a fantasy bullethell, but they simply weren't fun.\n\n*There isn't really any information on the class you'll unlock until after you unlock it.  Showing that information ahead of time would be great.  --Big caveat, unlocking a new class isn't particularly difficult, so this is a minor issue.","April 30, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was asked to leave "an honest review", so keep that in mind.\n\nSo here's where I'm at with this: It looks and feels similar to Realm of the Mad God. If you liked Realm's gameplay, you'll feel right at home with Overture - it's like Realm on crack. I haven't seen any indication of multiplayer functionality though, which would be pretty neat.\n\nI pretty much have nothing to complain about mechanics-wise, controls are responsive and simple. I do have some usability/gameplay gripes though:\nHealth and mana bars are difficult to see. When my character is getting swarmed by mobs, I generally can't tell how my health is until the screen goes red, and at that point I'm pretty much toast.\nIt's impossible to know what your newly-unlocked character's abilities are until you start a new run with them - you have to open the character sheet to know exactly what you can do.\nThe font on the in-game character sheet is hard to read.\nWhen two items drop on the same tile I can only pick up one of them if I already had a piece of gear in that equipment's slot.\nFiguring out if I just picked up a stronger or weaker piece of gear is a matter of dropping and picking back up and checking the character sheet to read the stats and abilities on my gear. It breaks the flow since I can't immediately tell what I just got.\nSome of the bosses (especially the blobs) seem really unbalanced for certain classes at lower levels/upgrade tiers. Maybe I'm not playing cleric right though.\nApart from that, I really like this game a lot. The classes feel varied enough to keep me bent on unlocking more of them, I love the soundtrack, looting is addictive, and it just feels right. Like a perfect cross between Hammerwatch and Realm.

You can select from up to 24 classes split into 4 divisions (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Shaman). You must face off against hordes of undead and fantastical enemies in randomly generated dungeons, with a boss on each to progress to the next floor.\n\nI would like to outright state that I won a key of the game in a giveaway by the Dev, but this I will try my best to make this as unbiased as possible.\n\nHaving played only 30 minutes, I'm not the most experienced player, but I believe have played enough to get a general idea of the game.\nThe main idea of the game is nothing original (not in a bad way), killing hordes of enemies to level up, become more powerful, and progress through the dungeon. However, it is executed very well. The game seems to be balanced rather well, with difficulty scaling throughout the floors.\n\nProgression not only comes from levels, but also weapons, armour, shields, and rings that are randomly placed throughout floors. These will make your life a lot easier, and are a welcome addition.\n\nThis game does a lot of things very well.\n\n1. It is a lot, and I mean a lot, of fun to play. Who doesn't love slicing through hordes of undead, becoming increasingly powerful? It's hard to stop playing after you start, and if that isn't the sign of a good game, then I don't know what is.\n\n2. As I have mentioned before, progression through the levels, and difficulty scaling is handled very well.\n\n3. It is an overall great Rogue-like.\n\nI do have a few things that I think need changing, or at least a little work on.\n\n1. The tutorial is minimal, at best. While nearly everyone is familiar with Rogue-likes, not everyone is. We get told next to nothing about how progression works, merely how to 'run fast'. The tutorial could do with at least a little bit more information for new players to the genre, incluing what the blue (mana?) bar is, and what alt-attacks can do.\n\n2. Your character's health bar is something that is generally important to see, right? However in the middle of an encounter with a lot of enemies, that quickly gets covered by scores of numbers, the same with your character, making it nigh impossible to keep track of your location, and health. This could be improved by simply adding health and mana bars in the top left of the screen.\n\nOverture is a game that I would recommend to my friends. While it does need a little work, it is a polished product that I would be happy to pay for.\n\n4/5","March 2, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I thought it was a really hard and unique since I died instantly several times after starting it. After I used the ranger (archer), I actually made some progress since the character has longer range and it took me a good hour to go down my first set of stairs. However, I met a boss in a small box room, which nulifies the ranger's advantage. I barley beat the boss and died instantly on the next level.\n\nIf Steam had a “Maybe” option for the recommendation I would use that. However, there is just not enough to keep me interested due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay. For that reason, I have to give it a thumbs down. If you don’t mind clicking a mouse button and dodging countless hordes of enemies, then you will probably enjoy this game, but it just felt like a grind to me.\n\nPros:\n-	There are a lot of characters to unlock.\n-	It is a very hard game.\n-	Reminds me of old school space shooter games where you constantly dodge bullets.\n\nCons:\n-	Figuring out which item you have equipped and which item is on the ground is not very clear. Use ESC or C to view what you have equipped.\n-	Menu system needs a lot of work.\n-	Only display options are full screen mode or a tiny window.\n-	Every time you die and restart the game window centers into the middle of your monitor instead of the last position you left it.\n-	Level difficulty is really random and the first level is almost always way too hard.\n-	You always start over at the first level.\n-	You cannot preview locked characters or see what their abilities are until you have purchased them.

I've spent time on each and every character available. Despite that, I can't beat it, no matter how hard I try. It occurred to me at around 10~ hours in that this game, while hard, isn't  difficult, per se. To quote James Rolfe, "It's one of the hardest games I've ever played and for all the wrong reasons." So many reasons, in fact, I'm unsure of where to begin for a proper review. In which case, I'll simply state off everything that comes to mind right now and edit it later if anything else pops up. There's a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n1) Damage from...nothing?\nIn the time I've more or less sacrificed to this game, I've found many-but-rare instances where my character will seemingly take damage from naught. In most cases, I'm more than aware it was my own carelessness, but in a handful of these situations I've noticed that there really was nothing for me to take damage from. This is usually the case when there are many projectiles around the area. (I can only assume this is a visual bug.) That aside, some enemies will summon large, stationary balls of fire that will obviously harm you if you stand on them. The problem with that, though, is they summon slowly. FAR too slowly for you to notice. As in...you-take-damage-and-THEN-you-see-them slowly. This wouldn't be an issue if only their damage boxes would appear with them instead of before them.\n\n2) Some enemies are faster than you.\n"Why would this be an issue?" While that in and of itself isn't a big problem, it doesn't help that damage is both based on RNG and time-wasting grind (something I'll get to soon). Each character has a wide set of certain speeds, between attacking while trudging through webs/mud/water/friggin' LAVA to running the same direction as the camera orientation. Enemies do not. Enemies like the Goblins (or Orcs, whatever) and the Minotaurs move as fast as they want. Their movement pattern usually speeds up after taking damage. Sometimes they simply spawn infuriated long before seeing you. It's random, all random...intentional or otherwise, it's impossible to be cautious in this game because of that. If you just so happen to be in water and a Goblin has more health than you can chew down, you might as well just sit back and let it gnaw on your pixelated corpse. Melee enemies like that attack you by running into you. They don't have the speed penalties you do, therefore making your in-game life absolutely forfeit more times than not on later levels. Enemies like this should not be given a higher speed than the player if they don't follow the same rules as the player.\n\n3) It's just a massive grind.\nI've put 2,355 hours into Warframe, a game that was given the nicknames of Warfarm, Farmframe, and Farming Simulator...and let me just say Overture is the worst game I've played in terms of grind. There's no way to justify this. The gold in each level adds to the character's own level on that particular run. (While you can level up by also killing enemies, your main source of EXP is found in the collecting of gold.) Per character level, your health and mana pools increase with slight damage boosts on top of that. These increases are minimal unless you were to compare lvl 1 to lvl 5, or maybe even lvl 5 to lvl 10. However, despite the minute differences, there's something even more minimal than this to such an extent that it makes in-round leveling seem valid: the characters' levels outside of the rounds. See, that gold you've been collecting goes toward unlocking new characters OR boosting the damage (and just the damage) of characters already unlocked. After each level, your character's attack power is boosted by 5. "Five what?" you may ask. I don't know. It's never stated. Five points? Five in-round levels? Who the hell knows? Little to no information is provided. Whatever these +5 stages in character development are, they're more disappointing than anything I could compare to. Each level increased sends the next level's required gold multiplier through the roof, and there's hardly any difference to the damage dealt by your character. The amount required per rank far exceeds any plausible excuse that could be provided by the developer(s).\n\n4) The loot is terrible and unbalanced.\nThroughout the game, you'll find helmets, shields, rings, sword/knives, and ehm...gems that look like blobs of goop...in each stage. The weapons give a damage boost while the blobs and rings give you mana regeneration. Some of the items in these categories excluding the rings have additional enhancements on them that provide assistance. Summon skeletons on hit/kill, extra health or mana potions on hit/kill, EXP tomes on hit/kill, and things of the related sort. That, I like. I think it's a great part of the game that helped me attempt through it as far as I did. The problem is, it's all unbalanced. The loot doesn't get any little bit better each floor. If you were to get a sword that summons skellingtons on hit that deals 150 damage on the first floor but a knife of 20 damage and nothing else on floor five, you shouldn't be too confused. If you found a gem in the first floor that gives 15 mana regen and a large health potion on hit but end up getting a gem that gives 3 mana regen and not a damned thing else, don't be confused. It does that. The game just does that and there is no rhyme or reason why other than RNG. There's really no reason in continuing to the next floor unless you just want to kill more of the same kind of enemies that just have increased health pools and damage-dealing capabilities (with maybe one new enemy per floor, but that's barely worth the mention). What's worse is finding out most of the things you found in the room prior to the boss room far outweigh anything found in the "rewards" you have to buy after killing a boss. Yes, that's right. Four chests in a boss room that make you buy access to (with in-game gold, not a microtransation) a random item of random variety just to be disappointed you spent the gold in the first place. After a few times, you learn to not even bother and keep the outrageous amounts of gold you save by NOT opening the chests.\n\n5) Boss battles\nAlongside the aforementioned super-disappointing post-boss loot, the boss battles themselves are either equally disappointing or equally frustrating. Either too hard or complete pushovers. An example of the too-hard variety would be the Queen Spider. She jumps on top of you, something you can't avoid. She also has a tendency of doing this over and over and over again until you're dead...from the start of the fight to the end. Unavoidable damage despite anything and everything you do is an awful and terrible mechanic. But, I suppose that may make up for the sorry excuse of a Lava Golem whose projectiles are simple to dodge and can easily be out-meneuvered by a slower character. In addition to your randomized "prizes" at the end of each stage, you have the choice to upgrade your health or mana pools upon your victory. Both options are null and void, as there's hardly any increase in whichever pool you choose. It's a waste of a second of your time, a second you could have used to sneeze or take a breath of air. Either of those are a better use of time, but I digress. At least the boss drops 2-3 free items upon its death per boss room, I guess?\n\n6) Lack of important and/or useful information.\nThere's barely any information provided in game. Any little bit given is on the pause screen, which doesn't help much at all. I don't know how much damage is increased per +5 rank on my character. I don't know how much my mana or health is increased per level or at post-boss battles. I don't know how much damage I do at all or how much that is increased/multiplied with a weapon. I simply don't know, and I shouldn't have to venture onto the forums to get a gist of anything at all.\n\nTL;DR - Too much text for this review. Just don't buy this.

Each character has a main attack and secondary magic attack that uses mana. Mana regenerates, health does not, but there are potions to refill both that drop amply. There's a movement mechanic that factors in your cursor position such that you move faster in the direction of your cursor. It's not an amazing feature, but it's nice. It seems there are 10 levels, but they do seem to get insanely hard.

Meaning, Floor one is kind of like a tutorial and then as you advance you get harder boards. This game is hard from floor 1-1 so if you are ready to grind, get this game.\n\nOverall a 8.5 of 10 on my scale.","May 16, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I have gotten quite a bit of fun out of it, so I am going to recommend it.\nIt's a fun little game, but after a few hours or so it tends to get fairly repetitive.  I do like the multiple classes and the many characters to play as, but once they're all unlocked you'll have figured out which is your favorite and pretty much stick with that character, and only upgrade them.\nAnd speaking of upgrades, I like that you can spend gold you've previously accumulated to make the character better, but upgrades do nothing except increase the attack power of said character.  Why there isn't an option to increase health or defense is beyond me, and it makes it so you have to play the game as a glass cannon every time.\nAnd speaking of the repetitive nature of the game, sure, it's randomly generated, but you'll almost always fight the same enemies on the same floors, and the floor layouts are very similar.  On 1-2 there are a ton of traps.  On 1-3 there are holes with never ending slime monsters spawning from them, and so on.\nAdding a mechanic where you could choose where to put your upgrade points would add a much needed level of depth to the game, and even better yet, a mechanic where you could put upgrade points in a stat when you level up during the game.\nI have almost 7 hours on Overture so far, and I have enjoyed it, and I would recommend it, 5 bucks isn't very steep, and I've gotten my 5 dollars worth.  That being said, at this point, I'm wishing for a little more depth and customization, and a little more 'randomization' to break the monotony of trudging through the first few floors, fighting the same big slimes, and fighting the same bosses.","May 19, 2015","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is still pretty good - A very fast-paced bullethell dungeoncrawler sort of deal, but...There's flaws. Pretty big ones.\n\nFirst off, the visuals. Again, Initially, I quite liked them...But soon after, I discovered that the vast majority of the visuals in this were taken from an asset pack with little to no alterations. Now, I'm all for using asset packs as a base, to get your project off the ground, but...At least tweak them a bit, ya know? It makes the game look a lot more cheaply constructed, and it DOES hurt the game.\n\nSecond...The difficulty curve is unfair, to say the least. I understand a game of this nature is meant to be difficult, yes, but as it stands now it's less of a difficulty curve and more of a difficulty wall when you reach a boss, a wall you need to smash through with your face. Now, yes, a game like this that you could get through on your first try without upgrading yourself would be lunacy, but at the same time, it can be critically disheartening if you can barely progress past the first boss. Maybe I just suck, but it's pretty harsh. There's also some issues that result in some very cheap deaths, such as some of the monsters doing far too much collision damage too quickly, and very limited feedback for when you're getting hit, meaning you can die very quickly without realising you're in danger.\n\nHowever...I will still give this game a borderline positive review. It's still very playable, but these two things are pretty irksome. I understand there's probably more fixes to come, so...If they changed up the graphics and made the difficulty a bit less insane, I would find this game more approachable and easier to reccomend.\n\nSo, if anyone reads my review and wonders if they should try it or not - Put basically, It's alright, and honestly, I've paid far more for far worse games. Give the Demo a try if you're unsure.\n\nThis gets a 6/10 from me. Flawed and unpolished, but alright for what it is.","March 24, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thanks Steam.\n\nWhen you think of a shooter game a medieval-theme is the last thing you expect.. But that's exactly what Black Shell Games's game Overture is: a roguelike bullet hell shooter game where you're tasked to destroy legions upon legions of monsters while things constantly fly across your screen. It's a high action, fast paced game that'll leave you blinded by damage scores and the amount of chaos going on screen.\n\nThe objective of the game is to get through the floors while fighting amidst countless enemies such as skeletons, dragons, blobs, and minotaur. There's an insane variety of creatures throughout the game. Occasionally you'll see named creatures, which have the chance of giving the player special gear, health potions and a bonus in gold which also acts as your XP, doubling their values. The named creatures do have slightly more health and are often guarded by a cluster of creatures, which means they're hard to get to, but they're worth it in the end. Each creature has a comically randomly generated name like “Hilda the Disgruntled” or something of that nature, leaving this bullet hell style game a least a little humorous.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","September 9, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, considering the fact that most of the indie games are not having quite a big action, Overture is very dynamic as in each floor you have to kill hordes of monsters, which in not quite easy as the number of incoming monsters is quite big and you have to pay a lot of attention to the game in order to not die, cause if you die you will have to start the game all over again from the very first Floor. Also, the Boss Battles have a certain difficulty level which makes the game progression much interesting.\n\nSo, which are the Pros for this game?\n\n- A cute and colored design, design which changes from a floor to another\n- A big variety of enemies\n-  24 heroes to choose\n-  The possiblity to upgrade your hero\n-  The player can collect items during game progression\n-  Entertaining soundtrack\n- Traps which hide extra hordes of enemies\n\nOf course, there are some Cons for this Overture as well:\n\n- Some visual effecs might be disturbing (for example, when your hero takes damage from enemies there is a kinda strong visual impact on the screen)\n- Perhaps there would've be nice if there was a story line for this game\n\nSo Overture is pretty much funny to play and I recommend this game to anyone.","February 19","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The title of this game itself is an overture.\nThe store flashes inspiration from LoZ, BoI, RoTMG, et cetera\n\nBoy lemme tell you this game is NOTHING like those other games. This is the most chaotic fun I have had in a while, and I play rouge in NT. Although In design style yes this game is a borderline copy. But what makes it stand out is how ♥♥♥♥ing insane everything is. You spawn in, walk for 3 seconds, already there are skeletons surrounding you. You attack and the once clean ground is pure bright red.\n\nI point out another lie in the description with "cunning enemies" those two words are lies. lies lies lies.The enemies run at you. Sometimes that charge, sometimes they shoot. Elsewise they are bosses. Speaking of bosses. I didn't know you could make bosses fun while you still have not a single clue what its doing.\n\nThere is also the mechanic fast running is an important one in this game. If one stops firing and then runs towards their mouse cursor they will run much faster than if they were attacking I thought I was going to not use this. I was wrong.  Its one of the most useful things in the game.\n\nSpeaking of useful. The class usefulness varies greatly. You've got completely broken classes such as Trickster, Warlock, and Soldier, Normal classes like warrior, wizard, and archer, and then you've got butt♥♥♥♥ useless classes  like necromancer, or priest. But all of them have their place.\n\n\nPROS.\nQuick games; Get in, get out.\nUnique classes; No two ominous people in cloaks are the same.\nFun bosses; They are absolutely insane.\n\nMehs\nChaotic gameplay; If you liked brutal doom, you'd be ejactulating into your own eyes to this.\nHard; Expect to see the first few levels a lot.\n\nCons\nBalacing; Seriously the balacing in this game is so off the scale is broken. I can't find the other half of it.\n\n\nAll and all a very fun game.\n\n7/10 I do not regret my purchase.","March 20","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is still pretty good - A very fast-paced bullethell dungeoncrawler sort of deal, but...There's flaws. Pretty big ones.\n\nFirst off, the visuals. Again, Initially, I quite liked them...But soon after, I discovered that the vast majority of the visuals in this were taken from an asset pack with little to no alterations. Now, I'm all for using asset packs as a base, to get your project off the ground, but...At least tweak them a bit, ya know? It makes the game look a lot more cheaply constructed, and it DOES hurt the game.\n\nSecond...The difficulty curve is unfair, to say the least. I understand a game of this nature is meant to be difficult, yes, but as it stands now it's less of a difficulty curve and more of a difficulty wall when you reach a boss, a wall you need to smash through with your face. Now, yes, a game like this that you could get through on your first try without upgrading yourself would be lunacy, but at the same time, it can be critically disheartening if you can barely progress past the first boss. Maybe I just suck, but it's pretty harsh. There's also some issues that result in some very cheap deaths, such as some of the monsters doing far too much collision damage too quickly, and very limited feedback for when you're getting hit, meaning you can die very quickly without realising you're in danger.\n\nHowever...I will still give this game a borderline positive review. It's still very playable, but these two things are pretty irksome. I understand there's probably more fixes to come, so...If they changed up the graphics and made the difficulty a bit less insane, I would find this game more approachable and easier to reccomend.\n\nSo, if anyone reads my review and wonders if they should try it or not - Put basically, It's alright, and honestly, I've paid far more for far worse games. Give the Demo a try if you're unsure.\n\nThis gets a 6/10 from me. Flawed and unpolished, but alright for what it is.","March 24, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a fast paced, highly addictive game. As far as i saw it, every of the 4 hero type has 6 classes with each slightly different kind of attacks. Its very similar to Realm of the Mad God, but singleplayer and without microtransactions. What makes it diffrent from other roguelikes is that you can free different types of NPCs that follow and help you.\nThe flaws of the game in my opinion are following:\n- No matter which hero type you pick, the items stay the same, so if you play for example a rogue, you attack with a bow, but the monsters keep dropping swords and shields, which you can equip to raise atk and def values.\n- The only thing you can upgrade before/after a run is the ATK value, but to be honest, I'm not sure, that diversity would make a lot of sense in that point.\n\ntl;dr\n\nIf you like rogue-likes, buy it, if you dont, stay away.","November 6, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd very much like to see this game after kickstarter goal is surpassed. Whereas at the moment the game itself lacks a few key things, but this game is already somewhat addicting. The soundtrack alone is easily worth the 5$, and on top of that, you get a game that you can easily sink hours into. I can see this game really taking off, much like Terraria did, just maybe not as fast.\nIf you're more anal about knowing the ups and downs before even trying the free demo out, I'll go ahead and compile a list of Pros and Cons.\n\n[Cons]\n1. The game isn't the best in terms of customizable interface. At the present time, there is no such thing as an audio slider, so the player cannot choose how heavy SFX is over the Music.\n\n2. Resolution is an issue. You currently only have a few options. 700xSomethingElseIDoNotKnowWhat, or Fullscreen.\n\n3. The game can get a bit annoying with the difficulty, however, if you're used to playing games like Dark Souls, you shall be fine.\n\n4. You could argue that there is a lack of content in the game at the moment, but you can only say that if you actually get far enough to have seen everything repeatedly in one playthrough.\n\n[Pros]\n1. The Soundtrack\n\n2. The Soundtrack\n\n3. Did I say the Soundtrack?\n\n4. Not only are there 4 classes, each class has it's own six-or-so subclasses.\n\n5. There is a general progression in your character's strength throughout the game. You can upgrade your subclasses with the gold you've amassed throughout other plays.\n\n6. The game takes a good path on unlocking and upgrading the characters. If you've played Magicite, you probably know a good example of how annoying character goals are. In Magicite, you were required to reach a certain point, or complete a certain goal in a play to just have a CHANCE of unlocking something, whereas in Overture, you simply have to get the gold necessary to unlock/upgrade the subclass of your choice, making an easy way for the player to grow into his/her own playstyle, and find the subclass that suits it best.","February 7, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is little to know what is actually happening on the screen, the "upgrade" system is a joke that has such insignificant effects on the actual game as you gain much more from just leveling up. So the game encourages you to kill everything on a level before proceeding to the floor boss. This boss can pretty much kill you in a couple of seconds no matter how many enemies you killed or what you picked up on the previous floor.\nI really wanted to like this game but there is so much ambiguity to the point where you will be confused despite its plain gameplay and appearance as there are no explanations for what many abilities do, no displayed stats for characters or really anything common in similar games.\nThere is soooo much rng involved in making it past levels from what I experienced and from other reviews I have read.  I got to floor 5 on my first character simply because I picked up items with chance on hit to drop XP scrolls and mana potions, since then I got to floor 2 only a few times.\nI am aware I only have an hour played on this game but to be honest I feel like that is all you really need to fully experience this awful game that seems to only have good reviews because of the graphical appearance, but no matter how the graphics are it can't hide ridiculous gameplay mechanics and poor design.\n\nTL;DR Don't buy this unless it's on sale and you have seen some gameplay.","January 9","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't know you could make bosses fun while you still have not a single clue what its doing.\n\nThere is also the mechanic fast running is an important one in this game. If one stops firing and then runs towards their mouse cursor they will run much faster than if they were attacking I thought I was going to not use this. I was wrong.  Its one of the most useful things in the game.\n\nSpeaking of useful. The class usefulness varies greatly.

However, considering the fact that most of the indie games are not having quite a big action, Overture is very dynamic as in each floor you have to kill hordes of monsters, which in not quite easy as the number of incoming monsters is quite big and you have to pay a lot of attention to the game in order to not die, cause if you die you will have to start the game all over again from the very first Floor. Also, the Boss Battles have a certain difficulty level which makes the game progression much interesting.\n\nSo, which are the Pros for this game?\n\n- A cute and colored design, design which changes from a floor to another\n- A big variety of enemies\n-  24 heroes to choose\n-  The possiblity to upgrade your hero\n-  The player can collect items during game progression\n-  Entertaining soundtrack\n- Traps which hide extra hordes of enemies\n\nOf course, there are some Cons for this Overture as well:\n\n- Some visual effecs might be disturbing (for example, when your hero takes damage from enemies there is a kinda strong visual impact on the screen)\n- Perhaps there would've be nice if there was a story line for this game\n\nSo Overture is pretty much funny to play and I recommend this game to anyone.","February 19","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think this is the first review I've written for a game on Steam. I don't want to be the guy who slams an independent developer and expects unrealistic quality for $5, or what it was when I first picked this up, $3. And somehow the general steam ratings for Overture has changed from mostly negatve to very positive since the last time I looked at this game, and I can't tell why.\n\nThat being said, I really want to like this game more than I do. Deep down in it, somwhere, is a really fun game. A simple twin-stick shooter with elements of Gauntlet and roguelikes is a really cool idea, and mechanically it's implemented pretty well.\n\nHowever, the game is a visual mess. It's not just the blown-up pixel graphics in it - it could have masterful, highly detailed sprites, and it would have been the same. The game is often incomprehensible. It is also really hard, and grindy. Not nessecarily a bad thing, though in this case it's rather maddening. I am constantly dying to enemies I don't realize are there until it's over. There's barely any cooldown on hits to your character, and there's so much commotion on the screen, it's sometimes very difficult to tell what's going on. The game qickly turns into a churning mass of large and tiny, sometimes hard to see projectiles, friendly and enemy characters, pickups and destructible objects all over a mess of dungeon debris from everything else you've been shooting that makes objects even less distinguishable. Both taking hits and some player attacks shake the screen and blur the action. When you are on low health, the screen turns a blurry red which camoflages everything even further. Try a cleric for the first time, and then try to figure out what is going on as your large attacks seem to behave not quite consistent enough to make immediate sense, and take up a majority of the center of the screen.\n\nBUT, I do enjoy it somwhat, as it's the only game I know of that does what it does so mechanically well. As in, shoot with swords and friendly assists, gradius-style, a bullet-hell action RPG with vastly different playstyles between characters. Think of it as a more rogelike-y, singleplayer Realm of The Mad God. It can be very cathartinc when things are going well, and there are certain parts of it that do have some charm. Considering the price point and the lack of pretense, and you should be able to forgive a lot and appreciate the core gameplay.\n\nIt's just hard to forvige such bewilderingly confusing visuals.","July 23, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems like the developer(s) of Overture were planning out the mechanics before a torrential bee storm assaulted their home and the last thing they could do was upload this. My two largest points are that the game has no plot and it seems that the game is a smashed together Krabby Patty concocted by Jenkins.\nDelving deeper into my first point; Overture's story couldn't be more uninteresting had they hired the Kardashians to write it. The reason being that there is no story. Story in a game is an important component in keeping the player there. Story gets the player invested in the characters and the components and in turn the player will continue to play and discover new game mechanics and content. However, in developing Overture, someone must've spilt coffee on the script. As you can see by my playtime, I was not too inclined to continue playing after an hour simply because I asked myself: "Why do I care about this game?" and "Am I getting new content by continuing to play this game?" I couldn't find a reason to care about this game, much like no one can find Malaysia Airlines. The answer to the second question is simply no. Within 15 minutes of play I played all the first level maps, fought most enemies and got bored.\nMuch like I am doing with you most likely. However, never fear, my second point is fairly short. I learned a lot about game mechanics in high school. This game seems like something I would have made when practicing my skills as a game designer. This is why I feel like this is a waste. To give an example: As a GFX designer I'm still an amateur, so most of my work for other people is done for free. To apply this concept to this game, why should we pay $5 for Overture when this seems like amateur work? Simple, we shouldn't.\nDev. of Overture, my advice to you: No shame on you for publicizing your work. Shame on you for making us pay for it.","May 15","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not sure which versions of those games the creators were inspired by, because I don't recall any of them throwing hordes and hordes of monsters at you as soon as you start play.   There is no strategy, no hidden doors or secret treasures, no mazes, no...well, anything that resembles those games.  It bears a larger resemblance to Smash TV than any of the games mentioned.\n\nThe game doesn't teach you how to play- not only is there no real tutorial, the learning curve appears to be non-existent.  You select a class, the game starts, and you're off to the races.  The mechanics aren't difficult in and of themselves, but the massive number of projectiles, enemies, and other obstacles on screen remind me more of the bullet hell genre than a "roguelike".  The biggest downside to that, however, is that your hitbox is MUCH larger than a single pixel.\n\nThe graphics come from a tileset (fine, they serve their purpose), the music is repetitive, and the control is surprisingly crisp.  None of this, however, saves this game from it's biggest flaw- the gameplay.  It is just...bland.  Sure, this game might work for 15 minutes of mindless play, but games like that are a dime a dozen, and there are much better out there than Overture.","May 25","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
