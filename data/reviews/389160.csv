Have no delusions, it's like the love child of a tablet runner and a flash game.\n\nIt's a single button game where the player jumps over spinning disks, whirlpool disks, ninjas who pose, ninjas who menace, a dog and an explosive tower that kills you sometimes.\n\nDespite only having one button the controls are still unresponsive with the character sometimes not jumping on downhill slopes.  Left and right 'move' the player but I got all the way to level 31 without ever having to use those controls.\n\nActually the the left / right controls are basically broken with left accelerating the character towards the left of the screen - sometimes so enthusiastically that the stage starts scrolling backwards and the character falls off into nothingness.  And right accelerating the player towards the center of the screen - generally causing the player to get hooked on something.  Do not touch anything except the jump button.\n\nThere's very little in terms of graphics.  The stages are black with the exception of the weirdly out of place and low resolution skyscrapers.  Red clouds obscure blades, ninjas and the player.  Jumping over something when you can not see yourself nor it is bad game design.\n\nBlack clouds also hide ninjas and blades against black backdrops.  In the all stages I played the only real challenge was learning where the mostly hidden obstacles were.\n\nThere's no significant ramp in difficulty, once you've played the first few stages the others was just variants of tap-the-button.  Stage 24 introduced a glimmer of fun because there was a genuinely tricky timed platform jump but that was it by the 30th stage nothing else had happened and the tedium had set in.\n\nFor a game with controller support it's shoddy - you can jump with the 'A' button but not restart the level.  That requires a mouse click.  Curiously the players death 'animation' kicks in only about one in every 8 deaths, usually you're immediately kicked back to the menu.\n\nAnd the menu.  There is no way to reset progress so if I ever wanted to go back to a previous stage I can't.  The options menu is a picture saying you must play the game by jumping.  There are no options.  The story menu is a picture of some poorly laid out comic frames that cannot be exited.  The only way to exit the story menu is to close the program.\n\nCollision detection is atrocious.  Huge bounding boxes around both the player and the obstacles will see you dying in mid-air time and time again.  Particularly bad are the strange little kill-you-at-a-random distance towers and the explosions; some of which do not kill you at all.\n\nShadow Ninja feels like a half-finished student project that someone is asking money for.  It's not worth it; even it were free it would still not be worth it.  Steer clear - save your money.","October 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 87 of 116 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","87","116","4","3"

The objective is to dodge obstacles and kill enemy ninjas through increasingly thickening mist (w/ the least amount of deaths). The only way to get through the levels is by trial and error until you actually know the timing for the hardest objects to dodge on each level. This is visibly truer as the levels progresses and the fog gets opaquer, hiding a lot of the obstacles.\n\nPros:\n+ great choice of colors (mostly black, gray and red) that gives this game a noir feeling\n+ responsive controls\n+ simple but fun gameplay\n\nCons:\n- it gets boring if it's not played for small periods of time (the frustation does not help)\n- Repetitive soundrack\n- no steam achievements (it would certainly make it more entertaining and even increase its replay value)\n- no option to change the controls\n- occasionally, a glitch happens, when restarting the level, that puts the character in its jump pose. When that happens, you can't jump.\n\nEven considering the price, I would not recommend playing this game.","May 9","false","4.8"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","32","32","2","0"

But actually controls don't work at all. Not because of technical reasons but by design. Didn't believe previous reviews but it's really bad. And by the way, the game doesn't close properly on my Win7x64 - process remains in memory and Steam still says "in-game".","January 7","false","4.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

The challenge isnt completing level 1-max level, its seeing the least amount of times you can die for me going from level 1 to max. Worth the buy for a $. Only things i can fault is you can ignore the ninja's and just jump over them and the there is no sense scaling of difficulty as you go through each level.","October 30, 2015","true","5.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

Unresponsive controls (mouse controls feels better somehow), lazy level design. Jump key often does not work, most of the obstacles are barely visible or not visible at all. Beat the game (50 levels) and didn't even feel that masochistic pleasure which often happens with such games. Also somehow lagging on a very good PC although almost not showing framerate drops in steam overlay. Also runs only in a window so technicaly support any monitor resolution but of course it's just a picture stretching. Very disappointing.","March 21","false","3.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

In turn, I got a cheap shot. It's a standard (not so) endless runner but everything is hard to see as the screen is cluttered and most everything is solid black. Not too much else to say really. It's an iPhone shovelware game ported over to PC. I try to see the good in most small scale games but this is kind of a mess.
