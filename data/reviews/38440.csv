If yes, have you heard of Sacrifice? Assuming not, Sacrifice IS one of the first and the best Action RTS hybrid titles out there, so BL's gameplay is hardly all that "innovative" (though still fun). Fun fact: Tim Curry starred in both of those games. You don't know who Tim Curry is? Go sit in the corner, you're on timeout.\n\nSacrifice is an incredibly bizzare and twisted game. Probably the weirdest I've ever played, aside from American McGee's Alice and The Path. The game sounds fantastic, has got a very memorable soundtrack and the voice acting is simply superb. The world and the creatures that inhabit it are quite strange, but unique and beautiful in their own way. The graphics are pretty outdated in this one though and it's something that may be difficult to overlook, especially if you're having a hard time getting engrossed into the game.\n\nThe gameplay is something that takes time to get used to and playing the (rather comprehensive and enjoyable) tutorial is a must here. As previously mentioned, it's a third person squad based game where you make formations out of your units, cast spells to aid them in battle and complete various map objectives. Whatever units and spells you acquire vastly depends on the deities you choose as the story progresses, thus making the game replayable due to the large amount of combinations that can be created.\n\nLast but not least, game has the same oddball sense of humor you might find in titles like Earthworm Jim. Considering that Earthworm Jim was the first successful creation of (now defunct) Shiny Ent. along with Sacrifice that followed a few years later, it's not all that surprising.\n\nThis game is really, horribly underrated. But at the same time, it's not for everyone. If you enjoy the hybrid gameplay of games like Brutal Legend, Overlord or Natural Selection (to name a few, but those three are on Steam), you might as well give Sacrifice a chance.","December 11, 2013","true","5.7"," 449 of 513 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","449","513","7","1"

A pawn of the gods, or chaos itself? Or perhaps no pawn at all...\n\nImagine a world without the internet. Imagine being alone in a room with a computer, and no internet, for several hours a day. Perhaps some of you don't need to imagine, perhaps some of you still live a life away from the madness of the net, able to sequester yourself in an insular paradise. Well, if that is the case, or perhaps you need to forget the world for a few hours and a lifetime, I honestly have to recommend Sacrifice.\n\nI bought this game back in 2002, the first year of uni, and I have to say for about 4-6 hours of every day - before I met up with my friends, this was my world. I suppose I should have been a better student, studied more and achieved better grades. But it's very rare to be able to look *back* at a time, and say while it mightn't have been the best use of the time, you don't regret it. This game was that much fun.\n\nLater on it was joined by staples such as Wizardry 8 and fps's i'm sure we've all played, but even throughout the next two years of my life, it still earnt its place on the shelf. It's just...an amazing game. It is still beautiful, the insane character models defying time, the gameplay still challenging and sometimes even frustrating, the spells still awesome, the gods still scheming and the action as frantic as ever.\n\nI have yet to play a game that really catches up to Sacrifice. Like a lot of great innovative games, at the time it just didn't get to its audience. Like your system shocks or deus ex's, where decades have passed before they've been emulated and resurrected, Sacrifice fits into a niche that is hard to define. You play like a field marshall, summoning troops to your side even as you dodge incoming fire and fury, and your objective is often simply to conquer, to destroy, to cleanse. But the path to that goal is often turf-war, sneak attacks, flanking, trap-setting and straight bull-dozing through your enemies. It's a wild and wonderful ride, with an atmosphere that pulls you in almost from the first moment.\n\nI can't recommend it enough.","November 28, 2013","true","2.3"," 103 of 130 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","103","130","0","0"

I lost one of the discs over the years and then it popped up on my radar on offer here on Steam and i just had to pick it up.\n\nThis game probably has one of the best stories ever (not just for when it was released, but even nowadays). Obviously the graphics are dated at this stage, but back then games were made with quality, not like these days (hell looking at the cardboard box now, the effort alone put in to the art on the box is beyond anything iv seen in recent years)\n\nIf you want a game that has 5 different endings and hours of narrative story dialog.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chewyinfo/recommended/38440/","Chewyinfo","Chewychucky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chewyinfo/","433 products in account","One of the best games of all time. Many of you will skim over this because you've never heard of it, because none of your friends play it or because of its sparse store page. You shouldn't.\n\nSacrifice offers the best mix of tactical depth and ease of learning I have ever seen in a strategy game. You play as a wizard standing down on the field where everything happens. Any units you summon are summoned directly next to you, buildings are created only by you standing next to them (for up to 10 seconds for the largest buildings), and orders are given based on what you can personally see. This makes for a much more immersive and easy-to-grasp gameplay than most other strategy games out there where you may be queuing up orders, units and buildings; might be zoomed far enough out  to be disconnected from the world but not far enough out to see any useful distance.\n\nFurthermore, the wizards you can choose from in multiplayer (you always play as Eldred in the fully-voiced campaign) are all equal. That is, everyone you might play against has access to the exact same spells and units as you. Or rather they have access to the same choices: your spell and unit lists are fully customizable offering a massive amount of variation possible. You could have ranged units that damage over time, can go invisible, can track enemies etc. Or you could pick units based on style if you prefer and do just fine: disease-ridden monsters, aloof mythical creatures, rangers, soldiers, constructs...\n\nThis customisation is in the campaign too but in a much more organic style so that you won't have to worry about choosing units based on no previous experience. Every level of the game has 5 alternatives (one for each of the gods) and each god will try to convince you the help them for each mission. You can decide who to help on a mission-by-mission basis, picking the most interesting or beneficial mission for you. You can become unwaveringly loyal to a particular god (or a certain alliance between 2 or more gods) and only server them. Or you can decide completely randomly if you like. Every mission you take increases your pool of spells or units equally, with units and spells granted by the god you choose to work for. You can also pick up heroes along the way who will be loyal to you (unless you do something completely against their nature) and will follow you in future missions until they die or you lose their trust. Every mission you choose (and don't choose) affects future levels to varying degrees. By making a god's defence stronger you protect their territory that another god or being was after and would've been able to use in future levels. Discovering something allows the god you discovered it for use that information in future battles. Capturing a village, building, character, area etc. will give the benefits of that asset to your god (whether that be a new factory, new allies, a weakness in another god or a number of other boons). This all leads to your character and the world evolving organically in a way that's not always obvious but always makes sense. By the end of your fifth mission you'll have access to a wide variety of spells and units (and perhaps a hero or two) and certain gods will have grown or diminished in power noticeably.\n\nAll of the spells are breathtaking. From the bog-standard heal and speed-up spells you begin with which create a pleasant glow/melody and a cool-looking trail effect respectively. To the more extreme spells granted later on including tornados, volcanos, earthquakes, death-incarnate and many more. In addition, most of these spells can be cast within a couple of seconds and without stopping. This allows you to run amidst your army healing, speeding up and buffing who you need, sniping an important enemy unit (or a bunch of them) and then hiding behind your own units again within a very short period of time. A lot of these spells (and some units) scare the landscape permanently too. This makes places where small skirmishes and large battles have occurred very obvious, even after 5, 10 or 60 minutes. Scorch marks, blood stains, unnatural bumps or dips in the earth, sometimes even the earth itself has gone.\n\nThe penultimate thing will mention (even though there is so much more I could say) is that the humour in this game is incredible from start-to-finish. From the gods (voiced by Brad Garrett, Kevin Michael  Richardson, Castulo Guerra, Jennifer Hale and Tim Curry) to the units (every one of which with the sole exception of the manahor (an armless, mana-dispensing bunny) has a half-dozen lines if you enjoy clicking on a unit repeatedly long enough for it to yell at you to get lost) to the wizards. This game has so much personality and not in an annoying way.  The humor interlaces with the rest of the game beautifully instead of being forced like in so many other games.\n\nLastly, this game is worth your money and time without question. Without exaggeration I have played through the campaign seven times with a vastly different playthrough and experience each time: once following each of the gods wholeheartedly, once working for all of the gods and keeping them all as friendly with me as possible for as long as possible and once attempting to keep a pair of gods powerful and friendly with each other until the end.\n\nAt £7 it's worth it easily, at half-price (as it is at the time of this review) I can't recommend it more to everyone I know. Get it, it's awesome.","September 23, 2014","true","6.0"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","30","30","0","0"

It's an older game so don't expect much from the graphics. Sacrifice is an army-focused spell-casting game. You play as a wizard that summons creatures to create an army and fight other wizards. Your character comes from a dying world to a new world with five gods. Your wizard introduces himself, and starts selecting which of the god's quests he wants to complete.\n\nWhat makes this game neat is that you can only choose 1 of the 5 quests, which makes that god like you more and the others dislike you, and the storyline spirals out from there. The same overarching storyline applies, but how you go about completing it and the way the story is told changes slightly depending on which god(s) you help. The five gods go from "Good" (Persephone) to "Evil" (Charnel), and it doesn't matter which one(s) you choose to do quests for. Besides the storyline shifting slightly, the god(s) you choose to assist will give you summon creatures and spells from their domain. For example, Persephone will give you healing spells that the other gods do not have, as well as Druids and Rangers, creatures only granted by Persephone. The game has a ton of re-playability because of the many combinations of choices you can make yielding entirely unique arsenals of creatures and spells for every playthrough.\n\nI highly recommend this game as a unique experience for gamers, even if "army-based strategy RPG" doesn't sound that appealing to you.","October 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Unique mixture of RPG/RTS/TPS, which doesn't feel like almost any other game. You are a wizard, who comes to a new world and is being offered to serve multiple gods, totally 5 of them, which one you will pick is your choice and each of them has its own distinguishable personality + the voice acting is just excellent! With names like Tim Curry, Brad Garrett and Jennifer Hale.\n\nThe gameplay self revolves around collecting souls that enables you to create your own units and capturing manaliths that gives you mana regeneration to cast spells and summon creatures. The objectives vary in campaign, but is mostly  focused on defeating enemy Sorcerer by desecrating their altars (casting Desecrate spell on own unit and killing enemy sorcerer), since if you only kill them, then they can ressurect.\n\nEvery time you choose to play mission in campaign, you have to pick which god you are going to side with, which grants you either specific creature/spell of that god or both, meaning each god has 9 Creatures and 9 Spells that you can combine. Some creatures and spells have similar concepts, but each has specific visuals and/or twist, which provides huge variety and replayability, although I personally think Pyro is the most powerful one.\n\nThe campaign also provides interesting story with some quite nice twists, it's indeed not the anything extremely extrodinary, but I still like the story regardless. The best part is that you can side with different gods with each gameplay, thus playing from different point of view, making it look like multiple different storylines. Every god has also specific personality, based off elements. Nature/Life + Ground/Rocks/Earth + Air/Ice + Fire/Machines/Technology + Death/Decay.\n\nThe graphics looks quite good for it's time (2000!), especially thanks to the character designs I've talked about earlier, but Sacrifice was also one of first games to use anti-aliasing, terrain change and other advanced technologies, which actually makes it feel more like 2004-2006 game, which is quite an extrodinary achievement, so kudos to developers.\n\nStill, despite being accepted extremely well by critics and being called one of the best games of the year, the game didn't sell well. It probably was due to many factors, but one of the main ones would be that it was quite performance depending game and only top PC setups of its time could run it propetly, making it sort of Crysis of its time, thus the actual market for the game quite tiny and the Shiny (company that developed Sacrifice) ended up in huge losses and never recovered, which is personally kind of ironic, since I consider this one of best games ever made to this day.\n\nIn conclusion, Sacrifice is worth not only playing, but also replaying. It is one of most unique games that works flawlessly, the designs looks amazing and characters are extremely memorable, with great writing and voice acting, it is a gem that we should treasure, not only for its quality, but also for the efford it took everyone to make it. The developers put everything they had into this game and I only wish they had opportunities to make more great games. So buy and play this game, because it actually has, I dare to say it, soul!","February 5, 2014","true","14.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

It also has so much customisation within the options panel. You can change controls and camera many ways to suit you. Hraphics options control options ect. Inside the game play is very user friendly with rosseta type flyout controls.\nFirst game that i ever saw with that, and tons of games are doing it today, but Sacrifice did it 15 years ago.

Very in depth but easy to get going once you do the tutorial ( highly recommended).\n\nI bought this game when it came out in 2000. Friends and i played it in Lan games and i have some of the best memories pc gaming playing this. Sacrifice was ahead of it's time but seemingly went un noticed even with high accolades due to the stiff cometition it had from the groundbreaking releases of 1999 and 2000. Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, CS old school pre 1.6 and the soon to come looming giant Diablo 2. As such Sacrifice got unjustly buried as we all fell under Diablos spell and followed the Dark Traveler, to the East....always to the East.\n\nSacrifice is forever a AAA title, even today in 2015 it holds it's own.  RTS/Moba all owe homage to Sacrifice. It Is still beautiful, deep, funny, challenging and just FUN.\nUnfortunately i'm not sure if there is online multiplayer, at least it wasn't working for me.

The world oozes personality and its unique, almost alien charm will keep you coming back just to see what just might pop up next. With an all star voice cast a full decade before its likes could be considered the norm and gameplay unique but intuitive and natural, Sacrifice is a Real Time Strategy game like none other. Seeing it on Steam is like a dream come true, a truly innovative masterpiece of a game on the gold standard of online distribution services.\n\nHowever, and it pains me to say this, you had best save your money. Sacrifice came out in the year 2000, and some systems may struggle to run it. I know mine did, and even now I experience crashes while loading the levels of this game. What's more, Steam's dashboard does not get along with Sacrifice, causing all manner of bugs and glitches whenever I bring it up. This review is to the game itself, however, and I would certainly advise more people to pick up Sacrifice, as it is a one of a kind experience, but it is not one currently optomized for Steam. I would advise those who enjoy this game to continue playing it and to share it and their experiences with others, and that those who have not played this game to try it and see for themselves just how amazing it is. I would also say that, in order for the consumers to truly get their money's worth, people look into updating Sacrifice, at least to the point where it can function within Steam.","December 31, 2015","true","1.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

The gameplay of Sacrifice is as follows: an RTS/RPG, where you play as a wizard who controls an impressive array of spells and units with the end goal of eliminating rival factions and their wizards. Boasting an indepth, lengthy campaign complete with many conceptionally creative units, factions, heroes, Gods and lands, Sacrifice is a game chalk full of content. Sacrifice is also a treat for both the eyes and the ears as the game boasts amazing visuals, textures, audio, music, and character voice overs with some influential and well known actors - such as Tim Robbins & Tim Curry. While the mechanics of the game are interesting and varied, the control scheme may take a bit of getting used to (damn that locked camera!), but have no fear, once you master the camera and unit formations, the game becomes oh so much more enjoyable.\n\nPick up this extremely underrated masterpiece for only $10, as it's absolutely worth every penny!","March 26, 2011","true","72.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","3"

Their embassies, Wizards, are their greatest followers, and most destructive weapons: casting powerful feats, protection, but also curses, and agony. Their second miracles lies in summoning life, from nowhere, to do their combative bidding. Souls are currency for more stronger monsters, and mana is the fuel for all sorts of magical mayham. Yet, in the mist of this madness, there is an unspoken creed the gods have: only mortals carry the suffering, and never the gods...\n\nSacirifce is an interesting blend of real-time strategy with a their-person on-field perspective on a usually traditional genre.

It depends if you want to support a diverse gaming industry. I find that when games try to give the player more control over what goes from seeming complicated to simple in a small amount of time that the learning curve is an easy one, but makes the gameplay all the better. I'm a big fan of RTS games that allow for individual FPS control (think starcraft but you could control a single marine, or a pyro, and when you die you become the guy next to him). This wasn't exactly the case, but doesn't meant I can appraise the game for what it is.\n\nSacrifice's storyline itself is good. In fact it's great that I won't talk about it because if your really into story telling of four gods duking it out waging wars with one another and you being the catalyst, you might like this. The gameplay itself I like for the reason the game designers had the intentions of making a FPS RTS game, they tried pushing boundaries. This game back in the day may have been phenominal, but today the gameplay leaves me to hunger for a bit more. You are a sorcerer of sorts able to casts spells to build certain buildings (mana places or soul collecting places for troops) and build units around those buildings and replenish your mana faster. Over the course of the game you come across units and similar buildings to yours, which of course you have to attack commanding your units or by your magic. Different units allow for different purposes. Mana horns I learned early on that you need them to replenish mana in the field (after dying several times... probably should have read a tutorial but ain't nobody got time for one longer than a minute)! The control scheme as well I find is easy. The only thing I would really like if they allowed you to zoom out furhter on the character.\n\nI will give this game a .9 instead of a .7 due to it trying to break more boundaries. I find games like this allow gaming to go beyond graphics, but start looking at gameplay again (be it single player, coop, or multiplayer. They all have their own joy to offer).\n\n7.9/10","August 8, 2014","true","3.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I don't usually play RTS games, resource races and clicking contests. So far Sacrifice avoids those pitfalls with emphasis on unit choice, formation, and position...you know...strategy.\n\nSacrifice also doesn't require every decision to be made at blazing speed, which is nice, so you can take a moment to regroup, spawn some things, re-position, and re-engage. This softening of the real-time aspect also makes the game more enjoyable.\n\nThis is probably a little too casual for the hardcore RTS types, and the old-school nature of it limits the graphics, storyline, and unit choices, but its a cool game and for $2 you can't ask for much more.","December 25, 2013","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This older title (2000) has a unique style of RTS game-play (resource gathering--collecting souls and building--summoning minions) and the game-play feels similar to some games of the MOBA genre, e.g. Smite. The single player campaign has hours of replay because each missions is selected from pool of five choices that result in different selections, which either lock or unlock missions based on player decisions.  Although the Steam Store doesn't show multiplayer available for this game it is and multiplayer is one of the best parts of the game!\n\nIn Sacrifice multiplayer you can choose one of the preset casters that correspond with the gods in the single player campaign: fire mage, earth mage, necromancer, air mage, life mage or you can complete the single player campaign and use your custom mage (each level in single player grants a new spell and those spells differ based on which god you serve).\n\nSacrifice was ahead of its time. If you can get past the graphics, you'll love the game-play and the single player storyline.\n\nLink to instructions for Sacrifice free multiplayer server: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/SacrificeCommunity/discussions/0/864971765503082825/","December 29, 2013","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Neither did I. The animations aren't actually half bad for the outdated engine.\nThe idea of the game, combining a RTS with this unusual view, the unique resource 'souls', the whole aspect of how to beat an enemy player (by blocking their altar)... Nice!\nAnd even has an interesting story for the singleplayer.\n\nHowever, a thing that really pose an issue to me is the clunky controls. Commanding units is a pain and you'll often not know whether you actually send them at the target you intended to click (mostly due to the perspective reasons). Movement feels like a different era (probably is), overall gameplay feels not all too interesting (singleplayer pretty much comes down to luring the enemy into a trap to snatch some souls, rinse&repeat until you got enough to crush him near his altar).\n\nI will not doubt this was a unique and milestone-ish game at one point, but measured with today's standards, it just can't cope (gameplay/controls-wise, I do not judge it for it's graphics).","December 27, 2013","false","3.1"," 19 of 51 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","19","51","0","2"

So I have set this one aside for now maybe I'll try and tinker with it again in the future.\n\nThe problem is that Interplay went under long ago. There is no way for them to come back and tweak the game so that the compatibility problems can get fixed. Sure there are third parties that have put out some material that can be used with varying results, but that shouldn't be necessary.

I had wanted it previously but with so many other games available it took a back seat.\n\nFor the day, this was supposed to be a kick ♥♥♥ game, which earned it plenty of accolades by various critics. Even IGN named it "strategy game of the year" but it still financially failed miserably.  Some critics said players needed a third hand or extra fingers.\n\nI must agree. While the game strategy is awesome, the game interface is awkward and cumbersome. There is no way to get a clear view of the battle from behind the wizard, which reminded me of Dead Space.\n\nWith voice acting of Tim Curry and music by Kevin Manthei, one would think the game would excel. Even the art work and graphics, light years ahead for the day, couldn't make up for the crappy controls.\n\nWell worth the $1.50 I paid to get those nostalgic memories, I instantly became bored and haven't played it since.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mirabel/recommended/38440/","mirabel","ミラベル_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mirabel/","87 products in account","PLAY IT\n\nThis fantastic Action-RTS hybrid (which amazingly was released in 2000) is a spiritual predecessor to Brutal Legend, but as far as the RTS mechanics go it plays more like a faster, more furious Warcraft III, another game it preceded by a fair amount. It's built on the tried-and-true Melee/Ranged/Flyer triangular counter system and focuses on a central unit, the wizard, which gains experience levels and new spells as the match or mission progresses.\n\nThere are no goldmines or forests to exploit, however, the only resources on the field are manafounts, which, once built upon, can relay mana to you and your army. To build units, you use souls, which are painstakingly converted from heathens, including enemy military units. Since you're feeding on your enemy, you can either chip away at the enemy army in a passive game of zoning and area denial, cut down his mana supply by harrassing his manaliths, or you can just strike at the jugular and attempt to kill the wizard in a battle royale, severely reducing the potential of his units if successful. Despite the strategic simplicity of the game, all RTS playstyles are accounted for.\n\nSacrifice is a third-person view game centered on the player, not top-down view like a traditional RTS. The camera is notorious for not zooming out a lot - the wizard is advised to seek high ground so he may properly command his forces. Control groups help a ton. The interface is extensive and highly-customizable, but it'll probably take a lot of playing before you're making use of all the shortcuts.\n\nThere's an all-star cast of voice actors and they're all in their element here. The soundtrack is memorable and no game element seems odd or out of place, as bizarre and surreal as the game world is. The grotesque monsters, the meaty ground, the strange plants and structures, the whole aesthetic of the game comes together so well.\n\nIf I had to criticize one thing about the game, I'd have to criticize its competitive value. The game is better-suited for tournaments than many RTS but there are a lot of random elements that plague the player, particularly the random nature of melee attack damage and certain endgame spells and units. Speaking of the endgame, the final levels of the campaign and the credits seem a bit rushed in comparison to the tons of love given the early missions.\n\nNo matter what you're looking for in a classic game, I'm pretty certain you'll find it here. You cannot truly experience this game on the first playthrough. The lore is deep, the gameplay is deep, and the crevasses between the floating islands that make up the world are deep. If a flier is shot down over the abyss, his soul is lost forever. ;_;7","February 18, 2014","true","78.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sacrifice is an action/strategy hybrid game where you play a wizard who fights for the favor of 5 gods (who constantly fight among themselves). Summon creatures, issue them orders, buff them with defensive spells or cast offensive spells to destroy enemies. Claim the souls of your fallen foes in order to summon more units for your own army, then push your enemy back to their altar, and sacrifice a minion to destroy it, banishing the enemy wizard from the world and preventing them from respawning.\n\nFight for the gods:\nPersephone, godess of nature, order and healing,\nJames, god of earth, stone and peace,\nStratos, god of air, cold and knowledge,\nPyro, god of fire, chaos and industry, or\nCharnel, god of death, plague and suffering.\n\nStick with one god to get all their toys or build an army of mixed units from certain combinations of gods to exploit their unique advantages.

You'll be saying that a lot as you play through this game. The outstanding voice-over work includes Tim Curry (Stratos), Tony Jay (Mithras), Paul Eiding (Eldred), and Brad Garrett (James), among others. The script they are given to work with is pretty good, too; the five squabbling gods are full of character. It's hard to pick your favorite.\n\nImagine Brütal Legend actually had some depth to its units and you have Sacrifice in a nut-shell. What units you get depend on which god you decide to follow for that particular mission, allowing you to mix and match units and spells for the first half of the game, allowing for a different experience each time you play through the story. And you'll want to play through it more than once; each god has a very different approach to the story as well as several unique missions.\n\nThis game is one of the best games to come out of the early 2000s. It's a shame that it doesn't have very much visibility; if you haven't played this game, pick it up.","July 21, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is also a multiplayer that is lots of fun both coop against the AI and death match.\n\nTo mention a few negatives to make the review more balanced the only negative thing in this game is the balance of the creatures and the AI to a certain degree. The predictability in the army composition of the AI, the AI will always try to counter your units in a rock-paper-scissor like form though the combat is much more deep than that with the spellcasting and number of available creatures you can after playing the game over and over know what the enemy will summon based on what you are summoning. The endgame unit is so powerfull you will mostly never summon anything else which makes the last 2-3 levels somewhat bland.\n\nBut all in all it is not only a 10/10 it is a unique lovely memorable gem out of the library of all games.","December 25, 2013","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
