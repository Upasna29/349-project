The gunplay is lacking, and while the idea is nice, it gets old after one round (a minute or two).","September 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 38 of 55 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","38","55","2","4"

The slow motion is a pretty cool feature. It takes a couple of waves to get into it, but all in all, it's decent and gets hard as ♥♥♥♥ as the waves get higher.","September 17, 2015","true","0.4"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","10","22","3","0"
