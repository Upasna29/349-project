"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/245620/","toquina","Overkill_Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/","302 products in account","The Tropico series has always played it safe, never pushing too hard to renovate making sure people know what to expect each time. Tropico 5 is no exception, with the same infrastructure and demands those familiar with the series will know exactly what to expect. With that said, significant changes have been made to the economy, development and elections systems that Tropico 5 holds its own unique identity within the series.\n\nOne new feature is a redesign of the campaign, while in previous games each mission would start on a new island beginning with the basic building blocks each time. Now players are given the choice between two islands, once the player completes a mission on the choose island the player must then complete the next mission on the second island. Levels are not reset and any development on the islands remains throughout the campaign. This change allows players to watch an island flourish over time, crawling up from its colonial roots to its own independent metropolis. Each choice becomes a much greater decision as it will not only effect the player for that level but for later missions that follow. While it provides a much greater sense of accomplishment it's a system with many drawbacks. The greatest of this being put into an automatic lose situation.\n\nAfter completing a mission I returned to a previously developed island which had a population of 900 before leaving. Once I came back I found my population had been almost cut in half to 500 however my foundations remained and continued to cost upkeep which left me with a drastically understaffed island. There was little I could do as I would almost immediately jump into negative finances and could never pull it back out. Restarting the mission left to the exact same situation every single time, an issue that needs attention. With some missions giving little time for a player to complete objectives, those starting in a bad situation can soon find themselves in impossible to win situations. With the current save system this could take you back numerous missions to repair.\n\nWhile the infrastructure behind the game remains the same the countless economy changes significantly effect how you would approach missions. A major flaw with all previous games was that most players would soon find their own approach that would work in every environment. With your own approach that was guaranteed to succeed there was little reason to break that mold. In tropico 5 however a  much greater dependency on varied trade breaks that mold. Forcing players to constantly adapt to a ever changing economy and political struggles. Finance isn't the only major overhaul, as elections now become significantly more difficult. Factions will be tougher to please, often forcing the player to juggle edicts and votes between each election to keep the majority on his or her side. With most actions having an equally negative response as positive players need to keep a keen eye, balancing the books of finance with the cries of the population.\n\nSadly, with what Tropico 5 makes up in polish it loses in humor, failing to come even close to the witty comments, quality voice acting and wacky scenarios we were given in 4. It's still remains funny at times but fails to reach that unique charm that gives it such a unique identity we remember it by.\nPro:\n+Well balanced economy\n+Improved Visuals\n+Increased Difficulty\n+Islands continue to develop after completed missions\n+Improved design of elections\n+New well designed edicts\n\nCons:\n-Less humor then previous game\n-Generic voice acting replaced funnier voice acting from earlier games\n-Some balance issues with builds, some produce little profit compared to others\n-Campaign design can cause some missions harder then intended or even impossible\n-Missing features, presume coming in as DLC for new buildings\n\nTropico 5 is a drastic improvement to early games but comes with many drawbacks of its own. With this in mind it's difficult to recommend or bash this title. Those who come for the gameplay and love a challenge will be happy with the changes. Those looking for a relaxed campaign with a humorous story may be left disappointed.  While i'm left with mixed feelings i'll still have to recommend it. It's well polished, well designed and exactly what most people asked for in this sequal it's just missing that cherry on the top to make it a memorable game.\n\nThis is only a short review, the full review will be completed at a later time.","May 24, 2014","true","87.1"," 1,057 of 1,186 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","057","1","0","40"

I didn't think Kalypso/Haemimont could screw Tropico 5 up.  They did.  The game has far less content than Tropico 4 did on release day.  This is so you can buy content later as DLC!\n\nThe economy controls are dumbed down.    Rent, wages, and all other economic factors are frustratingly simplified and broad.\n\nShipping was a bit of an annoyance in Tropico 4,  goods could stack at docks faster than it could be shipped.   In Tropico 5, that has been remedied (sort of) but the new way of shipping goods is an annoying, island clogging, minutiae-filled chore that makes me long for T4's flawed but ultimately less annoying shipping system.\n\nT4's troops worked automatically and you had no control over them.  In T5, you do have control.  A good thing, right?  Wrong.  The troops controls are clunky and unresponsive.  Another chore, not fun.\n\nRebels in Tropico 4 would appear if you were doing things wrong or didn't have enough jobs.   There was a reason (and cure) to having rebels on your island.  In Tropico 5,  you have rebels for no reason.  Your island could be a perfect paradise, but huge rebel attacks will still occur.  The Developers have admitted the rebels are arbitrary and for no reason other than some lame excuse about it being an upstart island with political turmoil; it just (and does, often) happens.\n\nIn Tropico 4, you could be a benevolent ruler, or a brutal Tyrant, which is what Tropico was all about.   In Tropico 5, you are an impotent and weak  governor that can only survive by doing your best in hopes of  pleasing the fickle masses to desperately stay in power.\n\nThen there is DLC.  Tropico 4, when it came out, was quickly buried in DLC. BUT!  The first several DLC were handy, useful DLC.  The DLC had VERY useful buildings, cool decorator pieces, a mission, and outfit.   Over time though, the Tropico 4 DLC became cheap, useless cash grabs.   This crappy DLC content continued on into Tropico 5.  All the DLC in Tropico 5 is pointless and adds nothing interesting.  Not only that, but a few skilled gamers actually found large chunks and entirely complete, usuable DLC in the RELEASE DAY game files.  Which the Devs tried to patch out and B.S. away.\n\nIn Hindsight, you could offer me Tropico 5 for free, and i'd decline the offer.  Tropico 4 is superior in nearly every way.  With Tropico 4 being available on Steam, there is absolutely no point, reason, or need to buy Tropico 5.\n\nThis really, for me, is a bummer.  This isn't some game I saw, tried, and didn't like.  I LOVE Tropico 4.  I WANTED to see this game succeed.   Kalypso/Haemimont are the little guys in the gaming industry.  But when they got greedy and released a content-weak game and put that content (that isn't that great to begin with) in DLC, they sold their integrity to nickel-and-dime their customers.\n\nI was dissapointed when  Kalypso started rushing out several shoddy DLC at the end of Tropico 4's run.  Now, with Tropico 5,  Kalypso/Haemimont are no longer on my radar, I don't care about their games.\n\nThat's okay.  I still have Tropico 4.\n\n\nEDIT:  Some people have posted below with some very good arguments about where my review may be wrong.  I still feel my review stands, but if you are truly looking into whether you should spend your money on this game or not, it wouldn't hurt in reading the comments below for some very valid responses that may change your mind.","March 22, 2015","false","3.8"," 626 of 692 people (90%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","90","626","692","17","15"

I played Tropico 3, 4 and 5. Let's get into this review.\n\nI was very excited about the game before release. Ever since Tropico 4 came out, I've been waiting and waiting for news about the newer one. But sadly, this game disappointed me. First, let me talk about the things I liked.\n\nThe textures and graphics are amazing. They have been improved alot. I played the old versions on my Xbox 360, and right when I changed to PC and tried this one out, I noticed the differences. The buildings look very nice, and when you zoom in, full in, you see all the details. The interiors of a shack, the faces on the people and sometimes just the trees. The developers went all out on this game and I say that the graphics are a plus.\n\nThe new online mode is awesome. You can play against three other people in an island, and race to finish quests or even try to invade the other person.\n\nBut those are really the only things I liked about this game.\n\nIn Tropico 5, you play alot of missions in the same island. You're basically switching islands and going back to them. I didn't like this move. Alot of times you feel like you're handed the island to you again. I know how this would have worked, but I don't really like it. In the old versions, every single mission is another challenge to you. You go on a different, all new island and building it out of nothing. Alot of times this game just feels repetitive.\n\nI feel like the direction Kalypso is moving is not helping the game. The game relies on DLC after DLC to try to keep it fresh again. A game shouldn't fully rely on expansions to make it better. Those DLC's could instead be implemented to the actual game and when you play the old game and the new one, you feel like it's a big step.\n\nThere have already been four DLC's out that could have instead been in the original game, that would have made it better. I still don't know how there's no offline multiplayer yet. It would be awesome to have people controlling different part of the island.\n\nAnd also, the soundtrack. I loved the older soundtracks, but when you compare Tropico 5's to the older ones, it's just not as good.\n\nTropico 3 and 4 both amazed me. I loved both of those games instantly. I expected the same to happen with Tropico 5, but sadly that was not the case. It feels like this whole series just relies on DLC's to make the game fresh again. I can't see many people buying DLC after DLC after DLC. It's just, not how it should go. I feel like Tropico can be one of the biggest strategy/city-building games out there if it just fills in all the gaps. After just a few hours of playing this game, I was already disappointed. I felt at times I was forcing myself to continue, and that it felt like a chore to keep playing.\n\nIf you've never played a Tropico game before, or you're just new at city-building games, I recommend you try this out. But if you are a hardcore gamer, or a just experienced at Tropico, chances are you won't like this game - at least not as much as the older ones.\n\nAnd for this, I give the game a 5/10.","January 19, 2015","false","10.3"," 534 of 614 people (87%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","87","534","614","23","13"

If you already own Tropico 4 you probably don't need this game and it will likely frustrate you.  I'm writing this review in the days after release so my gameplay time of Tropico 5 has admitedly been limited.  That said, I've played the Tropico series since the original back in the early 2000's.  I get that changes need to be made to keep the game relevant, but in my opinion Tropico 5 changed largely in the wrong direction.  However, if you're new to the series, you'll enjoy this game for what it has to offer.  Here's my initial breakdown.\n\nPros:\n\nBeautifully redesigned buildings, everything just seems to fit together nicely when you're trying to cram a lot of buildings into one space.\nThe dynasty member function seems like a possible plus (haven't really fleshed that out yet).\nI like the concept of having manager's in buildings, but it's not clear how they contribute to the overall expense of the building.\nI like some of the new edicts like charging for healthcare!  Finally those lazy peasants will pay or die.\nThe addition of tanks adds a layer of badassery and battling rebels/other nations is more engaging.\n\nCons:\n\nCan't set the exact wage for a worker anymore (it's done in an overarching budget system, so you set a budget for a building which somehow encompasses a salary for the worker and operating costs for the building).  You want to pay your farmers more than your doctors?  Sorry, can't do that...\nYou also can't set the exact amount for rent anymore.\nThe above two issues make it hard to become an uber-capitalist dictator.  I know it sounds ridiculous but they've dumbed down the economic system so much it's actually complicated.\nCustomizing your character is gone.  I don't care so much about what they look like, but who thought an astronaut suit should be 1 of the 5 outfits you get to choose?  I'm more upset you can't select negative and positive traits to create a more in depth character.  I always liked choosing flatulence even though the palace guards got double pay...\nAm I missing the plants and shrubbery somwhere?  You basically have a large park and a small park, that's it.  No single palm trees to meticulously line your roadways...  Statues meant to glorify El Presidente's and intimidate your opponents are non-existent.\nYou have to pay to explore your island now which seems pointless.\nOptions like "paper plates" and "cloth napkins" that used to affect the quality of a restaurant are no longer options.  You adjust the budget of the building now to change service, but that raises the worker's wages.  What if I want to increase quality without raising wages...\nEl Presidente is pretty much useless.  He can't help rush construction or join in fighting the rebels like in previous games.  No option to sway election with speeches either.\nBuilding progression through research/time feels poorly developed and arbitrary.  You earn research points through libraries and observatories which give you tech upgrades for different buildings.  Unfortunately, you can only build tenaments and country houses at the beginning so if you want to upgrade your citizens to apartments to improve housing quaility you have to wait until the Cold War era (and then destroy all your previous housing and try to make the apartments fit into your city layout).  I wasn't a fan of Tropico 4's purchasing blueprints, but I think it works better than this option.\nYou can no longer see who is actually visiting a restaurant, pub, doctor's office, etc.  You're just given a "number of visitors".\nSearching in the almanac is painful.  All I want to do is find the least happy person and execute them, but you can't search by that.  You can find the person with the lowest approval rating, but they're not necessarily the most unhappy.\nI know this is knit-picking, but I liked when you purchased a building upgrade in previous Tropico's, the physical improvement would appear (i.e. skylights in the cigar factory).  There's no visual changes on the buildings when upgrading now.\nYou can't toggle a dock to accept "tourists only" so I keep having my teamsters dropping export resources at the dock in my tourist area.  I don't want stinking peasants mixing with the upper echelons of society.\nOnly a handful of island maps to play.\nOne of the biggest negatives for me is the overall lack of buildings (where's the gourmet restaurant??? or El Presidente's childhood museum?).  I assume this is so we can be sold the inevitable expansion packs.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nThe ability to choose the placement of our palace and dock at the outset of a sandbox game would be nice.\nConsider reverting back to SOME, not all, of the core game designs from previous versions.  My big ones would be charging specific amount of rent and setting worker's wages (please change this back).\nTrue roundabouts would be great for improving traffic flow.\n\nEven with all the above, I'll still play it because I absolutely love Tropico, but just a lackluster delivery compared to past game versions.  Overall rating from me would be a 6 out of 10.","May 24, 2014","false","16.2"," 1,225 of 1,498 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","225","1","0","45"

It just feels lazy.  All your old favourite buildings return,  very few new ones.  DLC is silly expensive, customization is meh.  Save your money and go play one of the other tropicos.  Either 1,  or if you like roads,  3.\n\nTo elaborate.\n\nBuilding Variety - Tropico has never been big on this, but it's 2014.  Would it kill to have 2 models for a Bunhouse/house/etc?\n\nEras - These are esentially mini-goals.  If you fail to achieve them within the time limit,  you lose.  That's about it.  All they do is lock buildings from you,  making it harder to layout a good city -from the start-\n\nShips -  You get to own ships,  that sounds cool, and I really thought it was going to be like Tropico 2 managing pirate fleets.  But it's not.  You couldn't have any less interaction with them, No naming,  no colouring, and with each era, the ship just poofs into the next eras ship and keeps doing what it does.    Huge let down.\n\nMines - Ugly eyesores that just look silly when you upgrade them.   A mini Bagger 288 just sits there, and it's grosly undersized.\n\nTanks - Yep, I'm gonna say this too.  The introduction of Tropico tanks.   They are T-34.  That's it. Every nation be it america,  soviets,  modern armour,, oh and of course Tropico,  all use the same model T-34.\n\nBring Back TNT radio - I mean the Tropico 3 one, (but 4 is even better than this schlock).\n\nSome of these sound nitpicky,  but this is why the game just feels lazy.  Would it of killed them to make a few differnt tank models?  Woud it of been that much of an effort to make another bunk house?\n\nSure, these are just visuals,  but this game is very difficult to mod.  And there are virtually no new gameplay from say Tropico 3,  or 4.      So if the game play is the same, then the visuals better be amazing......but they aren't.  Hence  a lazy, forgetable, "next tropico game".","October 25, 2014","false","48.0"," 1,008 of 1,235 people (82%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","82","008","1","20","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bestfriendbarnaby/recommended/245620/","bestfriendbarnaby","Barnaby Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bestfriendbarnaby/","195 products in account","I'm a pretty big fan of games of this kind. I grew up playing the different versions of Sim City.\n\nI'm also a big fan of Tropico 3 and 4, and bought this game on sale. Even on sale, I can't really recommend it and here's why:\n\nThey haven't fixed the most important problem.\n\nIf you've played Tropico extensively, like I have, you've run into the problem with road congestion. It has not been fixed. You must plan out very meticulously your road network from the VERY beginning of the game. Each subsequent story mission builds upon the progress you've made in previous missions. You use the same Island and city as before (there's 2 different islands, and thus two different cities). If you're not very careful, you'll end up like I did, 6 or 7 missions in without the means to really go in and rework everything, and it's not until that far in that the problem becomes very large and difficult to solve.\n\nIf you have a diverse economy, which is actually very easy to achieve in Tropico 5, it's not difficult to make quite a lot of money that can be invested into infrastructure, but the problem for me doesn't lie in having to rework infrastructure, it's that I'm working to circumvent poor coding (the road system I mentioned earlier) that has been in every Tropico game I've ever played.\n\nRoad management is a part of the game, I'm fully aware, but there is no management options. Tropicans will take the shortest route available. There are no one way street, or high volume highway like options. I can't do anything but build a singular type of road which nearly every building needs to be attached to. The only way to be completely efficient is to have EXTREMELY ugly circle roads that never connect to each other except by adjacent garages. Someone actually developed a circumvention system for Tropico 3 (which has persisted into 4 and 5 out of necessity). If you google "road congestion tropico", I'm sure you can find more information (if interested).\n\nThis Tropico is a little bit more challenging than the last ones in terms of Rebels and their threats. They attack much more often, and your army cannot be controlled beyond telling them which buildings you value the most. Rebels will attack from multiple points and your army sallies out of wherever you built your buildings. Since all you have is men on foot and eventually very slow tanks, the rebels will usually destroy several buildings before your army can even respond.\n\nRebels are also able to target your army squads while you are unable to control and choose targets for your own. What this means is that your army will be running to defend a certain building, and the rebels will follow along and continually fire at them while your army DOES NOT RETURN FIRE, and simply dies. It's EXTREMELY frustrating.\n\nThere's also a huge problem that persists with housing.\n\nAs you might remember, people get old and retire and their income falls. There are children, unemployed and students as well. In Tropico 5, Houses now have budgets like employment buildings do. It is essentially the rent charge.\n\nNO MATTER WHAT JOB PEOPLE HAVE, most of them will not live in a house because it is too expensive. Even if you've maximized the budget (and thus their pay) at their place of employment. You must lower the rent to a single point (out of a maximum of 5) in order to allow people to live there. YOU MUST turn on social security. Otherwise you will CONSTANTLY be attacked by rebels. YOU MUST do this for every housing building.\n\nPeople will also not live in a building that is too far from where they work. Couples make a decision based upon both their work locations. If not satisfied with how close they live to work, they toss up a shack!\n\nIt is not uncommon to see shacks right beside housing units that are completely empty.\n\nFor some ungodly reason, Tenements lose housing value over time. There is no option to remedy this. This only way to circumvent is to completely destroy the building and replace it. It would have taken a few lines of code to add a renovate option, but no, they didn't do that. I wouldn't be surprised if it was in a DLC.\n\nThe graphics are improved, a lot of the mechanics of the game have been streamlined, but not fixed. There are improvements here, although the dynasty system is tacked on, stupid, and useless.\n\nIt feels like it's still Tropico. I don't know what it is that provides that feeling, the enjoyment of the game, and the music (I've always really enjoyed it) or the same bloody bugs that have persisted forever without attention.","January 1, 2015","false","35.9"," 260 of 293 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","260","293","11","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ihavenoshoes/recommended/245620/","ihavenoshoes","Jimmy NoShoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ihavenoshoes/","235 products in account","Unfortunately I just can't recommend this game as much as I would have loved to.\n\nWhen I first played it, it was a nice refresh and continuation of Tropico 4. As I played it more, I found more and more problems with the game. The fighting, the buildings, the overlays (pre building placement and post placement), rebels, population cap, to name a few. I'll summarise these quickly:\n\nThe fighting: Essentially, its build a huge military or be wiped out. Once rebels appear, if they break through your military (which they will as they are OP most of the time), they head straight to the palace and game over. Your military doesn't respawn, you cannot rebuild military buildings either. Even if your barracks refill with 8 troopers, they won't go and fight the rebels attacking the palace. Totally ridiculous and to me, its a game breaker.\n\nThe buildings: Only apartments have 'variations' and even then they look pretty much the same. Throughout the eras, the building all look the same, modern housing in colonial periods. Really? There needs to be much more variation in models. As it stands now, its bland. There are buildings missing too that should really be in there. Since when did a police station act as a fire station? Seems lazy. Modern tanks appearing in the cold war era too.\n\nOverlays: When you place buildings that say 'Affects nearby plantations' or 'Generates funds off nearby housing', there is nothing to say how far this radius is. You have no idea what it will affect until its placed and built. These buildings often cost alot to make and many times where you place can be a total waste of resources. For a modern 2014 game, this is not acceptable to me. Kalypso merely say its meant to be this way and is fine, and then point about overlays in the Almanac which are irrelivent to the point raised to them. There is nothing to say what the radius is of any building. This is a poor effort.\n\nRebels - too common, too OP. Doesn't give the feeling of a dictatorship game at all. Even on high happiness (some people have rebel attacks at 100 happiness). There are no real reasons for rebels alot of the time, and to many, its unknown why they are attacking since everyone is happy. The only real way to counter rebels is to have a huge military, which generates more rebels in itself. Lose lose situation ultimately.\n\n2000 people population cap. You have often use 1/4 of the island and reach this pop cap. Very poor. Dev excuses for this are poor and obsurd. As of patch 1.08 a population slider has finally been implemented. Only took them 9 months.\n\nLast point i'll make is the DLC for this. £3 for most DLC, gives 1 building,  an outfit you never see, 1 short mission and a music track. Most of the DLC was already included in the base game and can be unlocked via mods and working correctly. Your paying to play with what should have been there in the first place really. Considering the base price of the game is £29.99, its really not worth it.\n\nCould only recommend the game if game price drops below £15 and all DLC included.","November 22, 2014","false","117.7"," 511 of 615 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","511","615","12","14"

Sadly it appears to have been carved up and rushed out for a rather shameless DLC cash grab.\n\nIf your looking for a game in the series to buy Pick up Tropico 4 with the DLC in the next sale. Skip this\n\nPros\n-----\nEra's - your island now advances through various eras from colonial to modern times each with its own set of available buildings, technologies, politics and edicts\n\nYou now have family members forming a dynasty\n\nMultiplayer Mode - a feature that this game really could have run with.\n\nIts still tropico\n\nCons\n------\nMany of the building options are gone (some can allready be found in the overpriced DLC shop) the build options for each era are also therefore painfully limited especially the early ones. Often what is available in each era makes little historical sense at all. Also most of the buildngs most notably housing only has one skin per type.\n\nMuch of the fine tweeking from the previous games is now simplified or simply gone, the new system often leads to seemingly random swings of popularity, unrest, strikes and uprisings with no clear reason why or control over the events that follow, just hit fast forward and hope for the best.\n\nThe dynasty members dont really do anything interesting; theres a handfull of scripted events that rotate for them.\n\nThe humour is tired and repetitive very much a one gag pony.\n\nThe campaign missions are for the most part all very much the same set of scripted events on rotation and the story doesnt really go anywhere it just peters out.\n\nIt is entirely possible to totally cripple yourself for later on in the campaign with no way short of going back two levels of fixing it (if you happened to save it). The alternative is also true you can set yourself up so well you will just face roll through half of the missions.\n","June 8, 2015","false","60.3"," 276 of 340 people (81%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","81","276","340","9","2"

Unfortunatley the modern mindset seems to be that you can push out a minimal product at full price, and charge for "DLC" that should have been in the main game.\nEvery step taken by kalypso seems to be a step backwards. There are less buildings, less avenues for economy, less player agency. In tropico 4 you could entirely eschew certain areas of economy and still make it work. Want a industrial complex that sucks the minerals from the land for massive profit? No problem. Want to protect mother earth, build your economy by becoming a tourist trap, or an island vegas? Go for it! Do you want to create an atheist state, a complete theocracy, a communist regime, or a capitalist paradise? All do-able!\nNot so with tropico 5. Make a single move that the people dont like, and you're done. in some cases there is no way to correct this (sign the wrong thing into your constitution, watch your approval tank. just watch, you can do nothing about it now.) its game over. You -must- build a church if you want to have any hope of making out of colonial era. You -must- build a mine if you want to have any economy at all.  While in tropico 4 you had to keep citizen happiness in mind, now it is the single driving factor of the entire game, and you will have to play it their way, not yours. Now that buildings are tied to eras, the game is completely homogonized. Every game is "A" leads to "B" leads to "C". you -must- start with farming, which -must- lead to industrialization, with no options for tourism or even entertainment until the right era.\nAnd the DLC that is planned for this game is beyond insulting. there are so many features from tropico 4 that were taken out so that they could be resold in bits and pieces. Remove jails and make the game activley punish you for trying to deal with criminals. Oh but dont worry, there is a prison DLC coming out that you can buy. It reminds me of a mobile free to play game, only i unfortunatley payed money for it.\nTropico 4 was one of my favotire city building games, with many interesting mechanics and conecpts that couldn't be found elsewhere. Tropico 5 is an incredible disappointment, i cant recomend anyone buy this game.

This one is still playable, but just doesn't feel like it has the depth of the previous titles. Some of the additions I liked and thought were interesting changes, such as:\n\n- You know have a ruling dynasty and you gain new family members as you go, with different abilities and bonuses\n\n- You have different eras that you move through and different building available in each era. There is also a constitution with options in each area. This is how you control things like open or closed borders, conscription vs high quality military etc.\n\nHowever, things I didn't like:\n\n- It seems much harder to really get a picture of how your society is going. Little things like : previously in a school you could see all the students and click on them, now you just get '5/10 students' and you can't drill down on them. You can't seem to get a list of your whole population by education level, only the unemployed people. You can't see an individual persons needs anymore, just their ratings. It's harder to watch or track a single person. You can see thoughts, but not what they are currently doing, whereas they used to tell you they were going to the doctor, or to get food. You can't see how many people are using a garage or railway station. Lots of small features like this that they have removed make it really hard to diagnose problems, like whether people are able to commute effectively, or have enough services around them.\n\n- Because of the above, when things go wrong, you often have no idea why. Why is the happiness rating high but my approval rating low? Why do I have so many of every type of entertainment building but the entertainment happiness is still low? Why do I have lots of teamsters but my factories are full on un picked-up goods? It's often hard to tell if it is something you are doing wrong, inconsistencies in the game or bugs. Why do I have so many homeless people who won't move into the housing I have built that is in a good location and appropriate for their wealth level? Why do I still have people listed as 'broke' when I have the social security edict turned on. Why is there a group protesting against my government, but when I click on them many have 85+ approval rating and happiness? What are they upset about? No idea.\n\nAll of that being said, the game is still fairly easy to complete, but for those like me that like to not just finish the mission but build the ultimate society in the process, it is so frustrating seeing things like a low approval rating due to homelessness when I have dozens of houses standing empty and other similar things. I ended up giving up because I just wasn't enjoying it any more.\n\nFor anyone new to the franchise, go and play 3 or 4, they are awesome.","June 16, 2015","false","85.6"," 170 of 207 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","170","207","8","0"

It was the first Tropico game I had played and I couldn't wait for Tropico 5. Like most I've been disappointed with the changes made. They aren't bad, they just don't work too well. Tropico 4 was a waiting game, you had to wait for buildings to be finished. Tropico 5 is a waiting game, you have to advance in era to get to the interesting sections of the game.\n\nTropcio 5 feels like the developers tried to make it more tightly focused while cutting corners from everything to budget manangement to simple buildings. This takes away a large amount of options that you had in Tropico 4 and it makes it feel like an unfinished game. Everything interesting and fun has been removed and we've left with a lifeless and soulless sim city.\n\nCoop is pretty pointless because it's just the base game with someone else on the idea taking up space and resources. It's still just as boring and waiting around for your citizens to be happy enough to advance to the next era.\n\nI played through the campaign once and was left wanting more. I even tried to replay it but it's just so tidious I can't bring myself to dredge through to chapter 2.\n\nMy final thought is that this game should be good, possibily even really good. But cutting out content for future DLCs and expansions makes me not want to invest any more time with Tropico 5 when the base contains so little.\n\nEl Presidenté deserves more.","October 9, 2014","false","24.1"," 253 of 331 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","253","331","4","0"

However, what these people don't seem to grasp is that sometimes less is more. I will admit that Tropico 5 is certainly not a perfect game, nor is it even the best game in the series, but it still holds it own and should be considered by anybody who is a fan of the series or the genre.\n\nI will start with the good, which there is plenty of. Tropico 5 has the most robust campaign of any Tropico game to date, with persistent islands that carry over from mission to mission and a new dynasty system that allows you to pass your legacy on to your offspring if you choose to. While the dynasty aspect could have been fleshed out a little more, it is still fun and finally gives you something to actually do with your off-shore account money (which is used to upgrade dynasty memebers). As usual the story to the campaign is wacky and goofy, and completely unbelievable, but that is all just part of the charm to Tropico. Tropico 5 also introduces a new era system where instead of always starting during the Cold War, you can now start as early as colonial times and work your way up through 4 eras to modern times. While not game-changing per say, this does add a nice touch to the game and a fresh way to play it. The voice acting throughout is solid and charming, the music is catchy as always, and the visual are superb. The color pallete is bright and cheerful, and the level of detail on some of the buildings is rather impressive when you zoom in. It should also be noted that as with most Kalypso games technically the game is great, it runs wonderfully and I have had zero crashes.\n\nAs I mentioned though, the game is not perfect I'm afraid. There are a couple of aspects of the game that have been simplified compared to old titles. For example, when setting the salary for a building instead of a slider that allowed you to set whatever dollar amount you wanted, there are just 5 pre-set payrates to choose from. Furthermore, while you can still set the pay from every building of that kind, you can't set it for all workers of that education. A slight annoyance, but still something that may detract from some and it also points to the larger issue with this game I think many have. This game is not City:Skylines, it is not Banished, nor is it even SimCity in terms of complexity. Tropico 5 is a largely streamlined experience that is intended to let you focus on the big picture without getting too caught up in micro-managing. Some people like this, some don't, which I get, but it should be noted Tropico games have always been like this so it really shouldn't be a shock that Tropico 5 continues the pattern. Another annoyance is the lack of content in this game. While the campaign is robust and plenty of maps are included for sandbox mode, it is frustrating to see buildings and concepts introduced in previous games either omitted or held out so that they can be introduced through over-priced DLC. That said, the base game as is still provides plenty to do and can be enjoyed without spending a penny on DLC. It should be noted though that the exact same argument could be made about the last game, as without the Modern Times expansion Tropico 4 was a little lacking in endgame content, so again this really is nothing new for the series.\n\nAll-in-all Tropico 5 is a really solid game. Not great, but also really not bad, and very much worth the only $40 it costs. I will admit that you may want to start with Tropico 4 (skip 3, 4 is just an upgraded version of it), and if you want a really good game that is completely different from the rest of the series play 2, but if you already have played these and are hungry for more or you just want to play the newest game, you will not regret this purchase. Also please note while my Steam account doesn't reflect it I have played every game in the series extensively, in particular 4 on the XBox 360, and while 2 actually remains my favorite 5 is right up there as well.\n\n","July 23, 2015","true","22.2"," 114 of 136 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","114","136","5","1"

I didn't review this game until now, hoping that after the inital "shock" I would change my mind. I haven't.\n\nI've been a huge fan of the Tropico series since 2001, but I'm afraid I've lost that lovin' feelin' with Tropico 5. We loved the Tropico games so much that we upgraded ALL our computers so we could run T5 (DX11) to the tune of about $400 (just for new hardware). We had no other reason/need to upgrade (nothing else, to this day, has required us to upgrade). IMHO, that is some pretty serious game love. :)\n\nOne complaint I have is muti-player: we purchased multiple copies to play TOGETHER, but it doesn't really work that way (read the forums to see why, they explain it better than I can).\n\nThe reason why I don't play anymore (single player) is because of how they make the scenaries work. It goes back and forth between TWO islands, each time continuing where you left off. That might sound good, but for me it's a total pain. I have a VERY hard time remembering which buildings were upgraded before, how upgraded were they, which ones need managers, etc. etc. etc. For me it was SOOOOO much better starting a new island each time. That way I could build not only for the general needs of my people, but for the needs of the scenario.\n\n*As of 5-29-15 -- $112 (so far) for the full game ... are you kidding me?\nFull price costs - Tropico 5: $40.

Or has it...\n\nTo me as a fan of Tropico since #1, Tropico 5 has seemed to have thrown out all the old stuff that has been in the series since the Original Tropico. The Traits are now gone, alot of buildings from previous games have seemed to disappear, hardly any of the buildings look different from each other (Even Shacks look the same).\n\nThe concept of the time periods seems like an interesting idea at first but it is really poorly executed, around 80% of the buildings are locked in Colonial times, which is fair enough... Where are you going to get a Space Program in the Colonies? But what annoy's me is the fact that they didn't execute it like they did in the Modern Times DLC where you upgrade the buildings with the time. You can't even get a Medical building in Colonial times, or hardly any Entertainment buildings. And I'm pretty sure they were making Cigars and Rum before "The Great Wars"\n\nThe Gameplay can feel very dull and a bit of a drag at times. You feel like you've listened to the same song over and over and over, Done the same objective over and over and over. And you've gotten nowhere.\n\nAlso the customisation of the characters is appauling comparing to Tropico 4, which had limited options to say the least. The only costumes you can use in Tropico 5 limited to literally 5. And some of those don't even make sense, You can dress as an Astronaut in Colonial Times. This makes me facepalm very much so. They also slimmed down the traits to around 8. Considering Tropico's Useful and Humorous Traits from the past, these really aren't traits. Did I mention you can't have your own name? Nope, You got to have a name from this list. And going through the list is a grueling task as you have to go through each name INDUVIDUALLY by scrolling to the side.\n\nThe new characters also seem a bit... Bland and uncharacterful comparing to previous games. Even the Caricatures seem a bit lifeless. Also not having the faction figureheads stating what's going on really lets the game down.\n\nIt also is quite tough on the hardware, I would suggest using a beefy computer. But this could just be the early stages of the game.\n\nOn the brightside, It's pretty I guess. And Trading is a nice touch. But not much else has changed and had only really taken a step backwards.\n\nI think Haemimont and Kalypso really need to get their act together, After that tremendous flop that was Omerta and now This.

You just complete a mission and boom automatic Colonial Era to 1920s to Cold War to Modern Times. The way they talked about the whole Eras was that it was going to be amazing and interesting, but what we got was nothing of the sorts. I do like the Tropico series but as always, it's now at the point of anything new is just going to be crap. Hopefully this is the end of series and they go on to something new or else make Tropico 6 over the top - I kind of personally hope for Tropico in Space or something, something a little different.

Where previous titles had fires break out, and a fire station to fight these, this was essentially cut from the game with few exceptions, and fire-fighting is provided by an upgrade to the police station. Where previous titles would give you a convincing degree of control over your economy & housing, here you may merely set a 'budget' slider that affects everything from quality to costs. Gone is the feeling that you can freely choose to give housing to the masses or expensive mansions to the rich -- or to go full-on far-left and build beautiful mansions for the unemployed. Gone too is the notion of having plentiful factions with their own ideals on your island, forcing you to make meaningful choices. The reduced amount of factions among your citizens never make you feel they are actual entities with their own agendas (a feeling prevalent in, say, the first Tropico).\nIt's truly telling that when you first start this game with a game controller connected, it makes you play with console-specific UI / menus / controls.\nLike in any The Sims title, all the content you're used to from the previous ones' DLCs is again gone, to let you await the opportunity to re-buy similar stuff when it gets released for the current game.\nBesides some mildly funny pop-culture references, the SP campaign is entirely forgettable and not worth playing.\nFor completionists, each major DLC adds 10 achievements to make it impossible to "100%" the game without buying all of the massively overpriced expansions.\n\n\nThe multiplayer, a first in the series, is what should make this game worth buying.\nIt is, however, full of bugs, glitches and design issues.\nThat they only added the option to save your game in multiplayer after release should be telling - the mode doesn't feel like it received any playtesting. Very often some form of desync occurs, which for whatever idiotic reasons disables the ability to save completely. If you don't manually save every 5 to 10 minutes, you will soon lose hours of progress to this (auto-saving exists only in SP).\nThe worst thing is that any player even just alt-tabbing from the game in borderless windowed mode, while you watch the game run normally in the background, seems to always cause an initially hidden desync. Soon you won't be able to save and then you find out that everybody has their own version of reality, with buildings complete/incomplete/destroyed, armies stuck in fields unable to move, and so on.\nSpeaking about armies, when playing cooperatively your armies help each other out -- but that always bugs up to get the combined Tropican Defense Force stuck at the place of their last engagement instead of letting them return to their bases, so in the mid to late game, you will have rebels in the south and all the army in the north, unable to get there before your buildings are annihilated... every single time. If you don't team up from the start, there are some diplomatic options, but they don't involve temporarily sending military aid to your friends -- you either accept the inevitable problems or can't help each other.\nInexplicably, things like removing roads just don't work properly in MP, and you will likely be stuck with any accidental constructions.\n\nKnowing Haemimont and Kalypso, none of this is bound to get fixed -- as an example, they and the equally inept AMD managed to break water rendering in the game with the 'Omega' graphics driver release in late 2014/early 2015, and neither side has managed to do anything to solve this in over half a year.\nEDIT: The AMD-specific water rendering issue was eventually largely fixed with a game update, but it still depends on the precise AMD driver you're running.\n\n\nI can't say the hours I spent with this game weren't to some degree jolly, but that was largely because it's "Tropico with multiplayer". As much as I conceptually enjoy this, I can't hide that the actual game is pretty bad compared to what you would expect (at the price point they charge also are entitled to expect).\nIf you are only interested in MP, you have no other choice. For anybody else, pretend Tropico 5 doesn't exist and play the much better (and much cheaper) predecessor(s) instead.\n\nP.S.: The game is a bit better with mods[www.tropicomodding.org].","July 4, 2015","false","93.8"," 68 of 91 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","68","91","5","11"

However, you can tell right off the bat that it was made for the purpose of selling DLC. It's lack of vanilla content compared to its predecessor's is almost outraging- that is unless you BUY DLC. And, even the buying of DLC would be fine with me, if all of it were not $4.00 each and so on. On that note, most of the $4.00 DLC come with only ONE new building, ONE new map, and ONE new quest. So remind me, why is it worth it to pay $4.00 for that? The vanilla game is fine enough, but seriously underdone. If you are looking for a good Tropico experience, play Tropico 4.

Unfortunately, a low population cap makes Tropico 5 unplayable by its second half.\n\nThe player will find his citizens emigrating en masse starting around the beginning of the Cold War, which will cause his economy to collapse.  Factories go unmanned, exports are never transported to the docks, expensive buildings are rendered useless by rolling blackouts as power plants run short on staff and fuel. Pulling people from entertainment and welfare buildings causes Happiness to plummet.  Hiring even illiterate foreign workers quickly becomes prohibitively expensive, and pointless, as they're likely to leave on the next transport.\n\nAs the population cap is invisible to the player, he may spend many frustrating hours trying to placate his citizens before he realizes it's nothing he's doing wrong.\n\nIn order to play successfully, one has to very consciously limit expansion from the start of the campaign onwards. (Unlike in previous installments, scenarios don't start with a blank slate; everything you've built in earlier eras is still there, although the money in your treasury, mysteriously, is not.)\n\nIn short, this game is essentially broken without mods.  I appreciate the detail, beauty and realism that Haemimont have added, but they are in no way worth the losses in gameplay.","November 19, 2014","false","38.9"," 115 of 168 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","115","168","3","0"

Half of the buildings from earlier versions have been removed (though the code has now been hacked and many are already prepared to be added back in as paid DLC content later) and nerfed a lot of existing stuff so you have to buy upgrade DLCs.  Mechanics have been dumbed down and sandbox mode is no longer the days of fun it used to be in previous Tropicos.  You quickly run out of stuff to build or achieve.  Almost all alternate building skins have been removed so every freakin' apartment or tenement, etc. looks identical.  No ability to create a custom, good looking island.  Heck, you can't even place trees anymore.\n\nIs it all bad?  No.  They added some new stuff like research and the "eras" that are positive.  At this point, though, I have to say DON'T BUY NOW.  Wait until the DLC is released and pick the whole thing up on a juicy Steam sale later this year.

But it is a huge step back from Tropico 4. Military plays a huge role in this game, and it is hard, nearly impossible to survive without one. And the issue is, unless you have conscription, your military will never fill up.\n\nYou start in the Colonial age, its neat, but the issue is, its lack luster. You get randomly attacked by corsairs, who totally destroy your army. They are too powerful, and attack way too early in game before you can even establish a military to fight them off.\n\nThen there's the World Wars, its cool too, but Military again, unless you have conscription, is nearly impossible to bring up. You get attacked by the army of invading militaries, and they, again, destroy your army due to some reason.\n\nI haven't gotten much to the Modern age and Cold Wars often, because I find myself quitting the game because my militaries keep getting destroyed. And This is on the easiest Difficulty, mind you.\n\nI like the features they aded but they need to tweak Rebels, Foreign invasions, uprisings, and coups before it can be enjoyabale again. They defeat your military too often, and you find yourself, despite having a nice 85+ approval raiting, losing the game.\n\nI can't suggest this game untill these issues are fixed.

Now, having owned both, I can truthfully say; that's not necessarily a bad thing. Should you get T4? Yes, it's a great game. Should you get T5? Yeah, it's also a great game. Why? Because they're both their own games. You'll find, as a gamer, you'll enjoy things more if you can appreciate what makes them unique instead of looking for new graphics for the same old game.\n\nTL;DR: Don't listen to the haters, El Presidente; your people need you. (Especially on sale)\n\nThis game takes you through Eras, not just a one and done Building Cycle, Governing Factions and Trade fluxuations. I swear, T4 was almost too easy with its Factions setup (at least for me). From foreign powers to local politics each Era has its own flavor of personal dealings, edicts and the like.\n\nThe game has controller support. Yeah, I like that. I stopped trying to create Powerpoint presentations on my PS4 and likewise stopped trying to play every game on my computer with a mouse and keyboard. It's the little things I appreciate. Like also how the different buildings have their own levels of investment to affect their production levels and managers you can hire to offer little bonuses.\n\nThe way the farms and mines lay out are much more user friendly in T5 as well. It's almost seamless checking between variant crops and ranches to their respective areas to see what would fit where best. The plantations show an accurate area usage for your consideration when placing them and the overall feel of the building options seems fluid.\n\nI personally enjoy the little stamps as the icons, I find that to be fitting to the theme of Tropico. I have no trouble knowing where the different sets of buildings are and their skins (especially as how they partain to the various eras) are vibrant and well drawn.\n\nThere's a fog of war on this game. Interesting use, you can send expeditions out there to find out what lies beyond. I like it. I like the exploration value instead of taking 5 minutes at the start of a map to see where literally everything is. There's more gaming aspects to this Tropico than there was to the last, more ways to enjoy the game besides finding new ways to make the same winning combination of goods and policies.\n\nBasically, if you wanna hate on a game, you can find a reason.

The only major difference is the military aspect with is absolutely loathsome and here is why:\n\n-You cannot control the units so you have to bunch all your military buildings together on the coasts.\n-There is no option to turn military or fog off\n-There is this fog that you have to use your military to explore the island but you have to pay 1000 dollars for every spot you want to explore, and you cannot really direct them either making it really costly just to see the whole island.\n-If your military isn't bunched up they will get slaughtered because they run up one at a time at the enemy, no matter if its a tank squad facing 2 infantry squads or not... pathetic\nIf you are going to add a military aspect then please just spend a little time to make it a plus and not a negative towards the experience.\n\n\nThis is not to mention the fact that they limit "Modding" in the steam library to making new maps and missions only.

I would have rather seen them working with one time period (like in Tropico 4), but giving it a lot of depth and attention.\n\nMultiplayer :The second big thing they added in Tropico 5 was multiplayer.\nYou can play with up to 4 friends in Tropico 5's multiplayer. The multiplayer is largely mission based, for example:\n>Who can earn the most tax money in 5 minutes\nor\n>Who can export 5000 canned fish first\nCompleting these objectives will give a player a point, and the first to 10 points will be the winner.\nIt's fun for a while but suffers from horrible server slowdowns from time to time, and can feel a bit repetitive.\n\nChances since Tropico 4 :Other than a few minor additions the game feels the same as Tropico 4, although Tropico 4 did a few things better.\nFor example, the Tropico 4 had a better singleplayer campaign.\nTropico 4's base game also had more content on release than Tropico 5 has (such as prisons), although they plan on adding additional content to Tropico 5 over coming months.\nThere were also visual improvements to the game, and the UI is nicer to look at.\n\nOverall the game offers enough to earn a true sequel status, but Tropico 4 is overall just a better product.\nI still recommend this game because it's still alot of fun to play.\n\nDeveloper : Haemimont Games\nPublisher : Kalypso Media Digital\nGenre : RPG, Simulatie, Strategie\nWebsite : http://www.tropico5.com\nReleased on Steam on : 23th of may 2014\nTropico 5 is also on : Xbox360 and Playstation 4\n\nFollow my Curator page :\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6858371/\nAlways do more research than just reading a review, to ensure that you get the right product.\n[sorry for any grammatical errors]\n\nThanks for reading!","March 30, 2015","true","45.0"," 152 of 241 people (63%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","63","152","241","11","5"

You might not realize all the political parody that defines Tropico. If you follow along with campaign narration and read the additional commentary tucked into the corners of the game, you will no doubt laugh at the subtle — and not so subtle — jabs at things like communism, capitalism, certain famous figures in history, and cultures that might be found in such a fictional place as Tropico. In Tropico 5, it only gets better as you, El Presidente, bring your island up from Colonial times, wedged between other superpowers, through all the familiar eras of our planet’s history.\n\nThe fun of this game comes from experimenting with the exact ways you can choose to run your little country. Seeing what you can get away with, or seeing just how happy and loyal you can make your citizens, is the real appeal of this game. Yes, you have to research new technology, make money with farming or mining etc., and construct housing for your citizens, but every one of those choices has its own weight on political aspects. You can construct churches to increase quality of housing in the area, but if you are an atheist country by your constitution, this may lower your approval rating. If your approval rating gets too low, you may not win the next election (if you have those), or a rebellion may threaten to overthrow your rule.\n\nOne thing you can do to help your situation is create a dynasty. Each ruler, the first being customized by you at the beginning of the game, has a special trait. Eventually, the game prompts you to find a new heir (by ridiculous means like a singing competition or thumb-wrestling match), and that new person will be selectable as a candidate for any election. Also, if you upset one of them too much by not siding with them on other trivial matters, they can rebel and try to overthrow you. You can also send them off to do special tasks like spy on an enemy faction or get a fancy degree to add merit to your regime. This is a really unique gameplay mechanic that I have not seen before, and your dynasty even carries over to multiplayer and sandbox modes. The game feels more robust with such a lasting element that can possibly produce much varying gameplay.\n\nAnother sneaky, new mechanic is your personal Swiss bank account. This is represented by two dollar signs in front of any amount that concerns your personal account. This is where you can really become a corrupt leader and laugh all the while. The purpose of this account is to get you out of tight spots in the campaign, or to level up your dynasty members. If you are lucky enough to discover a manager that siphons off a percentage of a building’s revenue to put into your account, saving up becomes easy.\n\nCombat is in Tropico 5, but to be honest it probably shouldn't be, at least not in this form. While almost everything else in the game feels smooth and refined, the battles are fiddly and tedious. When you're attacked, whether by a traitorous squad of rebels or by foreign powers, you'll see tiny squads pop up on the map. They'll head off to destroy your key structures, and whatever defences you possess, militia squads or your personal guard, will automatically rush over to ineffectually swat at them, often before waiting for backup. Pretty much all you can do at that point is sit back and wait to mop up the pieces.\n\nIt's not too much of a problem honestly, because larger combats generally only happen when you've lost control of the situation completely anyway. The smaller skirmishes, like the occasional uprising that happens if you irritate one of the game's factions too much, thankfully don't last too long. Combat is the game's most obvious weakness, but it doesn't soil the rest of Tropico 5.\n\nThe characters of Tropico are drawn in broad strokes, but the canvas they’re drawn on is broader. Everyone and everything is a caricature: your underling, Penultimo, is a dimwitted, unceasing bootlicker; capitalists and opportunists within your staff seethe with delight as they suggest profiting off other nations’ needs, while communist revolutionaries are naively passionate about their cause despite not knowing exactly what they’re fighting for. Entire political institutions are mocked; early in the single-player campaign, a Marxist reveals that the Russians are exporting the Communist Revolution as a buyable service.\n\nI won’t bother going through how the basics of a city builder work, as I think you understand most of it if you live in any civilization in real life. But I will say that they scope of Tropico 5, with the added intricacies of politics, makes this game much more fun and in-depth. That’s something other city sims don’t have.\n\nThe parody in particular is especially entertaining. Once you progress out of the colonial era, you get to hear the perky ramblings of a girl who manages a tavern called the Jolly Rodger, which I think is supposed to represent pirate radio and a public truth-teller you cannot control. She has something to say about almost every new milestone, and she makes sure to embarrass El Presidente any chance she gets, like when you hire surveillance to warn you of any new rebel leaders. The voice acting is top-notch, mainly because it’s so spirited and spot-on for whatever person is being parodied. I appreciate that in a city sim. After all, why build up a regular ol’ society when you could be building one that makes fun of things that have happened in our actual history?\n\nUnlike previous games in the series, Tropico 5 includes multiplayer modes - and while these function just fine, they feel like they're missing something. Up to four players can compete or cooperate in pursuing a number of objectives, and the fact that everyone shares the same island elevates the pressure in some interesting ways. If there’s an oil deposit between two dictators, the first person to build a road to that resource can claim it and expand their territory at the same time.\n\nIn a cooperative scenario, roads become friendly lifelines that players use to share teamsters or construction workers. The lack of an omnipresent scoreboard forces players to visually observe each other’s progress, but it also leaves them data-starved. Regardless of the mode or objective, players still need to tend to all of the responsibilities of a single-player game, which pile up fast. The lack of chrono controls, while inevitable, muddles the series’ traditionally relaxed atmosphere, and most players will eventually turn back to single player in order get the true Tropico experience.\n\nVisually, this game is stunning. On high specs it looks beautiful and the effects like wind and waves are really nice. A lot of detail is gone into the look of the game. Which is probably why the developers have opted for a hollow grid look for the best areas to place buildings as opposed to the filled in grid that came before. I really didn’t like this, it makes it far more difficult to read the lay of the land. This is about the only thing in the game I really didn’t like.\n\nFives games in and the Tropico series has really found its feet, creating a cheery and relaxing ambience that sets it quite apart from other city-builders out there. From the music to the bright and colourful graphics and the irreverent wit of your various staff, it’s got a very unique character that makes the simple gameplay very addictive. Okay, so it holds your hand a little too much, and combat is a bit dull, but it’s certainly the high point of the series so far. A very good city management and political strategy game that’s got a relaxed attitude quite unlike anything else out there.","April 12","true","64.2"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","28","34","3","1"

There is less of everything - including building models, music or customization options - compared even to Tropico 4 without any expansions and DLCs. Quality of the existing content also seems actually worse than in the previous installation.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it seems more shallow. I'm not sure how happiness translates into popular support, because even with my Tropicans being pretty unhappy I never had problems with winning elections without fixing votes. You can rake serious debt without any repercussions and, with the amount of resources on the average island, it's easy to make obscene amounts of money without trying too much.\n\nThe new features are underwhelming. The consecutive eras don't change much except building models and the amount of available buildings and technologies. The only exception is the Colonial Era - you advance by converting people from Royalist to Independence faction. This sounds like fun but actually isn't - most of the buildings, edicts and other game features are locked, so you pretty much build the same thing several times and pray that the game lets you pass to its more interesting part before the time limit expires.\n\nThe family system also disappoints. From time to time, you get an another inhabitant of the island who happens to have the same last name as El Presidente. They can be sent to manage a building and may be useful during some events - and that's pretty much it. You can also let them run in elections instead of you, but you usually don't want to do that - most likely, your current president is more experienced anyway.\n\nTo sum it all up - Tropico 4 is simply better than its supposed successor.","May 24, 2014","false","12.6"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","43","61","0","2"

It spends more time talking about basic building mechanics than explaining how any of the metrics of citizen happiness and values work.   It basically just mentions that they exist and that they affect your popularity with the citizens. It doesn't explain how far the numerous "nearby" bonuses extend, It doesn't explain how to get useful information from the statistic tracking almanac.  Most of what I know of the mechanics of the game I got from reading guides.\nThe other main issue is that the citizen AI makes almost no sense whatsoever in its decision making.\nMy current island has 100s of homeless and jobless people despite there being more than enough houses and jobs for everyone.  I have homeless people who work in the nuclear power plant and jobless people who live, also homeless, next to open entry level jobs.  I have open college and high school level jobs and virtually nobody in either school.  I have dozens of farms and several food imports but citizens starving regularily.   I have quadrupled the number of couriers in the city but I still dont have materials and goods moving anywhere.\nThese issues and the happiness meters they reflect upon are so nonsensicle that I am convinced they have a randomized element to them.\nI have heard that these issues are almost entirely fixed in one of the DLCs but that's arguably even worse because it means that they are effectively holding the functional game hostage for another $5.\nAvoid this game","May 7","false","23.0"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","29","39","3","7"

Character customisation (to the extent it was present in Tropico 4)\n4. The ability to be a brutal Dictator, and stay in power\n5. Decent Political system\n6. The ability to sdjust wages, and rents on residences, in the same way as was possible in Tropico 4 (Only the simplified budget mechanic is there)\n7. The ability to play as famous figures from the period\n8. The ability to actually choose you characters name\n9. Cool DLC (As opposed to crappy cash grab DLC)\n10. Good Music (In my opinion the music in this is worse than in Tropico 4)\n11. A wide selection of buildings (there is a similar number of buildings, despite the fact that Tropico 4 takes place over 50 years and Tropico 5 over around 100)\n\nWhat Tropico 5 has over Tropico 4\n1. Multiplayer\n2. Tanks, Military Aircraft and APC's (Although you need DLC to get APC's despite the fact they can be seen driving around in the main menu on the base game.

The graphics are solid this time around. They have a much more polished feel over the others. The musics always solid and you can import your own into the game without much effort.\n\nWith that being said I'll go into a few negatives. With this one you really do want all of the DLC as too much was withheld from the base game. Once you have everything it's a beauty.This time around you can't zoom out as far as previous versions. There is a script available to undo this but it doesn't work in multiplayer. So now they have multiplayer but it desyncs often which ruins the match. It's definitely playable but there aren't many people online. It helps to know someone with the game if you want all of the achievements because several are tied to multiplayer. I've been trying for a long time to get the final 3 I have left. At least they have it which is a step in the right direction. Then they removed some of El Presidente's previous features. Now you can't follow him around or engage in a shootout. Instead it's all about dynasty members which would be fine... if they let me follow them around, give my speeches, and shoot up the enemy. They must undo this in the next one as it removes part of the charm. I'll also argue that they made it way too difficult to be a ruthless dictator. You'll make money hand over fist being a swell guy, but if you so much as look in the other direction you're going to have a military mutiny. It doesn't matter how well prepared you are for your own troops toppling you. Sure, you deserved it but I invite you to try running a North Korean style of government on this game. You might even find yourself in awe of what that dictatorship has accomplished. It probably is more realistic in that regard but it's also almost impossible since most of the features that could make it a reality aren't available until much later in the game.\n\nThere is so much to this game that I am overwhelmed by attempting to describe the positives. Teamsters and construction workers are no longer an achilles heal. The army doesn't wander off during a crucial battle. Traffic jams are no longer an issue whatsoever. Parking garages and metros have been nerfed to the point that there doesn't seem to be a penalty for not having them at all. I'd argue that they went too far but micro managing roads was annoying. The military additions, the espionage, industries, trade, and so on are all well done. You have people flying rocket powered gliders all over the place, blimps, airlines, and so on. It's no longer just micro managing a banana republic and more like you're running a western power. I'm really interested to see what they will do with Tropico 6. I hope they add more wildlife as they removed a bit too much this time, give us back control over El Presidente, and work on the different forms of government. If they do those simple things I'll be happy.\n\nI will place the script to edit music into the game as well as the camera zoom into the comments section.","March 27","true","173.4"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","2"

Kalypso servers are not able to withstand the release overloads which is pathetic. We all know that when a game first comes out with a fresh multiplayer idea that nearly all purchasers are going to want to try it out, but kalypso managed to completely oversee this meaning they had to completely shut down the servers to reboot them, and then put a limit on the number of connections because they didn't dedicate enough space.

I go to the forums, and other people are having the same issue. There's a workaround, but it's not working for everyone. And there's no official response from the developers on when or if they intend on fixing it. Other heavily advertised features of the game, such as Multiplayer, are locking up on players frequently. Oh, and it doesn't have a save functioon, so even if they do happen to make it some ways into the game, they gotta start from scratch if they have to leave. Still others complain that the game won't even start. Again, there are workarounds, but it should not be incumbent upon the consumer to find fixes for a "finished" game that was just so recently released.\n\nNew games have bugs, I get it. I can understand the traffic glitch that forces your teamsters to get stuck, unable to transport  commodities to the docks for export and causing your economy to plunge. That's annoying, but it's an easy fix in game once you recognize it. I cna understand how trade ships might just magically disappear from your inventory, preventing you from utilizing them. Annoying, but you still at least have trade ships, and the computer freighters still come to export, so that's more of a minor inconvenience. I can even forgive them for forcing you to accept new immigrants at a steady speed even when you've indicated in your Constitution that the borders will be closed.\n\nBut I can not understand how the developers decided it a releaseable product when players are unable to complete Sandbox missions because the game doesn't register that they've accomplished the primary objective on the mission. Or how they determined a final release should have a game breaking bug, the likes of which I haven't seen in a game of this budget since Big Rigs. I guess a 30% success rate on multiplayer matches making it through era changes was high enough by Kalypso's standards. And maybe that's why they didn't figure the mode needed saves; because no one makes it far enough.\n\nI want to recommend this game. It's got good potential; even though they reduced the total amount of buildings, and therefore functionality, from previous Tropicos; or put a heavier emphasis on the military's role without expanding on the mechanics behind the military units, forcing you to watch the horribly programmed AI duke it out and hope that your side wins.\n\nBut at its current stage, I can not and will not recommend this unfinished garbage to anyone.","May 28, 2014","false","32.0"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

A slight graphical upgrade, but less content and virtually every new feature has an incredibly irritating dark side. The eras system essentially locks off 3/4 of the game's content for no justification and makes your old building redundant. Politics has been dumbed down in the extreme, making pleasing factions essentially a random process. Trading route economics means tedious micromanagement. The greater military focus means huge outlays for rebels that cannot seemingly be appeased or defeated, constant battles with seemingly random outcomes and incredibly important upgrades hidden in rarely-accessed menus. The campaign's focus on four islands means a nice sense of investment, but as every mission has to be playable on one of two choices, say hello to incredibly bland islands with pretty much every resource - and sod if you can guess which island would be best to play the subsequent mission in each era on, because you can't play more than one mission in each era per island.","July 24, 2015","false","16.9"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It's a little late, but a very welcome update which makes the base game well worth getting, especially if it's on a sale.\n\nTropico 5 uses a new engine and completely remade graphics, unlike Tropico 4 which simply expanded on Tropico 3. This being said, your old tricks and tactics won't work, so you will get a fresh new experience from playing this.\n\nPros:\n+new eras feature allows you to advance and rule through time: colonial era, the World Wars , the Cold War and Modern Times, each era has different foreign nations, factions and availible buildings and edicts\n+new combat system gives you more control over the defense of your buildings\n+new research feature\n+new trade route feature allowing you to manage specific imports and exports, which also affects your foreign relations\n+the ability to form your own dynasty, which can be involved in certain missions\n+new policies feature allows you to declare and decide laws on your island, giving you freedom of choice over your method of ruling it\n+continous campaign system which allows you to pick and carry over your old islands over several missions\n+competitive and cooperative multiplayer\n+ingame radio is still as enjoyable as it was in the older games, complete with soundtrack and radio host which comments on island events\n+the ability to make custom sandbox maps and missions\n\nCons:\n-the new combat system sometimes takes unoptimal routes, and in multiplayer it is very easy for a player to quick-build military buildings and rush the opponent\n-campaign lacks an actual challenge\n-the competitive multiplayer component is entirely reliant on luck and map placement, rather than skill\n-fewer actors and faction representatives than in Tropico 4\n-fewer buildings and building models than in Tropico 4 (all the missing buildings were either useless or served the same function as other better alternatives, so this is only aesthetically damaging)\n-the same cheap DLC marketing method\n\nConclusion:\nThe base game is worth getting now, at least during sales. The DLCs, however, still don't offer enough, so I'd advise you to avoid those, or get them during a big sale.\nThe mission editor (through steam workshop) will offer you great, near infinite replayability, for as long as people keep playing and making scenarios. But you can't just expect custom missions to magically appear, so I encourage you to try your hand at making a mission once you finish the main campaign!\nI will go do that right now.","July 24, 2015","true","223.5"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","23","34","0","1"

Yes, it actually gave me a few hours of fun before it dried out.\n\nDo I recommend this above any other city builder? Not at all.\n\nI have enjoyed playing both Tropico 3 and 4, not because of the unbelievably easy AI as seen in 5, but because of the ability to control my city and fix its problems. Tropico 5 not only shields you from changing your laws in less than 28 months, but linearly guides you on what to build next. In previous titles, missions were an optional thing that you could participate in, depending on the mission. But, in Tropico 5, say the communists want you to build them a row of 15 houses; you now have to option to cancel the mission, causing the communists to hate you literally for the entire game, OR, you can go into national debt by building the houses, and have a nice little +1 boost to happiness.\n\nThis prevents players from building the island nation of their dreams, and instead they get a moshpit of infighting communists, capitalists, and acoholic religious zealots. But, don't worry, you can fix the opinions of EVERYBODY for the new DLC called Waterborne, at the low cost of $40! You get off-shore oil derricks for the capitalists, more coastal homes for the commies, and the religious--well, you can get alongside a future character creator expansion for only $15.\n\nSeriously, though; every month it seems that features that should have been in the game already are released as DLC bundles. If you look closely, you can see that, in the time of the game's original release, it was coded so that future DLCs would plug right in; before the off-shore oil derricks, we had off-shore oil deopsits visible. Why? Because monehs.\n\nThe game with every DLC is a good game, but until Kalypso stops dicing off features and putting on a price tag for all of them, do NOT buy this. My final verdict is a petty 3/10.\n\n5/24/2015 Edit:\n\nI finally came back to the game to see if they had added anything in new patches; all I got was four new DLC's. Expect Tropico 6 to be even sketchier; maybe we will have a one-time 10 population boost for the price of a $5 gem pack.\n\nEverybody, go home, back to Tropico 4; this was a bust.\n\n6/4/2015 Edit:\n\nI laughed this morning when I opened Steam to find Kalypso gave me the Green DLC for free.\n\nI now completely change my mind about this game and the developers, they are so generous by giving me their cheapest DLC for free. 11/10 would be bribed again","January 12, 2015","false","23.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","14","18","5","1"

These are just some of the things you can do in the previous game and are still present in 5.\n\nBut Tropico 5 changed in different ways, military became much more critical, forces are stronger thus stronger defense is required. Trade routes can be chosen and relations with foreign countries' relations affect these. You progress through time and things change even more than Modern Times DLC in 4. Housing is more interconnected with job salary and sometimes you experience problems but don't know the details until you see a detail that changes your prespective. The game provides a bigger mirror to the perspective of a dictator, things need to be watched more often and closely, you must be prepared and at the same time be able to adapt to the situations you must be watchful of such as civil unrest and the end of WWII.\n\nEverything got more difficult, more complex, in some cases worse than 4, I miss the old Penultimo, I missing allowing no rent to all residentials, I miss the diverse set of characters and more. But 5 had some things I really liked, the campaign was something I didn't expect and loved, the fact that you make your island grow and don't abandon it at the end of the episode makes you see how difficult it gets to run a country the longer it stays alive. You have multiplayer (which sucked earlier on until some updates) where you cooperate or kill each other with armies and resources. Military played a bigger role, both a good thing and a bad thing because I didn't give a damn about it til 5.\n\nBottomline, Tropico 5 is like a more difficult version of 4, things need to be watched more often as the threat level of everything got more critical such as rebels, civil unrest and pirates and the campaign requires you to realize that you are NOT going to abandon your country and ALL problems you experience now WILL happen into the future unless YOU fix it while you can. Tropico 5 is a great game and I value it as I value 4 but in different ways.\n\nIf you've played Tropico 4 and loved it as it is and don't want things to change, then stick with it. If you value a bigger challenge, a more complex way of playing it, a chance to compete with other dictators (heads up, few people go online anymore so find a friend) and to realize how difficult it is to manage your own lil island then go buy this, hell it's Steam anyway.

The historical period of this game ranges from the colonial era to its modern counterpart. For each period there is one or two particular types of economic activities that are lucrative and beneficial. You always have to change your construction plan over time. For example, in the Colonial Era, plantations and ranches generate money but as the time passes on you can't count on those to fight the Great War. After the Cold War the space program and internet become crucial as well.\nIt is not only a city construction simulation but a political one as well. You are the sole policymaker. You have to consider all aspects of your nation in terms of policymaking. Should I reduce the wages of the poor to gain public support? Should I use martial law to secure the position of my dynasty?

Unfortunately, you're going to bang your head against the concrete, because it just isn't that deep.  Verterans of Tropico 4, in particular, are going to find themselves looking for things that just aren't there.  Minor spoilers below:\n\nPros: Tropico 5 sports some upgraded graphics and a couple of new game mechanics that work fairly well.  The timeline is expanded, and the game's main campaign does a decent job of fostering a sense of "era" and moving through history in a way that earlier installments in the series did not.  El Presidente now gets his/her own Dynasty, and the player has the option of training and leveling up several characters with different skill sets.  Any of these characters can be El Prez, while the others can be tasked as Managers to improve the efficiencies of buildings.\n\nCons: Despite the upgraded graphics, Tropico 5 is just missing a lot of customization options that were taken for granted in 4.  Almost no building in the game has an alternate look, so housing blocks tend to look generic.  The decorative options are also fewer, and look much more "cardboard" when compared to Tropico 4's decorations.  Many building types have also been combined in ways that don't make sense.  I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out where the option to build a fire station was, only to find out this was an "upgrade" for my police station.\n\nTrade in Tropico 5 doesn't make much sense, period.  You can "trade" resources continually, but to get better prices for goods, you need a trade ship, which you obtain one at a time by building a dock.  Want 5 trade ships?  Build 5 docks.  The trade system scales poorly, has little information provided by the game HUD, and requires a fair amount of micormanagement.\n\nThe character development and voice acting have definitely taken a big step down.  While Penultimo is reasonaby well done, the other characters in the story line are either flat or overdone.  The faction leaders from prior games (Sunny, Reverend Esteban, etc) are nowhere to be seen and there is no commentary to replace them.  If you want to know how a particular faction is feeling, you will find yourself constantly digging through the menus to do it.\n\n\nFor veterans of Tropico 4 looking for a few hours of fun, pick this up when it goes on sale.  If you're new to the series, just go pick up Tropico 4 and skip this one.\n\n","June 14, 2014","false","35.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

The game looks better but you certainly don't feel like you have the freedom to be a true dictator (fewer personality characteristics, PAINFULLY dumbed-down almanac, dumbed-down economic system, dumbed-down faction system, not enough edicts, etc.). It seems like they also brought alot of half-baked concepts into this game (research, trade, constitution,  etc. - all good ideas) whereas maybe they should have focused on just one of those concepts and made it really decent. What happened to our pre-election speeches? (We need MORE of those types of things).\n\nIt's almost as if the game is under new mangement and that the management is out of touch with what has made the game such a great hit - we don't care so much about what El Presidente looks like, we want more gameplay freedom.We care about having a wider range of political and economic options so that we can tweak and abuse our little island nation for our purposes! Why can't we specifically control wages or rent prices anymore - what if I want a farmer to make twice as much as a doctor?\n\nAs a fan of the franchise, I feel like #5 has simply taken several steps in the wrong direction - we needed a political and economic system that had even greater depth, not much, much less. It seems like the developers are getting carried away with the looks and zaniness of the game rather than the original concept of the game - that in which a control-freak dictator can run his island nation however he likes, with an endless array of customizable methods on how to do just that! Think Tropico 3 and 4 but with an even  greater range of economic and political freedom and abilities - we can't even place trees, fountains or intimidating statues anymore...\n\nOverall, a 4/10 - a beautiful game but not nearly the political and economic game it once was. I do like the addition of tanks, though. Also, the concept of trade deals is a good one but still seems not completely thought-out. I will be sticking with previous versions of the game to satisfy future dictatorial urges...I hope the franchise makes a 180 for the next release. Instead of making a good model even better, they seem to have tried to renovate the franchise, which, to me, is undermining what has made the franchise so good. I recommend it to those who are new to the franchise, but would further recommend previous versions.","June 9, 2014","false","31.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

Well I wish there had been a "maybe".\nBecause if you haven't played the series before and like City Builders, I'd absolutely\nrecommend it: nice graphics, game design, sounds and music, lots to do, user-friendly interface\nand with a political and historical aspect to it.\n\nOn the other hand, as for myself, who have played the series from the start -\nit's a waste of money - really. A lot of great features - like many buildings and edicts has been\nremoved and replaced with others. In fact - edicts, witch I find the most enjoyable in Tropico,\nare much fewer in Tropico 5 - sadly. The historical aspect, where you go through Colonial, World Wars, Cold Wars and Modern Times, at first sounds interesting - but fact is, in ruins the free gameplay totally, and will in a few weeks time (if not days), feel extremely repetitive.\nBecause you can only buy buildings in specific historical times and when you have researched many of them. I want to play a sandbox game where I have the most freedom to build my\nTropico "paradise" with only money and some resources hindering me in doing just that.\nI don't want to be controlled be a game developer dictatorship - I'm the DICTATOR!\nSo stick with Tropico 3 or 4 - if you already have one of these - you won't get much new here,\nand the new stuff in Tropico 5 will ONLY annoy you.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOff the record and not very hush-hush:\nIn general (Tropico 5 being the sum of that) I simply don't understand what game developers,\nare thinking about when they make a game. Do they actually play the games themselves?\nI can hardly believe that - why would you put in stuff that are extremely annoying? And remove\nprevious great features? It doesn't make any sense. And do they not read and listen to what\ntheir game communities says or wishes? And what about game testers? Do they actually listen\nto them? Or do they get the wrong people to test the games?\nBut of course - if it's only about making money, it's a clever idea, to make half a decent game,\nthem you'll have an excuse to make yet another game (read: update)\nto correct the annoying things, that people don't like and put in new annoying things\n- that way you can keep a series going on for as long as you want.\nEA being another perfect example of that.

A long answer will be hell no.\n\nTropico 5 is built on what made the tropico series great. City building and controlling your island as El President is addictive. All that you loved from the older games you will find here as well. However Tropico 5 is bringing a lot of new things to the series.\n\nIn the older games, you could find a balance and then you would NEVER have any kind of problems again with money, well Tropico 5 skull ♥♥♥♥s that and makes you work for it. Just as you think, “Ah ! I finally figured out how to keep my money in plus”, you will go in huge minus due to one of the many random events.\n\nThe interface and gameplay in many ways will make you feel like home. But all the new things will toss you a curve ball all the time and keep you on your toes, I had to play the last mission 6 times in a row (Yea ! I'm not kidding, 6 freaking times) to even understand what I did wrong and to finally beat it. In the other Tropicos this would never have happened.\n\nThe graphics are brilliant as well as the humor. Lets not forget that there is MULTIPLAYER.

The trade-off? A family-structure called 'dynasties' which doesn't actually affect the gameplay much, a minor graphics upgrade... and some very very pretty loading screens. Now I understand why this game feels emptier than its predecessors; updates. They are 'updating' this game as they go. Whilst this may seem like a boon; a gift; a nice thing they are doing, the fact is that the game I paid for was not worth the money if you owned previous iterations. This is not labelled as a Greenlight or Early Access game, but compared with previous Tropico games that is what it feels like. Perhaps Tropico 5 will become even better than past iterations, eventually, but with this sad precedent the company have screwed themselves. I will not bother paying release price for their games again, and I highly recommend that you do not either, Ignore this game for  another 6 months, and maybe they will update it enough to be worth the price tag. But whatever you do, don't pay the full £35.","December 28, 2014","false","52.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The research system is very boring, rather then letting you unlock differant bonuses to buildings and improve the things you have.. it's just a system to ever so slowly dole out the same buildings you had in tropico 4, The Voice actors were universaly bad, the comments didn't seem as witty, Much of the customization from building to building that the earlier games had was striped out nearly entirely.. as was the customization for your ruler. rather then dozens of "perks" flaws and other attributes to pick from and play with, you get to select one of like six. the dynasty system also is as pointless as boring. despite what they hinted it prerelease.. you don't age and die and have to be replaced by one of your family.. you just put a differant perk on each "tool" and elect the one that currently best fits what you want. not that the abilities matter a great deal. Decorative items have been stripped out so no more creating visualy pleasing cities. nor can you jail criminals. All and all the game feels like Tropico 4, if it had been lengthened out in size, and stripped of a fair ammount of content to "streamline it." I was disipointed by the game.  im sure a flood of DLC will be coming to slowly rectify the situation. but unlike with tropico 4 I don't feel the urge to buy it.. honestly I felt like one of the Factory Farm livestock from it. shoved in a small pen and shoveled this "Corn" to make them money.","May 24, 2014","false","161.8"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","17","27","0","0"

In Tropico 4, one would always start fresh with each campaign mission. In Tropico 5, the island is carried over between missions. There are benefits to this, but it changes the way the player plays the game. There are buildings the player might want to put near the coast that aren't available until later missions, but it's quite likely the coast will already be well developed by the time those buildings can be built. This forces the player to build akwardly, with future additions in mind, to demolish what are in many cases expensive buildings to make room for new ones, or to simply learn to live with a less-than-ideal situation that will penalize them moving forward.\n\nMany of the interface changes between 4 and 5 seem to make it more difficult to access information rather than easier. There seem to be fewer useful overlays and the overlay can be very difficult to read. Some buildings or building upgrades have an effective radius that can't be viewed, leaving the player guessing. It's still very difficult to easily see what areas are being served by which service buildings. The interface changed from 4 to 5, but that really seems to be the extent of it. It wasn't improved in any significant way. It's just different.\n\nThere are good points to the new game as well. Features I would be excited about if the rest of the game didn't feel clumsy. The introduction of research, upgrades and building managers are all interesting features. Greater variety in the military is also very interesting, though the military itself is clumsy to use and combat can be rather infuriating. There are some clever additions made in this iteration that might see better development in a sequel.\n\nThe core gameplay of Tropico is still there, so some may enjoy this. First time players may not find as much fault with the game. Personally, i'll hold out hope that (the likely inevitably sequel) Tropico 6 will fine tune things and simply be a better game on whole.","March 22, 2015","false","8.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

The country had a large population, estimated to be around 100 civilians. Everyday El Presidente would randomly order his troops to attack random citizens in order to create lolz on his bland island. For some reasons tourism is very popular on Tropico despite the random mass-murders, an extreme lack of liberty and complete corruption of the government. So far every attempted invasion on Tropico failed due to the extensive defense system of guard towers.

To anyone? Even my most hated enemies? No. That's the answer to all of the preceeding questions. Why, you ask? Now that's an answer that's more elaborate.\n\nTropico is fun, don't get me wrong, but the fun you have with Tropico is the kinda fun you have while drunk or stoned. The kinda fun you have looking at a picture of a badger. It's not fun by sober standards, but when you're smoked outta your skull, it's hilarious.\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that you pretty much need to be smashed or high to find Tropico thoroughly enjoyable. Unlike actually GOOD city-builder games, like SimCity 4, Cities: Skylines or hell, even Banished, you have ZERO control over ANYTHING in Tropico. You can build stuff. Whoop-dee-♥♥♥♥♥ety-doo. That is IT. That's ALL you get to do in Tropico.\n\nEnemies invading your turf? Your soldiers'll take care of that automatically. Built a new cluster of nice mansions and want to keep your elite soldiers away from living in them? Sorry, schmuck, but you can't do that. Want to make sure that your precious and EXTREMELY FINITE iron makes it to your weapons factories instead-a just getting exported for a shïte sum of pennies and dimes? BZZT! Wrong answer! You're not allowed to suspend exports either.\n\nSimply put, you can't control ANYTHING in Tropico, and that INEVITABLY leads to disastrous results. Maybe not this month, maybe not this year, but eventually, you'll run out of iron for your weapons factories or crude oil for your refineries, and your high-end exportation will come to a grinding halt because you simply can't tell your ♥♥♥♥♥twäts of a population to göddämn STOP SELLING SHÏT FOR TINY SUMS OF CASH.\n\nIronically, many people laud this game for its simplicity. Those people are idiots. A city-building game should NEVER, EVER, sacrifice control for ease-of-use. Cities: Skylines is a good example of how to strike a decent-enough balance between simple-to-play without shaving off player control to an absolute minimum.\n\nSo, to summarize: would I recommend this game? No. I would not. It's not worth even one FRACTION of the asking price on Steam, and the DLC-whöring? Yeah, no, that shït's not gonna fly with me. Simply put, this game series peaked with #4, and it rapidly went downhill with #5. It's not worth buying, not even for 0.99, and it's barely worth playing at all. Avoid it. 2.3/10","July 23, 2015","false","29.7"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","22","37","0","1"

The characters you'll come to either love or dislike , I however never got tired of Penulitimo's comments or Lord Oaksworth's trails.\n\nFor the most part this game made me feel like I could actually achieve something by building a settlement and attempting to set it up right and in the most efficient way possible, something that Simcity 5 couldnt really achieve, or at least not very well.\nWhile Simcity didnt do a terrible job at creating your own settlement, there were no actual problems or issues with money or power politically at all after completing your city, effectively making your only problem at that point the efficiency and placement of buildings, or the bugs inscripted in the game itself which rendered a problem unsolveable.\nTropico 5 puts you in control of everything as the ''President For Life'', as a Roman ruler once said, for production of all goods and foods, public buildings, the army, and social and constitutional matters.  Stuff up and fail to get the support of your people, and your time as El Presidente could well be up with military coups, rebel attackers, major powers invading your island (if you get them really peeved), or an annoying combination of two of these issues, OR the simple fact the you should have cheated or cheated harder in the elections.\nSimcity was lacking this redeeming feature of actually trying to hold onto power, and after a decade you were basically done in that city alone (even though the game controls said otherwise).\n\nI am a bit disappointed with the emptyness of multiplayer rooms and hearing that it had problems early on also didnt help its reputation either.\nI'm also not happy with the news of a hacker who managed to figure out that for future DLC's, money will be required for most, if not all 10 future DLC's over the next year or so.\nMost of the DLC's did nothing for Simcity, and actually didn't add much for the game except visual appeal, so I hope that these DLC's either aren't useless or will be free and useful at some point.\nAnother complaint would be at the achievements.  Some seem too easy to get, while others might take along time to figure out and be able to complete.  Not as much of a biggie, but just something to keep in mind if DLC's factor into future achievements.\n\nThe biggest complaint I would have however would be the seemingly inefficiency the infustructure buildings get by the modern era/age, seriously, it gets pretty annoying once you hit a population of 1000 and truck offices are everywhere and arent seemingly doing a lot.  I just dont get it, if you get stuffed over by this, then you could be stuck in negative bank numbers, and mostly the only way to solve a problem in this game is to throw money at it, and without exporting goods which seem to stock up in the production buildings being delivered to the docks (because the trucks aren't working for some reason), you've basically signed your defeat, and woe to you if its near an election or popularity is taking a hit and the people want change!\n\nIf you brought Tropico 4, then its a question of if you want spend the money on this one, but from what I've seen its a great overhall of the old game which might only do a few things better (and possibly worse) than its elder.\n\nOverall, fantastic game, I would recommend to anyone interested in town planner games or political-type strategy with building elements, as while becomes harder to manage in the future ages, is actually rewarding in the end and might teach you some lessons along the way, if not the occassional laugh at Penultimo.\nThis game I hope won't finish here, as the developers are capable of achieving much more and adding some more layers on this cake.\nThe music is pretty cool also, wouldn't mind seeing some more music tracks in the future though!","July 14, 2014","true","30.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've been a fan of the series who followed every release back to the original Tropico, and in the week leading up to the Tropico 5 release (of which I pre-ordered a 4-pack) I replayed Tropico 2 : Pirate's Cove through for about the 30th time. Old graphics, a few annoying design flaws, but even in 2014 still a spectacularly fun game, just like Tropico 1, Tropico 3, and Tropico 4... but not Tropico 5. For the first time in the history of the Tropico series we've got a new Tropico game released that is not only not a fun game, it isn't even a Tropico game. Packed with bad design decisions, content compromises, and maddeningly simplified with console limitations/mainstream stupidity in mind, for the first time in Tropican history we've got a game that can't be fixed with patches because the base game is so incredibly, irreparably broken. Tropico 5 is a corporate "game-by-committee" insult to each and every fan of both Poptop's original Tropico creation and Heinimont's mostly-faithful torch-bearing continuation of the series since then. It's a bad game, badly designed, falsely advertised, and will never become a proper Tropico game without a complete overhaul of every design mechanic of the strategy gameplay.\n\nLet's begin with the interface. Gone is the functional and useful interface we all know and love, with the traditional Tropico feel, intuitive layout, plenty of options, and helpful tooltip popups for every sub-menu or screen. The layout for Tropico 5 is much simpler, missing many important screens, with less information on every screen, and with almost no tooltip popups on any screen. Building upgrades no longer have any graphical representation, and the upgrades aren't located on the primary building screen, so you're forced to tediously check every single upgradeable building on your island with 2 mouse clicks on parts of the screen that are never near each other. This is unforgivably tedious and by itself makes the micromanagement of Tropico 5 unbearable beyond words, especially considering that buildings freshly built or destroyed in disasters revert to the default settings, necessitating constant micromanagement of every single building on the island.\n\nWhat about the lack of content? Tropico 5 advertises, even to date, "Choose from over 100 buildings from each of the individual eras." This is false advertising. Counting all the buildings up I can only come up with 91 total, and that includes every building from all the eras. Maybe campaign mode has a few unique buildings used only in the campaign, but I never saw any, and even then there's no way to get "over 100 buildings from each of the individual eras." I count 91 buildings in Tropico 5 and 117 in Tropico 4, so this is simply false advertising. No way around it. Furthermore, every Tropico fan who owns Tropico 5 will be quick to tell you why they lied about it: tons and tons of vital and important buildings and even building types are missing from Tropico 5. Take just one example: Prisons. In Tropico 4 you had Jail, Labor Camp, and you could turn the colonial fort into a dungeon for your personal dictatorship needs. Tropico 5 has no prisons or even a concept of jail. You cannot arrest anyone in Tropico 5. Crime is reduced to an overlay and a happiness number, and occasionally you see Crime Lord characters appear in the game that you can have a marginal interaction with. By marginal, I mean Bribe, Banish, Kill, or Discredit, the same 4 actions you have available for you to deal with every single island inhabitant in the game. To quote someone from the forum, "How does El Presidente run a dictatorship without prisons?" To heavily belabor this point, what about salt mines, fire stations, radio stations, wind power, solar power, and condos? "How does El Presidente run an island paradise without condos?" Why is there only one type of restaurant, "Restaurant", when Tropico 4 had "Restaurant", "Gourmet Restaurant", "Ship-O-Rant", and "Cosmic Pin", all of which were better rendered, described, and implemented?\n\nThis brings me to the graphics of Tropico 5, the major selling point of the game, yet still underwhelming and poorly implemented. Tropico 5 requires DX11 for reasons that I can only describe as dishonest. It doesn't need DX11 or any of the hardware functions implemented therein, and the official excuse for the requirement, and I directly quote from the official Tropico 5 Steam forum, "The game and engine were redesigned from scratch as was requested by many players", simply does not hold water. Tropico 5 is coming to XBOX360 soon, an old console that is only DX9 slightly extended, and in such context the publisher/developer excuse can be clearly viewed as PR nonsense meant to cover up the fact that Tropico 5 is a functional disaster. The graphics aren't very good, there are only a few high end features added on near the end of the development cycle purely for marketing window dressing, and tessellation, if implemented, has been implemented so poorly that it renders the overall graphic package functionally of a lower quality than Tropico 4. HBAO/SSAO simply can't cover up bad design, and forcing the DX11 requirement on top of the substandard graphics is just insulting.\n\nThe biggest success of the Tropico series was always in the gameplay, and the gameplay is where Tropico 5 fails the most spectacularly. To understand the level of failure you have to understand how previous Tropico games were successful. In Tropico 1/3/4 you started with a few people, a palace, a couple farms, maybe a tenement, and a blank slate to design a society. If you wanted a peasant serfdom that you ruled through fear of your military might you had many avenues through which to engineer this society, any the effectiveness of your approach was purely determined by how well you engineered your economy, balanced competing concerns, and reacted to changing circumstances. As one example, you could focus on mining, pay the miners/police/military high wages, and give the finger to everyone else, dominating and controlling their lives through fear, imprisonment, labor camps, many detailed and useful edicts, and even through pathing and placement of buildings (indeed, in Tropico 2 the latter is essential for accomplishing ANYTHING). Now what can you do? The budget tool replaces rent/wages/cost and a lot more, and since it only has 5 positions, you've got no subtlety to your economic engineering. Low means low EVERYTHING: rent, wages, maintenance cost, production output, housing quality, etc, etc, etc. Same for high, which functionally turns the budget 5-way into a Win/Lose slider.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Tropico 5 is not actually a Tropico game at all. Tropico was always a social engineering game, and in Tropico 5 you do not have the necessary tools to engineer your desired society... or ANY society. All you can do in Tropico 5 is build, react to popups, and set the 5-way Budget selector (the Win/Lose slider) to "Win" on every building that you build. It's really that simple, and there's no room to do much else. You could always set the Win/Lose slider to "Lose" I suppose. There's no way to win or lose creatively when there is not an underlying framework governing the simulation. Simcity 5 proved this very clearly, and Tropico 5 insists on following in those same pointless, infuriating footsteps. The fact that someone found 10 DLC confirmed titles listed in the launch config files says it all. Tropico 5 is a greedy, absolutely cynical cashgrab for mainstream/console gaming dollars and it throws away almost every good idea that brought the series this far. Spending 108 dollars to pre-order a 4-pack of this worthless game is a watershed moment in my 34-year-old life as a computer gamer. If you can't trust Tropico, who can you trust?","June 4, 2014","false","19.2"," 29 of 51 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","29","51","0","11"

The campaign itself is very enjoyable as it takes place over several ages where you begin in the colonial time and progress to new periods as the campaign progresses.\n\nSome of the new mechanics involve the economy, as you can now select specific commodities to import and export, granting you the ability to buy low and sell high, while also allowing you to target industries you'd normally lack resources to develop. Other changes also include military buildings also producing different kings of military units (e.g., Army Bases result in 3 tanks per base), which makes military expansion more strategic compared to the previous interations.\n\nAlso with this version is the inclusion of Online Multiplayer, which unfortunately, I have not been able to participate in.\n\n\nShould you buy?\n-----------------------------\nVery much so. This is a fun macro-oriented city builder that provides an enjoyable experience. If you are a person who is compelled to buy DLC, then I suggest waiting for sales or special editions that bundle all the DLC together.\n\n","October 2, 2014","true","40.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Important gameplay and ui features are cut away, while the UI becomes more bloated and inefficient.  Familiar concepts that set the series apart from other city-builder sims -- like being able to customize your presidential faults and qualities, which makes the game more dynamic, gives the player a wide range of gameplay styles, additional challenges and creates greater replay value -- have been removed or cut down to a micron of thier former strength.\n\nThe new concepts that are introduced (like FoW) are inconsistent with the genre, hindering that intrinsic creative value of city building.  The islands tend to be much smaller (in both campaign and sandbox) compared to the rest of the series.  The scale of buildings tend to feel bloated and awkward with few effective placeable locations.  Many of the 'new' elements are just disappointing replacements for previous staples, like cocoa being introduced but papayas being removed.  Dammit, I loved papayas...\n\nIn addition to the cumulative restrictive effect of these changes, the game tends to play carrot-and-a-stick with what little choice you have left.  The campaign (and even sandbox mode) essentially constantly micro-manages the player, which is an unpleasant if not ironic twist on gaming.  At times this is mandatory and oppressive, others it's simply and option one can choose to ignore -- however there is no benefit to attempting to do things your own way.  The player is basically caged in and asked to perform specific meanial tricks.\n\nThe UX is terrible and easily the worst-in-series.  I honestly felt that the Tropico 2 interface was cleaner, more usable and more efficient.  The Pop up build menu, which is ugly, bulky, and poorly laid out, interferes with with your world viewport inevitably blocking whatever it is you were trying to work on.  The overall design seems to be trying to accommodate touch interfaces, which in traditional iOS fashion means that your have to sacrifice detail and control for huge UI elements.  We've lost 2 degrees of speed control in Tropico 5.  The Overlay's have been turned into the ♥♥♥♥ing ugliest rainbow wire-grid that I've ever seen -- It's almost completely unusable.  The PiP viewport becomes annoying after 30 minutes, and takes up too much screen space as a non-interactive element.\n\nAll of the ui changes leave the player with less control and a more cluttered screen.  Useful elements like faction leader notices have been removed, as well as monthly/annual reports (like starvation and deaths from poor healthcare).  Mind you the game still internally wants you to build a new church, or improve healthcare, but you will be left in the dark to guess as to what the social problems are.\n\n3/10.

It certainly is not just like 4 (which in turn was just like 3). The idea of advancing with a tech tree (of sorts) is an interesting change while a consistantly changing global environment can often catch you by suprise if you get complacent. Unlike previous Tropico games, putting all your eggs in one basket will be your undoing. I have also noticed that while in older instalments I could win ellections with ease, each election can often leave me with a nail biting victory (or twice so far defeat). So I would recommend reducing the difficulty when you first play as Tropicans in 5 will rebel almost 3 times as often as those in tropico 4 with the modifier Rebel yell on.\n\nThis Game still still retains the political satire and puns of the previous Instalments and on the odd occasion has made me laugh. It does how ever have a few flaws such as; a lack of customisation for EL presedente and his Dynasty (i feel like tropico 4 had more customisation options), the more clunky almanac (i much prefer the tropico 4 almanac) and the fact that you are only warned about a faction not being satisfied when they protest (often leaving you with little time to rectify the problem before some become rebels or you lose an election).","May 25, 2014","true","41.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This version is the exact same thing without the fun.  too many ways to trap yourself down the timeline on a prior bad, usually just ignorant, building decision.  so where in 4 i didnt mind occasionally restarting or going back to an autosave realing i could fix something, in this version its all the time.  you could blame me, sure... but having done 4 a couple of times and all the wonderful user maps downloads - this game has no fun to it any more...\n\ndont buy any Tropico game until the next release comes out.  as they correct and complete the game it will be called DLC.  so anyone whom buys the first release is buying 70% of the game, then over the  next 12 months the close to 30% full game gets distriuted.  i loved Tropico 4 because i bought it late and in an on sale complete DLC and game package.   if 5 has any chance then wait for that same disty type.

I got this on steam so I was able to download it on May 23. This is very different from the previous Tropicos. The difference between tropic 3 and tropic 4 was a few more buildings, but overall was the same game. Tropico 5 looks and feels completely different. You will find this game much harder and challenging on campaign mode but now has difficulty settings. There are many new building and upgrades as well. Multiplayer is still not up but I will update this review when this mode is working as it seems like it will be fun. I have played many hours of tropico 3 and tropico 4 so I am very familiar with the series. They released patch 1.02 on June 9th, which fixed numerous issues with both multiplayer and single player.\n\nPros\n-Graphics are updated and is much smoother than previous tropicos.\n-The trading system has been overhauled and you now have a guaranteed trade ship every six months. You now also have an additional ship that you can use to trade a certain commodity at above default rate of the computer generated trade ship. Also the ships will change every so many years and look like a ship of that time period.\n-You no longer have to build a separate tourist dock. All tourist ships use the same dock as what is given to you at the start of the game.\n-You can now hire a manager for each building. Each manager with have certain bonuses they bring such as better efficiency or better job quality.\n-Each place where tropicans work will display what income level they will be at. For example a dock worker or a farmer will be a poor tropican, but you can increase their pay to make them well-off. The housing will tell you how it corresponds to their income level. A tenement will suit a poor worker but a house requires their income to be well-off. This also applies to the restaurants and pubs, which serve the poor tropicans whereas opera houses and casinos appeal more to the rich tropicans/tourists. This is much more detailed than previous tropicos.\n-There is now a constitution that will have selections such as for the labor market-all citizens 16 and older must work, child labor, or work if you want; each with its own pros and cons.\n-Many new buildings including cotton and cocoa plantations. You can now build a textile mill and use the cotton you grow to make tshirts. You can now mine uranium and coal and either sell it or use it for power plants. There is now a library which is used to research buildings and upgrades per era.\n-The construction priorities feel like they work much better than previous tropicos.\n-The dock now shows exactly what you are exporting and the money you will generate with each item. For example: Corn-$3000\n-You can now have a population well over the 650 person cap in the previous tropicos. (I currently have a population of 800 on one island and it is not even that built up, there is even one mission where I have to have over 900 people.) The low population cap in tropic 3 and 4 really limited how much you could expand and grow your island because you would not have enough workers to fill positions for every building later in the game, especially when you threw tourists in the mix.\n-Plantations now have plots of dedicated land that crops will be planted on. This is much better than previous tropicos where farmers would just plant crops in random places around the farm.\n-I like that in the campaign, as you move to the next mission, you continue on the same island with everything you already built and expand upon it.\n\nCons\n-The overlays no longer include a map of minerals, instead you have to explore the undiscovered portions of the island to find mines. You now have to pay an expedition $1000 to explore differnt parts of the island and can get expensive. Also mines are only located by hills or cliffs now. You start out only seeing about 1/10 of the island and the rest is fog. I find it kind of annoying that as you build you city and reach the edge of what you can see of the island, the fog doesn't clear. You still have to send an expedition, even its across a busy street.\n-You can no longer build factories until you hit a certain era.\n-When trying to place a farm, the crop condition map is not as easy to read as it the square tiles are now outlined in a green, yellow, or red border, not a full green or red square. I personally found it harder to distiguish the yellow and green conditions of the map.\n-In the campaign you only have a certain number of years to rule, known as mandates, and if you cant complete the level in time you lose. More challenging though.\n-You have to wait to get most of the upgrades for factories till certain eras.\n-You cant set wages for all farms or mines anymore (Fixed in patch 1.02). You can only set the sames wages for specific farms or mines such as all gold mines or all corn farms.\n-The game will pause and go to a loading screen when it autosaves for about 5 seconds. This is just kind of annoying when playing, I hope they can patch this issue.\n\nOverall, this game is more fun and challenging than tropico 3 or 4 in my opinion. I bet with a few updates some of the cons I listed will make this game much more fun and enjoyable. I was use to just building up my island at my leisure and building up money to purchase better buildings but tropico 5 is not like that anymore. This version requires patience and a see what this does approach in the campaign. I really like that aspect as it has created a much higher replay value. And this is like most game downloads from amazon, it will be on steam. This has been the case for many years now so don't be shocked. (And it says DRM-steam). I will update after more gameplay.","August 18, 2014","true","25.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The first thing you notice - right off the bat - is it lacks the charm and personality of the Tropico series. While Penultimo returns as hilarious as ever, all your old friends like Reverend Esteban, El Diablo and the Mighty Chinese Dragon (who's hungry for your goods) are conspicuously absent. As such, factions and foreign powers feel like numbers on a page instead of personalities.\n\nThe campaign is way too short with way too little variety. You can grind through it (fairly effortlessly) in a few days, during which you'll get to play on four islands. That's right. FOUR islands. Two of which are basically the same. As for the running of Tropico, in pandering to the needs of the crown, the people and the powers that be, you get the feeling of being a thankless civil servant rather than being a power-mad dictator in love with his own reflection, as was the case in Tropico 4.\n\nWhile the implementation of Dynasties was a great idea - in theory - it was lacking in execution. Instead of three traits, now you only get one per Dynasty member. And a grand total of about four or five costumes. Thinking about sending el Presidente to a construction site to speed things up, or a building to boost service? Think again, as the option to do so is gone.\n\nOn the positive side, it *looks* nice. But as it's a Tropico game (and not a super-realistic bro-shooter), it doesn't really need to. If anything, the mandatory DX11 requirements have screwed a lot of people out of playing it in the first place. I'll have to double check, but I could swear the background music (with a couple of exceptions) is the same re-heated soundtrack from Tropico 4. Come on, folks. There's a wealth of Calypso/Carribean/Latin music to choose from. Get a LITTLE creative!\n\nIn summary, I REALLY wanted to like this game. I really did. Tropico 4 is still one of my favourite games of all time. It's sad to see what could have been an amazing game not fully realised and ideas not fully explored. Until such time as there's adequate DLC (I have no doubt they'll churn it out piece by piece in $5 increments) to give it a little variety and scope, I can't really recommend it. Go play Tropico 4. It's still a damn good game if you want to indulge your inner megalomaniac.\n\nP.S. As if it weren't bad enough you can't build a giant golden statue of yourself any more, you can't build ANY statues. How the hell are you supposed to feel like a tyrant if you can't remake Tropico in your likeness?","June 2, 2014","false","26.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I was expecting it to have everything from Tropico 4 (because there was almost nothing to critize), but what I received was just a poor version of Sim City. The charme of Tropic was the close interaction and connection to its citizens: the naming of the people, their origin, the education, the family tree, all their personal information. That's all lost in T5.\n\nAnother thing: the colonial era has no date, only stressful mandate. The selection of buildings is very poor. Then in the WW ear, the game suggests you to advance into the cold war in the early 30s, which has no historical accuracy. Not to mention the following eras. Basically, the game should just start in 1850 and continue from then on.\n\nKalypso promised a lot of things, which I could not find. Also, the dynasty system is boring, to say the least. I was expecting that I could marry and start a real family, instead of these random and usless additions to my "family".\n\nThe research of new technologies is annoying and extremely long.\n\nI could continue this list, but I', going to play Tropico 4 now. Would advise the same to all of you. Save the money for something else.","May 25, 2014","false","114.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Without delving into past Tropicos too much, these title pretty much abolished everything decent that was good about the past games and while I wanted to strive to figure out the best way to win and be efficient in Tropico 3 and 4, I find myself logging off in frustration a lot with the fifth installment.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is a lot of good and a ton of potential for future DLC's (hate to think that maybe this was a focal point, but it's quickly becoming industry standard). Unfortunately, the bad and the outright annoying is so prevalent that the whole experience gets ruined pretty quickly.\n\nRebels often seem to rebel without any reason. Protests are totally arbitrary and "negotiating" with protestors oftentimes has you build or create something to contend with one of the few problems you're probably not having. Construction costs are astronomical. Power plants are very confusing and either buildings need a ton of electricity to run and maintain optimum efficiency, or the power plant itself is severly inefficient given the amount of cost to build and maintain them.\n\nHealthcare, schools, and entertainment are a beast of their own. While a single newspaper or television seems more than enough to land me at sufficient levels for happiness, I'm finding that multiple buildings that should have the same effect as a liberty increasing building in a different capacity don't actually do anything, or the difference is so minute that I couldn't even tell.\n\nThese things all strike me as bugs, but with the lack of feedback from the developer it's hard to maintain that allusion forever. Essentially, I'm trying to save you money. Even if you're dying to play this, or something has piqued your interest, just wait it out. Eventually I think most of the issues will be fleshed out, but, for all intents and purposes, buying this is equivalent to something that only works some of the time.","May 29, 2014","false","31.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The revamped military is also worth mentioning, rather then turning their rifles on the more... vocal Tropicans, there are actual enemy armies to engage from time to time.\n\nThe other notable addition is multiplayer. It's a fairly well done implementation, though likely won't be the main focus of most players. Perhaps this game can best be summed up by a saying from the great Sun Tzu, "Blame it on the goose/ got me feeling loose/ blame it on patron/ got me in the zone/ blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol."","December 18, 2014","true","9.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

It has all the basics needed, building up a tropical island and a single bizzare campaign. But it's really impossible to play this without comparing it to its immediate, and fare more affordable, predecessor. Tropico 5 adds multiplayer, does improve some design and planning apsects, but strips out much of the micromanagement, a large number of building, avatar customization, a tremendous amount of detail, and nearly all the wit.  For example, instead of the corrupt political humor oozing out of the previous Tropico games, we get an endless stream of toilet humor and bad sexual innuendo with the most annoying 'host' that Kalypso could apparently find.\n\nThe list of things missing is staggering, and it's very clear that this game was designed for a long run of DLCs just to get us back to what Tropico 4 had to begin with. The game feels, and is, a massive step backward for the franchise. Multiplayer may be a saving grace, but empire builders don't tend to like multiplayer all that much to begin with, so...\n\nIn all honesty, I do regret spending any money on this game, and it's the first time I felt that way about Tropico.

Overall I am quite satisfied with Kalypso's course of action.\n\n\n\nTropico 5 is a good game as far as difficulty and presentation goes.\n\nRight off the bat I noticed that the game runs better than the previous game on the same machine I played it on. There were times when I crashed due to large invasions but for the most part, the game has function well for about 95% of the time.\n\nThe Modern Times DLC in Tropico 4 was somewhat of an introduction to the multi-era gameplay in Tropico 5. I like this as it makes the game a bit more dynamic. Prices adjust depending on the Era and available technologies, alliances, and political powers differ as well. All in all the multi-era feature is a great addition to the game.\n\nCombat in the game seems a bit lacking. I understand that combat is not the main feature of the game but if you plan to run a totalitarian state then you'd best expect to see lots of it. On addition to that, your dynasty members play a passive role during invasions, uprisings, and rebellions (in the form of global effects or manager effects). This seems a bit strange to me especially since some of them can be Tacticians or Generals. I've also had trouble figuring out how to get the rebels to attack my Palace while maintaining a strong Military. It's not like Tropico 4 wherein I can set up an elaborate trap in certain structures or have my own avatar tip the scales of battle in an evenly (numerically) matched battle.\n\nAs of now I am 60-40 on this game. It still requires a lot of polish but at the same time, I did enjoy it enough to play it to near-completion. If there was a neutral button then I'd select it. For now, I'll wait for that polish to be applied.","May 27, 2014","true","36.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

It feels much more like a run of the mill city builder game, they changed a lot of the voice actors for the main characters, they brought back the annoying radio host idea, and a whole smattering of other poor design choices. The jokes fall flat for the most part, and a lot of control has been taken from the player, and a lot of the smaller details that used to make the series great are missing. Where that's been removed, however, needless complexity has been added. Now you need a library to research technology- yep, a tech tree. Military affairs are much more integral and like many, many other terrible city sim games, it too is bland.  You are supposed to appoint managers to your buildings- but why should I waste my time flipping through all the potential managers to try to find the one that actually fits, only to get a 10 point effectiveness boost?  And if you have a plantation colony, say, you always end up with a bunch of managers for things like tourism or landscaping or speed-cubing or whatever else. I played for a few hours and lost interest. Your island is consistent across missions, which is cool, but you'd best hope your crystal ball is accurate. One mission starts with you being invaded, so I certainly hope you thought to build multiple forts and towers. Overall, it just feels like a shadow of the 4th game in the series. The 4th game, with the modern times expansion, offers a much more entertaining, satisfying game, and you can probably grab it for a small fraction of the price.","December 24, 2014","false","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, the mind♥♥♥♥ for me is I will have a 84% approval but still get rebels and even rebel attacks. My favorite feature of this game is the fact you play in multiple time periods and also you can repeal invasions unlike in Tropico 4 were you have to please either both powers, get the nuclear program, or ally with one of them. Another thing is after playing multiplayer for a bit, the game seems to lag for me. Not as in the jerky lag but a lag were if I ordered my soldiers to attack lets say the Green faction, I dont see my men deploy for awhile but on their side they see the attack. Infact, this even prohibits me building even further as I wont see any change on my screen until possibly a full five minutes have passed by even though I can still scroll around the map. Also there is one major feature I miss and thats the Tropico First option on immigration. My reason being is even if you have the safe haven option, you still can get a ship with 20 new immigrants. However another issue I have encountered is the logic of some civilians. For example if they are married and both earn a poor wage (using my tropico 4 logic) I would assume their accumulated income would make them a "well off" family thus permitting them to live in a well off house. Boy was I wrong...They only live in a poor house thus promting me to have to lower the budget for housing thus making me loose money from not getting good rent profits. The biggest complaint I have though probably is how quickly you can get over populated. For example if you start off in the colonial era with 50 people, if taking your time you can easily get 200 people, and then possibly 400 by the time you entered the World Wars era. The most I have had was 790 people living on my Island and that was just by the Cold War era. With this its easy to loose track of how many houses you need to build, entertainment, healthcare, and hell sometimes your forced to build a entirely new city on the Island just because you've ran out of room in your first original city. With another concern on multiplayer is the lack of the ability to support another player when attack by pirates or even the Crown. With this the only way you can support them is attacking the player who's attacking them. Also to add in further is the common understanding of "If you place a parkinglot/garage here. Everyone who is traveling will go to that and take a car" however in this game, if you place a parking lot right where everyone lives, only a few will think "Hey...I gotta travel right into the center of the Island for my job. I think I ought to take a car..." instead of the norm of spending five months to get to the farm they work at, then spend another five months walking back home. By the time you get the metro tunnels, people dont consider that if there's a metro tunnel RIGHT next to their house and there's a metro tunnel RIGHT where they need to work, that they should use it. It is the most frustrating thing when you see that your money is getting wasted on transportation because people simply refuse to drive or even take the metro! Overall the game is great but once you start seeing how these people work at times it can get tiresome. A great example is you can have a good five empty houses for the poor and have enough poor people to house them but refuse to abandon their shacks.","August 4, 2014","true","56.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Tropico still maintains much of it's comedy and charm but, unfortunately, something feels like it is missing since Tropico 4.\n\nThe new interface leaves much to be desired as much of the information that El Presidente's are used to is now either buried or missing. Want to know which buildings are profitable and full? Too bad. Want to know where the oil is? Use a magnifying glass! The lack of a Tropico 4 style interface leaves much to be desired and makes it difficult to get the information you need.\n\nIt also seems that with the addition of the new interface we've also lost the fun faction interaction that we've come to expect. They do still exist but they've essentially taken a back seat to everything and are much harder to find with much fewer missions.\n\nThe addition of the new dynasty system is pretty cool. Your new family members offer you some nice bonuses, more benefits, and you can use them as new 'managers' which help you run buildings better. You can even send them on fun little missions and storyline quests for more bonuses. However, with the addition of these new folks you also lose direct control of El Presidente himself. You can no longer tell him where to go, who to visit, and what store to promote. I used to LOVE that feature from Tropico 4 and it helped pass the time and improve production. Now all El Presidente does is wonder around like an NPC. Furthermore, you also have a lot less options in character creation when it comes to El Presidente and can no longer pick from a vast number of backgrounds, histories, bonuses, and penalties; now you pick ONE bonus and that's it.\n\nAs I said, Tropico 5 is likely the best city builder of the series. The addition of the new grid or city layout system makes placing and organizing structures MUCH easier. Due to the new era system you also have building that grow and change as time passes. Farms, for example, get nice upgrades and then can be transformed into Hydroponic Farms which are much smaller and more efficient.\n\nOverall, I have been enjoying Tropico as a good city builder but I often miss the micromanagement, humor, and the style of Tropico 4. Everyone expects at least a dozen DLCs (ten confirmed so far) and I hope that future patches improve Tropico 5 back up to Tropico 4's level.","May 31, 2014","true","75.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

I'd recommend this as a great entry point to the series for new players, and veterans of the series may very well enjoy it too. For one thing, building farms is much easier due to them being zoned out and planned instead of farmers just throwing fields down willy-nilly after construction is done.\n\nBut I personally, coming from Tropico 4, don't enjoy some design decisions made with this game. For one thing, having to explore the island is tedious to me, and I don't really like the Era system much. I don't like that you can't have your Presidente walk around visiting buildings to improve their production.\n\nI also dislike the problem with genders and working. See, the game is based mostly in past points in time, but this game fails to reflect that in jobs. Women can do manual labor, and men can and do work as strippers long before they would have been allowed in those positions by their society.\n\nTL;DR I don't like some choices the devs made, but it's still a well-made game.","November 21, 2015","true","31.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Oh and it also has MUCH more stuff to do.\n\nWith changes in economy and many product chains and raw resources added compared to the previous game - it may take a few failures to wrap your head around the way things work.\nYour tropical dictator paradise can now also have sharper teeth with more offensive stuff to beat down rebels and invaders with (although with changes in faction system the rebellions happen a lot more often for my taste).\nAll other categories of things to build and create are expanded as well, coming with a lot more comfortable interface.\n\nAs usual Sandbox mode is where the real game's at. And now it doesn't have time limits, albeit the generator is unfortunately simplified.\nInstead the time frame takes you through four eras starting with colonial one where you are just a mere local manager of the king - you have to use crown's cash to kickstart your playground which you also have to make independent before your term's over. Don't worry it can be extended by doing missions (later on they give you much more varied rewards).\nOf course if you don't want to bother with the colonial era (with it being quite different from the rest of the game, but I personally like it) - you can pick any other era to begin your game in.\n\nI recommend it both to newcomers and previous Tropico players alike.","July 30, 2015","true","28.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Sim City was a massive dud and Calypso Games decided to capitalize with a 75% sale on Tropico 4. When Tropico 5 came around I was ready for more. I enjoyed Tropico 5 immensely. All the annoying little bits of Tropico 4 were wiped away and the new game style was great. Having to plan a city to last the entire franchise mode was fun. I got attached to my cities. I recommend Tropico 5.\n\nThen I downloaded 'The Big Cheese' DLC. It was 5 bucks for a silly costume, new building, and extra missions. It was a ripoff  but I was still loving Tropico so much I didn't care. The building was decent. I could never find the costume. The mission was impossible. I mean IMPOSSIBLE. I normally build my cities to use the resources well and keep my people happy. I tried this with the mission and failed to finish it within the time allotted. Begrudgingly I lowered the difficulty down to east and tried again. I failed. I was a little confused at what I was doing wrong. A month later I decided to load it up again and go for it one last time. I screwed over my citizens in the name of milk. I built as many of the creameries as possible and put all my resources into pumping out as much as possible. I failed. I see this as lazy game design. They made a great game and now are trying to just cash in until Tropico 6 comes around.\n\nGet the game.

This results in a much smoother economic development.\n\nThe second big change is that the campaign is not just a story woven through some otherwise disconnected scenario maps. When you finish a scenario in the campaign, your island is saved so that when you return to it*, all your buildings and Tropicans are in the same place.\n\nThe third item of note is that within the campaign, the progression of time is usually not measured as the passage of months within a year (ex. Nov. 1959) but is instead a countdown to an event related to the scenario (ex. 48 months left before mandate expires) which you can usually extend in several different ways while playing.","June 29, 2014","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have  played all of the previous versions of tropico and this one is obviously a new generation separate from the older titles. It is more difficult, and it does not run on older machines. However, I am on mission number 4 of the single player campaign and have been having a really good time playing.  I recommend it to any strategy game fans out there. I like that your old builds remain in place- it makes long term planning more important.  I have also found that the military is something you need to pay much more attention to-- which is fine in my book. After all, why play a banana republic dictator if you  don't have to rely on soldiers to keep you in power?  I heartily recommend it to all fans of sims or  strategy games. The graphics and sound are top notch.

I still haven't played the first and second Tropico games though I might pick them up on the next sale just to see how the game has changed over the years. I enjoy Tropico 3 and 4 a lot but Tropico 5 is by far my favorite with all of the changes that have been made to make it more of a enjoyable and challenging game. If you've played Tropico then skip the next paragraph.\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Tropico, you play El Presidente, the dictator of the island of Tropico. You can play the game as a leader of the people, doing everything to please them, or you can bribe, cheat and kill your way through your lifetime (If you choose to have it end). You'll face rebels, foreign powers, protestors, and elections as you play a much more humorious city building simulator. While I enjoyed Tropico 3, when I got the fourth installment I could tell the developers knew how to improve their game and did what people wanted by adding more of well, everything and included the humor that made Tropico 4 even more enjoyable. However one thing remained unchanged, Tropico has a issue named after it. The issue is once you know what to do the game becomes way too easy and the other problems being builds stop being built by the NPCs (Luckily happens later in so you can insta-build everything) and the worst issue being that shipments stop being transported for some reason. These issue have been taken care of in Tropico 5, however in the Modern Era sometimes I run into issues with the Teamsters again.\n\nTropico 5 adds new features like the time era and research to help keep things from getting too easy. It has you create a constitution that will help and hurt you in various ways. Importing and exporting goods go far more indept, allowing you to choose who you buy and sell to for each individual good to get the best prices and help (and hurt) your relations with foreign powers. For example, in the World War Era, if you sell to the Allies it will hurt the Axis' view of you which can lead to less trade with them and if your relation with them is bad enough, an invasion.\n\nOld things like your military buildings are far more useful in this game. Before they were only good for when rebels attack. Now they'll help you with foreign invasion (which before ment Game Over) and pirates when they attack you for your gold. You also won't get that one soldier that just turns into Rambo because they end up killing everyone attacking by themselves. They also add a "Manager" system. Most of the building can have a manager and depending on who you pick will give you certain bonuses, like increasing housing quality nearby or increase production.\n\nWith all of the improvments made, the game has become noticably harder. No more is re-election a definite thing. The player could be making large amounts of spending money but if your people are not pleased, come time for re-election it could mean Game Over. And with no speeches this time to save you (Though might be nice to add something where if you don't keep your promises it'll hurt you in the long run might be good) you may find yourself bribing and exicuting faction leaders more often. I know I did. In Tropico 3 and 4 I never did but here I find myself cheating the votes and taking care of the faction leaders just to end up winning by no more than 30 votes. The game is fair about it though. I've won before having 80% of the votes before, what you do can make or break you here and I love it.\n\nThere are other things like an online multiplayer which I haven't tried out fully yet but given the way the game plays, it might be kind of like a fast pace version of Anno 2070, but when my roommate and I tried to play together on the same internet connection, I found it laggy.(He was hosting) I could sit here and go indepth with every detail and share my experiences but why sit here reading that when it'll just be there to tell you why you should buy this game when you could get it yourself and give it a go. If you enjoyed the previous Tropico games, like city building sims, or just a casual gamer, this is a purchase you won't regret.","May 26, 2014","true","45.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

We meet at last. Do you know why you were brought here, Tropico #5? Because El Presidente believes with the right sort of, let's say, motivation, you could become so much more useful as a citizen of our great virtual island. But as it is right now? I don't know, Tropico 5. I don't know. Considering the work of the four previous Tropicos who have come through town, who have very rarely made any significant changes to the status quo, which I have to admit, around here we can appreciate that sort of slow gradual change considering how everything has been working just fine, you decided you wanted to make a few more, shall we say, radical changes. This has El Presidente very concerned. Let's go over the dossier, shall we?\n\nLet's start with what you've been doing around town that's got so many fellow citizens vocally supporting you. One of the biggest changes you've made is to the infrastructure. It's nice to see that you've scaled down the size of the parking garages to something manageable, and look, in the Modern area you've introduced the Metro to our tiny island! Letting citizens get from one point of the island to the other nearly instantaneously is quite the feet. Something that El Presidente truly appreciates when he wants to get out to the llama farms for some quite and relaxation without having to drive through all of that horrible traffic. Which is another issue we see significantly less of. It is good to see more people walking instead of filling the streets with cars! I applaud you, Tropico 5, for finally resolving that issue.\n\nThat reminds me, the whole Era thing. It is, if of a somewhat debatable quality, nice to have Eras from which to transition. Going from the Colonial Era to the World War Era is probably the largest change of the four. The other two are the Cold War and the Modern Era. Having the ability to upgrade certain residential units to other certain residential units is nice as the era transitions, and new constructions become available.Having Edicts become available as the Era progresses is another thing to look forward to, until finally you have access to all of them. And the Constitution! Who would have expected something like that to be introduced into our tiny island? The discovery of science, which is used to enhance the Constitution and advance the Eras, was nice as we can finally figure out that whole sliced bread thing.\n\nThe price of docks is considerable cheaper than they were previously, which allows El Presidente to build many, many docks to help speed up the export of his new delicious cheese. And speaking of money, it's nice to finally be able to have a use for El Presidente's, shall we say 'private' income. Being able to use the Swiss Bank account balance level up El Presidente and his family members abilities is quite good at encouraging you to play multiple maps with the same family so you realize their full power! Oh yes, and El Presidente would like me to pass along his thanks in allowing multiple members of the family to share power on our island.\n\nFor the workforce, being able to hire managers with minor Presidente-like powers to manage buildings is a nice touch indeed. The people of our island enjoy being empowered in such a way that makes them more useful to El Presidente.\n\nBut now onto some concerning trends that I am seeing here. The buildings snap to a rather large grid system that while nice when fitting buildings together sometimes, is terrible unimaginative and can leave a lot of extra space between buildings where they meet at odd angles. It doesn't help any that you have taken away El Presidente's favorite toys. No longer can we build statues to honor El Presidente's might. No, now parks and decorations only come in two units, small and large. The small is one grid or two, while the large fluctuates slightly more, starting at a 4x4, and going to such sizes as 4x6, to the mighty 5x5 and 5x6. But what happened to the gardeners, Tropico 5? Did you murder them in the study with a lead pipe? Because we can no longer plant individual trees, or benches, or any of the small single items. This is a great disappointment to El Presidente, for he had quite the green-thumb.\n\nHousing has now turned into something of a mess, since, as we said, Tropicans walk far more than they did last time. Now if a Tropican can not find a house near where they live, they will opt to just build a shack near their work-site, even if there is ample housing on the island. I have been told by many who do this, Tropico #5, that they were encouraged to ignore El Presidente's benevolence and build these eyesores around the city by you.\n\nAnd another thing. Why have you taken away the ability of El Presidente to personally manage the wages of our citizens? Not only that, but he can no longer set prices for buildings or services. Everything has instead been rolled up into one "budget" function. Tropico 5, I'm concerned about this power grab. These are function that should be left up to El Presidente himself to manage, not some overly simplified "budget bar" that controls everything. This has actually made it HARDER to manage the economy, since if we want to pay people less, we now have to also decrease the efficiency of a building by lowering the budget. This is a big problem, and I suspect it may be sabotage!\n\nI was also shocked to discover that we need to discover our own island now! When we start administering our great government in the Colonial Era, our island is shrouded in mist, and must be explored by our soldiers during "expeditions" that cost a thousand dollars an event! And you can't even control them, you just click on a way point and hope they go the right route in getting there to discover it. Though the discovery of the Compass does negate this, it is none-the-less irksome.\n\nAnd speaking of discovery, why are our people no longer able to improve their skills concerning their profession? Why have you taken this source of pride from our people, Tropico #5? The people are also kept more out of sight as well, as no longer is El Presidente able to see them when they utilize a building. Gone are the queues that show up when you click on a service building. Instead, they are reduced to mere numbers.\n\nHaving to mine minerals out of very specific "mines" instead of just having to dig it out of the ground did not actually turn out to be helpful. These "mines" take up permanent space on the map, even after they are used up and collapse. Which is another issue! When a resource node, with the exception of the fishing wharf, is used up, it is automatically destroyed, regardless of whether or not the output storage is full! This destruction of El Presidente's property at the hands of no other than you, Tropico 5, is a great crime! It is most irritating and wasteful. If a facility no longer has resources to mine, El Presidente will choose when and how it is removed, not you!\n\nAnd with the Edicts, while we do have some nice new interesting ones, I see the Pope is no longer able to visit our island, Tropic 5. That is a little disappointing.\n\nElections are now quite a bit more boring. Why do you not allow El Presidente to do speeches anymore, Tropico #5? In fact, why is it that El Presidente, and the family, are not able to directly control their actions on the map? Gone are the day when El Presidente could walk up to a construction site and encourage the workers to construct faster, or walk into a service building an inspire greater service. This is very disappointing that you have talked otherwise upright citizens into ignoring El Presidente in such a way.\n\nIn the end, I find my appreciation for you mixed, Tropico 5. I can stay with Tropico 4 and not really miss much, I think, but I do still enjoy  your presence, Tropico 5, even if I think you're a half step back from progress.","July 28, 2014","true","115.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commandotmp/recommended/245620/","commandotmp","Ser Bercherer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commandotmp/","72 products in account","This game makes for a great city builder with a comic twist. Previous Tropico titles were also very fun and time-consuming, but with the new edicts, tweaked economy and the added eras, this game has evolved quite well. Though it takes a while even for the somewhat experienced Tropico player to get into it, it's well worth it.\n\nThe colonial era is an enjoyable starting position where you focus on raw materials before becoming an industrial powerhouse. Previous titles always made you start with minimun buildings in 1950, but this gives your island nation a colonial tradition as well. New military buildings and modes allow you to repel rebel attacks and fight off foreign invasions.\n\nMultiplayer is fun! Co-op or fight your friends is great, but as both cities reach around a 1,000 population, connection issues are immenent. This still needs fixing, but overall, multiplayer is pretty great!\n\nSo far, I have played several sandbox games with varying settings and one multiplayer game with a friend. I have listed several pro's and cons below:\n\nPro's:\n\nColonial Start - Great feel and well suited to the game. Every island in the caribbean has an extensive colonial history. Glad Tropico is now one of them :) You can already experience 15k + profits with every freighter which will allow easy and fast industrialization in the next era.\n\nResource and Manufacture Diversity - New minerals and raw resources, more factory goods and more production cycles, with the opportunity to elaborate and initiate new production cycles: Coal to Oil, Oil to Pharmeceuticals; Cocoa, sugar and milk to chocolate milk, etc.\n\nTrading System - Profit from extra trading deals for your resources and manufacture. A big plus as this can sometimes lead to incredible boosts to economy. Though these offers appear and disappear over time, it's worth checking your trade tab every few months.\n\nElaborate Tourism - A diversity in the amount of tourists reflects in the many hotels that one can build. Different buildings add to appeal for different types of tourists. You'll decide to place buildings in particular places that will increase effectiveness of buildings: Haciendas and historical inns near colonial buildings; economy hotels and cabana villages near your entertainment hotspots; country hotels and cabins in the middle of nowhere, etc.\n\n\nCons:\n\nLimited Ruling Options - In previous titles you could choose several ways to rule. Background info for your character could make a great difference. I feel with the constitution options this has actually been limited if you want to make most out of your island. When encountering different constitution choices, there three options, but it two are opposites of each other and the third a more-or-less neutral stance on the subject. I personally feel this limits options.\n\nTraffic - With more teamsters in each era, traffic becomes a total nightmare in Modern Times. Any junction, even three way junctions, already halts most traffic. Even if you have more than enough teamsters, goods sometimes don't reach buildings for some time, even if your road layout is quite good. Hopefully they will add future options to add rotundas, yielding signs, trafficlights etc to aid traffic flow.\n\nMusic - All music has become instrumental. Whilst that is not per sé a bad thing, I do feel Tropico loses it's Hispanic touch in that sense. Tropico 3 and 4 both had excellent OSTs, whilst I feel that Tropico 5's soundtrack is a bit more repetitive and just not quite as fun. Best soundtrack is still Tropico 3. Venga bailar! xD\n\nOverall:\nA great game if you like the series or city builders. The game needs some more elaboration, but I'm confident new DLC will be available soon enough. For now, Tropico 5 offers enough to ease the gaming experience.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/allosautos/recommended/245620/","allosautos","allos autos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/allosautos/","115 products in account","First, a brief history lesson. I was an avid player of Tropico 3, and snatched Tropico 4 up on the first day. I was underwhelmed, as the game seemed more to be Tropico 3.75 than a new game in its own right; for example, all of the UI and art elements were exactly the same. However, over the next several years, patches and DLC helped make Tropico 4 a truly outstanding game, far surpassing its predecessor.\n\nNow we're met with Tropico 5, and history seems to be repeating itself. Tropico 5 has a rock-solid foundation. The mechanics and the underlying systems have been streamlined and now make a lot more sense. Building variety has been diminished, but gone are a lot of buildings that you only ever used once (and that was just to find out what it did). What's left has a time and a place, and the only time you won't use a building is if it doesn't suit your playstyle (as opposed to, say, satellite dishes from Tropico 4, which had very little extra-campaign utility). I've yet to experience a crash. The new systems function well. I especially like the introduction of eras. The dynasty system works, I think. I'm not sure. I seem to get all of the bonuses all of the time, regardless of who is Presidente.\n\nThat said, the game needs work. Some categories (entertainment) are far too sparse, unless you want a dozen cabarets on your island. I've experienced one game-breaking bug: I don't win Sandbox missions despite meeting the victory conditions. Hopefully that gets patched soon. Upgrading buildings is tedious, although I'm happy that they streamlined modernizing them. A big letdown is that the trademark Tropico humour largely falls flat this time around. Instead of the caricatures of various tropes (the drunken priest, the inept second-in-command) and the banter on the radio which could be genuinely funny (I still laugh at General Rodriguez's description of the Museum of Modern Art), you get "Brokeback Mountain" references, predictable flat-out stupidity from Penultimo, and...Lulu. One cannot be told what Lulu is, one must experience her awfulness for oneself.\n\nAll told, it's a solid game that will likely only get better as time goes on. It's worth the price--you can easily get 30-40 hours of gameplay in its current state. It's still one of the best city-builder franchises out there.","June 11, 2014","true","76.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The mechanics and graphics are smooth and to a high quality, and the replayability is of course high for a game of this calibre. Whilst I have yet to successfully complete a sandbox game without utter chaos and uprisings against my dictatorships, trying a new approach everytime will allow me to spend countless more hours in this game. 9/10, definately recommend for any RTS / City Sim fan.","June 13, 2014","true","13.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For instance sometimes it feels like I'd rather pull my fingernails off than try getting roads placed where I want in this game. Same goes for buildings, especially on shore regions.\nWhat makes this task even more frustrating is the new "fog of not knowing your own island" which can be painstakingly cleared by sending your palace troops to "explore" said areas. Only that the troops are idiots that don't reveal important areas (mines, oil) but rather walk right past them. Have fun sending them again and again (1000 credits every time) to reveal even the smallest of areas. These guys are like Vickers in Prometheus, capable running only straight ahead - except when they can use roads to go around and reveal even less of fogged area than using straight path to marker.\n\nThe "combat" in this game... whoo boy. Not good. not good at all since you can't control the troops at all and the outcome is based on placement of your building in relation to path taken by attacking forces. What fun.\n\nA new console-player friendly task system within campaign missions is like you're playing a tutorial all the time. Do this and do just to get some reward. What happened to being supreme leader? In this game you're just an errand boy.\n\nCampaign missions end on victory condition, just to kick you to another island for one mission and then back to the first one. Around we go. Not the smoothest experience and feels like a continuation of tutorial feeling described above.\n\nExecution is poor and overall Tropico 4 is so much better than this its not even funny.","December 29, 2014","false","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I think the series (or developer) has gone a little bit creatively bankrupt .. clearly struggling to find new ways to reinvent the game.  (Which, strictly speaking, I don't think you need to do - you can just improve on the existing formula).\n\nWhat I mean is - rather than look for substantial changes, make iterative ones - make the underlying financial simulation stronger, make the graphics better, make the islands larger ... and then make it all about the story-telling and controlled challenges in the scenario.\n\nInstead, it feels like they've kind of tried to reinvent a bit .. consolidating concepts that came up in Tropico 4 DLCs (like changing eras) and introduce them into this game.  Problem is it all feels shallow.  There's this dynasty concept where you can have children, raise them, have them fulfil roles in your dynasty (but you yourself don't die, apparently).  There's just .. I don't know .. a shallowness to it all that makes you start yawning before you're even halfway through the game.\n\nThey've also left core elements out of the game, and a lot of the stuff that made Tropico 4 interesting (such as balancing the factions) has been de-emphasised in Tropico 5.\n\nIt feels to me that Tropico 5 is kind of like the wanna-be cool grandad of Tropico 4 .. it's actually older and less edgy, but it tries to dress up in a younger persons clothes and act cool .. but you can kind of tell it's struggling to keep up the charade and running out of ideas.\n\nIt was hard to decide whether YES I DO recommend this game or NO I DON'T.  For me it's marginal .. if you're looking for a city builder with it's own personality, why not ?  It's not a terri-♥♥♥♥ game .. it's just not great.","March 7, 2015","true","77.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

In fact I loved them!. However, Tropico 5 was, let's say, different.\n\nThe graphics were good and the humour was there too (if not a bit repetative, a joke is funny once, twice, three times, four times -cringe, again, again and so on). Too little dialogue was included.\n\nI'm sorry to say the gameplay just didn't work. What do I mean by that? Well, it was boring by comparison!\n\nOne of the features that unfortunatly dictate how the game is played, is that each scenario is played on a different island. That in itself is not a problem, but two or three scenarios later you go back to the island that you previously developed and you have to try and remember how and where all the resources are and how you developed the 'supply chain'. It was like going back into somebody elses half-played game and trying to work out what's wrong with it - even though it worked when you left it!!!\n\nThe menus are at times difficult to work with - important features, that can make or break a game, are sometimes buried deep in a menu that you hardly use or struggle to find (even though you might remember it was somewhere).\n\nMy next comment is strange, yes I agree. But it is like the rebels and armies are random. Now I know that they are not. But I felt like they were detached from what I was doing even though I do understand the mechanics.\n\nI have saved my biggest gripe/problem until last. Groan. The price of the DLC's!!! I paid a lot of money for this game £35. Nobody should have to pay a total of an additional £52 for all the DLc's) making the cost of this game a humongous £87 (about $135 american dollars as I write this). This was a huge problem for me IN THIS GAME. Because I felt that I did not get the gameplay that I should have had from the original package and the content just wasn't there!!!\n\nI am not against all DLC's. But these were overpriced and the original game was short of too many features. So I did not buy them.\n\nThe original base game is on SALE now at £12.24.\nI believe £14.99 would be fair price, maybe.......... BUT this price should certainly include all the smaller DLC's. Maybe £19.99 with all the DLC's included. So it is still not good value even at 50% off.\n\nIf it was reduced to these prices tomorrow would I buy them? I'm sorry no, for all resons that I wrote about above. The game does not compare to the fun that Tropico 3 and 4 were and I tired very quickly from it.\n","July 25, 2015","false","47.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

The game looks nice, but as a fan of the genre I do have some gripes with it. First of, it is rather shallow compared to feature packed games like Unknown Horizons or Sim City. Since I'm now used to playing high quality strategy games like that (some for free), I expect commercial titles to go the extra mile.\n\nPlacing roads is akward at best. Yes, you learn to work around it, but a user interface should work for the player, not against him. During multiplayer you can build roads that stretch far out, but they cannot be demolished leaving you no room to make a single mistake while placing them. That is a tall order considering how akward the road editing is.\nThe game rushes you from era to era and I often struggle to remain in one era because I feel I haven't gotten to use my newly researched technologies enough. This combined with very small map sizes (even huge is rather small compared to other games) makes it a poor choice for the month long builds I'm used to.\n\nThere is supposedly a way to save/load multiplayer games, but it's not clear to me at this point exactly how. As with seemingly all modern games, it lacks a proper server browser, instead your left with some social network thing for matchmaking and remote hosting. I didn't like it in L4D2 and I don't like it in this game either. Really old games like OpenTTD (which is free) solved load, save and multiplayer features a long time ago. Just do what they did.\n\nThe game has also crashed a few times, not a segfault, but a hard lock forcing me to get a console up to kill it.","March 6, 2015","false","18.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is now my favorite tropico so far.\n\nThis game got me just as hooked as the others, and hands down it is the most in-depth and complex tropico so far.\n\nThey have introduced dynasties so you can have additonal characters and vote other dynasty members in during elections and take advantage of their bonuses. Moving the character around to give boosts to buildings has been eliminated. I see this as a good thing because it just seemed like unecessary micromanagement in the previous game. Instead your character or dynasty members give global boosts to production or whatever else they do (military strength, effectiveness of services, etc.)\n\nThey have also overhauled trading and added trade routes which can be very profitable if you find good opportunites (Not every trade is profitable and sometimes settling for less lucrative ones is desirable.) They are very easy to manage and not annoying at all. Docks are now more useful to provide more ships for trade routes.\n\nThe difficulty of the game has gone up, which is a good thing for me because in previous installments I'd get bored when I had loads of cash and almost 100% happiness. In this game I've actually had to use my military AND do the voter fraud thing. I had never had to do that in previous games. You no longer need a secret service building to do certain things, which I thought was pretty annoying.\n\nThey've introduced a constitution which give you decisions to make that will benefit your country. There is no more immigration building but the benefits provided by one are instead on a constitutional amendment. Edicts are basically the same but some have to be unlocked through research. They've also added research, and it's not just buying blueprints like before. Building libraries and staffing them give research points.\n\nArmies and military are very important now and are to be utilized. In previous games I would not bother with militaries until the militant faction complained, in this game it is very handy to have a sizable military, especially when declaring independence in the colonial era.\n\nThere are now multiple eras in the game. I did not have the modern times expansion from Tropico 4 so I will not compare them directly, but the eras add a whole new interesting layer. In the colonial era you should try to increase revolutionary support to buy independence from the crown and move on to the great war era. This is where the military can also come in handy, to declare independence the crown requests $20,000. If you have a sizable military you can refuse and fight off the crowns troops to save that money. It's not extremely difficult to do and is somewhat challenging but it was a lot of fun for me to do.\n\nFarms and mines are also much different. Farms are much more asthetically pleasing and larger. The way building upgrades work has also been changed and is more relevant early game. It's not just a statistical advantage to get late game anymore. A previous reviewer has complained about the way the mine looks, but I think it looks much much better than before. Instead of a random patch of land being dug into, mines are now in preselected locations along mountains.\n\nWages & rents are more simple to manage, no longer do you set individual rents or wages but you set budgets which determine worker prosperity. I do not think I can explain it well, but if you set budgets high, the workers income level becomes either poor, well-off, rich, etc. This determines what kind of house they live in.\n\nThere is now a "fog of war" type mechanic on the island. In the colonial and great war era you need to explore your island to reveal what resources you have available. You use your military for this.\n\nThe game runs just as well, if not better, than the previous version of Tropico. I honestly think it runs better than Tropico 4 did on my laptop which is surprising. I also feel comfortable hooking the laptop up to the TV and playing this tropico from my couch with my wireless laptop & keyboard. The GUI had been changed and is much better. I also like that they changed the portraits on the message screens. It's not as exaggerated and cartoony as it was before. I also feel like I can't zoom in on my island as far as I used to.\n\nCons: Only bad things I think is that there is no real additional building sprites. I thought this would be something easy to do. The almanac also has a little less info available but the data that it does show is much more useful and better organized than before.\n\nI highly recommend it for anybody who likes the Tropico series. I have been playing since Tropico 2 and this one is my favorite so far. Definitely buy, even at full price.","December 28, 2014","true","39.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Once we get into the game (not a knock at the loading times, it runs quite smoothly) it's apparent that no part of the "co-operative" gameplay will involve interaction between the two of us, he is on his side of the island, I am on my side, and we still have "team 1 victory points" Ummm, there is only one team.\n\nHis fright ships come in on their own schedule, mine come in on their own schedule.

Amazing game, it really is!  The ONLY minor complaint I have, and in comarison with the rest of the game it is minor, is I wish we had more control over the various attributes of the dictator like we did in Tropico 4.....  Other than that, Penultimo is hilarious, the music is awesome, building and learning what you are doing is a breeze!  The tutrial is very useful, earning medals is a blast, the economics are balanced and very interesting, and the downloadable content after you buy the game is endless!!!  Far as multiplayer, I have to wonder why every time I try and find an opponent, there are not enough people to play.... but that being said, there is so much else you can do after you finish the campaigns I would STILL say incredible replayablility!  and on top of it all.... I managed to grab my copy for 10 dollars when it was on sale at STEAM..... everyone needs to check this game out!!!","August 26, 2015","true","258.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Load up the game (after stealing an old graphics card of his, because my dumbass cant read the stickies, or the game requirements), start the campaign, no multiplayer/co-op option.\n\nFair enough, maybe we expected too much hoping to play through the campaign together, maybe we can just jointly build a city, and go freeform/sandbox on it. the first time we get into game together (why cant we make private lobbies?) we start across map from each other, with "victory objectives", well wait a second, there was an option for co-op or versus, I must've selected the wrong one, because we are on opposing sides from each other, with no clear way to interact.\n\nRestart the game, make sure we are on co-op instead of versus, pick a new island just because. Once we get into the game (not a knock at the loading times, it runs quite smoothly) it's apparent that no part of the "co-operative" gameplay will involve interaction between the two of us, he is on his side of the island, I am on my side, and we still have "team 1 victory points" Ummm, there is only one team.\n\nHis fright ships come in on their own schedule, mine come in on their own schedule. He accepts certain missions (such as sell us 3000 lbs of coco), I accept certain missions, on the ocassions that those missions DO overlap, our counters each fill up independently!!\n\nAdd to that the unchanging, bullet-fast gameplay (in which we don't have time to properly read the rewards/punishments, a slower option would be nice, if it could pause when dialog is happening would be friggin wonderful), and the complete lack of notification when one of us gets knocked out of the game.. oh and why do all of their buildings and civilians cursedly die upon their leaders flight? ITS A CO-OP GAME, Why dont you let the remaining/surviving partner take over the buildings?\n\nthis game has a LONG way to go, I am incredibly disappointed.\n\nAvoid until, forever?","August 14, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

You have to manage the economy, population happiness, military defence and politics in order to survive.\n\nThere is flexibility in what economy you want, whether it be exporting raw materials like iron and coffee, turning them into goods like steel or canned food, or tourism.\n\nPolitics is more advanced than in Tropico 4, where you have the Constitution which affects your country in different ways, and what you choose will affect your standings with the external world powers and also the internal factions in your country.\n\nThe things that Tropico 4 did better are little things like Penultimo being voiced by a goofy hilarious voice actor, but in Tropico 5 he sounds like a monotonous person with no charisma.\nTropico 4 also had nice music with the singing, but Tropico 5 doesn't.\nThese little things however create the funny and fun atmosphere that Tropico is famed for, and something that is slightly missing in Tropico 5.\n\nOverall Tropico 5 is still a good game for people who love the franchise.

I spent several hours just getting lost going through each faction member, playing with my population by bribing, arresting, or banishing them to see what would happen. The graphics are not bad, and the mods and add-on content such as, Waterborne add content to make the game even more enjoyable.

I completely finished the campaign of Tropico 4 and love the hell out of it, but I feel like this game was built on the same engine. They reuse the same animations and camera angles from Tropico 4 for a ton of things that happen regularly, like tsunamis. The game doesn't look noticeably better than Tropico 4, and there aren't really even many new building types. The only new additions are a research tree which is ultimately a waste of time because it doesn't give you meaningful upgrades, the ability to apply managers to buildings based on certain traits (it's a really passive thing), and what else, the islands stay the same from level to level? Both of them. Furthermore, the game runs sort of poorly. All in all, if you can get this for cheap and haven't played the previous entries to death already, go for it.

Why these weren't there at launch is beyond me, considering they were in Tropico 3 & 4, the community thought perhaps we would get nickled and dimed for a prison DLC. The dev team to the surprise of many, at patch 1.08, have hadded the prison and the ability to arrest citizens for FREE.\n\nIn addition to this, the second large complaint was the 2000 population limit. Tropico 5 offers various huge Islands for the players to build on, much of which would stay empty due to the low population limit. Not to mention the horrible side effect of this limit and multiplayer - in which the total cap was divided among all players. New with patch 1.08 is the ability to change the max population anywhere between the original 2000, and the new high limit of 10,000.\n\nI have to say I am very happy to see the devs change their stance on the population cap after community feedback, and would highly recommend this game to anyone. It's done a lot for the series, and is very unique in its approach compared to T3 & T4. Not to mention the devs, while a little slow on the action point here, nontheless pulled through for the community.\n\nWith my restored faith I may just buy the large upcomming DLC at full price :)","December 16, 2014","true","47.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found myself lowering the difficulty level in some missions, due to... the wrong decisions made in the previous ones (the maps transfer themselves to the next missions, so wrong decisions made in e.g. 3rd mission can cause problems in the 5th). Although quite frustrating at first try, I find this feature a nice addtion to the strategic part of the game :)\n+ Humour\nI've never laughed so hard while playing Tropico! The new lines said by the characters (especially Penultimo) are great! The humour presented in T5 is much better than the one present in T4, which was also very good.\n+ Graphics\nWow, I was really surpised by the level of this game's graphics! They are not the best in the gaming industry, but they are one of the best in the strategy genre.\n- Dynasty\nPositively surprised at first glance, I found that the dynasty system is in fact boring and useless. Throughout the game I prefered to stick to my first El Prez, than give power to the other dynasty members. This could be made much more entertaining by making the characters age, or even die over time, forcing the player to change El Presidente.\n- Building variety\nAs pointed out by other players, the game does not feature any building variety (apart from gardens). The player can build an entire city with exactly the same buildings; for example, the tenement from 1930 (World Wars Era) will look the same as the one built in the next Era. Although the problem was also present in the previous Tropico titles, I think that the introduction of Eras was the perfect time to change this issue as well.\n\nAll in all, I'd strongly recommend Tropico 5. The game has its flaws (there are no flawless games!), but they are nothing compared to its positive aspects. T5 is a very good sequel to T4, although different in nature (eras, dynasty).","January 2, 2015","true","93.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tropico 5 adds gameplay to the existing strong strategic game mechanic, while increasing the graphics and streamilining the gameplay through use of often comical npc interactions which keep the game moving, adding TRUE online multiplayer, featuring a masterful invite friendlist ready system as well as a join random games list. The TRUE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY is done exceptionally  well too. What a superb addition to an already bright futured franchise. I can honestly say this is the first game I can remember enjoying its sequel more than its original... We couldnt be more happy with this title. If I had to find some cons to the amazing list of pros this title boasts, I would have to say the lack of a multiplayer save function and no Lan option. However because the Online multiplayer has been working so exceptionally well since day two, You probably will not miss LAN very much. The only worry I have is when we manage to last hours and one of us runs out of time, the game is effectively over. I hope they will add the multiplayer save in the future.

At every election you can ask a Regime member to run in the election in lieu of your original Leader. They can be sent on missions and kidnapped, assassinated or disowned.  They have personalities which you can "upgrade" with money from your Swiss Bank Account to make them more effective as managers as as Regime members.\n\nAlso new is the aspect of "managers" where the people running each building can bring a minor perk that you can assign to whichever of your buildings you choose.\n\nAll this is wrapped in the same familiar "Tropico" packaging that fans of the series know and love.\n\nSo, Long Story Short, though I am glad I grabbed this on sale for $10, this game is MILES more than Tropico 4 was and any fan of the series should pick it up.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGreat game. Worth a grab at $15 or less.  Enjoy Ruling, Presidente!","March 27, 2015","true","107.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Worth getting if you want to play multiplayer.\n\nIt seems that there were a number of things removed from Tropico 5 (such as different characters for faction leaders and your parliment/cabinet members), but it's balanced out by the things it does add (like different eras, Colonial/World Wars/Cold War/Modern).\n\nTropico 5 is different enough from Tropico 4 that I can play both and still have fun; I don't feel like Tropico 5 is a replacement for Tropico 4, but it's still enjoyable.

I've been an avid Tropico player since the very first game. I sank and hours and hours into Tropico 3 (on the Xbox360) and have a ton of time racked up on 4 as well. So when 5 was released and everyone started complaining I was kind of confused. I held off on buying the game until it went on Sale and let me just say that I think it is more than worth the full price.\n\nSo far it has absolutely everything I love about Tropico and more. No longer is it game over when the US or USSR decide to invade. You can defend yourself!\n\nYour presidente gets a single trait, and all of the members of your dynasty get one as well, every time there's an election you can decide which dynasty member you're going to have run for office. You can appoint managers to your buildings which offers a bunch of different ways in which to modify the behavior of the game.\n\nNo longer are protests are just the populace voicing their displeasure. You can choose to negotiate with them and trigger an event that increases that faction's opinion of you if you complete it.\n\nThe import/export system has been overhauled to great effect and the trade system is absolutely a pleasure to work with. Same with the reasearch section which adds a new element to the game and removes the feeling that all problems in El Presidente's life can be solved by throwing money at them.\n\nI have a mid-low end computer and even on somewhat low settings the game looks gorgeous. It runs smoothly and feels well optimized.\n\nThere's so much more I could probably go on and on about it. I honestly don't have any complaints. As someone who has played these games from the start I've had so much fun watching it grow and change over the years. This newest iteration doesn't disappoint and promises many hours of play in the future.","August 17, 2014","true","26.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was the first and last Tropico I buy on release day, you lost a customer Kalypso(for now, until you change how you treat your fans). I can't believe the lack of effort put in, it's so sad because Tropico 5 does have potential.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are better by a little bit, but not much. Although there are some awful textures I noticed like fishing spots having terrible looking 2D fish and the newspaper building having a buggy garden texture.\n-El Presidente customization is slightly better than the old Tropicos and Slightly worse. I like that you can now customize the colours of your outfit and there is a good selection of faces and hair, but the game is severely lacking in outfit choices(DLC money grab sadly)\n-WASD Movement!! Thanks for that Kalypso.\n\nCons:\n-The menus are awful, big step down from Tropico 4.\n-Less buildings, e.g. No more firestation(It's a police station upgrade now)\n-Still can't paint ground textures. Such a simple but important feature to fix dirt patches in your city, come on Kalypso.\n-Building variety is non-existent. What a step down from Tropico 3 & 4 and they didn't even have that great of variety but it was better than nothing, which is what we have here.\n-Hardly any gardens or objects to place(the stuff that makes your city look alive) limited to 10 small gardens and 6 large gardens( DLC later I'm sure, gross)\n-Can't control El Presidente anymore, and he doesn't fight in battles either.\n-El Presidente's ability tree has been downgraded since Tropico 4. Limited to one skill now instead of 3, very sad.\n-Flags, they look nice but depending how you rotate the buildings causes the flags to look like they're blowing in every direction. Looks bad, trust me.\n-Time moves a little too fast.\n-Co-op is awful, nuff' said\n\nConclusion: Buy Tropico 4, it's an awesome game, if you want to buy this turd; I'd say it's worth $5 tops, buy it on sale. Don't expect a great game, but do expect to be ♥♥♥♥♥ by DLC, sadly. I wish I had my $50 back =(","November 10, 2014","false","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this iteration, the developers seemed to have maintained the core mechanics that makes the game work and took several tentative half-steps in a new and mostly good direction.  This cautious innovation has produced mixed results.  Few of the new changes or features are bad, they’re just unfinished or poorly implemented and it becomes painfully obvious when one plays the game that they were not carried out to their logical ends.  And even though, on the whole, it is still a fun experience the game suffers because of these half-steps.\n\nThe Good:\n-Ambiance and artwork.  Tropico is more scenic and beautiful than ever and the soundtrack is the best yet.  While I don’t find the humor in Tropico 5 to be nearly as amusing as Tropcio 4, it still maintains that sardonic sense of humor that is part of the Tropican experience.  I was also underwhelmed by the voice acting and characters.  While not bad, they lack the personality of the characters in 4.\n-The Eras.  This is actually one of my favorite parts of the game.  I like the progression from era to era and the way national and international politics is different depending on which era you are in.  I like the continuity as well.  I like the aesthetic of having colonial buildings existing alongside modern ones.  I thought that the addition of tourist buildings that derive extra benefits from nearby colonial buildings was a nice touch.\n\nThe Bad:\n-The almanac.  In Tropico 3 and 4, all the information that a diligent dictator needed to run a country was easily accessible and clearly presented.  In 5, the almanac, while still containing most (but not all) of the same information, has made it much less accessible and readable.\n-Rebels, coups and civil unrest.  It is not uncommon, for me at least, during the cold war era to have an approval rating above 75% and yet still have a major problem with rebels which often number in the dozens and seem to spawn out of nowhere.  This relates to the almanac in the sense that it can be difficult to discern what exactly the problem is based on the information provided.  Sometimes when I examine individual rebels it is not uncommon for me to find that they are often gainfully employed, generously compensated, comfortably housed and give my regime high approval ratings.  This makes no sense to me.  In addition, the rebels seem overpowered.  I actually like the idea of not having exact numbers and perfect intel on rebel forces, it adds a level or realism to the game.  However the mechanics that govern their behavior and combat abilities seems broken to me.\n-Missing Features and buildings.  This is, hands down, the biggest complaint that I have.  To give one example of this: the police now serve as law enforcement and fire protection.  The latter they do well enough.  The former I’m pretty sure they don’t do at all.  It’s maddening to see people identified as crime lords and rebels by the police, walking around without the slightest fear of being arrested or shot.  And in any case, there’s no jail, dungeon or labor camp to lock them up in.  That’s just one example.  There are several buildings, edicts, and activities (e.g. campaign speeches, official workplace visits from El Presidente, the secret police with their extremely useful and covert skillset.) that are missing from Tropico 5 that really need to be there.  In this respect Tropico 4 is actually, at this point, still far superior to Tropico 5.\n\nThe Half-Steps (i.e. good and bad):\n-The Dynasty.  The most underwhelming of the new features, the dynasty function feels like it was tacked on at the last minute and is not fully integrated into the game mechanics which is too bad because I think there are some interesting possibilities.\n-Research Tree.  While not especially deep or complex, this feature does add a nice progression mechanism to the game.  I like it much better than buildings simply becoming available after a certain year.\n-The Tropican Army.  It’s nice to see that the Tropican armed forces have finally learned how to fight as units as opposed to individual soldiers.  It’s also nice that they’ve learned how to drive tanks and fly jet fighters as opposed to displaying them as useless set pieces like in Tropico 4.  That being said, it is very unfortunate that, for all their improvements, they basically still suck at what they do.  As far as I can tell, when the palace is threatened, all units (that haven’t already been routed by the super-rebels) will converge on it to defend it.  Other than that, there seems to be no centralized command and control mechanic that governs how your soldiers and their support vehicles behave.\n-Multiplayer.  I have not tried the multiplayer mechanic and have no interest in it.  While I’m sure that there are those who enjoy it, I thought from its announcement that it was unnecessary and out of place in a game like Tropico and I wish that the resources dedicated to its development had been tasked to other aspects of the game that are lacking.\n","August 17, 2014","true","87.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I expect more out of a big release like this. How can you have so many bugs with this game?

Each stage of an era is a new start, you will have new foreign powers influencing your island's future, you will have to trade as much as possible to fulfill your treasury bag. If your first start at a innately rich island, you basically just need to export as much as possible, making your dictated country rich and prosperous. Build more and more buildings, infrastructures, research facilities, education facilities, be the most self-righteous gwuy in the world and implement it to your real urban planning. As I'm bit interesting in urban planning, this game literally give you the chances to build a city on the basis of all your ideas. In other word, be the most ♥♥♥♥ing awesome guy in the world and your countrymen will kneel down as much as possible, if they don't, make them. ;) The idea of owing an island in Carribean Sea is as cool as developing it into something you aspire to. And the ultimate goal I guess is to develop it into a country that is as strong and powerful enough to be able to against superpowers manipulating you for long. Anyway, till here, the game is kinda cool, but there are defects that it has to address.\n\nTypically, the battle element. The game focuses on mostly construction and governing, but the battle is awful. You can't build anything during a battle, you can't save your palace as long as you don't have enough manpowers to fight back, and literally watching it collapse (WTF?!). And the invasion of superpowers are just op, your squads of soldiers literally do nothing but wandering around and getting high I guess, they just get beaten up one by one or just basically get vanquished. And one building only produce one squad of infantry, which is painful, you basically don't have anything to against superpowers army when you only built three or four military facilities. And once your palace is compromised, the game is over, you lose and you have to start it over. And rebels, they are just as annoying as your neighborhood granny, once you stepped into more modern eras they r like periods basically wouldn't stop and appearing periodically. And once appeared a rebellion force you will have to eliminate them, and we start to talk about battle. Yeah, battle is just painful and bad. I wondering why they still haven't fix it or upgrade it since the game has released almost one year and a half and more, and there are people complaining about it.  You can't take peoples money and do nothing.\n\nThat's basically it, think before you buy.\n\n有没有官中无所谓，简单一句话，战斗太蛋疼，被打的时候还不能造兵怎么让我好好大独裁!?","January 19","false","13.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Tropico 5 is far from a remake of Tropico 3 or 4 - But not in a good way. The features and mechanics of this game are, in addition to beeing unpolished, just bad features. The era concept look entertaining on paper untill you realize the only one that matters is the last one and everything up to that is a chore and not at all entertaining. The mulitplayer is a complete joke. What bugged me the most is still the way you regulate a buildings budget. This system is supposed to reduce micomanagement (just what the city-builder needs) but ends up giving you much more micomanagment and less control over your citizens development.\n\nThis might be a good game after an expansion and a couple of dlcs.

Trading is a handy addition and exploiting it is necessary to keep the island running, and the heavier focus on the citizens' political leanings makes keeping everyone happy a tad more challenging, although the endgame, as always, is the least interesting and exciting part of the game- Tropico is about the journey to greatness, not the destination.

You just can't stop people from coming to your island (even with Constitution options!) – and there is no emigration office to help you deal with this problem. No options for restarting current missions – from main menu you can only play full campaign from the beginning. And there are 10 missions in 2 islands for the entire game! And of course they removed many cool building from Tropico 4 ex. Police stations is now also a fire brigade, only 2 types of schools, forget about zoo, tourists shops, golden statues (they give only 2 gardens size with no variations!). No options for education profiles, tv programs or kinds of films to play in your cinema. Only a few different models of peoples. As a big fan of series it seems to me like they don’t have money or time to finish the game properly so they sold what they have. Sad.

For a long time all I ever played were city building games, and I will say that the Tropico series are my favourites. While yes Simcity (the old ones) and even the new Cities Skylines are enjoyable, I usually get bored of the city I'm building after a while with the whole zoning, waiting for people to come to the city and build house/shops/industry build some services then repeat. The Anno series steps it up with you building each building, production chains and the occasional quest making it more engaging for me. Tropico gives me that but it also brings a fantastic humour to my megalomania experience (sorry in advance if I over use humour/funny etc, but it's true) that has me laughing out loud every time I play it and after nearly 300 hours of play I'm still not bored.\n\nIn this latest instalment the humour that has kept me endlessly amused in previous games is still fantastic (I wish we could all have a Penultimo in our lives). The building models are done with great detail, the colours and textures of my island paradise are amazing. I sometimes like to zoom the camera right in and tilt it so it's like you standing at street level and watch the occasional sunset/rise.\n\nI used to feel that I never really had enough time lording over my adoring subjects (benevolently lording, most of the time anyway), especially in sandbox with games 3 and 4, but with the eras setup in this latest instalment I’m in El Presidente heaven. The addition of the colonial time is really nice, when declaring independence I always say 'let the redcoats come, I ain't paying the crown anything' (I'm actually British before anyone says anything). And the era specific random quests have fantastic humour in their delivery. There's one quest during the world wars era where La resistance needs messenger animals, the result of each animal tried - pigs are too tasty and become bacon before reaching their destination, still make me laugh every time.\n\nI know there have been a lot of disagreements over the whole DLC thing, I have to admit with other games I've thought they were a bit of a rip off, but with Topico's I've been really quite please. For £2.50 the small single mission ones have kept me entertained for at least a weekend on each play, the 2 £14.99 new campaign ones at least a couple, so I see them as good value (I have played them all more than once). The new random 'side quests' that accompany the DLC's are just as funny as those in the vanilla game and playing through the main campaign again with them popping up can drastically change how things play out. I failed a mission during my 10th play through of the main campaign after the addition of the Mad World and Espionage DLC's, due to a revolt caused by my overuse of banish/kill of crime lords and enemy spies. It was hilarious. So I have bought them all and I probably will continue to buy anymore that come out - if anyone from Kalypso is reading this I loved Pirate Cove, so if you wouldn't mind doing a piratey DLC. As Lulu say's everything is better with pirates!\n\nThe one thing I will say I don't like and that's the complete reduction in advisors/representatives. I miss Miss Pineapple and her love of spanking (her little guest appearance visiting the fish people in one of the new side quests from the Waterborne DLC was a nice addition). Where's El Diablo telling me to stop letting the riffraff in. And while I love Lulu's radio show, Sunny and Penultimo's banter in 4 was just as fun (maybe they could do a guest spot). What happened to the other nations diplomats? Sometimes I could do with the 30,000 instead of the promised camel\n\nI’ve would definitely recommend Tropico 5 to anyone who likes city building games and I hope that Kalypso will continue to bring us more life as El Presidente","June 25, 2015","true","370.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I then played Tropico 3 and loved that too. It had less features than Tropico 4 but was still fun. Tropico 5 is terrible compared to the two and that's putting it nicely. They literally took 20 step backwards to try and pretty up the game. But in doing so they made the game much tougher to run and just plain slow unless you have a pc that's not 2 years or older. T5 also has very little features compared to the other Tropico games. They essentially want you to buy the DLCs and they did that by literally stripping all the features that made tropico great to package them into dlc to make extra $$$. When companies do that to their games it strips the quality in the game and you can tell if you just get the base game. Do yourself a favor wait until the game is like $15 with all the dlc content packaged together.

It's been proven some of the so-called dlc's were PART OF THE GAME AND DISABLED, so you are forced to pay for them to turn them back on. It's like buying a car, but forced to pay extra in order to start the car, or use the lights, etc, etc. The only reason I got the game is because it was 80% off. And the only way I'll get the add-on is again, 75% or more off. It is NOT worth more then that. So many buildings are missing, it's pathetic.\nAgain, if you want to play tropico, only play 3 or 4, unless you can get it for 75% or more off.\n\nAs for tropico 5 play, it's frustrating. You are forced to play only 2 maps. Your own city builds. Win too quickly and you auto-screw yourself for a auto-lose. Like one mission is timed and you are required to do research to be allowed to build something. You will never make it if you won too quickly on the previous mission of that island.\nOther things will ♥♥♥♥ you off, like many entertainment buildings LIMITS how many are allowed to visit and therefore limits your profit. That alone really screws up the city build.\nThere is also a HIDDEN rating system like even though happyness in the charts show 55%+, your rating on the tab says 40's%. ZERO chance to guess why. Maybe housing, maybe limits of the entertainment buildings. Screws you up trying to get re-elected.\nSome missions AUTO-LOSE if you take too long as well. Or force hotels to never fill even though they filled to the max the mission before on that island over and over. Many parts of the game almost made me destroy my keyboard a few times. Something tropico 4 or older never did.\nIt's like you would love the game, if it didn't screw you over so many times in so many different ways.","July 10, 2015","false","62.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have not played a single expac/dlc.)\n\nT4 just felt like a more compelling and engaging product.  Managing the army felt better, and also playing the tourism side felt more interesting.  The Campaign for 4 definitely felt superior too.  5 has some improvements: less guess work with construction, and I like managing the plantations/ranches in 5 (unless you are talking hydroponic farms.  Really Calypso?  High school graduates?!  You don't think that doesn't totally bork your game?)  but I do miss running the prison farms from 4.\n\nIn short, I may remember a few small details wrong because it's been years since I played 4, but I do remember being super satisfied with my experience with 4.  Not quite with 5.  I liked it enough, but I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nOh and Calypso, after playing Prison Architect, the only way you are getting me to buy the eventual T6 is if you provide  a layout mode.  Guessing, placing, cancelling construction, replacing, maybe cancelling again, etc. until i get the building placement perfect (I hope) for my future plans is something we need to get passed.

Anyone who's played the last 2 Tropico games knows that they're basically the same game with a little graphical touch up. Everything in Tropico 5 is different, from the apartments, to the power plants, everything has been redone.\n\nA lot of mechanics have been improved to feel less redundant and more intuitive. Now you can clearly  see how much space plantations will require, and gone are the days were you can't figure out how to get rid of the "garage overloaded" message.\n\nThe campaign has changed in a big way. Maps from the previous missions are saved and you pick up where you left off in the next mission. No more having to start from scratch, the campaign is much more rewarding, and finally allows for building sprawling cities.\n\nBut my favourite thing about the campaign is that it is finally challenging. I loved Tropico 3, but some of the missions in Tropico 4 were so mind boggling simple, they were exhausting. Tropico 5 brings the challenge in a new way and actually encourages building sustainablitiy instead of suiciding your treasury for mundane mission goals so you can win and start over.\n\nI haven't played the multiplayer yet, and I don't really plan to. This is the first time a Tropico game has really interested me with its sandbox mechanics, and when I'm done with the campaign I think I'll spend a long time trying to build the coolest island I can.","May 24, 2014","true","23.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Those familiar with the Tropcio series will feel right at home here with the fan favorite city building style that Tropico has to offer, but with some distinct gameplay, UI and graphical changes that spice up the series. For those unfamiliar with this game as well as the previous installments, the series is very Sim City-esque but with a refreshing take on the city building genre, giving you free rein on your citizens to do what you please. Want to be a absolute dictator, policing your city completely, riging elections and stopping the immigration of people all together? You can. Overall, I highly recommend this game, as well as the previous Tropico games.

I will explain why:\n\n♦ No army reskins to match the era so enjoy modern soldiers and rebels (Even the invasions) so don't hope to get imersed visually, even the civilians are wearing the same clothes as their modern era descendents.\n\n♦ The whole era aspect is basically a way of slowing down the game, remember Tropico 4's version where you had to buy the blue prints? Well screw that idea let's make it so that is takes you an hour just to get to the modern era where you have no choice over what you research due to you having to research everything before you can advance.\n\n♦ Remember that whole selling point of the colonial era? Well enjoy it quickly fly by as it is one of the quickest era's to research out of with little to no significantly memorable features to it.\n\n♦Remember that whole selling point of the future era? Well enjoy it quickly fall flat as it has barely anything deemed 'Futuristic' in it basically what we have today meaning there are little to no significantly memorable features to it.\n\n♦ I would say the only decent feature is the decendents feature due to it being a rather snazzy idea where rather than having a singular person lead the country you instead over the course of the game have  El Presidente’s family tree expanded and thrive depending on how you play.\n\n♦Combat, Oh god don't even mention it. They made it sound like you had real control where you chose where your units went and what they attacked. What we got it the usual automatic movement and attack where all you do it decide which one is the highest priorty target.\n\n♦Multiplayer, Barely played any due to my friend not understanding what to do so swiftly lost in the colonial era, but from what I saw the islands sorry Island is a standard sized area split between however many of  you their are making it quickly become cramped, BUT  I have not even got to the worst part, want to join a friend? Well have fun going through the tedious system of seeing the name but then have it vanish rapidly within the space of a second while names of others whom plan on joining a game battle to to click on the names of their friends or others which turns a simple joining of a friend into a race to which happenes first, you throwing your computer throught a window or you joining the game.\n\nSure you may say that I have only played seven hours of the game so I don't really understand the game to well but I had kept an eye on the game for months previous where they made it sound better than it really was.\n\nIn the end it is just over priced DLC where they had planned all their DLC for the game before it was even released.","November 14, 2014","false","8.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

With it's own set of rules, laws, and regulations? plus the ideological factor that drives your nation so?\n\nThen this game is for you!\n\nI had a blast while playing this game and you will too! There is a lot to do in this game, which can make time fly fast which is nice. Like in Sid Meier's Civilzation V you have to keep an eye out on your happiness, and your production level! Too litte, and your nation will starve of resources and rebel against you, Too much, and you will have constant invasions by the outside world. You need to find the right balance, plus make sure you choose your edicts wisely, pick the wrong ones too early and you will be at a disadvantage, pick the right ones in the right point in time might just help in your favor, or not depending upon whether or not you choose to upgrade your armies and defenses.\n\nYou can 'customize' your dictator, with outfits, looks, first name and last name. However, the first name is randomly generated so that's the downside to that. Plus you can upgrade your 'dynasty' members to be better, which is highly advise. Another downside is that it's not like Crusaders Kings where you can marry someone and have a child, it's randomly generated with a look, and the only thing you can customize is the outfit itself.\n\nThe locations are very well done, each island offers a unqiue spin on how you want to build your nation. If you pick a tiny island you have limited resources to build your country, If you have a huge island you have endless opportunity to build whatever it is you want to build. Like real life you must geographical plan out where you put your buildings and roads, plus your defenses and what not. The last you want is have a full fledge invasion, and your military defenses is sub-par, plus your guard tower locations are out of whack.\n\nThe music in this game while it's fun to listen too, It can get a bit repetitive so becareful there.\n\nI am honestly surprised there is no mod workshop for this game, i can see the potential in what kind of mods this game can produce. Lastly, the achievements are easy to earn. And the tutorial is really simple and easy to understand.\n\nIf you want in-depth nation building then this game is for you.

BUT HOW COME THEY FORGOT TO ADD PRISONS !!!!???\n-Resources variation has been increased , also manufactoring system has been improved , to better.\n\nin other words , if this is the first time you play tropico , you will find it one of its kind between the other games in this similar genre , and if tropico 5 isn't your first experince with this title , you will enjoy the variation and upgrades that shows the effort that was put on this one. i recommend having this game either in full/discount prices 10/10.","October 24, 2014","true","64.7"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","23","45","0","0"

It has some new cool features from 4 that are great, but then has some that are cut out or limited. Why? i don't know. Not much variety in buildings, placement is too blocky, (can't always lay down roads or buildings in the way I wanted) and ultimately, after only 30 hours or so, I feel like I've played all there is to play, and even though I have the desire to build more cities, as soon as I remind myself that i know pretty much exactly what they're gonna look like, it kills it for me. I can't recommend it if you played or own 3 or 4, but if you've never played a Tropico, its a good economy/city-builder game for what it is, so in that aspect I can still recommend it. It's just not different enough from 4.","June 7, 2014","true","32.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The cheeky story and humor are there, but, if you're looking for an experience as deep and challenging as Tropico 4, you will be disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately, as with many games of recent issue, this game suffers from dumbing down for console play. Lots of things that experienced Tropico players know and rely on to really add depth to the game are gone. The most useful overlays, such as occupancy, profitability, employment level, newspaper, television, and rado station types... all gone in favor of being able to play the game on limited hardware with just a few buttons. In fact, radio stations are gone altogether. You cannot directly set wages at buildings anymore, in favor of a "budget" system that supposedly sets wages, but in reality allows you NO control over wages to properly prioritize your economy. Rents and entry fees on homes and service buildings also gone, in favor of a simple button saying "Tourists Only". You can see these glaring oversimplifications everywhere you turn.\n\nThe campaign is far too easy, and I was able to complete it in about 20 hours with no failures, really. The dynasty system seems pointless and can be ignored without affecting gameplay in any way. In short, Tropico 5 is to Tropico 4 as the Texas flag is to the US flag... a dumbed down, easy reader version of the original.\n\nAlso, I got the "Big Cheese" DLC as part of my pre-order for free, and this is a good thing, because I would have been really upset if I had paid for it. All it adds is a singlee building, the creamery, and ONE, count em ONE mission... which is 100% more missions than the game came with outside the original campaign.\n\nLook, I'm not a console player. I don't like console games, because I prefer something a bit deeper. That said, there are some console-type titles I have enjoyed and do enjoy playing. If this is the future of the game industry, then there are some pretty dark times ahead. I'll be putting this back on the shelf and playing user content in T4 instead.","September 7, 2014","false","28.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has some new cool features from 4 that are great, but then has some that are cut out or limited. Why? i don't know. Not much variety in buildings, placement is too blocky, (can't always lay down roads or buildings in the way I wanted) and ultimately, after only 30 hours or so, I feel like I've played all there is to play, and even though I have the desire to build more cities, as soon as I remind myself that i know pretty much exactly what they're gonna look like, it kills it for me. I can't recommend it if you played or own 3 or 4, but if you've never played a Tropico, its a good economy/city-builder game for what it is, so in that aspect I can still recommend it. It's just not different enough from 4.","June 7, 2014","true","32.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"Budget" is a confusing mess of dollar symbols.\n\nDo NOT spend your money here, Kalypso does not deserve it this time. See the comments too.\n\nI have played for more than 100 hours at the writing of this final piece.

Don't expect it to be logical or even challenging in a humorous way like T4 was, it will just be a BIG WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY.\n\nCampaign? Oh, play the same 2 islands that will get bugged out and impossible to play the campaign if you try to do anything other than what your hand holder tells you. Multiplayer? Don't waste your time, the rest of the game is terrible. One way stat progression, one way tech trees, mines and mines of useful information that is buried 15 layers deep in the game, time-flow corruption (i.e: your trade ship says it will be here in 6 months, the election doesnt happen for 8 months. Somehow you lose the election before your trade ship gets back to dock.) Not to mention it's so god damn FAST. By the time you have researched "power plant" in the world war era, its already time to advance to the cold war and you are in massive debt from trying to keep up with the tech tree! Economy is BROKEN BROKEN BROKEN on any higher level difficulties, with or without trade it is nigh impossible not to go into debt while trying to keep ANY factions or people over 50% happiness, let alone one at a time. Disasters want to feel like they are broken but really some noob game dev at Kalypso decided it would be a "good" game addition for disasters to break everything all the time.\n\nDon't even get me started on the TERRIBLE voice acting and the ATROCIOUS sound effects, as well as the three whole songs that loop on repeat OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.\n\nPLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.

Honestly though I feel like the series peaked at Tropico 3, I enjoyed 4 and I enjoy 5 but they are both lacking some of the freedom and zaniness of 3. Tropico 5 has its good points, I am very greatful for Linux support and there was obvious effort put into switching things up from the normal model. However to me Tropico was a multiplayer game and the addition of that feature changed the dynamics of the gameplay a bit too much. I am not a fan of the Dynasty feature either, I prefered having my El Presidente having ultimate power and I miss some of the touches of the charicter creation system (no longer can you have the charming but flatulant El Presedente) instead you only assign a point to a charicter (+1 foriegn relations etc). Which builds when you have a dynasty, but it removes a little of the soul of the game. I am not a fan of the new Radio announcer either, I miss Penultimo. Finally I wish there were more diversity in the islands, while it's interesting to return to an island and continue building on it I miss the diversity. Overall it's a fun game, and if you like Tropico 1-4 you'll like it, but overall it feels like the weakest entry so far.","October 24, 2014","true","7.9"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

First, there is that fact that you have to alternate between two islands that keep the previous developments (i.e. you keep the same two islands for the duration of different stages in the campaign). Second, the various industries follow a timeline (e.g. the tourism industry is not unlocked until you reach Cold War era, if I'm not mistaken). These two factors basically force your island to develop on a specific path. Natural resources (logging and mining) to light industry to heavy industry or tourism then advanced stages of the industry and toursim. This makes logical sense in the real world but this is a video game. It doesn't have to make sense. It would have been better to letter the player develop the island anyway they wanted from the beginning.\nI still recommend just because I am a fan of the previous Tropicos 3 & 4.","October 11, 2014","true","156.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Tropicos 1 - 4 were all amazing, I can't even begin to count how many hours I've blown playing them on PC and X-Box. And I don't regret a minute playing any of them. So when I heard Tropico 5 was coming out, and it would include features like multiple eras and even a Constitution, I got very excited and pre-ordered ASAP.\n\nBig mistake. The game is buggy as hell, some things they refuse to fix. The Constitution options for immigration? Forget about it. They don't make a lick of difference. Even if you ban immigration you still get bunches of immigrants (illegal aliens, anyone?). The entire game has been simplified and dumbed down. And forget about better graphics. Buildings may look sleek from a distance, but zoom in and they are flat and pixelated in the extreme.\n\nJust about everything I loved from Tropico 4 was cut out of the game, and precious little was put back in to make up for it.

The cheeky story and humor are there, but, if you're looking for an experience as deep and challenging as Tropico 4, you will be disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately, as with many games of recent issue, this game suffers from dumbing down for console play. Lots of things that experienced Tropico players know and rely on to really add depth to the game are gone. The most useful overlays, such as occupancy, profitability, employment level, newspaper, television, and rado station types... all gone in favor of being able to play the game on limited hardware with just a few buttons. In fact, radio stations are gone altogether. You cannot directly set wages at buildings anymore, in favor of a "budget" system that supposedly sets wages, but in reality allows you NO control over wages to properly prioritize your economy. Rents and entry fees on homes and service buildings also gone, in favor of a simple button saying "Tourists Only". You can see these glaring oversimplifications everywhere you turn.\n\nThe campaign is far too easy, and I was able to complete it in about 20 hours with no failures, really. The dynasty system seems pointless and can be ignored without affecting gameplay in any way. In short, Tropico 5 is to Tropico 4 as the Texas flag is to the US flag... a dumbed down, easy reader version of the original.\n\nAlso, I got the "Big Cheese" DLC as part of my pre-order for free, and this is a good thing, because I would have been really upset if I had paid for it. All it adds is a singlee building, the creamery, and ONE, count em ONE mission... which is 100% more missions than the game came with outside the original campaign.\n\nLook, I'm not a console player. I don't like console games, because I prefer something a bit deeper. That said, there are some console-type titles I have enjoyed and do enjoy playing. If this is the future of the game industry, then there are some pretty dark times ahead. I'll be putting this back on the shelf and playing user content in T4 instead.","September 7, 2014","false","28.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have been a fan of tropico for a while and have played 114 hours of tropico 4. I pre ordered this and was very happy when it was released a few hours early!\n\nHowever, I was a bit disappointed by the game; it wasn't exactly what I expected.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\nWhen I first started I noticed I didn't quite like the HUD. First, the building menu isn't really what I like; You should only be able to see buildings you can build in your era. I also liked the tropico 4 building menu better (where it starts with you picking what category of building you want). Building HUD isn't really greaet either. There are tabs that are a bit confusing, and you don't really see what you want to see.\n\nIn tropico 4, you could zoom ALL the way in and see each citizen, piece of trash, or crop, whereas in 5 you can barely zoom in at all. I like to see my little peoples and cars zooming around, but you can't do that as well in 5.\n\nWhat I also liked about 4 was the fact that you feel so CONNECTED with your citizens: you actually click seperate citizens walking around (i know you can in 5 but I dont feel compelled to) and look at their job, education, age, whatever and look at what they need. I want to actually look through my people and feel like they are real not just look in the happiness section at what they need. And the happiness section is another issue..\n\nI really don't like the happiness section. You are CONSTANTLY having to build new buildings, even though you have NO workers to work them. I am at 887 population, with only 47 happiness because I have no more workers to increase the entertainment or food quality or anything. My happiness went from 82% to 47% in only 1 year even though I didn't destroy any happiness increasing buildings or introduce anything that could have decreased it. Still not even sure why it went down, my population didn't increase all too much.\n\nI've also had a few graphics glitches. Whenever I load a game, my camera is facing down like a top-down game. trying to reangle it makes it zoom, and it doesn't fix until I spaz the mouse around and maybe press a few buttons. Then, while playing today, my minimap randomly had a square of inverted colors right where my city was. I have no idea what caused that one and it didn't go away since I played. Checking out of screenshots will show the glitches\n\nI do not like how you can't customize rent, pay, or fee in this one. Rent and pay are both confusing in how they work.\n\nWhat I like:\n\nI like how the voting system is actually difficult. In tropico 4, all you had to do was not have happiness at like 0%, otherwise you always win by like 90%. In this game, you have to work hard in the beginning to win the elections (unless you cheat!).\n\nI like how there are lots of buildings!\n\nCombat, combat, combat. tropico 4 combat was simple and lacking. THIS combat is epic! No other word. Axis tanks and infantry storming your beach while your own tanks are firing at them is about the coolest thing you can imagine in a tropico game. You no longer automatically lose when you are invaded, you have a fighting chase.\n\nSo in all and all I thought it was 4/10. If they were to update it, I will of course change my review! I will also continue playing and see if I change my mind at all.","May 25, 2014","false","18.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Figured that they system in 5 would been just a more expansive version of that. Well it isn't and it actually gets in the way and makes the game play tedious. Heaps of features and abilities from 4 have been dumbed down or removed all together and it appears that I cannot even fix an election these days.\n\nHopefully they release an update/upgrade/DLC that will fix most of the issues but I ultimately think I should have stuck with the tactic of skipping every odd iteration of the series.

The era system introduced in this game, alongside the campaign that involves playing on two different maps and selecting whihc one you believ that you have already built up to be the most useful for the next mission makes for an interesting change of pace from the constant blank slate starts of Tropico 4. Managers are also a welcome change, bringing new ways to help your economy grow.\n\nWhile overall I would say the game is very good, there are a few small problems, the first being the research points system, whihc while I do like better than purchasing blueprints from Penultimo, I find ot be a bit dull as I always find myself choosing to do my researches in the same order. Additionally I feel the number of wacky quest giver characters to be reduced greatly. The final issue, and perhaps the only big one is the cost of the DLC, which for what it gives is simply too high, but the base game is plenty of fun without it, and Im sure it will eventually go on sale for a reasonable price.","July 9, 2015","true","45.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I spent the time I have in this game developing my island into a democratic, high liberty, and manufacturing mega plex. Single player only review.\n\nPositives\n-You can develop your island as you see fit (manufacturing, tourist focused, agriculture power house, or any combination)\n-Streamlined development options for your island\n-Start in colonial era and work your way into the modern era\n-Foreign affairs with robust trade options for several other countries\n-Robust government management (write a constitution with various effects and issue edicts, LOTSA edicts)\n-Many interesting and unique buildings *IF* you purchase the DLCs (I got them all for .99 during holiday sales)\n-Military options and invasions (see negatives)\n-Great graphics, entertaining voice acting, good cha-cha music, humurous\n\nNegatives\n-Poor implementation of the military aspect (if you are going to implement something do it right). Poor pathfinding, very little or no control over military units\n-Rebels everywhere! No matter what you do you are going to ♥♥♥♥ some faction off and they will attack frequently.  It doesnt matter how nice your island is. It dfoesnt matter how free your government is.  It also doesnt matter if you have a 95% happiness rating. It doesnt matter if everyone is filthy rich and living in a mansion.  You WILL get attacked by rebels.\n-Strange citizen behavior.  Example: Your filthy rich bankers will erect a shacks below a luxury high rise.  This happens often and is very annoying.  Example:  You have guys and gals that just wont get a job no matter how many open jobs there are.  Then these citizens get mad b/c of no work and join the rebels! Example: Your citizens choose to  live in a shack rather than commute to thier job site (even with mass transit available)!\n-'Cha-Ching' DLC policy by Kalypso (this is nothing new)\n\nOverall a fun as hell game with a few annoyances.  Would definately recommend if you are into an interesting city builder where you dont want to worry about micro managing things.\n\nRating: 80% FUN! 20% Aggrivation with a dash of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off thrown in.","January 3","true","123.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Tropicos 1 - 4 were all amazing, I can't even begin to count how many hours I've blown playing them on PC and X-Box. And I don't regret a minute playing any of them. So when I heard Tropico 5 was coming out, and it would include features like multiple eras and even a Constitution, I got very excited and pre-ordered ASAP.\n\nBig mistake. The game is buggy as hell, some things they refuse to fix. The Constitution options for immigration? Forget about it. They don't make a lick of difference. Even if you ban immigration you still get bunches of immigrants (illegal aliens, anyone?). The entire game has been simplified and dumbed down. And forget about better graphics. Buildings may look sleek from a distance, but zoom in and they are flat and pixelated in the extreme.\n\nJust about everything I loved from Tropico 4 was cut out of the game, and precious little was put back in to make up for it. This game is bland, boring, and a complete betrayal of the fan base. Do yourself a favour: buy Tropico 4.

The cheeky story and humor are there, but, if you're looking for an experience as deep and challenging as Tropico 4, you will be disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately, as with many games of recent issue, this game suffers from dumbing down for console play. Lots of things that experienced Tropico players know and rely on to really add depth to the game are gone. The most useful overlays, such as occupancy, profitability, employment level, newspaper, television, and rado station types... all gone in favor of being able to play the game on limited hardware with just a few buttons. In fact, radio stations are gone altogether. You cannot directly set wages at buildings anymore, in favor of a "budget" system that supposedly sets wages, but in reality allows you NO control over wages to properly prioritize your economy. Rents and entry fees on homes and service buildings also gone, in favor of a simple button saying "Tourists Only". You can see these glaring oversimplifications everywhere you turn.\n\nThe campaign is far too easy, and I was able to complete it in about 20 hours with no failures, really. The dynasty system seems pointless and can be ignored without affecting gameplay in any way. In short, Tropico 5 is to Tropico 4 as the Texas flag is to the US flag... a dumbed down, easy reader version of the original.\n\nAlso, I got the "Big Cheese" DLC as part of my pre-order for free, and this is a good thing, because I would have been really upset if I had paid for it. All it adds is a singlee building, the creamery, and ONE, count em ONE mission... which is 100% more missions than the game came with outside the original campaign.\n\nLook, I'm not a console player. I don't like console games, because I prefer something a bit deeper. That said, there are some console-type titles I have enjoyed and do enjoy playing. If this is the future of the game industry, then there are some pretty dark times ahead. I'll be putting this back on the shelf and playing user content in T4 instead.","September 7, 2014","false","28.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A common complaint for Tropico 4 was that it was too much like Tropico 3, so this is the answer for those that wanted something different. Luckily they didn't change anything about the game that made the previous ones so great. I recorded this video with no music, because sadly Youtube griefs me anytime I've done that for any Tropico game... so the video is a bit lacking. Just play some Hispanic music in the background and you'll be all set.\n\nThe age system is the biggest difference in this iteration of the game, other than perhaps multiplayer, and although it is a valiant effort... it becomes tedious after progressing through it a few times.  It works ok for the story mode, but the best part about the age system is that it can essentially be turned off during sandbox games by setting the starting era to Modern Times.\n\nMultiplayer looks good... but I haven't played enough to really get a feel for it yet.\n\nThe best change to Tropico 5 is the Dynasty system. Building your dynasty is fun, and finally gives you a reason to have a fat stack of cash in your slush fund.\n\nSo all in all, I'm really happy with the game. I sometimes miss the simplicity of the older games, mainly because of the addition of the age system, but the Tropico series is still my favorite city builder, and I expect to play Tropico 5 for many, many more hours to come.","June 10, 2014","true","50.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The gameplay is streamlined and simplistic, even moreso than its predecessors, and this somewhat detracts from its depth of gameplay. It is, however, intuitive and obvious to pick up and play.\nThe only major fault I've seen are the bugs.

So when I heard Tropico 5 was coming out, and it would include features like multiple eras and even a Constitution, I got very excited and pre-ordered ASAP.\n\nBig mistake. The game is buggy as hell, some things they refuse to fix. The Constitution options for immigration? Forget about it. They don't make a lick of difference. Even if you ban immigration you still get bunches of immigrants (illegal aliens, anyone?). The entire game has been simplified and dumbed down. And forget about better graphics. Buildings may look sleek from a distance, but zoom in and they are flat and pixelated in the extreme.\n\nJust about everything I loved from Tropico 4 was cut out of the game, and precious little was put back in to make up for it. This game is bland, boring, and a complete betrayal of the fan base. Do yourself a favour: buy Tropico 4.

The era system introduced in this game, alongside the campaign that involves playing on two different maps and selecting whihc one you believ that you have already built up to be the most useful for the next mission makes for an interesting change of pace from the constant blank slate starts of Tropico 4. Managers are also a welcome change, bringing new ways to help your economy grow.\n\nWhile overall I would say the game is very good, there are a few small problems, the first being the research points system, whihc while I do like better than purchasing blueprints from Penultimo, I find ot be a bit dull as I always find myself choosing to do my researches in the same order. Additionally I feel the number of wacky quest giver characters to be reduced greatly. The final issue, and perhaps the only big one is the cost of the DLC, which for what it gives is simply too high, but the base game is plenty of fun without it, and Im sure it will eventually go on sale for a reasonable price.","July 9, 2015","true","45.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(but still an awesome game though!) The game looks and feels a lot less like you have to run some 3rd world country. Besides that, being able to actually control where the crops grow is one of the best new features in the game; in previous versions the crops fields were randomly scattered around the farm buildings.\n\nAll in all the game is definitely a major improvement and definitely worth buying if you enjoyed the previous games, or if you are interested in the genre.

The game is beautiful. Lovely graphics, and the user interface if fairly intuitive and easy to use. And it runs on Linux, which is a HUGE plus.\n\nMy biggest grief is what appears to be inconsistencies in the economics. I have homeless and unemployed citizens. I build a library, I build houses, and the library sits there empty because no one will work there. The houses sit empty while the peasants build shacks round it. I build a ranch so my idle workers have a job and are producing something that you can consume and/or sell, and now I'm loosing money hand over fist. I demolish the ranch, my citizen homeless rate goes up, content goes down, but now I'm making money again. I've watched my treasury bleed away into the negative, I'm loosing money fast, and nothing I do stops it. I build docks, ranches, mines, farms. I build housing. I increase budget on buildings and ranches and farms. I give them a bar, churches, libraries, clinics, etc. Nothing I do stops the money loss.\n\nI finally discovered two secrets to making money:\n\n1) Don't build anything. Just sit there with the bare basic town, only build what you are told to as part of a task, add a few docs, and you make money. You start expanding with ranches, plantations, industry, etc., and no matter what you do you start loosing money.\n\n2) Set economic difficulty to the lowest setting. NOW you can play and enjoy the game without going bankrupt in 30 minutes or less!\n\nAnd you might as well get used to your people hating you. I finally figure out how to get my approval rating up to 50% so I can declare independence and not loose elections, but what you have to do to get there is not always obvious.\n\nI don't recommend this game because of the frustration level involved with  just trying to survive. There comes a point where it just isn't fun anymore.","October 10, 2015","false","221.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

A common complaint for Tropico 4 was that it was too much like Tropico 3, so this is the answer for those that wanted something different. Luckily they didn't change anything about the game that made the previous ones so great. I recorded this video with no music, because sadly Youtube griefs me anytime I've done that for any Tropico game... so the video is a bit lacking. Just play some Hispanic music in the background and you'll be all set.\n\nThe age system is the biggest difference in this iteration of the game, other than perhaps multiplayer, and although it is a valiant effort... it becomes tedious after progressing through it a few times.  It works ok for the story mode, but the best part about the age system is that it can essentially be turned off during sandbox games by setting the starting era to Modern Times.\n\nMultiplayer looks good... but I haven't played enough to really get a feel for it yet.\n\nThe best change to Tropico 5 is the Dynasty system. Building your dynasty is fun, and finally gives you a reason to have a fat stack of cash in your slush fund.\n\nSo all in all, I'm really happy with the game. I sometimes miss the simplicity of the older games, mainly because of the addition of the age system, but the Tropico series is still my favorite city builder, and I expect to play Tropico 5 for many, many more hours to come.","June 10, 2014","true","50.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I spent the time I have in this game developing my island into a democratic, high liberty, and manufacturing mega plex. Single player only review.\n\nPositives\n-You can develop your island as you see fit (manufacturing, tourist focused, agriculture power house, or any combination)\n-Streamlined development options for your island\n-Start in colonial era and work your way into the modern era\n-Foreign affairs with robust trade options for several other countries\n-Robust government management (write a constitution with various effects and issue edicts, LOTSA edicts)\n-Many interesting and unique buildings *IF* you purchase the DLCs (I got them all for .99 during holiday sales)\n-Military options and invasions (see negatives)\n-Great graphics, entertaining voice acting, good cha-cha music, humurous\n\nNegatives\n-Poor implementation of the military aspect (if you are going to implement something do it right). Poor pathfinding, very little or no control over military units\n-Rebels everywhere! No matter what you do you are going to ♥♥♥♥ some faction off and they will attack frequently.  It doesnt matter how nice your island is. It dfoesnt matter how free your government is.  It also doesnt matter if you have a 95% happiness rating. It doesnt matter if everyone is filthy rich and living in a mansion.  You WILL get attacked by rebels.\n-Strange citizen behavior.  Example: Your filthy rich bankers will erect a shacks below a luxury high rise.  This happens often and is very annoying.  Example:  You have guys and gals that just wont get a job no matter how many open jobs there are.  Then these citizens get mad b/c of no work and join the rebels! Example: Your citizens choose to  live in a shack rather than commute to thier job site (even with mass transit available)!\n-'Cha-Ching' DLC policy by Kalypso (this is nothing new)\n\nOverall a fun as hell game with a few annoyances.  Would definately recommend if you are into an interesting city builder where you dont want to worry about micro managing things.\n\nRating: 80% FUN! 20% Aggrivation with a dash of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off thrown in.","January 3","true","123.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Massive chunks of content were taken out from the previous game. What little has been added is sort of a "one step forward, two steps back" scenario. While the constitution and era mechanics are nice, it doesn't make up for the fact that most buildings were taken out. Not only that, but several GUI elements have been removed entirely, like being able to see the monetary balance of specific buildings and being able to see population maps. There are even fewer political factions as well. Just about everything in Tropico 5 is a downgrade, and it's a real shame because I was rather excited for it.

The engine is smooth, AI works more accordingly, changes to buildings such as updgrades and expanded timelines with technology research has made the next piece in the Tropico anthology an obvious gem.\nThe reactions from foreign powers and consequences against your little island paradise are vast and far reaching. Random events and disasters are far more balanced; and politics and trade are a bit more in depth, giving players a chance to either maximize profit or be able to work up foreign relations through trade.\nMost notable in the Tropico game series, is implementing different era's for your island to push through with a new technology tree, allowing one to progress in numerous paths when deciding there tropical paradises fate.\n\nFor any looking for an excellent city building simuation, Tropico 5 is worth the price-tag.\n\nEdit: Update on gameplay:\nSo I get to a population of about 2,500 and things are looking good not only financially but my diplomatic stances with foreign nations were all warm, if not neutral. However there was discontent brewing over the past decade, the nationalists were becoming increasingly vocal and taking up arms in small rebel actions against my regime. I began noticing arresting rebels belonged to a mixture of the nationalists and environmentalists. Years of an open immigration policy, immigrants on almost every boat to port for the past couple years. Then recently I managed to receive 60 Chinese immigrants.\n\nImmediatly rebel action began to scale up with a series of attacks on my cash crop farms, and they were succeeding with every other attack. I chose to put my foot down and lure the rebels numerous times, thinning there ranks and arresting identified rebels. But of course I had many citizens who were very loyal, I met all their desires, the militarists, globalists and capitalists were almost eating out of the palm of my hand.\n\nWell one fine morning I put the finishing touches on putting the last of identified rebels down. Moments later the uprising began. Markers began popping up everywhere as my military scattered to intercept any rebel forces. There were people fighting for my regime, but many more fighting against. I watched as my population counter suddenly dropped by fifty in mere moments. One by one guard towers fell and the mob slowly gathered together in an unstoppable show of force. My fighters bombarding the crowd to no avail, there were to many to stop now.\n\nAfter a drawn out battle with some few loyal forces I had left who trekked over half the island to my palace were to late as the rebels burned my personal fortress into ashes, three square blocks on fire or bombed out. The revolution was over, it wasn't even sunset yet.","May 24, 2014","true","132.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I played at least 150 hours of Tropico 4 (Mac App Store version). But I was nervous about this T5 release because of all the bugs and missing features reported by PC gamers.\n\nI got it anyway on sale from Humble Bundle and I'm so happy I did. The developers have been hard at work since May, fixing many bugs, making gameplay smoother, and creating this wonderful Mac version. The graphics are amazing, especially compared to T4. The buildings and decorations are beautiful. Optimizing buildings with upgrades, budget, and managers is more fun and easier. The humor is fun. The research system and edicts work well.\n\nI played the tutorial and a quick sandbox game up through the Cold War era on medium difficulty settings. I had no problems with managing happiness, rebels didn’t appear out of the blue, teamsters didn’t get stuck in the docks, my military performed decently, etc. So it seems like the game-breaking bugs have been fixed (at least for Mac).\n\nMinor complaints:\nI went onto multiplayer, but no one else was there. Granted, this was at 3 am CST. :p\n\nI miss being able to zoom down to street level and “walk” around my city.\n\nI hate the way the grid overlay looks. It was perfect in T4. Now all the lines of the grid are thick and they glow, making it difficult to see the ground for good placement.\nLooking forward to more updates for more polish. And once all the planned DLC comes out in a bundle, then I'll buy 'em.","September 25, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Initially the game seems great with good graphics, very amusing advisors and fairly solid city building mechanics. Then, everything is going great, approval rating well over half, no debt, plenty of housing and amenities and your people rebel, over and over and over again until no matter how much army you build you get overthrown and game over. WTF kind of game mechanic is that?! Cant even have a long drawn out casual builder session. Terrible.\n\nTLDR - Great graphics, good comedy, fun city building. TERRIBLE political system.

You can create your "El Presidente", and through the course of the game, their dynasty.  You rule over an island over various eras and need to build it up, focusing on housing, food, money making, employment, religion, healthcare, happiness, diplomacy among other things.  For fans of previous versions, Tropico 5 is more of an evolution of the series rather than a revolution.\n\nNew & Improved features (A sample)\n- Dynasties - Can have more members of your family, can make them managers, send them on missions or make them El Presidente\n- Eras - Can start from the Colonial Era, under the tyrrany of the crown, up to the Modern era.\n- Managers - Can now employ different kinds of managers to buildings to grant bonuses.\n- New buildings\n- Improved AI - Especially construction priority\n\nPros: The game has a lot of depth and challenge, that gets more challenging to handle as your island grows.  Managing employment, military, production, diplomatic relations, security are just some of these.  The game has a nice, tongue in cheek humor that I like and it looks great.  A lot of the annoying AI issues in the previous version seem to be fixed.  The campaign is fun and does a good job of taking you through all the areas of the game.  Also, the Dynasty / Manager system is a nice feature allowing you to provide good bonuses to key areas / buildings.\n\nCons: The game, like the previous one, suffers from lack of information tabs.  While it does a good job at providing the basic information you need it lacks the ability to get a more detailed look, for example, to compare production vs transport capacity, unemployment by area, free jobs by location etc.  While with practise and some manual effort you can get some of this information, it really should be provided to you in an easier way.  As such, it leads to a reactive nature, reacting to issues instead of being able to be pro-active, especially when your island grows.\n\nSummary: An evolution of the series that has fixed most of the issues from previous versions while adding some nice new features on top.  The lack of in depth analytical info is a shame and I can imagine some Tropico Vetrans might be dissapointed with the lack of new content vs previous versions.  But for those new to the series with an interest in city builders, this one comes highly recommended.\n\nScore: 8/10 - Good Solid City Builder","May 30, 2014","true","39.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Tropico 5’s timing seems slower paced than 4, but the consistent humor and different ways to build your nation is never repetitive.\n\nThe only thing I wished was better was the DLC package.  The DLCs are more add-ons rather than enhancements to the game.  For example, the Waterborne expansion allows me to utilize the ocean, but it’s an “okay” feature that doesn’t enhance the game.\n\nRegardless, I’m a sucker for these games and I keep buying the DLCs in hopes that they’ll make a Tropico 6.\n","May 14","true","76.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's a bit different than CIties skylines but I would say that for me it has atleast the same entertainment value if not better. Tropico 5 was definitely better than EA's simcity.\nI must add that Tropico 5 is more difficult, atleast I found myself struggling with economy on my first two runs. This is because you rarely receive constant income like in other city building games, but instead you receive money when trade ships show up and buy your resources, and the income you get from a single ship is very irregular. For example one day you might receive 1k for selling bananas and weeks or months later when next ship arrives 10k for jewelry. And meanwhile you are constantly losing money to upkeep your production facilities.\n\nTropico 5 is quite solid actually, no bugs or anything that I've experienced. Only thing I was a bit annoyed about was that everytime autosave happened my game went to a loading screen and after that for some reason wanted to change my dynastys name, so I had to press cancel and second loading screen followed. But that can be avoided by reducing or disabling autosaves in options. Loading screens were also fairly short so I wasn't too bothered really.\n\nIt should be noted that I haven't played tropico 4. and many reviewers seem to say that it's better, so check that out before you buy and make your own conclusions.\nIt is quite common that Tropico 5 can be bought at discount, especially outside steam, but I can recommend it for full price as well if you like building games like I do.","May 17","true","32.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The other one got broke when El Presidente single handedly broke the noses of the Premier of the USSR and President of the USA with a swing of his beard.\n\nSeriously, this game gets a 4.5 out of 5. Another of the great series of city-building dictator sims that made me fall in love with city-building sims again in the first place and have a personality that makes it so few people can turn away after beginning to play with them, it delivers much of what it promises, but there's tarantulas in those crates of bananas.\n\nThe first and foremost is that the voice acting has degraded, and things are less funny, than its predecessor Tropico 4. The storyline shares some mirrors to that game, ultimately, but is enjoyable despite this fact. The addition of tech research and a static continual build of your islands throughout the campaign (Which is something I greatly greatly missed in the Tropico 4 game, wishing it existed) provides a cohesive story and more believability, while keeping things humorous. Add in options like crafting your nation's constitution and it has plenty of playability, eve if your fun per minute might be lessened and ther's less commentary about your actions.\n\nSandbox mode remains solid, especially with the addition of a random generator for islands.\n\nThe multiplayer is a GREAT GREAT GREAT addition to the game, but that crate of bananas has a tarantula in it, too. What is that, you say? There is absolutely no save mode at all in it. So if you and your friends play 2 hours playing a multiplayer game? YOu'd better finish it because you won't be able to come back to it, you either have to devote a large chunk of time to it or play on small maps, in the end.\n\nFinally, there are plenty of bugs and glitches, even now, including things like the menu stuttering (at least 30 people including myself had this problem, which was because an intromovie playing in the background had horrible frame rate issues) but there are easy enough fixes of these until official fixes from Kalypso come forward.\n\nOver all? The game is a solid addition to the genre and the Tropico family. IT could have sailed higher, and it might still with DLC, but it's already far more enjoyable and far more playable for computers with lesser capabilities than its competitors in the city building genre, especially with very real trade, invasion, and competitive options in the multiplayer making an already deep game deeper.","May 25, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This series has always been right where it needs to be in terms of gameplay, humor and style; it's just been a matter of perfecting it. While Tropico 5 brings the series closer than ever to perfection in an absolutely beautiful iteration of the series, it's had to take some things that fans love away in the process. But I trust Kalypso to continue to refine the game in later updates and expansions. I'd wholly recommend this game to fans and newcomes alike. Viva El Presidente.\n\nPros:\n\n- Graphic updates bring you a gorgeous, sun soaked Carribean.\n- Difficult. In previous Tropicos I never had an issue getting elected with the majority of the vote. Now I'm constantly on the offensive trying to figure out what needs fixing.\n- Fantastic little details crammed into every corner.\n- A new sense of depth to the gameplay, new strategies to be brought out, and new ways to plan your regime.\n- More of the fantastic humor that's always made the series a joy to play.\n- New trade and political options.\n\nCons:\n\n- Faction advisors gone, no more Sunny or Ms Pineapple to update you on the latest situation.\n- Difficult UI, a bit of a hassle trying to sift through all the citizens to uncover the root of a problem.\n- Buildings could have used more variety and height as in previous iterations. While the graphic updates are charming, there could have been more options.\n- Seriously.

As a player who never touched campaign mode, the focus on a deep and richer sandbox mode is exactly what I wanted. Here are some ups and downs from my experience.\n\n-DON'T BUY FOR MULTIPLAYER\nAnyone buying Tropico 5 for multiplayer should definitely wait a long time, its a half-baked feature that may very well need an entire expansion (or two) to get right.\n\n-ALMANAC\nThe new Almanac technically has most of the information you could get from 4, but its not very intuitive.  It takes a long itme to figure out where the important info is scurried away. Sometimes you need to scroll down, sometimes its behind an inconspicious word button. You have to explore every nook and cranny to find what you need.\n\n+DYNASTY\nThe Dynasty mechanic was kind of a letdown. Its an upgrade from T4, where each skill doesn't go into a massive pool, but is tied to a specific character (who can potentially die in certain circumstances.)\n\n+ERAS AND MISSION STRUCTURE\nThe Era system is the real game changer. If you've seen TotalBuscuit's T5 preview, you'll know the game has a very rigid, formulaic mission structure at the start, the Colonial Era. This is the most defining and brilliant of changes made to the Tropico series.\n\nThese Colonial missions are guide you to very specific objectives, ignoring these usually  results in a premature ending. This is done to prevent you from falling into a routine which in prior games, would kill the fun of these games after awhile. These mission chains will seem binding, that you HAVE to do exactly what these missions tell you or fail. However, as your understanding of the game mechanics come together, you can figure out how much breathing space you have to fulfill the missions while building the Tropico you have in mind.\n\n+-COMBAT\nCombat is all about expectations. Its no RTS. Its a little hands off, but for me personally its hard to react to changing circumstances. Your firepower comes only from three sources: guard towers, soldiers and tanks. If all of these sources of attack power are gone, you're effectively done.\n\nThe most depth I've found with the system is grouping Guard Towers, so that the tankiness of the towers are complemented by consistent firepower which can kill enemy units and actually turn battles around. There should be ways to react to a bad situation, by cutting deals or accepting demands.","May 30, 2014","true","86.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In my opinion, this simply is the best city builder out there. Why is that? Mostly because of the style. It feels great to be El Presidente of your own little Carribean island. Your entire island looks exactly like you would expect from a Latino-American country. Yes, in the beginning that does look quite a bit like shacks, but if you do well that will change soon enough.\nAnd then there's the fact that you are El Presidente: this means that you can do whatever you want, provided you keep the people under control by either being popular or repressing them. The latter is my personal favorite.\nBut El Presidente does not rule alone. He also has a number of trustworthy advisors to help him out and keep him busy. And your number one advisor is the one and only, brilliant Penultimo!\nAlso, there are multiple ways to build up your island: you could build farms everywhere, industrialize or be the dream island of every tourist. Though I've got to be honest: this can get a little bit dull in your 50th game.\nUp until now, this might have seemed alright but not hugely convincing. So let me tell you what is.\nIt is: the humour. This game is absolutely hilarious and happens quite often that I find myself laughing at yet another brilliant remark by Penultimo, though he is not your only source of fun.\nSo if you want to rule your own little banana-republic and laugh a lot doing so, this game is a must.","June 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Luckily, I got the game for £12 on sale, so not as much money was wasted, however a game that has been out for almost a year and is pumping out DLC already, shouldn't have any issue along these lines under any circumstances. Despite this, I was very lucky because steam offered me a refund due to its issue. On another related topic: I would, from the gameplay I've seen, heard from friends and the brief while I played, I would reccomend this game for gameplay however, if you have a 1920x1080p monitor, I would say it's not worth the risk, especially at £30.\n\nAs advice to people who may have purchased this game and experience this issue or any game affecting issue significant enough for the game to not be playable, it is against UK law(only applicable if you bought and use this game in the UK), and you are entitled for a refund, however luck and good tech support is required, which I was fortunate enough to have.\n\nThank you for reading, for the developers on the other hand,\n\nPlease fix your games and don't let this happen again.","March 11, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Even the simple pleasure of clicking on a random citizen and getting to know who they are and what they are doing is gone. The people instead scurry around as faceless drones that can't be interacted with. That takes all of the fun out of crushing a rebellion.

They tried to re-invent the wheel and came up with a square. It's a bit dumbed down and usable elements from the previous games were left out. Also it would seem that the studio got into taste of dlc industry with million billion different dlcs.\n\nAlso I can't help but to wonder if they had some legal problems with the used soundtracks on tropico 3 and 4. I enjoyed the vocal music on the previous games. As far as I remember in tropico 5 there is just one soundtrack with voice and that is lyricless. Or maybe it costs more to produce music like that.\n\nThe humour is of the same brand as so far. But It's tired wannabe funny, whereas tropico 3 and 4 had genuinely fun moments.\n\nIn essence there is nothing wrong with the game mechanics. But the previous installments put the bar too high for tropico 5  and they failed to meet the high standards. However it is for that I am still giving this game thumbs up. There is nothing wrong in the game, but it is NOT it's predecessors.","July 29, 2015","true","92.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As a player who never touched campaign mode, the focus on a deep and richer sandbox mode is exactly what I wanted. Here are some ups and downs from my experience.\n\n-DON'T BUY FOR MULTIPLAYER\nAnyone buying Tropico 5 for multiplayer should definitely wait a long time, its a half-baked feature that may very well need an entire expansion (or two) to get right.\n\n-ALMANAC\nThe new Almanac technically has most of the information you could get from 4, but its not very intuitive.  It takes a long itme to figure out where the important info is scurried away. Sometimes you need to scroll down, sometimes its behind an inconspicious word button. You have to explore every nook and cranny to find what you need.\n\n+DYNASTY\nThe Dynasty mechanic was kind of a letdown. Its an upgrade from T4, where each skill doesn't go into a massive pool, but is tied to a specific character (who can potentially die in certain circumstances.)\n\n+ERAS AND MISSION STRUCTURE\nThe Era system is the real game changer. If you've seen TotalBuscuit's T5 preview, you'll know the game has a very rigid, formulaic mission structure at the start, the Colonial Era. This is the most defining and brilliant of changes made to the Tropico series.\n\nThese Colonial missions are guide you to very specific objectives, ignoring these usually  results in a premature ending. This is done to prevent you from falling into a routine which in prior games, would kill the fun of these games after awhile. These mission chains will seem binding, that you HAVE to do exactly what these missions tell you or fail. However, as your understanding of the game mechanics come together, you can figure out how much breathing space you have to fulfill the missions while building the Tropico you have in mind.\n\n+-COMBAT\nCombat is all about expectations. Its no RTS. Its a little hands off, but for me personally its hard to react to changing circumstances. Your firepower comes only from three sources: guard towers, soldiers and tanks. If all of these sources of attack power are gone, you're effectively done.\n\nThe most depth I've found with the system is grouping Guard Towers, so that the tankiness of the towers are complemented by consistent firepower which can kill enemy units and actually turn battles around. There should be ways to react to a bad situation, by cutting deals or accepting demands.","May 30, 2014","true","86.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is by far the most interesting and tedious city builder there is to date which covers a lot of ground to keep you busy and reeled in for hours on end.\n\nThere are only two major complaints I still have about this game - read why below.\n\n1 - The Multiplayer was horrible at first and because of that the game got a really bad wrap from the get go so players stopped playing it online due to the issues it originally had. On a positive note most of those problems were fixed and it does work very well online now. However, due to that bad start it may be hard to play it online unless you go to the community or get a friend to join you.\n\n2 - One of my biggest problems that I have always had with this game with each of it's following game sequences is that the buildings are way too repetitive as in all of the building types are the exact same. So once you get further into the game you'll notice that you have lots of areas with houses and buildings but they all look exactly alike with absolutely no variance whatsoever. I have repeatedly complained to them about this in every series and nothing has been done and I doubt now that it will ever change either unless a ton of people start to do the same. One thing though that does make it a little better is the different building types and the added buildings from the dlc but still if you have a bunch of houses and similar buildings you will notice that and it may become an annoyance. If you can look past that then you'll enjoy it! On top of that the Eras also do help aid with that in changing the look of several types of buildings after upgrades have occurred from advancing in time but many do not such as housing unfortunately.\n\nAnyhow though, aside from those two issues it is still an epic game and I definitely think it's worth the price in full but if you'd rather wait for a sale then I would certainly recommend grabbing it for sure to say the least!","May 1, 2015","true","24.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I find it very addicting as I'm a complex strategy player at heart and enjoy the extra content, options, and challenge it provides. I think the dynasty mechanic is pretty interesting, it helps you overall in game though it does suck you can't control it a little more, specifically the first names and skill trait your heir gets.\n\nYou definitely have to use your head! This is a simulation of you being a dictator after all! ANY decision you make will typically either affect you positively or negatively. How extreme depends on previous decisions you've made like who your allies are or will be and whether or not you've taken precautions to keep social unrest down. It's a lot more scale tipping than Tropico 4 and you have to have a short learning curve to enjoy this game for what it is. It's highly political and invasion is more likely from people you ♥♥♥♥ off than Tropico 4.\n\nOverall I think it's a more realistic rendition of a dicatorship simulation. Even at "Occassional" freaking random disasters, riots, conspiracies, etc happen regularly. I love it.\n\nIf you don't actually like critical thinking strategy games, rely on foreign aid like a crutch all the time, or only played Tropico series for the humor then I wouldn't recommend this to you.\nIf you love a true leadership simulation including managing, building, arresting, bribes, banishing, political gambles, and all the little aspects that come with it or just love world history, I do recommend this game!\n\nLikes\n- More challenging overall\n- Nicer Graphics\n- Dynasty Members Mechanic\n- In Depth Import/Export Trade Mechanic\n- Politics Game\n- Love having building managers to increase overall production/job/building function!\n\nDifferences | Dislikes\n- *BIG* Less humorous than previous Tropcios IMO. They have jokes but it's like "Ha. Ha." More than hilarous imo.\n- Wish I could name and pick the trait (other than the 3 provided) for my heir\n- Would like more outfits than currently provided for avatars (Might be future DLC)\n- Wish I could purchase/attract more trade ships other than building a dock per trade ship ratio.\n- While I like the Eras mechanic, find it a little hindering BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE for things like tourism or imprisoning/arresting etc not able to be done earlier in the game.\n- There is less of a subtle teaching mechanism in Tropico 5 than 4. You pretty much trial and error play blindly until you find yourself out of a job and have to restart the game with what you've learned. I can handle it personally but it might be a turn off for other players who need a bit more guidance in a game. (Took me a while to figure out how trade works and that I could send squads to unveil the island. No instructions on that.)\n\nTips\n- Save Regularly. It does autosave but since crazy ♥♥♥♥ happens in short amounts of time, you may want to change a bad outcome.\n- I reccommend doing a little research before playing the game. If you aren't familiar with actual world history or the game's new mechanics it will behoove you to look a few things up ahead of time like what technologies/resources and trade will be available in future eras so you can plan accordingly.\n- Check the trade routes before you designate farms/ranches/mines. You can profit more with something in demand.\n- Send out the squad from your palace to open up other areas of the island. (Costs $1000)\n- Don't be afraid/panic if you go into the negative in your treasury a bit. You have a -$10,000 Defincit allowance.\n- If you have 51% love of your people, I don't recommend doing an election if you can't improve in 12 months. I've literally lost an election like that hitting 49% by 12 months. And when in doubt if you've already agreed or suddenly lost a lot of support dont be afraid to call Martial Law to stop the election!\n- Always expect the unexpected.","March 8, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It provides a good challenge while simultaneously offering a relaxed and even casual play time. The new Waterborne campaign is fun and worth the money. Multiplayer is fun but few people seem to take advantage of it.  The Tropico line of games continues to impress and is a fan favorite. The company would not hurt from giving attention to a few minor details like ensuring the correct accent is given to the voices in the game (Carribbean Spanish accent versus Spain or Mexico Spanish) and other little details.\n\nI feel like the game could do a better job with tutorials by offering advanced tutorials that show players the ins and outs of economy at a detailed level to include how to maximize trade and edicts. Also, constitutional choices and how they affect factions and political standing.. Explanations on why my island might have 100 job openings and 100 unemployed even when I am making them pay for their own healthcare and food would be nice.\n\nThe game has much more potential especially if they focus on multiplayer.

First age "Get Independence." Okay, well I got that. "Good job now your economy completely changes!" Wonderful, lost in my own fish bowl and in the middle of a world war. Alright, I can deal with that. "Oh by the way, Rebels want to raid your Sh*t. Good luck with that." Okay, not bad but- "Hold on there, don't forget about your elections!." Oh yeah! Nice not bad. "Okay age over time to make peace with the axis and allies! Even if you were not at war and they both like you F*CK IT, make peace of stay there." Right.. and I'm assumeing if I tell them to shove it up their respective bums I can expect invasion. At this point things are getting a little strange but hey lets advance.\n\n"Welcome to the cold war! Now, get your economy working and move forward." Alright, well I expected worse but I get it now. At this point I looked up a tutorial on how the hell the economy works. With about an hour of researched I got it down and now I'm not having to much trouble. Again its a good game but the fact that the tutorials teach you 10% of everything is a little trashy. They are not called "Tutorials" for nothing.\n\nIf you need a break from Sim city or Skylines, its a good buy. However the extensive DLC for the game. (DLC which is little things for 4$ each.. Seriously?) Seems interesting but I personally will not waste my money on the DLC unless its offered as a good priced bundle.\n\n7/10 Decent Buy. I'd recomend it.

The campaign is a lot of fun (the light-hearted and parodic-ish tone is brilliant)!

One thing i would have liked is more control over military units , which would have created improved chance of using different strategies to beat the bad guys.  This games has some pretty eye candy and an attractive soundtrack.  Both pluses in my book.  Unique enough to come back to many times .  Think i would like to check out its predecesors now, and maybe fork out for the expansion.\n\nRuns smooth on i7 4770k, 8gb ram, 280x and windows 8.1 with all the candy at max.\n\nThanks","January 29, 2015","true","69.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

For starters the DLC situation is just... wow. There's not a soul alive whom can convince me that, that isn't quite simply a money trap regardless of content, I bought the two that seemd most appealing (and cheap during a deal) and I actually still felt I'd been cheated out of money.\n\nHonestly I would warn people away from this title for the most part. You will want to pick this up on sale and give it a couple of hours when you've run out of things to do, but apart from that... I'd recommend to at the very least set your expectations down before you buy.","November 22, 2015","false","9.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"
