I've been playing the IL2 series since the first iteration, and with these expansions, this is by far the greatest piston flight simulator ever made. Even though it was released in 2006 and sometimes feels like it, the gameplay is still tight, flight models are still amazing, damage models realistic, and editor still the greatest ever made. Multiplayer is nonexisteant without using Hyperlobby, but that is free software. The dynamic campaigns are serious fun and can eat up hundreds of hours, and the sheer volume of them means you'll never run out\n\nAlso. Members of the dev team are STILL updating the game. Just in October, they added 3 new aircraft and a large number of features. There have been hundreds of patches which fix even tiny bugs. The community is HUGE, and replayabillity is paramount.\n\nThere's a reason why this game has the most hours of play out of my entire library.","November 29, 2013","true","494.0"," 193 of 198 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","193","198","0","4"

After destroying 4 A-20 bombers, I then decided to drop down to about 1000-2000 feet to get a better view of the map. Now I am no pilot from the 1940s and this proved it because in my mind I figured the best way down was to just point the nose down and drop. This was a mistake. Around 4000 feet, my engine stopped and my left flap had literally sprung off the plane. I ended up gliding until I reached Caen and then crashed landed....all in all this is just utterly fantastic as a flight simulator and a dog fight game.\n2000 feet out of 2000 feet.","October 25, 2014","true","7.2"," 106 of 111 people (95%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","95","106","111","27","1"

I logged a couple hundred hours with the hard copy of the game way back when. Then I just stopped playing for whatever reason. Later on I noticed that it was for sale on steam. Time to give it another shot I guess. Might as well burn a few more hours into it. Then when I loaded up the game I noticed a whole bunch of extensions tacked onto it. Some that I never even heard of. So I started up a quick dogfight with my usual Spitfire, and Tally-HO! Even to this day I feel as though this game is still in it's prime for an old WW2 Flight sim. Not only does this game give you endless hours of missions, dogfights, bomb runs, and flight support. Now you can extend your gameplay by creating your own missions in the full mission builder! And with endless aircraft to choose from, you're pretty much in it for the long-run. I cannot simply find enough time to try everything out in IL-2.

If you are in any way interested in flight, world war two and realism, i would give this game a go because the content of the game in my honest opinion is worth far more than the $10 is is sold at. The flight physics will hold up against most flight sims of these times (not to mention that the game it's self both physics and content is constantly being worked on despite the games release some 7-8 years ago). ontop of that this game is also compatible with the head tracking device "trackIR" making it all the more fun and realistic.\nOn another note i do not recommend this simulator to anyone without a joystick becuase you will find it incredibly hard to control even the most basic manoeuvers because of such realistic events as "stall and spin".\n\nAll in all this flight sim is by far one of the most complex, in depth, realistic i have ever played only being topped by DCS but had it been for a WW2 sim only, Il-2 Sturmovik would take 1st place any day.","April 22, 2014","true","21.2"," 41 of 42 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","41","42","0","0"

If you get this game, one of the first things that you will notice about it, is that it isn't exactly the easiest game to learn to like. The tutorials that are available to you do not put you at the controls of the aircraft you're being taught to fly, but rather make you watch another person fly it the way it's supposed to be flown. Really, the only true way you can learn to play the game is to start it up, and begin playing it immediatly. No tutorials, no help. Trust me, you will die. A lot.\n\nI'm going to go ahead and tell you the things that you likely won't like about this game at first. 1: There are no "Real" tutorials that teach you how to play as I've said before, meaning the only way for you to learn to play the game is through jumping right in.\n\n2: The controls and flight characteristics are very realistic, meaning that if you haven't played a Flight Simulator before, there are hundreds of ways that you can screw yourself over without actually getting into combat, such as putting yourself into a Flat Spin, Stalling Out, Ripping Your Wings, Overheating Your Engine, etc.\n\n3: There can literally be a use for every single button on your keyboard, meaning that hitting one wrong button can mean instant death.\n\n4: This game is unbelievably difficult to master in terms of everything, from flight controls to maneuvers to landing.\n\nWith all of these negativities said, it doesn't sound like a very fun game, now does it? That's where you're wrong. I believe that the people that made this game were absolute geniuses. This is the number one thing about this game - you need to be patient. You will die several times before actually learning to kill anything, but once you do learn, once the little mechanism inside your brain clicks with this game, it will be one of the most fun World War Two Flight Simulators you've ever played.\n\nThe Bottom Line is, this game isn't for people that give up easily. This game is for people who are patient, and people who are willing to learn. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes I do, but only if you are willing to learn the complexities of it. If not, then don't waste your time with it.","August 9, 2015","true","45.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

With Hyperlobby providing custom dedicatd servers with custom gamemodes and a clan servers that are still active to this day. The clans are fun with custom operations outside of their public server with huge and long campaigns will full and intricate operations- all with real people going against AI or each other.\n\n\n\nFantastic game, I love this game and its community.\n\n10/10","June 11, 2015","true","105.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

In addition there is a ton of customizable options for your plans, including nose art, camo sets, weapons, etc.  However, if you dont have a joystick it will be a bit tricky, but you can use a corded xbox 360 controller if you need too.

It has become a bit of a cult following with several loyal players continually playing, hosting, creating skins, missions and campaigns.\n\nIt is probably one of the longest running dedicated combat sims which though using a limited and dated engine, is still able to satisfyingly emulate the widest scope of aviation combat centered around World War 2 in varying difficulty levels and complexity. It has over 150 flyable aircraft from varying aspects of nearly all theaters of operations as well as associated maps. It includes pilot campaigns from nearly all sides, a quick mission builder and a full mission builder. But most of it's contemporary strengths come from beautifully made skins, missions, campaigns and utilities from it's many followers and fans that run the gamut of historical to flights of fantasy.\n\nIt's latest version is 4.12.2m (which is the latest steam version - No patching needed!) which has been officially updated by a group called Team Daidalos (rumor has it they are even working on 4.13!) has added flyable aircraft, tweaked graphics and sounds and additional mission building options and objects. (it even now has the option to add 3rd party "Online sounds" and still be a 'stock' game) It's multiplayer capability is via Hyperlobby where you can usually fly and/or host missions, join dedicated server maps, or get limited help from people there.\n\nBesides the stock game, many have added one of the popular mods to add even more popular aircraft, different flight models, digitized sounds, improved graphics and mission building options and objects. (Most mods can be switched to stock easily via a simple program).\n\nIt has the added advantage of being able to run smoothly (A critical point in combat flight sims) on most older systems.\n\noh, I have purchased 2 retail box versions and the steam version so I've played a bit more than 10 minutes..  :)\n\n(I have "Il-2:Cliffs of Dover" and "Il-2: Battle of Stalingrad" and I still enjoy "Il-2 Sturmovik:1946)","December 26, 2014","true","0.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

The aircraft selection is massive so there is bound to be something you'll like flying. (my personal favourite is the Spitfire Mk.IX series. ) You can change the difficulty settings to configure the game from a semi-realistic flight game to a hardcore sim.  In the Campaigns (some of which are dynamic) you can find yourself dogfighting over the lakes of Finland, intercepting bombers over Stalingrad, operating from carriers at Midway, escorting B-29s over Japan and much more.\n\nThe game is old so the Graphics aren't insane but gameplay-wise it's awesome.\n\nDespite most the negative reviews, you do not need any kind of specialist equippment like Joysticks, Rudder pedals or Track IR.  My friend, Shas'O Bongosun, (who has flown over 200 hours in the game.) only uses keyboard and mouse and he's a good pilot.  Personally i have used a simple joystick for a while but it is not needed,  I've used the keyboard since the originial IL-2 .","August 12, 2015","true","99.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","1"

They're better at carpet-bombing and torpedoeing.\n-A few missing planes from the aircraft selection, I unfortunately didn't see any P-40Ms, or any F8F Bearcats, still a very wide selection, again, most of it can be fixed with mods.\n\nTo sum it up, with how many pros I gave this game, this game doesn't lack in anything really, it does it's job, an air combat sim. I found it hard to find any negatives, but if you've got the money, definately buy the game, it's well worth the price if you're a fan of WW2, and or aircraft.\n9/10.","November 20, 2014","true","207.7"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","67","28","42","23","0"

Used to fly around in my BF-109 and wreak havok on the skies, destroying ME-262's as quickly as they came. I was 7 then.\n\nThen I lost the disk and I was crushed, my favorite game was lost. It took me 8 years to find another copy at the bottom of the "unwanted" bin (let's face it, those piles of games just sitting there in those boxes? They're mostly junk with a few flecks of gold every now and then) at Wal-Mart, and I was in love all over again.\n\nThen I found 1946. I had heard about it while surfing Ubisoft back in '10 and I was instantly hooked, and that was before I realized that it came with EVERY IL-2 ever released before 2007!\n\nNow I terrorize the skies in my P-38L and I couldn't be happier! Plus the lads at SAS and thier modding community always come up with something to make IL-2 interesting (BF-109 and FW-190 super packs, an MI-24V Hind etc).\n\n10/10 all day every day and twice on Sunday!","July 4, 2014","true","205.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Although some other, like Battle of Stalingrad, has better graphic and physics (it's almost a decade now, of course physics gonna be improved), none have the same feeling, planes diversity, combat diversity, location, as 1946 has to offer. The flight sim itself can be set to multiple level of realism, allowing new rookies to take control with confident while learning to fly with easy flying mode, and allowing hardcore ace to feel the wind flow through the wing, to feel the recoil, and to feel the aircraft itself with full realistic setting.\n\nOkay, what I mean "easy mode" is that it's a simplified mode. It's not a face-pace arcade mode like War Thunder. The mission is the same as full realistic setting, only simplified some matter, like no spinning. Also, no aiming helper either. If you're looking for War Thunder's alternative, you're coming the wrong way. IL-2 1946 is far more realistic than War Thunder.\n\nBeside, another advantage is that they're freaking LOTS OF PLANES!!! More than 10 of Yak-9 subtype, 20 of Spitfire's subtype, dozen of A6M family, lots of Bf-109, etc, most come as realistic as you could find, and some paper planes are also fitted well within the game. Which mean you could made an alternate scenario mission with these plane if you like.\n\nOh, did I mention large amount of mods avalable? Some of them give a new graphic, some add EVEN MORE PLANES, some hoes as far as Korean war (heard that someone made an F-86H with Sidewinder as well), and lots of possibility.\n\nSo, if you want a not-so-hard flight sim, with low graphic requirement, lots of planes, and adaptability, I personally recommend this sim for you.\n\nSafe flying, everyone.\nDr. Galactose","January 6","true","1.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Being a History enthusiast kinda Kat an fascinated by what it must of been like for the Brave Airmen of All Nations. Being thousands of FT/Meters up in the Blue Yonder is still kind of nerve racking on a Modern Commercial flight. Let alone with 1940's Tech and Enemy combatants trying to ruin your experience a la The Sun to Icarus.\n\nConsidering the age of this Fine title it's still Very Much a Beautiful ode  to those who actually went through this interesting era in History.\nDetailed damage modeling from portions of your Aircraft getting blown away, sometimes affecting your Plane's controls an functions. Fuel leaks & Fires, Instrument Panels destroyed in the Cockpit.  Pilots can be Wounded in various locals of Body causing control to get progressively worse as you bleed out or Insta-Death.\n\nAll Depending on where the plane was hit.\n\nTurbulence, Wind, Stalls, RedOut and BlackOut from pulling hard G's is also modeled.\nAll wrapped in a lovingly crafted Flight Engine, that still stands well against Time. Allowing you to take to the AirWar with a Ridiculously extensive list of flyable Machines each with their own Characteristic Charms.\nIt culminates into a package that breathes Visceral Life into those Noble Duels between Men at a time foregone; The perfect melding of Man and Machine...Air Combat of WWII.\nIf that's what you're looking for then, IL2 1946 completes the mission....Like a Ace.\n\nOfficial patches dropping seldom to maintain the game and still adding Planes. Not to mention the likewise Legendary Modding Community. That is Still active in bringing Great content such as Skins, Cockpits, Planes, Gfx packs, Sound Packs, Maps, Missions & Campaigns. New Theaters to Fly even, WWI(DBW1916)& JetWar '56!

The game had a number of substantial updates since its release, with the most recent being just last year (2013), though I'm not so certain if the game will see as much now with Battle of Stalingrad on the table. A plus in my book, some aircraft that have multiple crew stations can be manned by human players in multiplayer, so there's a possibility you can even get friends who don't care for flying to join in.\n\nIf you're looking for a solid World War 2 to 1946ish era flight sim, this is a safe pick and you especially can't really go wrong with it if you get it on sale. If you're new to the flight sim scene, I would suggest trying the A6M but be careful of your dive speed. If you excede 350mph, you could cause damage to the airframe --even to where the wings tear off...\n\nEdit: I was just thinking about this review the past few days and it occurred to me that I should mention (emphasize) that this game is a flight sim and not an arcade style flyer. A flight stick is highly recommended for this game because flying with mouse and keyboard is going to give you a pretty lousy experience.","December 1, 2014","true","32.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If anyhting this games is honest, you pay once and get instant access to all the aircraft the game has to offer. Mods are open to anyone who has the aptitude to play around in the games directory, since Steam Workshop support is virtually non-existant. There are fun little add ons and strategy videos floating around the internet for anyone interested in learning them. The interface is clunky and a bit of an eye sore, navigation of menus is a pain whith visual reference for the various aircraft buried in layers of the interface. To really get the full experience of this game you NEED TO HAVE A CONTROLL YOKE!, there is no mouse steering like you would find in War Thunder. You are religated to keyboard controlls which are so clumsy that flying anything but a bomber is pointless, which sucks because there are no bombers for the player to fly in the base game. To get controllable bombers you need to install a mod from one of the many community websites, which is admittantly a huge pain to sort through.\n\nExcellent simulator title, unique approach to damage modeling, but dated in its application, and on its way to becoming somewhat irrelivant. There are newer version of this game which cost more, and are likely the better choice if your looking for a longer term game investment.","March 8","true","148.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It has everything from WWI to prototype jets! So many countries you can fly for such as the US, Germany, Italy, Britain, Australia, South America, and many, many more. So many campaign missions as well! Escorting B-29's, B-17's, scrambling other aircraft, and bombing airfields or armor. If you just want to mess around with the crash physics or anything else, you could always just do a quick mission. This game is excellent, I HIGHLY recommend it. But if you already own it, be sure to install the HSFX mod that enhances the game's sound effects, adds newer aircraft (such as the F-86 Sabre and MiG-15 and MiG-17) as well as letting you fly (nearly) every aircraft in the game possible.

You won't be zooming about in the air doing on a dime turns in some super OP plane, just blasting people out of the sky left and right. This game requires a great deal of patience and skill to really play well, especially online against other people. The modeling of planes and all their related systems is really good, as it should be for a WW2 flight simulator. You can fly most major aircraft from all major sides in the war, ranging from the eponymous IL-2 ground attack plane, to a Japanese Zero or a P-51.\n\nThat all being said, a joystick (preferrably HOTAS) is damn near a requirement to get the most out of this game. Without it you'll be stretching your fingers and your brain to remember all the controls on a keyboard. You can set the realism to lower levels so you won't have to worry about having to open radiator cowls, ammo counts, fuel status and the like, but IMO that takes away from the fun of the game.\n\nIf you're a flight simulator junkie like me, and am willing to drop a few bucks on a good joystick setup, this game is definitely worth the price.","January 11, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead it's a physically realistic air combat SIMULATOR.\n\nEverything from managing the richness of your fuel mixture, adjusting the pitch of your propellor,  to having to trim your plane to compensate for engine torque makes IL-2 the flight sim I've been looking for.\n\nI highly recommend this game.

Ideally, you'd also want to use a joystick, as the control scheme is much more fluid and easy to use with a stick compared to the keyboard.\n\nOnce you start the game you can choose between doing the story missions or trying out pilot school, which is intended to prepare you for the more intense story missions. There are also video tutorials available to watch, which are extremely useful and strongly recommended. The videos will teach you everything from taking off, to landing, to dropping bombs on your enemies and dogfighting.\n\nAt the start, I had A LOT of trouble getting my plan to even successfully lift off the ground. Be patient, as you will probably see many "engine inoperable" notifications (if you haven't already blown up or overheated your engine by this point). The control scheme is a little spread out, but it shouldn't be too difficult to familiarize yourself with the layout. The learning curve for the game is not too steep, but it can be difficult in the beginning. Give yourself plenty of time to get used to taking off, and everything else will be easy to pick up after that.\n\nThe graphics are a little dated, but when you get into a skirmish or large-scale battle, you will love the intensity of the fighting.\n\nDefinitely recommend for the (war) flight simulator junkies.","July 9, 2014","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Apart from the out dated visuals this game is perfect. Plenty of planes and maps, as well as pre-made missions. Comes with a great career mode too, where you join one of the many different airforces available and serve in historically accurate missions. The fun part is that the career continues as long as your pilot is alive, meaning that all of your air kills, rewards, medals and promotions throughout the war are tracked up to the point where your pilot dies, making you actually give a damn about that little silly looking model in the cockpit :D\n\nThe only downside to this is that multiplayer is a bit hard to get access to, the base game requires you to specify IP to whoever you want to connect, and there is no server browser, but you can fix that by downloading Hyper Lobby which acts as a server browser. You may also have to downgrade to 4.10.1m(I believe thats the version UP and similar packs use).","July 3, 2014","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The bullet holes are a bit off but come on, this is 2006, and with the amount of content this game gives, it can be easily overlooked.

I started a bombing sight tutorial, didn't listen and went strait into the game as a Ju87 Stuka against some Russian bomb targets. Going in, I didn't really know the controls, but I let the autopilot spend the 2 minutes it took to get to the targets. After a short 30 seconds, the other stukas had already dropped their payloads, I didn't know how to but I was told the mission was complete. I was still flying however.\n\nWe were then suddenly surprised to see a small fighter group of Ishaks close in on us from the ground. I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn a bit about the dogfighting. So, I dive in the mighty Stuka, hoping to boom and zoom a lowly Ishak.\n\nAfter about 15 seconds, I got one on screen. I fought for a good while with my plane to stay on target, line the sights up, get in range, stay far enough away for the bullets to hit him, and also fight the speed of the Stuka in a dive. I then lined the Isak up and...\n\nFired. Miss. Again. Miss. AGAIN! Direct hit.\n\nI heard the machine guns roar as bits of the Ishak's wing went flying by when I suddenly got about 500 messages from other pilots;\n\n"Two is hit!"  "I down!"  "Need assistance..."\n\nAnd then I was shot and my fuel tank exploded, shutting off my engine. I tried desperately to force the damned Stuka to the mainland and crash "safely", but to no avail. I bailed out at 300 metres and was shot by an enemy pilot.

This game has everything a good World War 2 dogfight game should have, and everything that its closest modern competitor, War Thunder, doesn't have. First, it has good controller compatibility (using outside mods, but still). Another thing that I cannot emphasize enough on, is the career. You can select from any country that had a flying airplane (and was important), and you can create your pilot, select your rank, earn rewards, and rank up. It's all pretty crazy. Now, I can't rate the multiplayer due to the fact that I haven't tried it, so I'm going to skip to the mission builders. Now, there are two kinds of mission builders, quick and full. Now, think of quick as sort of your instant action, you select your opponents, select your plane, select the number, select the map, and play. There is a couple additional features, like the mission type or the altitude, but those aren't as important. Then there is the full mission builder, the spot that I've spent the majority of my time in. You can select from a huge number of maps, then deploy the planes, artillery, boats, buildings, trains, bunkers, cars, motorcycles, etc. The list goes on. You then deploy waypoints and ya'll battle it out. It truely is amazing, for an early 2000s game, like 2001 or something is when it came out. This comes with a bunch of DLCs and additional content for only $10.\nGraphics\nAged very well. They are not bad, they are in the middle, but they still look fine for when it was made.\n\n\nTL:DR\nGameplay - 9/10\nContent - 10/10\nGraphics - 7/10\nMission builder - 11/10\nOverall - 92.5% Which is practically an A-.\n\nI may be overselling this game a little bit, but it is just plain amazing (haha get it?). I highly advise you buy it, unless you don't have a controller or flight stick, then don't buy it. If you're using a controller, download one of the many keyboard and mouse to controller programs like this: http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/\nHave fun and be Germany, they have sweet planes.\nSuch as the Me-262 with the 50mm cannon.\nYes.\n50mm.","April 30","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

I want to share with you my impression of Il2 1946 !\n\nThe game is still the same like 10 years earlier. The mechanics work great and feel realy realistic if you keep the right config. The game does also make a lot of fun if you play with your own rules and does never get boring. I have to admit that  I tried to play with Joystick and also just with my keyboard. I noticed that the experience you get while playing with a Joystick is much better because the aircrafts are better to fly and coordinate especially if you want to kill someone.\n\nIt is still possible to fly via only keyboard but i would not recoomend this at all. Less fun and feels less good.\nAll in all the Game is worth it just for nostalgia reasons alone but also for its cheap prize. 10 Euro isnt that much at all and for 2 Games its perfectly fine. Considering its works on every Windows like mine (Windows 10) I highly recommend you to buy this game.\n\nI`ll hope I could help you with your decission.\nYour german pall Ashoka Tano","May 20","true","45.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You are a freelance stealth operative who works around for the different countries during WW2.  It is then up to you to choose a country to work for and do what you do best, that is sabatoge of enemy bases. After choosing your country, you will be brought to a menu where you are given a briefing on your mission.  Here, you can customize John's loadout, equipment and even choose apropriate camoflauge for the mission.  You are then thrown into a giant open world map, with multiple routes to complete your objective. you are also sometimes given a set of more than capable AI teamates.  This is all very nice and well implemented, it's just to bad that they didn't focus more on the "game" part of this "game"\nThe amount of controls for this game are absolutely ludicrous.  You will probably end up having to rebind and memorize over 100 different keystrokes just to make the game playable.  After that, you will of course try and move to your objective. However, the developers of this game didn't understand the concept of a "stealth" game.  Any time you try and move john around, you might as well be playing the sound of a b-52 bomber over a boombox at full volume.  It is not remotely possible to sneak around in this game.  On top of this, if you try to turn John around to fast or make to sudden a move, he will fall over to the ground faster than a boombox playing the sounds of a b-52 at full volume being hurled out the back of a b-52.\nYou might be thinking now "Well if I can't get close to the enemy, I'll just take them out from far away."  That's just the problem.  Every weapon in the game has no silencer. You might as well be firing rockets, dropping bombs or shooting a .50 cal machine gun at them.  Finally, there is no way to see how visible you are to enemies.  Since the maps or so open, you can literally be seen by an enemy miles away.\nOverall this is a poor excuse for a stealth game.

It is a shame that BoS and CloD failed to deliver.  All they had to do was take the original game and make the graphics pretty.  The details and amount of content in IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 is far superior.  The community is small but strong.  The problem is that there are so many mods for the game that the community is split up.   I was so hoping that these new titles would unite the community under one patch and allow these games to thrive.  Unfortuanetly they were unable to deliver so i find my self playing a 11 year old game that is better then anything out there.\n\nWe can't really blame the devs for everything the die hard community is very demanding.  I think 1946 hit a perfect balance of engine managment that neither of these new games do well.  None of the settings for the engine managenemt in 1946 would cause you to blow the engine unless you ran it full  throttle and let if over heat or played with the prop pitch and over spun the engine.... there was engine managment but very little of it was engine breakering unless you were really pushing the limits. CloD i can't take off without blowing a gasket or perforating a radiator and I don't know why which just makes it so frustrating that I have no interest in learning, so only the die hards will play this game so the community will be small which will make the Devs little money and low motive to update or release patches.  This can already be seen as the community of die hards has taken this over releasing their own patches for the game.\n\nBottom Line is I am just disapointed and will have to wait many more years for a decent flight sim to come out and actaully push my graphics card and wow my senses.  (It will probably be BoS or CloD once the community patches the crap out of them, currently leaning towards BoS as per reasons above)","May 8, 2015","true","214.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There is a whole training section, but it does not let you do anything. It's just videos of a guy doing various maneuvers and the text on screen is loosely explaning what is going on. The mission creator is greweling and confusing. The default graphics look very bad even considering the year when the game came out because they hardly changed the engine since the original Il-2 from 2001. There are millions of mods to help that problem and to improve the gameplay in general, but they are near impossible to understand and get working, in many cases incompatible with the latest version of the game. There is a club, and if you are a new player, you ain't in it. The controls are somewhere between scarely realistic and broken - I have not yet figured out which.\n\nThe difficulty curve is way higher than in Flight Simulator X and is too steep for me. I will give it another try or two but I think I will wait for a more user friendly sequel. So far the problem has been that the sequels kind of sucked. Perhaps War Thunder will one day become a user friendly yet accurate sim, though it is not this day.\n\nThis is a game for you if you are ready to put real concentration, time and effort into it. I have played car sims, flight sims, submarine sims, truck sims, etc...Nothing has been as confusing and difficult as this game.","December 31, 2013","false","6.3"," 20 of 124 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","20","124","0","3"

I used to have IL-2 Forgotten Battles, but I decided to replace it with this. I have only played a little bit, but I think it is enough to write this review. Buying the thing was pretty simple but I had problems starting the game up. It was extremely frustrating but I submitted my problem to Steam Support, got an answer instantly,  followed the instructions that they gave me and it worked perfectly. IL-2 is of course getting old, but it has it's advantages. It plays very smoothly on my computer (A windows 7 that is kinda clogged with stuff that has built up over the years) and you get more options than newer sims. I thought this would be a good purchase instead of a newer one, since I get so many aircraft. IL-2 Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad (recently released) is a great, high-end sim, but you can only fight with Russian and German planes and during the same time of year and the same location. This was a better option for me because I can fly what I feel like flying. Just today I reanacted Pearl Harbor, then I flew a 1944 USAAF mission over Europe. Also the game has language of course, and some noseart is a little, well, you know. But this can be fixed. You can switch off subtitles, and for languages that you can understand you can simply delete the "bad word" files. And nose art files you dont approve of can be deleted also. If my instructions arent very clear, I'm sure you can look up how to do it. Anyways, the aircraft selection is wonderful, you can fly aircraft from all the major powers, (some smaller countries too). You can fly alot of stuff from 1930s biplanes, P-51s, all the way up to late WW2 jets, including some wacky German experimental aircraft. Also, a very neat feature is that you can take a picture of your face and use it to make your own pilot! You can zoom in on your plane and it's you in the cockpit! I love it. You can create your own nose art and slogans too, along with entire paint jobs. But I dont know a whole lot about that besides adding art and text to the plane. So yeah, overall I would recommend it, it works for me. "You stay classy". *clicks tongue, puts on goggles, and flies away* Merry Christmas by the way. Hopefully you'll be getting something from steam. I'm probably going to get T-72 Balkans on Fire next.","November 30, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If that had happened though, the Japanese wouldn't have attempted the first seaborne assault, but would have waited for their carriers, and attacked in force. So in my opinion, re-writing history doesn't work!\nLove the way it allows me to add in naval and land units, and have a mini sea battle going on at the same time.","January 22, 2015","true","66.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can make the plane as hard or as easy to fly if you want, customize skins, and create your own maps in the in-game map editor.  Graphics are a bit dated, but this does not distract from the hours of fun you can have.  To participate in multiplayer, however, you must know the IP of your host server.

The voices of the AI pilots are amazing, even in hungarian. You can tell a lot of effort has been put into the game and its story mode. I was absolutely amazed by the detail of the campaign map. I cannot speak much for the aircraft flight models (from a realistic point of view), as I have no idea how these planes perform in real life, but I have never been frustrated while flying. Every crash has been my fault. The interior cockpits of all the planes are at least decent, with most of them being very impressive.\nAll in all I would like to suggest this game for any aircraft enthusiast. This game still holds up nicely today, and I hope simulator designers will use this game as a base for many features of the games that they are working on.","December 24, 2014","true","200.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then select old_version, ignore the code box, then apply. It'll start!\n\n\nAn oldie but a goodie!\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik has developed from an Eastern Front ww2 flght sim into an absolute monster! It's detailed, unforgiving at times, takes effort to get into, and has a steep learning curve. Despite, or because of all of that, it's an awesome game. Given it's pretty old now, most mid range systems will do well with this. The graphics were good for its time, and still hold up ok in the sky.\n\nThere's a huge online community of verteran players making all sorts of custom missions and skins for this game. Skins are easy to import.\n\nThese days there's plenty of action for the other fronts of WW2 as well, especially in the Pacific.\n\nDamage is well modelled, flight characteristics have been well researched, with only a few glitches, and aircraft interiors are beautifully done. Oleg , the man who started all this, was insistent that no aircraft be imported until the cockpit was fully accurate.\n\nI'd recommend this for someone who has an interest in flight from this era, and is willing to put in the hours to learn to fly adequately. I'd suggest starting not in your favorite aircraft, but something more forgiving like an IL-2 to learn to fly. Eventually you'll be able to handle other aircraft no problem. Landing is a big challenge, I've played over 2000 hours on this game back in its CD only days and I'm still  more nervous about landing than combat!\n\nThere's also some "what if?" aircraft included, hence the title 1946. They're fun, and make for an interesting experience, but don't add to the realism. There's some fascinating player made 1946 missions out there well worth playing.\n\nThis is not for the casual gamer. I can't stress this enough. This game demands your attention and your commitment. do so and it'll reward you. A number of real-life veterans have said this game captures the difficulty of ww2 air combat. Don't expect an easy ride.","January 17, 2015","true","34.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are also TONS of mods out there too. For  $9.99 it was certainly worth it. Like a lot of older games some modern systems might not run it but with all the discussion boards and groups out there you might get lucky and find a fix if your computer won't run it.

The aircraft are modeled very realistically featuring an advanced damage model where individual parts of your aircraft can take damage and affect the performance of the plane.\nMost of the aircraft in the game are very realistically modeled using performance data from actual aircraft. (except the Nazi secret aircraft added in the 1946 edition).\nYou can play story campaigns, dynamic campaigns and single missions.The game includes a very advanced campaign editor that lets you create your own campaign and missions.\n\nTo truly have fun in this game you need to play multiplayer or get into the modding scene. However matchmaking is not possible from within the game and you need to get Hyperlobby (which is free). Once you have that installed you can easily join multiplayer matches.\n\nA huge (and still active) modding community keeps adding new content and really adds to the games replay-ability. From extra missions to entire story campaigns, hundreds of downloadable aircraft and  semi official patches that steam will not install and you have to get it manually.\n\nIl2 is a must play game for any flight sim fan or any aircraft enthusiast.

There many other cool features.\n\nThe only downside for me is the campaign, because it´s take so many time and are not something that catch you and get you evolved, i just don´t feel like it is a campaign.   But i had a lot of fun doing custom missions, and multiplayer can be real exciting and challenging.\n\nIL2 have a lot of option to setup the game more easy and friendly, but in cost of the realism of course, i´d rather play it "as real as it gets".\nYou will NEED a joystick to play, as any flightsim, but this in special, without a good stick this game can be really disappointing.\n\nThe controls and commands are very simple, no secret..\n\nIf you like WW2 aviation era, and want a realistic simulator that you need to spend a lot of time to learn until you get proficient, this is the way to go.\n\nIf you just want to do crazy stunts and frag some enemies right of the box then forget it.","June 2, 2015","true","87.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plenty of aircraft to fly, which starts from the first monoplanes and goes to the dawn of jet figters, so you never run out of birds to fly.  A great career mode, and unrivaled realism.  You can make the plane as hard or as easy to fly if you want, customize skins, and create your own maps in the in-game map editor.  Graphics are a bit dated, but this does not distract from the hours of fun you can have.  To participate in multiplayer, however, you must know the IP of your host server.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/recommended/15320/","AdamMil","Adam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamMil/","240 products in account","I can partially recommend this "game". It's an excellent simulator with a wide variety of aircraft and mission types, including carrier-based operations, and the price is great. It's difficult and you'll need to put in quite a few hours of practice before you can make successful bombing runs and shoot down other fighters, but it's fair.\n\nHowever, there's really not much of a game here, there's essentially no story, and there's a lot of time spent doing rather tedious things. For example, I was playing a bomber campaign and so many missions went like this: 1) take off from the carrier and get in formation (a few minutes of fun), 2) fly in a straight line for 20 minutes (boring), 3) set up a bombing run and drop bombs (2-3 minutes of great excitement), 4) spend 20 minutes flying back (boring), 5) land on the carrier (a few minutes of fun). There's time compression, but it can't be safely set very high. Sometimes the mission generator mixes it up, but the vast majority of my time was spent uneventfully flying to and from the mission areas. I'm sure it's realistic, but it's not exciting or fun.\n\nIn summary, it's a great simulator that lets you do all kinds of military flying and the huge number of (mostly randomized) campaigns gives tremendous replay value, but after you get the hang of it most of your time will be spent feeling bored unless you actually enjoy flying in a straight line in formation for 30-60 minutes per mission.\n\nI've heard that the multiplayer is decent but I don't believe there's any matchmaking so you'll have to find a community if you want to try it.","December 29, 2014","true","33.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have accurate modeling and caliber for plane guns and have many varients of certain planes that add a challange, and an edge to combat schnarios. The campgain is a great time waster and has lots of good story to it. This game has all the 1946 DLC for free with it aswell\n\nThe cons: The games multiplayer is very very messed up so much so i had to download another thing just to get the multiplayer on, even then it didnt work. You're locked to only a select amount of planes, while plentiful it would be nice to fly other planes without having to go through the backbreaking process of adding every single named plane in a map editor for it.\n\nCoclusion: This game was pivitol for its timeline and is still one of the best airplane simulators out there the developers also made other games for it and are currently working on a battle of stalingrad game check it out!.","October 3, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Best way to start this game is to fly single missions in an easy to fly plane (I recommend the La-5FN) until you're comfortable with:\n\n1. Taking off and landing\n2. Performing aerobatics\n3. One-on-one air combat (Basic Fighter Maneuvers). To learn this, I highly recommend the Falcon 3 BFM tutorial - look up "Art of the Kill Falcon 3" on Youtube.\n\nUltimately, though, remember that you're basically learning to fly combat aircraft, so be prepared to give the game some time. It'll take a while to get comfortable, and you'll be pulling G's with sim (and real life!) pilots with 1000s of hours of flight time under their belts, but as stated in other reviews, it's a very enjoyable game once you finally straighen up and fly right.","August 12, 2012","true","99.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the best part is, it can be as realistic or arcadey as you'd like, meaning all flight fans can enjoy it even if you don't want to worry about realistic gunnery (Which I wouldn't recommend using at first) or worrying about blowing your engine up.\n\nBut if you DO crank the realism up... well it can be quite challenging, but also a blast, especially when you manage to hit a BF-109 mid turn juuust right and send it smoking into the ground below. (And for added effect, if the guy survived your attack and jumped... you can always shoot his parachute...)","July 17, 2015","true","145.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 it is!\n\nIL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 is a classic WWII plane simulator with many planes to fly. If you'd ever like a classic dogfight with a friend, this game is good. It is also a good game for stuff like LAN-parties as it can host servers on LAN-only.\n\nThis game might be really old, but it is just an absolute gem. It works on new computers (tested on Windows 10 and a gaming PC bought in the beginning of 2015, works perfectly fine in Full HD resolution). The game can literally work on any calculator you own as it is like 10 years old.\n\nDon't let that fool you though, this is quite a good plane simulator. To start up your plane, you need to do a lot of stuff before going into the skies. Physics can be as realistic as you want them to be. Unrealistic physics are the most fun, since can bounce into the sea and still fly, but realism mode changes all that except graphics-wise.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n+ Both realistic and unrealistic can be amazing in their own ways\n+ Runs basically on any computer that uses Steam\n+ Compatible with new screens\n+ Hilarious glitches\n+ Great choice of WWII planes and even prototypes\n+ Great for LAN-parties\n\n- Quite an old game\n- Graphics are not the best in the world\n- Unrealistic mode glitches are fun, but sometimes not fun for your opponents\n- Render problems at some points (just check my oil lake pictures, that is meant to be a river and a lake)\n\n\nI CAN recommend this game to anyone who likes their plane simulators, but not everybody will like this ancient gem. I'll leave it up to you, as I DO have more positive points than negative ones, but the negative ones are more significant.","October 10, 2015","true","21.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where-as most games only come with a mere handful, this sim comes with literally hundreds of WW2 aircraft – and through 3rd party modification (such as CUP[www.sas1946.com]) there is hundreds and hundreds more, not just for WW2, but for WW1 through to modern. The flight models of these aircraft are also really well done – even by today’s standards. Plus it has to be said for the vast majority of these planes there is few to no alternative simulators where you will be able to fly them all in one package without huge expense or comprising flight model accuracy - at least until the newer IL-2 games have been expanded over time.\n\nMultiplayer is tricky but certainly functional and the game runs fine for me on Windows 10, but a certainly better experience with mods installed. If you have interest in WW2 aviation, or aviation in general then for the price of £6.99 for literally hundreds and hundreds of available aircraft to fly, you should have this title in your library.","April 18","true","124.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I advise researching online various guides and tutorials to help you get a good grip on the aircraft and proceedures you will need to master to become an "ace" of the skies.\n\nThis game has an excellent selections of Aircraft & Missions, I am also currently using the Sturmovik Stab 6.3 (1946) app.\n\nFor reference my test system is:\n\nDell Optilex 755\nWin 7 - 64bit\nIntel Dual Core E5300 @ 2.6Ghz\n4 GB DDR2 Ram\nATI 6350HD @ 512mb\n\nIts hardly suprising I pull 60+ fps on high settings using this dated unit. I would advise you get a decent joystick with at least a twist rudder. Preferably rudder pedals.\n","April 15","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
