It feels almost same in every character. Only difference is attack range and skills...\n- Needs more game modes.\n- No assist system. It should give you assist when you did half of the damage or when you healed your teammates.\n\nSuggestions- Better communication system. Such as microphone chat or radio messages. Also please let us change chat buttons. I am used to press "Y and U" to chat.\n- Do not cap FPS at 60. Just give us an option in settings.\n- In game currency that you can gain by playing.\n- For beta, make a quick "bug report" form instead of "send feedback" form.\n- In game tutorial. Even though i read the tutorial page 2 times, i didn't understand when i started.\n- Ability to host servers (local and multiplayer).\n- Map editor. Maybe not now, but in the future...\n- Bots should be able to play more characters.\n- Mute and Report buttons in TAB menu.\n\nEven though cons are more dominant, i recommend this game. Remember that this game is just few days old. I think it has potential!","May 14","true","17.6"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","52","61","4","1"

Play 10-20 matches and you'll love the game. It's not really complicated, but there are little tricks that you can do to make you that much better than your opponent, like bounce jumping with the healer.\n\nCon:\nNot enough people on it. That's my ONLY problem with it. I'm looking at the servers at different times of the day, and recently it has been hard to find a game with enough people.\n\n\nFor those who haven't tried it yet, and have a competitive nature to you, come try the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carboxymoron/recommended/392060/","carboxymoron","carbo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carboxymoron/","325 products in account","Total snorefest. Gameplay is bland, everything you do is low impact -- low damage skills, low healing, limited mobility. You feel like you're chipping away at each other with foam darts until one of you dies of boredom. There's no satisfaction of landing a good skill in other MOBAs or making a clutch shot in an FPS.\n\nIf teams aren't completely mismatched in skill, the game is a perpetual stalemate because the respawn timer is about the time needed to cross half the map. This means that after winning a fight at the middle objective (required to make the end objective "vulnerable"), the entire enemy team will respawn before you can get to their base.\n\nGraphics are generically cartoony, like TF2 but with low-quality wizard hats. Animation and sound are simple and repetitive, which only highlights how low impact your skills are.\n\nThe only interesting feature is the on-the-fly class switching. You choose 3 classes to play (out of 5 classes: 2 ranged DPS, 1 melee tank, 1 melee DPS, and 1 support) and can switch between them on a short timer. Each class has a passive skill that triggers when you switch to that class (e.g. the tank has a short duration of invulnerability, support does a small AoE burst heal). I'd love to see this mechanic in a proper game.","May 13","false","0.8"," 39 of 73 people (53%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","53","39","73","7","0"

The enemy is running away because they are low on health, quickly switch to the mage and finish them.\n\nI love this game so far.\nA very strategic type of combat, switching classes for your abilities, yet you are nothing without your team.\n\nIt has a few bugs with the options, I had to play it in window mode because full screen make the game go to my second monitor.\nAlso the buttons on the option menu are a bit buggy.\n\nI hope we can see quite a lot more characters in this game to play with.","May 14","true","1.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Allowing each player to effectively be a tank or dps with some even having self heals. You must as a team take cotrol of a point on the map (king of the hill style) before the enemies crystals become vulnerable. This can prove difficult as the crystals tend to be close to the enemys spawn point.\n\nGraphics and animations are quite colourful and unique and fairly high resolution. Sounds could be touched up a little but for alpha they are working well enough. Something to consider for beta/release is how janky the characters feel when they are walking, I feel like a tank when using the potion throwing girl class.\n\nThe game is going to be released as F2P with kill effects and other cosmetic items indended to offset development costs. Worth picking up if you have some spare time to help bug test and give feedback or have some friends to play since at this time in ALPHA (just before beta release) the servers seem fairly dead besides bots.\n\nI would give it a 2/5 in its current state, considering its in alpha and would like to see how they continue to improve the game as development progresses.","May 13","false","0.6"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","12","26","0","7"

You basically pick a combination of 3 classes that can switch mid-battle. There are currently 5 classes to choose from. Warrior, Healer, Vampire, Pirate and Mage. Warrior and Vampire are melee while the rest are ranged. You basically go around capturing inhibitors and destryoing the enemy bases crystal. If you destroy 3 of them before they destroy yours, you win. It's not a novel concept as you can find this in Team Fortress, Unreal or Quake but it's fine.\n\nThe game passes but I would compare the game to Overwatch and find that Overwatch is better. This would make me veer towards Overwatch instead of Battle Soul.\n\nPROS\n1. Different characters and their special abilities.\nIt's nice to see someone stepping up to Team Fortress and Overwatch.\n\n2. Ability to switch roles\nYou can change from DPS, Tank and Support any time you want. Do note that there is a cooldown though and your HP is converted from 1 class to another as a percentage of HP remaining.\n\nCONS\n1. High Ping from Players\nHorrible game experience when this occurs. The game was good until a high ping player (ms 268) joined the game and thoroughly ruined the experience. The game froze every 3 seconds and nothing moved.\n\n2. Low Player Population\nLiterally 0 players in their servers. Most of the players were bots.\n\n3. Nothing Novel\nThe concept of capturing points and destroying the base is so old-fashioned and cliche.\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Separating high-ping players from low-ping players.\nWith such a low player count, I understand that it's hard to do. But\n\n2. Traditional roles\nThe Sniper class (long range unit), Rogue class (invisibility) and Shield-bearer (Hard Tank).\n\n3. Unique Races\nMaybe some non-human units, like a Troll, Werewolf or Orc.\n","May 12","true","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

So is the case with Battlesouls. A Very cool idea, which is missing everything but the most basic of features... and a cash shop.\n\n\nFull review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNQ8I2bhL3g\n\nTextual:\nBattlesouls main concept is selecting a group of 3 characters, each with two abilities and using a hot-switching during a match to switch between them. The goal is to destroy the enemies "crystal" 3 times, while controlling a central inhibitor structure.\n\nThis part of the game is actually pretty fun for a few hours... but the game lacks any meaningful content outside of this, which a myriad of other games do as well. My main opinion is that this game is being pushed out to soon, to fast and with WAY to little. Being free to play - while having a functional cash-shop - doesn't make it okay by calling it a "Beta".\n\nSo, what does the game have?\n\n- 5 characters, where you pick 3 at any time\n- 2 kill animations (paid)\n- A bunch of account icons (paid)\n- A quick match with EU servers only.\n- 3 maps\n- 1 game mode.... that's it.\n\nwhat doesn't the game have?\n\n- Progression\n- Unlocks (except account icons)\n- Game modes\n- Variety of characters\n- Ranked\n- Custom games (private or public)\n\n\nOutside of this: The animations feel "feathery" without weight, and are very repetitive. The music / sounds are Bare bones and the balance in both characters, re-spawn timers and pickups is just not there.\n\nAs such, there just isn't a way for me to recommend this title. Maybe a year down the line.... but until then, don't spend your money on it.","May 12","false","9.0"," 25 of 55 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","25","55","3","11"

I think that the mechanic of switching between 3 completely different heroes is really cool.  Right now I feel like the mage hero might be a bit more powerful than anyone else.  I think there should be a popup system letting you know that you got a kill or an assist.  The only thing that I was afraid of was that eventually with no in-game progression/leveling system, the game would get very repetitive after a few games.

The game itself is fun but right now there are only two maps and one game mode that I have been playing on.  And there are not alot of people.  It will definitely be more fun once more players start to join and when more modes are in rotation.\n\nIts not pay to win by any means, hopefully that wont change.\n\nLooks nice,  runs smoothly, and alot of fun. Not much is wrong with the game other than small player base and hopefully that will change.","May 17","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

But there is time, it is still in beta. Although i didnt notice any bugs for during my playtime, i would still leave this game in "Early Access" because it could use more content.\n\nPros:\n- good tutorial\n- during the time im writing this review, game is not pay to win, only thing that you can buy is pets that dance around you (they dont deal any damage and are purely cosmetical), some other taunts, pictures for your avatar, and xp boost (xp boost for levels that reward you nothing)\n- servers worldwide (us-w,us-e,eu,sea,sa)\n- has unique medivial art style and characters that fit it\n- developers are dedicated to game and listening to players\n- there are bots for empty servers\n\nNeutral:\n- you pick 3 characters, and you can switch them any time, even in middle of fight; they also have special abilities which activate upon switching\n-you can pick the server you want to play on, instead of timed matchup (like on LoL, etc..)\n\nCons:\n- even though game was released last month, playerbase is sadly small\n- game feels really bland, and its kinda weird to play, characters could use more skills\n- there are only 5 characters now, and they could be balanced little better\n- only one game mode\n- there is no competitive gameplay, rankings of some sort, however it wouldnt work with small playerbase anyways\n- no customization,\n- no sense of progression, only thing that changes as you play the game longer is levels, which reward you nothing as there is no currency, or nothing to unlock\n- cosmetics are kinda expensive\n- it could use screen/sound indication after killing enemy, the small one on side takes some time to look from screen at it (this is very minor issue however)\n\nMost of these cons should be fixed eventualy, because developers are still working steadily in order to improve the game. They have made mistake by releasing the game, instead they should've labeled it as "early access", because it lacks content. However developers seem really nice updating the game every week and making the game non-p2w, so i will support them in making this game better.","June 4","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
