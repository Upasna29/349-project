At that time, many of the advertisements were compairing this game to Terraria, hence the nature of my review\n\nI had a lot of hope for this game.\n\nLet me preface this by saying I love Terraria.  I played a ton of it with friends and by myself back when it was first launched, and again with all the updates with my girlfriend.  I went from thinking it was a 2D Minecraft rip off to a great game that reminds me a bit of your old school games (Ghost and Goblins comes to mind with the new Expert mode)\n\nTerraria had its charm in the exploration.  You died, a lot.  You learned from said deaths.  You learned different materials make different items.  You fail a lot, in funny and unexpected ways (i.e. Farming Wall of Flesh, then realizing that I had been equipping my armor in the social slot).  The exploration was in both the world itself, and the mechanics.  They gave you nothing, said "Here is the world, have fun" and that was it.\n\nEdge of Space forgets that.  I start a new character, and I am inundated with tutorials as if I was a toddler.  The game literally stops everything to tell you to right click to pick up an item from a chest, including a video.  I am all for tutorials done right, but this one is just patronizing.\n\nThe UI is just trash.  I have a character menu, inventory, tech, ect.  They are all small enough to fit on the screen all at once, yet they are their own movable UIs with wasted space.  Not to mention if I want to craft something to equip, I may have to go through three different menus for it.  This developer took a huge step backwards in design.\n\nThe character control is also a problem.  It just feels slow and unresponsive.  I felt like I was on a server lagging in single player (and with the rig I have, this game should not give me any delays whatsoever).  The feel of everything was just off too.  Mining is aiming a laser at a rock and waiting.  Terraria did it right, because you would hear the clanking as you mined, making it feel like you were doing something.\n\nLastly is the performance.  It felt like it was running at 30, because I was getting that same blurriness I would get at lower frame rates.  The game however has a FPS counter that was staying at a solid 60.  I pulled up the Steam FPS counter, and low and behold, while it did stay around 60, it would very occasionally dip, but the in game FPS counter stayed at 60.  I have a feeling that this counter is not accurate, and the developer has static text up there, but I will not say 100%.\n\nI will end with this, Have I been harsh on this game, comparing it to Terraria?  Yes, very much so.  They have marketed it as the spiritual successor to Terraria, and thus started the comparison.  Sadly, it fell very short of the mark they were aiming for.\n\nI wish to put this into the actual review itself, since this actually has me hopeful about the future of this game.  From the head developer in the comments from this review "Thank you for your review, i think there rae some valid points we are trying to address. At the same time the game is meant to feel different."  The developer actully listens top criticism in a positive way, which could make this game potentially great in the future.","July 18, 2015","false","2.5"," 348 of 427 people (81%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","81","348","427","19","13"

If you don’t feel like digging down, walking to an island’s edge and jumping to the one bellow is always an option. (And having a jetpack from the start helps you not to fall to death this way. Usually.)\n\nWhen it comes to combat, Edge of Space gives highest “Player vs Environment” feeling than other games of its genre. Instead of challenging powerful bosses like in Terraria, EoS’ focus in on fighting ever present and deadly “common” enemies, who present constant and serious threat.\n\nHowever, ever-present enemy threat has side effect of limiting player’s ability to build in lower areas of the world. Aside from danger to player, many mid-late game enemies has structure-damaging attacks, and will easily wreck both your base and landscape you were trying to preserve.\n\nAlso on the negative side, Edge of Space is rather lacking in variety: there are only 3 main biomes in the game, and they don’t feel as unique as Terraria or Starbound’s biomes. Visually the game isn’t very pleasing to an eye either, and everything is mostly brown or metallic-gray (possibly done on purpose for “realism” – we all know that Real Is Brown).\n\nOverall, Edge of Space is quite good, and I can fully recommend it to fans of sandbox exploration/building, who already had their fill with Terraria and Starbound. And those who are more interesting in action than building will probably find that aspect of EoS even more appealing than that of other games of its genre.","February 14, 2014","true","192.8"," 604 of 778 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","604","778","0","14"

In terms of the knowledge progression I'm about 6% complete or so it says. I can say confidently enough that the game is interesting and has some decent mechanics that set it apart from similar games like Terraria and Starbound.\n\nHowever, this game is very much a buggy mess right now and I would not say this is worthy to be called V1.0, it is very much still an early access game in my mind and if you are hoping to play this game without upset, I feel I need to tell you that you will be let down.\n\n-Mining\nMining feels clunky at the best of times, it doesn't work like terraria or starbound where if you click on a tile then that tile gets removed, it's a directional thing and the mining tool isn't center with the playable characters model, it is off to the side a little and it makes mining a real chore.\n\n-Monsters\nThe monster spawns are attrocious, they spawn anywhere even in the air, which makes falling down elevators you dig suicidal, it encourages the use of teleportation but really I find this a constricting mechanic and very poorly thought out by the developers. A fix that would make everyone happy in my opinion would be to limit mob spawns to front tiles or certain background tiles (such as dirt, clay etc)\n\n-Monsters continued\nMobs can spawn in the air, regardless of the foreground or background tiles, I have confirmed this, and this doesn't only effect elevators and general exploration, mobs can spawn inside hangers you built for your vehicles, and those ships will die as the mob mindlessly floats back and forth rebounding off walls etc. This is completely ridiculous and wastes your resources needlessly.\n\n-UI\nThe UI is a complete mess, it is extremely user unfriendly and lacks specific interactions like shift clicking to place items into recipe facility entities like the carbon refinery for example. You have to mouse them in one by one and when recipes require 5 items that are cluttered around your inventory, it is not fun to micromanage and makes organising inventory space and much more, a very annoying task.\n\n-UI overlays\nTo add onto some of the UI problems the game has, the UI overlaps the screen in some instances, such as when "dominating" an area (or setting am item recipe as a task), the overlay that displays you have conquered the area acts as a none transparant pop up, basically it stops you from shooting or building while mousing over the overlay and this can lead to some pretty cheap deaths as I have experienced.\n\n-Gameplay\nThe gameplay for the most part is fine, you progress at a steady pace and you are rewarded for killing monsters and mining generated tiles. However the dungeons you come across such as the zombie rooms seem to feel extremely off. You have to destroy 4 spawners and once that is complete, you have to plant 3 bombs, leave the chunk and then the entire land is just blown up. Any decoration blocks you might have wanted from the room are deleted, and you're left with an unappealing piece of land that does nothing. The game says you've "dominated" the land but you're just left with an ugly crater. Furthermore, you aren't rewarded in the slightest by blowing the chunk up, no EXP, no loot, nothing.\n\n-SNAILS\nHOLY ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥, SNAILS AND FROGS HAVE TO BE THE SINGLE MOST ANNOYING MECHANIC I HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN A VIDEO GAME. PLEASE NERF THEIR SPAWN RATE, IN FACT THAT BRINGS ME ONTO MY NEXT POINT\n\n-Spawn rate\nMonster spawn rate either seems to be so few or so disgustingly unbearable, the amount is completely random, you coulld be spelunking in a cave and come across one or two mud crabs, but then teleport back to base and an entire army of frogs, snails and crabs will rain from the sky.\n\n-Frame rate\nThis is a really unfortunate aspect of the game, I have a really high end computer and I get frame lock ups quite often, it's not a long lock up but it is very common and happens in loaded chunks even if I am standing still. I don't have a clue what causes it and as far as I can tell from other reviews this seems to be a common problem.\n\n-Rare crashes\nThe game as crashed a few times on me now. both times have happened when starting up a pregenerated world and entering a container too quickly. I am sure this will be fixed but it added to the frustration this game is to play right now.\n\n-Instance glitches\nIn an instance you are similar in proprties to that of adventure mode in minecraft. You cannot place or remove blocks basically. If you happen to click too fast on a door (which is basically a teleporter to another part of the dungeon) yoiu can very easily be teleported out of bounds and you have to exit your game to fix the problem. The items needed to enter an instance dungeon aren't cheap so I find this to be a very harmful bug that impedes progression.\n\n-Exploration\nNow this may be due to the overall difficulty of the game, and I may be playing the game without fully understanding the metagame and what not, but I find exploration into the second biome (I think it's refered to as the comet biome, it's the ice themed one) to be extremely unforgiving. I have the weapons to deal with the monsters there in small numbers, but as I have said, as you fall down to lower levels, mobs spawn in the sky and can basically 1 hit ko you as you fall, but that's not the only problem, as you land on the surface of the main tier 2 biome, mobs that are faster than you are generated all around you, on the ground and in the sky and that makes exploration and progression an absolute chore. I have tried to find a way to set my spawn down there instead of on the first biome and I'm not sure how. The wiki for Edge of Space is extremely outdated and many pages are missing.\n\n-Exploration continued\nI have solved the issue of teleporting to lower levels, you have to build 2 command centres to teleport between areas. However now that I don't have to deal with the annoying elevator scenario, I have discovered that towards the lower half of the second biome, bears and penguins spawn in great abundance, regular bears can 2 shot you, and have more than doube the players moving speed so in tight spaces it is very hard to escape, they spawn almost everywhere in the cave systems down there and I simply cannot progress further below. I enjoy a hard game but I think something seems off with the spawn rate, they appear so frequently that I feel stunted to go any deeper. You might be thinking that I should gear up a little more before progressing, which is true, but all the radium I can find in the ice and all the illuminated crystals (that can drop radium) have been mined up in the top half of the biome. I made the mistake of building one of those NPC anchors with the radium (he was a useless NPC as well, did 100% nothing and that brings me onto my next point shortly) and now I lack the amount to create the desert armor set.\n\n-NPC Anchors\nI really like this idea, it's another resource sink and the potential for some really cool bonuses is there, but the developers really missed the mark on most of them. I believe Rob the robot is the most useful, fully upgraded he will drop Titanium ore for you occasionally, I have about a stack and a half of the stuff just sitting around and as Titanium is a pain to harvest, I like this NPC and my investment was worth it. However, NPCs such as Vinny (The potato plant) do nothing, regardless of the investment, his one ability is that every time you feed him 5 biomass and 5 ice, he will glow in the dark. That's ridiculous, I have lights everywhere, the investment and the space for his anchor completely outway his use. This is very similar for the other NPC's too, they could provide cool bonuses like 5% to sneak, or ore in a radius will glow, something that would actually be fun to invest these resources into. But nope, glow in the dark plants are apparently useful.\n\n-Hit word limit, much more is broken-","September 21, 2015","false","28.6"," 258 of 328 people (79%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","79","258","328","19","54"

Today the game came out of Early Access as v.1.0, and unfortunately, the game is still rather hard to digest.\n\n\nWhen I first played, the game had a few graphical issues, and it looked like it could have needed something like an editor to an author. Fine, I could always go back to it - though at this point I was beginning to regret buying this. At this point (and a couple subsequent playthroughs), I felt the game was not intuitive, unfriendly to beginners, and rather difficult for a game where you literally build your character to advance. Gathering materials? The laser pick was extremely weak and could not be as easily manipulated as Starbound's (as much as I don't like comparing, especially to Starbound). I took a long time gathering enough supplies (after dying a few times, some from mobs in the starting area and some from falling off the edge of the map) to make anything. Also, while the game no longer has the difficulty (sort of...) and the 10 free respawn limit, those things severely discouraged me from doing anything. So I waited.\n\nToday, I opened the game with no expectations of things and found myself facing similar issues from the first time I played. The UI needs a lot of work - this doesn't look at all like a modern game with a futuristic setting - the dialog boxes look like just hastily placed rectangles and fonts (I spotted some serif fonts...) look like they were not even picked with intent. Some of the tips need editing in syntax and grammar, and overall, the game feels very much like a beta still. I wasn't pleased by the "tutorial" either, since the first thing I saw was a codex full of unnecessary text.\n\nNothing in the game has struck me as intuitive so far, even regarding the gathering of materials. I got the DLC items and the pick is marginally stronger than the starting one, and while it's got a wider beam (3 tiles wide), the width becomes useless because the pick target cannot be directly chosen - so if you just dig downward, for example, in the same direction, you just end up with a 1 tile wide chasm, walls either damaged or already "healed" to normal. Everything seems so grindy already - I know that games won't have you start off with good gear ready to kill bosses, but in the first quest of the tutorial, each one of those enemies (although they do no damage) took many hits to die. I don't see any fun in spending minutes killing common mobs (because face it, you're gonna attract aggro for all those missed attacks and some of those enemies move too fast with the starting rifle) and then spending minutes gathering.\n\nI'm going to pass. Sorry, I tried, but more than 2 years did not give sufficient progress for me to enjoy this - too grindy and too unpolished.","September 17, 2015","false","3.7"," 334 of 434 people (77%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","77","334","434","14","26"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtuallyReal/recommended/238240/","VirtuallyReal","VirtuallyReal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtuallyReal/","253 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n***I will retain the original review here, but I will add and mark new points. If  you want my most up-to-date review, scroll down.***\n\nI'm going to be completely honest; there's a lot of potential here and I hope it reaches it, but so far I'm just not seeing it. I'm trying not to be too harsh, I respect the dev team and their game, but here are my impressions...\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind with this game is; There's alpha games, and then there's ALPHA games. While I play a lot of games in alpha and beta stages, I usually enjoy the experience because they often bring something new and innovative to the table to make them interesting. Sadly, I'm just not seeing it with the alpha of this game. There's little that I would consider standout, innovate, or unique. The mining lazer is cool, but not groundbreaking, and mindnumbingly slow without any upgrades in sight. At the very least, it should have the option to heat the targeted rock and at least one sqaure of the rocks around it at a slower rate. This would speed up the process while still allowing precision. Jetpacks are cool, but the limited energy and energy regen followed by blind jumps makes them more frustrating than anything. If nothing else, the early jetpacks could use a massive buff until more is added and that situation is sorted out strictly for exploration purposes. Beyond those two features, the game doesn't have much to offer.\n\nMy next gripe is the actual game's goal and layout. The game gives you the goal of terraforming, and that's about it. I really didn't like that goal. I don't feel like it's a goal at all. Terraforming is just something you DO in this kind of game from start to finish. I don't feel like something I'm going to be doing anyways -and can do at any point- should be my final goal. It gives little to work towards other than "look I mined out this rock lol." If my goal is to terraform, than I want to be given a final idea of what I'm terraforming towards, rather than just changing the landscape slowly. Which brings me to my other argument; the real "goal" players give themselves is simply going downwards. I feel like the only way to progress is to mine resources and then continue falling downwards in hopes of new discoveries. There's also multiple levels as you fall downwards, resulting in higher risk areas. This is great and all but then why terraform anything on the top levels if the better resources and more interesting stuff is downwards? Why even set your roots and your house at the top just to work your way back down and farther again? I'm not trying to be harsh, I just think some good thought has to be put into these concepts before the game moves forward and falls flat on its face.\n\nI'm hoping that my investment, and the investments of everyone else gets put to good use here. I think somewhere in this alpha is a great game, but right now it's barely in a playable stage. It's just very unsinspiring when compared to the games everyone, myself included, will immediately pin it to- being Terraria and Starbound. Both of those games have unique and recognizeable art, music, gameplay, and attitude. Even the art in Edge of Space feels cluttered and weird and just like it needs to have its own personality to it. I will say that I love the music at the opening menu though.\n\nClosing thoughts; I don't regret supporting this game and I hope it continues getting support so that it can become a full-fledged competitor with other similar games, and hold a meaningful spot in a steam library. That said, until the game brings proof that it's serious and has something to prove to the gaming world, I wouldn't recommend putting coin into it to have it gather dust in your steam library.\n\n\n*** As of Jan. 30th, a few months after original review\n\nWell I'm not entirely sure I can list everything they did, but the devs are pulling through on this one. With some UI overhauls, and massive variable tweaks, even the initial few minutes feel much more active and fluid than before. The progress curve is much more obvious right now and you have to work towards your progress points individually. Exploration is a bit easier now as jetpacks have recieved decent buffs, nulling my earlier complaint about them. Also mining has been considerably buffed, with an early "overcharged" mining lazer now available that damages at least 2 layers of blocks at a time. So my mining complaint is decently nulled. There's a bunch of other tweaks/buffs that improve fluidity of gameplay including changes to weapons, monster health, so on so on.\n\nMy initial impression before was that the game was an unplayable wreck and I was a bit disappointed in it. Right now my impression is that I can really start to get into this game. Although I feel it's a bit lacking in overall content right now, yaddayadda it's an alpha, we've been here before. It could just use a bit more... Variation? Maybe just several different sprites for the wildlife or something. The sights get a bit repetitive at the start. I haven't moved too far in yet as there is quite a lot of grinding involved now.\n\nAll-in-all I'm refraining from saying I recommend this game just yet. While it has shown significant improvement and I feel like the devs have listened to complaints and worked to better the game, I'm still not ready to recommend this game. I'm going to see if the devs are still dedicated to improving the game and adding content, and if they seem committed and the game starts to come together I will change it to recommended in a heartbeat.","September 2, 2014","false","31.7"," 147 of 183 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","147","183","5","6"

The time in development (in my opinion) should have seen "Edge of Space" in a much more polished state than it currently is, considering the 2D style of the game.  *For the record, I understand the nature of "Early Access", but I do not believe that games should forever exist in a state of early access simply to justify financial or developmental limitations.  Having said that; open world, 2D scrolling, space exploration, voxel-based laser mining, crafting matrix, etc....   we've seen this song and dance play out again and again with the expectation that, maybe this time, something new and refreshing will find us.  Well, for me at least, it did not with Edge of Space.  I could have overlooked the poorly rendered and seemingly unrelated intro clip, a clunky tutorial that introduced an even clunkier UI, and even the low-res character, enemy, and background models.  What I couldn't overlook, however, were the poor aiming/targeting/tracking mechanics of the various starter (and presumably all) weapons and tools.  Proper hit detection, field of effect, and cursor-reticle alignment are so critical to a game like this, that to experience immediate frustration and difficulty utilizing said tools told me most of what I needed to know about Edge of Space.  I know, I didn't even play for a full hour, but let me be clear: This is a Starbound, and thus, a Terraria clone.  Unfortunately, it doesn't even rise to the level of quality those games possess, not to mention the lack of charm.  I appreciate the seemingly responsive nature of the developers, and the consistent development blog updates, but this one seems to have hit a creative wall both visually, and technically.  Sorry for the detraction, but I will be placing this game on the back burner for now.\n\n<3\n\n","July 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 271 of 368 people (74%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","74","271","368","12","13"

In it's current (release) state, the game is tolerable, but lacking in many respects still, the largest being actually fun. I only play games of this sort multiplayer, so the experience may be different for playing solo.\n\nThe mining tool is my biggest gripe. It fires in a line, that is based on an unusual place on your character, making getting at specific tiles difficult, and hard to aim at anything but straight up/down/left/right. The mining tool is INCREDIBLY slow compared to other games such as Terraria or Starbound. In the latest incarnation, they added new mining tools that slowly (at about half-speed) dig out the tiles around the tile it's hitting, but generally this doesn't help much because it's slower and you can't generally dig in a way to take much advantage of it.\n\nThen there is dealing with the plants of the world, which require a saw of some sort to gather. This is even slower than the mining tool, you just sit and wait and wait for it. And finally get your 2 protovine or whatnot. Good luck finding any seeds!\n\nAnd then creating much of anything requires so many resources, but you have a tiny inventory and finding storage is time consuming. And though it is an interesting idea to have tiers of what sort of item something is (eg, "Inorganic - Mineral - Radioactive - Uranium"), when you need to build something that just needs a mineral, it should just say "Uranium" or similar names... but it has the entire long list for Uranium, making it hard to tell exactly what it is you need without really long names for things.\n\nAnd the world itself is just a bunch of skylands, with occasional larger ones tossed in there for actual "ground", except that when you get lower, you have another giant gap of space before getting to the next "tier" of skyland below you. You generally find out about that after having walked off a cliff of your "ground" near the beginning of the game, because it is very abrupt: "Just walking along, oh there's a little hill, let's hop down... no, there's no bottom. NO! Oh, I'm dead again..."\n\nThe game USED to have an entire tutorial, teaching you how to use the interface, move around, use the laser pick, etc. but the release version removed all of that in favor of a talking shark that just tells you to get it things... without any details on how to do much of anything. I'm glad I already knew how to switch between foreground and background tile mining/placement from the previous tutorial, because I probably would have gone nuts trying to figure it out.\n\nThere are now side missions that take you to your own personal instance that are not multiplayer at that point... there are random NPCs to get that don't do much (a couple give you ok-ish rewards for doing tasks)... there are various weapons, but most require ammo that is frustrating to get.\n\nAll of this and, while playing, you still have no idea what you're actually doing. The premise seems to be something about terraforming, but to what end?","October 28, 2015","false","31.5"," 139 of 183 people (76%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","76","139","183","15","10"

However, if you actually explore the game you'll find that it's much more than that.\n\nFirst off, There's the hefty tutorial, and the (rather) steep learning curve. You'll probably be finding yourself tripping over yourself in the three different menus, each at a not-that-convenient spot on your keyboard.(V for Crafting? Really?)  All the while your having your energy zapped by one of those nice little energy suckers. But once you get used to the very confusing interface it shouldn't be much trouble.\n\nNow that we are out of the inital Edge Of Space experience, we'll start talking about some of it's better qualitys. First and most noticable thing is the Weapons. In this game, you can take the phrase "No weapon is the same" literally. Different types, Different Ammunition, Different Specs, just about different everything. Ever played Borderlands 1 or 2? Take their weapon system and apply it hear.\n\nNext:\nUpdates. Your never not sure when another updates going to be out, because they have a in-game update timer, and the updates are shot out faster than most Early Access games can blink.\n\nTHE RESULT:\nWhile many players will get bored and lose interest in the first chunk of gameplay, those who stick around sure will be going for a fun ride- and loss of outside-world productivity. If you're a patient gamer, I recommend you pick up this title right now.\nYou won't be dissapointed.","June 13, 2014","true","11.4"," 154 of 213 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","154","213","0","0"

As of the Thanksgiving Patch, I have had no crashes or freezes, but there is also an in-game save option for those of us who get paranoid about beta crashes.\n\nThere's a lot of systems testing and bug-hunting going on at the present stage of development, but there is enough content to really have a blast.\n\nThe mobs at present are not pushovers, and can really tear you apart if you aren't careful. Personally, I like that the mob danger factor is so high, as it adds a real tension to the exploration aspect of the game. There is a mechanism in place for craftable respawns, which takes out some of the sting from dying.\n\nI've gone on some intense-to-the-point-of-adrenaline-rush missions descending down through the biomes to find and unlock tech upgrades, while mobs and missiles chased my tail. I love the descent into danger mechanism of this game, where there is always an element of risk involved, and skill with manoeuvring and shooting is rewarded.\n\nThe gameplay is a combination of resource gathering, mob killing, building, crafting, and exploration.\nThere are quest/mission equivalents, in the form of finding Tech Waypoints, where the reward for success is unlocking boosted statistics and/or new craftables, such as better weapons and armour.\n\nThere are also wormhole events - at present these are time-constrained events where you have a specific timeframe to explore and loot what you can before your time runs out and the wormhole collapses. (Word from the Devs is that there will be a number of different kinds of wormhole events, including boss battles, which I am looking forward to)\n\nAt present time, there are only two complete Biomes in the Beta, and a limited number of tech upgrades and crafting options. That being said, I haven't exhausted that limited content in the 30 hours I've played thus far, which isn't bad at all for a beta. Furthermore, from the official forums and chats with the devs, it looks like what is presently in game is but a small fraction of the content planned for launch and post-launch.\n\nI've found myself losing hours to this game, and do not regret spending money on it at all. As of 30/11, Multiplayer is still disabled, but word from the Devs indicates that this is only temporary while they finetune the coding. So at present, and likely for a few more weeks to come given the time of year, the game does only have single player mode.\n\nThat hasn't stopped me from having a damn good time with the game though. I definitely recommend it if Terraria or Metroidvania-styled gameplay tickles your fancy.","November 29, 2013","true","80.6"," 263 of 384 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","263","384","0","0"

All you've got is some utilities from your ship you were able to grab. You can mine, you can build, and you can craft. What will you do to survive?\n\n(tl;dr at bottom)\n\nIf you're a fan of Terraria, but want something a little more bizarre, and more focused on space, this is definitely your game. Don't see it as Terraria or Minecraft knock-off, though. This game is one of the most unique games of this type that I've seen. Most notably, the crafting system. The way this game's crafting system works is just fantastic. Rather than picking around for specific blocks, you are able to craft things by finding blocks to fit the requirements for density, permiability, and other criteria for creating an object. There is more to this, but I'd rather let you find that out for yourself, as there are many machines in this game that would take a while to fully explain.\n\nAs you can see the graphics in the screenshots, and audio in the trailers, I'm not really going to dive that deep into them. The only thing I'd like to note is character creation. There is at least a moderate amount of customization for your character off the bat, and even more when you consider vanity and armor further in the game, so if that's the type of thing you're into, consider it another plus.\n\nThis game isn't completely great though, and I won't be able to stress enough that this game is EARLY ACCESS, and that's what you're paying for. A lot of it isn't done.

While you can solo most of the game, it is pretty tough without friends. The music is very decent as well.\n\nFairly stable, server we had running did not crash. Took me a while to figure out how to get some of the other game mechanics running but once that is over, the crafting stuff works well. Only gripe is the crafting workflow could maybe improved abit.

So I will go through a few pros and cons from my experience thus far.\n\nPros\n- Gameplay is fun when playing with multiple people, there are features such as resurrecting dead players that you will miss out in if you play singleplayer.\n- Questing is quick and easy normally. It can be a bit grindy for some of the quests but the rewards seem to usually be worth it. It instills a sense of progression that is enjoyable to experience.\n- The details on your character armor and progression trees that allow you different armor if you play a certain style give a unique vibe and add potential replayability.\n- Knowledge skill trees give you lots of ways to specialize as you progress in early game and it is especially helpful if you have multiple players with you, letting you all specialize in different ways and combine your knowledge to progress quicker.\n\nCons\n- Do not try to exit game and try to get back if you are running a server. The steam client will not allow you to start game back up till you take your server down. This is also a huge problem if you crash or have any gamebreaking bugs.\n- Got stuck in a wall by jumping into it during first hour of play, only way I could solve it was to quit game and log back into multiplayer server. Issue fixed as of sept 19th hotfix.\n- Exploding monster nests can leave the sound of bomb alarms going off long after its been destroyed, making an annoying sound that just wont disapear.\n- Monster ai leaves a  lot to be desired.\n- Building seems to take a while to make anything worthwhile and there is not as much a need to build actual homes like other games in this genre.\n- It is incredibly challenging to figure out how to get many types of building materials, leading to constant searching of wiki to figure out how to find many types of materials.\n- Certain materials that were used in many types of items were incredibly rare to find, making it so that more people you had with you, the more challenging and difficult it was to even find enough materials to get everyone basic items.\n\nOverall, I would recommend waiting on this game for a few more patches or unless you like what you see. The game is enjoyable but there is quite a few issues with it that can lessen the enjoyment in both singleplayer and multiplayer post launch.","September 18, 2015","true","8.8"," 113 of 160 people (71%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","71","113","160","9","5"

I suppose that was a mistake on my part, and I'll admit as much.\n\nAs such, I tried my best to look beyond the horrifically clunky and unhelpful user interface, the occasionally slightly janky graphics and the various spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and so forth...  And, for a while, I did.\n\nUnfortunately, what lay underneath wasn't all that great.  Yes, being able to "fudge" resources and use one thing in place of another is nice, but you can't combine two different types and the drop-down list bugs out if you have too many candidates.\n\nBut then we get to the matter of the actual tech tree and what you're building with all this space junk...   The game praises its "unique, Borderlands-style procedurally generated weapons", but all this means is that rock gun 1 may have +2 minimum damage and +1 clip size, while rock gun 2 has considerably less of either but 15 more accuracy (note, I have yet to discover what, if any, effect "accuracy" actually has on anything.  It certainly doesn't do anything with the projectile spread) and a different abstract "quaility" [sic] rating.  And between the three first tiers of weapons, with a really vast difference in required resources, there was only a tiny upgrade in regards to damage and clip size.  All other stats were pretty much the same, and they all looked like so much jumbled bulk.\n\nThere's no smooth progression, as all tech is unlocked by picking up and consuming data bricks that get dropped randomly by enemies.  Yup, you're gonna have to shoot a LOT of electric jellyfish before you can build that kitchen counter you always wanted.  You'll also need to do a spitload of grinding to get all the metals you need for anything beyond just dirt guns and mud armor, because ore veins are very rare and often stupefyingly dangerous to go near.\n\nSpeaking of danger, this game incorporates a life system.  It's not game over once you reach 0, but if you die after that all the items in your tragically small inventory will get expunged onto the surrounding terrain.\n\nThis game is early access, VERY early.  It's fully possible it will shape up in time, but right now it's clunky, incredibly grindy and half the items in the tech tree are obscenely expensive and serve no purpose.  In closing, I figured out how to infinitely duplicate any resource in the game before I managed to work out how to split a stack in two.  Wouldn't recommend in its current state.","September 23, 2014","false","6.9"," 74 of 99 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","74","99","4","3"

It is a work in progress but a couple of key issues are preventing me from doing so.\n\nTo keep this as brief as possible, there's not hardly any "How to" up to date resource online - most of what I found was from more than 12 months ago and a lot of the game content has changed since then.  The in-game tutorial is better than nothing but it only goes over the basics and the in-game codex doesn't offer the detail needed.  If the developer would put up some current video tutorials it would help out a lot.\n\nWhen I first started playing it was a major red flag to me that you couldn't pause the game in single player.  The game can be fairly complex (which is a good thing if you have a resource to explain it) and most of what's available online is fairly outdated.  People were left to ask questions on the forums.  Not a major issue for people that have been playing since 2013, but for new players (even ones with experience from playing other similar games like Terraria or Starbound) they can lose motivation to continue quickly without knowing what to do next to progress.\n\nIt's not a bad game, it has potential and it's still in development.  However I could not recommend it at this time.  I have uninstalled the game and will check back in a few months.","April 11, 2015","false","43.2"," 103 of 146 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","103","146","5","1"

I wanted to play it for myself to see how it was. Here are my thoughts from just an hour and a half of playtime.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Has something like a main quest line\n+ Has mini events that appear on the planet, with objectives\n+ Has a crafting system with trees that look like they have a reasonable amount of items\n+ Has an npc with a bunch of dialogue, uncommon for this genre\n+ Has a strange (but interesting) artstyle that reminds me of AVwW, but a little different\n+ Some of the equipment looks well drawn, and very nice as future outfits\n\nCons:\n- Crafting system requires large amounts of materials to make mundane or low tier objects\n- Enemies and destructibles drop lots of loot and it feels like my inventory is weighed down with junk just a few minutes into the game\n- The tiered system for items/crafting isn't intuitive or sensible (other than weapons/tools named "Mk. 1", "Mk.2", etc.)\n- The tiers locking you out of building or crafting some items feel arbitrary despite being in an already arbitrary game setting\n- Mining the necessary materials for the beginning quests or items is very slow, boring, and repetitive; it's so unengaging that it feels like busy work\n- Mining laterally is A PAIN at times because the laser eminates from your upper chest and you can't mine a straight line below or above that level due to that constraint - you have to mine extra blocks to get line of sight for your laser (which technically makes sense, but this isn't real life and an arbitration could be made here, even just letting us CROUCH would fix half of the problem)\n- Moving the character is clunky, you stop on a dime and using the jetpack arrests upward movement to begin a slow acceleration upward (but using the jetpack to slow your fall does very little to slow you unless you were already falling at a slow speed)\n- The npc with dialogue is annoying, makes annoying sounds each time you respond to it, and doesn't help you with the early game much other than telling you what the tutorial pane (accessed with the U key) does.\n- Several parts of the game are very arbitrary, like being magically unable to mine in an event area until you complete the event (but then able to mine with no problem afterward)\n\n\nConclusion: The game almost has the barebones of a sandbox crafting adventure game, with what looks like a reasonable amount of content added in. But content doesn't make a game, it only adds to it. The base gameplay, the platforming, the item collection and crafting, just feels bad. It does not feel finished. It feels like a prototype with extra content.","December 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","37","40","2","0"

Melee weapon, energy weapon, projectile weapon, phase weapon - four different ones. Explorer, fighter and builder armor, utility, consumables - it's overbearing and really hard to notice what's useful. Crafting is also a mess - it's great that you can multiple materials when the recipe only asks for *metal*, but you need to pick the chosen one from a drop-down menu. There's an autofill button that uses the lowest tier? most abundant? resource of yours, but in that case I don't know why is that not the basic option. Not to mention that opening one dropdown menu doesn't closes the other, and they overlap - I can't believe this is happening in a finished, released game. And finding the actual items from the crafting menu is just a nightmare - if you check "all", there are too many options, but other than that, you can filter by type. And you know what does that mean - even more dropdown menu, trying to find out which one has a craftable, or even a useful item in it.\nGraphics are vibrant coloured ones, but it's like someone smeared something opalesque on it - hard to take out silhouettes, the size of the blocks, the aim of weapons/tools.    But hey, we have a spaceshark companion who's sounds are like a girl whining in an anime... ON A SPACESHARK.... just... no.\nIf I should summerize the game in a world, I would say  it's  unintuitive. But to a high level.  Stay away from this one - Terraria still provides so much fun and depth, and even Windforge has more style with it's weird 2.5D graphics than this game :\  Maybe I'll come back to force some progress, but this game is a definite NOT RECOMMENDED.

I bought this thinking it was Starbound, and was horribly disappointing. I have no idea what build I was getting into.\n\nWhat I got into was pretty much "build a base with a couple of buildings as a home-base, upgrade your characters and build armor and weapons, then kill the like 20 or so different enemies in the game."\n\nI mean the way to progress your character was to get little data-chips that would increase your xp.\n\nIt was cute, but it took waaaay too long to progress, and when you did a lot of the time it felt like half of your progress was for very little.\n\nNow it's been a while, there's a pretty clear line between enemies that act as a faction that alert each other and gang up on you(can get really tedious at times, but as long as this is a beta that's all good) whereas there's other wildlife enemies where some'll be more aggressive, but less factional in that they communicate with others of it kind, and then other creatures doesn't really care that much, but gets mad or scared if you attack them.\n\nBase construction used to have a power generator and a command center's CPU-distribution as their main sources of power for the base equipment. Now they have Command Centers that power parts of bases, but command centers will conflict with each other, so you'll either have bases build into segments, or bases placed in completely different edges of the map, still connected by the Command Centers as one can teleport from one CC to another.\n\nThere's the separation between Phase-type weaponry (that doesn't use ammunition) that does less damage than projectile-based weaponry(which does use ammunition), there's signs that they'll end up giving us energy-based weaponry as well.\n\nGame's also got a few vehicles, as of patch 0.4458 we have the Zephyr, decent hp, medium speed vehicle, pretty large, would guess about 6x7 blocks-size or so? There's also a Thunderbird, which I haven't tried, but it's supposed to be more armored, but slower. Other than these mechanical vehicles there's mounts: A crab, a jumpy raptor, a fast raptor and a net with captured jellyfish that works like a hoverbike. Jellyfishbikes have very little fuel, but are way faster than traveling by foot, never tried mounts as I was worried their lack of ability to fly or hover would make it hard to traverse in any useful terrain, as there's not much to gain by scouting the surface, unless you're on-foot killing enemies for loot and XP.\n\nHope to see the ability to equip and upgrade vehicles and/or mounts with different types of weapons/mining equipment in the future(choosing between phase, projectile and energy, potentially even one additional weapon slot in specific cases would add interesting layers into the vehicles section I think) Definitely hope to see refueling stations/refueling kits in the future as some vehicles are way to expensive to have them permanently expire after traveling a short distance, not to mention that giving the vehicle retrievability until it's destroyed could justify increasing costs of vehicles, and giving it said weapon/armor upgrades as mentioned earlier.\n\nNot sure what the devs have in mind in terms of npc's or vending machines, but so far this game is intriguing.\n\nThe different AI behaviors are also interesting in terms of there being completely passive AI, passive-aggresive AI, faction aggressive AI's and some that will camouflage themselves rather than attack you for survival.\n\nNature yielding multiple resources as well giving different elements like sap, bark, the leaves and seeds, which affects what players can do in terms of crafting. It's half interesting due to different categories of crafting materials (Inorganic(processsed)/raw, minerals/chemicals/organic etc) but I also halfway feel like plants and gems end up kind of taking up a little bit much inventory space, as much as I adore the complexity. It works, but with a limited amount of inventory space it's definitely tough if you're going solo. Which also makes the swarmy enemy spawns a bit tough to deal with. Haven't tried playing with friends yet, so would say this'd be way more fun multiplayer.\n\nAll in all, in its current state I think that if you wish to roll solo and only go for weapons and armor upgrades I think the game'll last a few days. If you're going for exploration, building bases, upgrading yourself and essentially minmaxing on everything on your own it'll be worth everything from 1 week and up depending on how fast you are with these kinds of games and how much time you have to play it. I'm thinking 15+ hours a day being super efficient and lucky with weapon stats(Because weapons' stats are semi-RNG. Dmg per shot, in-game gun visuals, accuracy, crit rate, Ammo cap, MAYBE reloading time, and refire rate/rounds per second). Although it's a bit buggy and pretty slow in its current state, its simple "complexity" in crafting and although the devs(and their resources) are in charge of how much they can do with it I think it has sick potential, even if they end up sticking with the content they have right now, although more stuff's always beyond appreciated.\n\nI'm very glad I stumbled across this game, and I hope it goes even further as this is awesome so far.\n\nPS. Devs. PLEASE give me a way to change my looks. I'm stuck with a thing on my face that won't let me see the helmet-art.\nAlso, there's a bug where when you blow up a thing that explodes upon death with an exploding projectile, the explosion caused by the dying npc will destroy the projectile post-explosion and will cause a chain explosion in projectile and dead enemy, which nearly killed my application. If there was a way to fix that that would be great, meanwhile I'll make sure to only kill explosion upon death units with normal bullets.","June 11, 2015","true","62.8"," 62 of 94 people (66%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","66","62","94","16","5"

The game however its self has a unique array of weapons, functions, game mechanics overall are interesting. At first I thought this would be somewhat like terraria but I was quickly mistaken. It only looks somewhat similar. Probably a concept overlap in overal cosmetics but other than that it all functions quite seperately. It revolves around you and your character who crash lands on archoa. You need to terraform the planet to be suitable, build a base, etc. Terraforming is not available yet unless they consider base building terraforming but that's unlikely. Overall, I don't have too much to say but this game is great. I'm hooked and it's absolutely a blast with friends! They come out with new content regularly, and while some times things break, other times you get cool things as of now like a gun that glitched past the clip capacity to have 65 ammo.

Sadly, this is the one area where Edge of Space really fails to deliver. The art isn't bad, the worlds are imaginative, and some aspects of gameplay are actually very fun! Tearing through rock with a high-powered mining lazer feels great. Unfortunately, these high points are all brought down by clumsily implemented features that are frustrating and poorly explained. A lot of things nagged at me during the 12-or-so hours I spent trying to enjoy Edge of Space, but I'll focus on the worst: dungeons.\n\nAt a certain point in the game, progression through the tech-tree is halted by materials that can only be obtained from a dungeon. No problem! Except the dungeons are awful. The freedom of your jetpack and mining laser are stripped from you, and you're forced to clumsily hop along through some kind of half-baked platformer full of dark, confusing, repetitive rooms. Exploring the rest of the dungeon after going down a dead-end branch involves slowly backtracking through rooms that are even harder to navigate in reverse. It's so tedious that it's easier to just die so that you can start again from the top. The drop-rate for those materials you need is abysmal to boot.

Explanations on how switches work with power are also few and far between so you're going to have to do your own troubleshooting for a while. There is a variety of weapons, i won't deny that, but in terms of USEFUL weapons there are only a few types which work well. So you can basically ignore all the melee and energy fueled weapons, stick to the projectile and plasma weapons. But the worst part of this game is the enemies...their hitboxes are really funky, and to make matters worse the hurt boxes on your weapons are terrible as well. So mixing hard to hit enemies with weapons that are hard to aim...great. And the movement of the enemies is particularly annoying and random. Otherwise I applaud its effort to be different but this game feels poorly done to me.","September 29, 2015","false","46.5"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","23","34","2","2"

Shamefully, no longer supported.\n\nTo tell the truth, 1.0`s feature wasnt suprise for me since i was in inner test team, yet those changes from last public build to 1.0 made game much more and quite much more entertaining. I'd even say it made game lively - tons of different events waiting for you to blow up (well, some of them do require you to bomb some places).\n\nSo, what's this game about? - it's about exploration of planet, on which you had emergency landing when ArkCo`s shop crashed (watch the intro cinematics for more story) - thus you're alone (or not - if multiplayer with friends) and now you need to explore this world, getting resources and making better  equipment in process (typical for all such games). Further you go down - better resources, more dungerous enemies, new places to visit. For most actions you get XP to spend in knowledge window to get access to better gear and new facilities.\n\nEoS is about exploring ONE planet (different each time you make new world, following some generation rules obviously), furthermore - exploring it VERTICALLY - there are 3 biomes, which is placed vertically, even thought you will explore it in rather horisontal line, then moving down to next one. Also, note there isnt any solid terrain - rather flying chunks of it (codex it for why), thus you will not be forced to dig through solid terrain to get lower and lower.\n\nMany ppl complaining about game being too hardcore at start since weapon you begin with sucks at dmg (lol, ppl didnt even bother opening crafting window to see 1 scematics of better gun being avaible). But dont get too relaxed - most of things on this planet seems to be made to be human-killers and death can me quick and/or painful :3\nIi expect ppl crying in few days about dying and respawning at start as annoying feature - even thought u can make and bind urself to better cryopods (respawn facility) to get respawn-at-dying-place points on time bases - cryorods.\n\nBtw - game has no tutorial, outside window with knowledge - CODEX - about thing you find/unlocked and flying laser shark, which will teach you some basics. Why? - well, for world's optimisation and....more hilariously, some ppl failed to finish tutorial or even simply passed by w/o learning and then stormed forum/reviews with questions tutorial had answer on :3\nReally, so far it's not very hard to understand a game.\n\nThose confused by low % of positive rewievs - most of negatives are made by those, who didnt bother to lurking around about game or didnt play enough (under 10hours - not even worth looking at), as well as people wanting Starbound clone.\nFor more detailed comparison of EoS/Starbound/Terraria/etc visit http://steamcommunity.com/app/238240/discussions/0/540735426074163826/\n\nPros:\n- interactions with developers - they do respond within a day (depending on timeline of yours) and they're friendly. Seriously, they even used to run server to play with players and they do take in account suggestions of players about what to implement;\n- helpful people;\n- Quite big sandbox-generated world - can travel to new places, see alot monsters and kill them. 3 biomes with different flora, fauna - so you will not see all the same things for whole game.\n- build your base, place facilities and decorate at your taste (alot stuff will be coming, thought even now you can spend few hours decorating);\n- rpg-oriented - alot stuff to research, player-style-oriented armor sets and kits;\n- quite nice amount of armors (3 trees: fighter, explorer, builder - all with unique and useful bonuses), weapons (phase - unlimited ammo and weak strikes, projectiles - limited powerful crafted ammo, energy - not present yet) and facilities to place;\n- SCI-FI setting;\n- some humorous moments;\n- Pretty nice graphics;\n\nCons:\n- only English as supported language atm;\n- no way to pause game (thought placing command node and teleporting to command center placed in your haven saves the day);\n- a bit hard to set multiplayer server - there is a complete How-To guide on forum thought;\n- not exatly your average YOBA in terms of game's info - well, Codex, npcs and your brain should be enough to figure out the game (at least many questions are answered on forum since long ago)\n\nneutral:\n- farming - as in any rpg of such type, you gonna need to get resources for ur stuff, thpught getting most of resources isnt hard during traveling - just keep your eyes open. If playing solo - one might consider getting builder sets for quicker digging;\n- 2d game - yep, no realistic 3D graphics (like in 60-usd games);\n- not newbie-friendly in some terms (tutorial thing explained above), since not everything is explained, chewed for you and put in your mouth with spoon. If you run into trouble - i'm currently making game's guide:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448294464 feel free to open it. If reading forum and guide still left you with question - feel free to ask me.\n- more multiplayer-oriented, than singleplayer game (noone stops from playing alone thought. Truth to be told, i donno about other simular games and their MP/SP orientation)\n\nstate of game:\n- 3 biomes present and filled (with mobs, plants, events and stuff).\n- dungeons - instances to find some specific resources and bosses.\n- animal mounts and vehicles;\n- multiplayer (thought require to have someone hosting server);\n- guns (3 trees) and melee, armors (3 different trees w different type of bonuses), upgrades, facilities and stuff in quite nice amounts;\n- NPCs - somewhat funny bunch;\n- terrafroming is present))\n- achievements.\n- trading cards :3","May 6, 2015","true","237.2"," 36 of 58 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","36","58","0","0"

I definitely see the potential of this game and can forsee it being a really fun and addictive game like Terraria. Right now it's just frustrating. Especially since this game has been out in beta for over a year and the feel hasn't changed. It's sad when 3 of my friends and I can't stand to play this more than an hour every 3-4 months we try it.\n\nMany items that you find early in game have absolutely 0 use or in the item details it shows "Will be updated in the future" or some nonsense. The inventory feels clunky and can be buggy when swapping things in and out of your actionbars.\n\nFor those of you who played Terraria, if you enjoyed the helper dude being there to somewhat guide you in the right direction you're going to have a harder time. The beginning gives you a brief sense of direction but then it's gone. To understand what a lot of things do, you must either spend lots of time trying to figure it out on your own or look it up on the wiki.\n\nWhile I feel games do need to have a little but of challenge in them, I'm not sure the start of this game goes in the right direction with that. Your mining tool is painfully slow. Your starting weapon is painfully weak. Materials needed to upgrade anything are way high. You also have lives in this game. So as you're digging down trying to find some sort of material you need to make an item you have no clue what it does, you come across some crabs that take 15 shots to kill with your weak gun and they kill you. You've spent 20 minutes digging, lost a life, and still have 0 of the material you need.\n\nThe soundtrack is nice. Which is one thing I expected after playing Terraria and Starbound. Visuals look good for the most part. The gameplay just has a long way to go until I feel it will be fun.\n\nIf you want a new Terraria style game, go pick up starbound instead. You'll be completely satisfied! Maybe in another year I can say the same about this.","November 25, 2014","false","39.2"," 48 of 81 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","48","81","2","5"

There will be changes. There are glitches. Boo-hoo.\n\nPros:\n\nIt's engaging, especially compared to the garden variety of miners and crafters out there. There is a multifaceted approach to crafting that requires both raw materials and the know-how of a specific skill to be able to craft. Science Points (SP) are awarded for everything - killing baddies to laser-punching dirt - and are used for increasing skill levels in broad categories such as Base Construction (BUILD BIGGER CHESTS!) to Utilities (MAKE STRONGER LAZERBEAM!) to Consumables (WHO NEEDS CRYORODS ANYWAYS?). Once your skill level is increased you can then craft a better item for yourself! Enough on crafting..\n\nEnemies! They're gorgeous! They're varied! They kick my ♥♥♥ =( They have weaknesses that make it an engaging combat game beyond point-and-click. Angles of attack, parabolic arcs, and reload times all need to be taken into consideration when fighting the local floral and fauna. Build stronger weapons! Fight bigger baddies! Get more SP! Build Data from SP into building better weapons! Rinse - repeat - pwn.\n\nDungeons!  Just when you think you've found it all - suddenly you're platforming through a mega-dungeon fighting off mechanical brains with well-timed plasma rifle shots! Loot Loot Loot Loot.\n\nMore dungeons!  Did you know penguins like pre-marital sex and Daft Punk? Play this game to find out why. They're promiscious. And deadly. More Loot! Why do I need all these brain stems? SCIENCE!\n\nCons:\n\nIt's in Beta. Lighting sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥ itself - sometimes there's no shadows at all! Hitboxes have been off before - but appear to have been patched. Nothing gamebreaking that I've run into with my 38 hours. 1/2 the world isn't filled in yet - but I'm sure it will be amazing when it is! There's more than enough to explore as is.\n\nThe only gripe I have is lack of map - but it is a planned implementation, and I'm sure will be here soon. It's a large and confusing world - even with teleportation available you still get your ♥♥♥ lost.\n\n\nOVERALL GRADE:\n\nWOULD BUY AGAIN / 10\n\nI give it a solid 8.5 - with the possibility to be a 9 or even 10 when all the bugs are worked out and content is added. The time I have put into  it should say enough. As a fan of Minecraft and Terraria - both Vanilla - the Edge of Space more than meets my expectations and is my current crack.\n\n","December 30, 2014","true","58.8"," 29 of 47 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","29","47","6","0"

I play this game solo and really don't have any plans to play MP.\n\nI do enjoy the idea that all the fighting (for now) is with guns rather than melee. It is hard to get used to because enemies are smaller and fast but you get better over time.\n\nThe game itself has just had a UI overhaul and progression is being changed up right now. I have no fear that this game will turn out to be bad in any way. The team listens to us and makes great decisions on their own as well.\n\nI have been part of some rough early access games (Warz :( , The Stomping Land :((  and Starbound :-\ ) so I have had my share of ups and downs. Edge of Space has kept me even, while I want the game to be done I am not demanding them. I know they are working on everything and it will be great no matter what.\n\nI originally came to this game because Starbound was updated and it killed a connection to a mod that made the game fun. (survivalist mod) Obviously starbound is so easy, no challenge at all. This game is actually much harder and makes you feel the need to be careful and play safe at times.\nGive Edge of Space a try some time or just keep it in mind and watch for updates!","November 17, 2014","true","51.9"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","24","38","0","0"

If you can deal with game breaking bugs for multiplayer and game hindering bugs in single player then by all means purchase this to get a taste of what a great game it could have been if it was finished.\n\nI was a part of the Early Access players that enjoyed Lady Ajew (or whatever her name was) performing damage control for erroneous coding (not to be confused with erogenous) and a poorly timed "Full Release" which was thrown upon us a proclamation that it was neccessary to release it as full to iron out all the bugs; of which there were countless!

No longer are titanium, ice, and other ores rare in the first phase of the game.\nGame promotes a natural progresion in that exploring, digging, and fighting will all give you exp you can put towards tech\nI really really like this soundtrack (thanks, Lori)\nDifferent types of weapons feel different. Phase are weak but infinite weapons, projectile are strong but very limited, and energy are strong but require you to decide between using them or using your jetpack since they both use the same energy.\nWide range of enemies and great for people who like making very technical bases (with logic gates implemented and an easy to use power system)\nFunny loading screens to help pass the tedious but necessary parts of every game\n\nCons :\nWeapons are a little hard to get used to and are sometimes hit and miss.

Unfortunetaly it is still in phase of development. After completing few startup things (gathering resources, protecting robots) it is coming to a point where You are bored because You can't find anything new (~15 hours) or it gives You a head punch with difficulty level that is too hight (in the game events like 15 mobs spawning and shooting at You light bulbs that is extreamly hard to avoid). I do not recommend this game because sometimes recipes are not finished and in some points it is not intuitive (that is very important thing). Good thing would be adding some kind of direct portals (that You could craft on place with quite huge ammount of resources) to epic boss battles which would give You either uncommon/rare loot or resources that would be only available to drop out of this boss.\nThings that could be usefull:\n1. More boss fight (and except needed gear, also tactic required) + rare epic loot 1 in 100 or 1000 to drop\n2. More special monsters that grant a nice reward\n3. Combo shoots that gives a player sense of power (for example charging power for killing monsters and than when You want You can unleash it upon all foes dealing massive damage)\n\nMy opinion:\nFor now it is not as good as expected, however it offers creation of own server that You could play co-op/multiplayer.

Since the game was on sale I decided to take a chance with it since I'm really drawn to the artstyle and general concept of the game itself.  I'm actually surprised that I liked the game as much as I do since I played Starbound before and it didn't really impress me as much as EoS does.\n\nA few things I do have to mention though is that, yes the tutorial isn't that informative but since a lot of people have played games such as Starbound or Terraria and Eos is in the same genre, a lot of the functions and basics are the same as well.\n\nAnother thing is the lack of any active server searching function within the client, as far as I know of right now, servers are spread through word of mouth or in forum posts, but most of the big servers have been shut down already so there isn't a huge population in multiplayer that anyone can just jump in (Again, I may be wrong since I've only been playing the game for a little bit)\n\nLast thing I really wanna recommend to anyone thinking about playing the game is to really stick with it during the beginning, because things are slow and gathering seems like a drag, but once you start getting into the game more, you'll find that Eos has a lot of depth, potential, and it's own personality that separates this game from the other games in the same genre.  Seriously though, you can build a giant mech suit, what more do you need to convince you to buy this game?","September 20, 2015","true","4.8"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","26","43","0","5"

First off, the bugs:\nmissing image assets\nbroken dialog trees/subquests\nspelling mistakes\ncrafting window which gets laggier and laggier each time it's opened.\nconstant shaking of the screen when left unattended for long enough (in my case, once to answer a phone call and another to deal with a someone at the door).\nBeyond the bugs, the content of the game itself is surprisingly sparse.  You just constantly descend without much incentive to explore other than to discover upgrade stations.  You can also find NPCs and get their subquests, but even if those subquests aren't broken there's no real payoff for completing them.\n\nAt its current level, the amount of active development and polish needed before this would be worthwhile is probably measured in months, not days or weeks.  I'd check back in six months to a year to see if things have gotten better or if the move out of Early Access is an indication that the dev team is abandoning the game and so might as well call it done.","September 28, 2015","false","60.8"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","0"

You gradualy start to encounter bigger badder challanges that not only require you to be well prepaired equiptment wise, but it also requires you to bring more advanced tools.\n\nThe versatility in Edge of Space's tools seperates it from alot of other sandbox games because you can choose to have a longer, less powerful range, or a shorter more powerful version of your tools.   This gives you options to work with.\n\nThe armor sets also differnt from other games in the aspect that they are not necissarly combat focused.   Instead of Ranger, Mage, Melee, you get  Builder, Explorer, Fighter.  Each armor catering to a particular task rather then a weapon role.  All items are created from crafting data of a specific sub catagory in crafting, so you can specialize and focus on one area at a time rather then pooling all of your science (aka accumulative xp pool ) into everything at once.\n\nEdge of Space also offers a challange factor with it's dungeons.  It disables things like jet packs and grappling hooks and building so that you can not cheese the boses for easy wins.\n\nThis should give you an idea of how the game plays out and how it differs from other games of it's kind.\n\n*Feb 25, 2015*\n\nDevelopment Stage: Early Access\n\nEarly Access Compitence Rateing:  9/10  -  Things were bumpy at first for what ever reasons, but things turned around quickly.   The developers never gave up despite the road bumps and updates are comeing in frequantly.   Edge of Space is a very good example of Early Access done right.\n\nExploration:  9/10 -  The environment can be dangerous, there's danger around every corner and you need to prepair accordingly.    There are events and outposts that keep you busy and though it is currently in an infant state of things, I can see how the world will gradualy become more and more full as time advances.\n\nCrafting: 8/10 -  Crafting is based on xp and tends to get a bit grindy, but it's quite rewarding once you unlock new things.\n\nGame Controls:   8/10  -  Some obvious bugs are still around, but it will not hinder the game experince too much.   Jetpacks can also go wildly out of control and some of the grapple mechanics can send your character bouncing about.\n\nGame Play: 8/10  -  I suspect the game will greatly improve with time, but at the moment there is a limited amount of content to keep you busy, so the game becomes a bit grindy.   Again, I suspect this will change greatly in the near future.\n\nMusic:  9/10  -  The music is very fitting for the game and quite immersive.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 -  It's gritty and retro, but also very fitting for the game style.  Some of the texture look weird, but it's a fair representation of what it is conveying.\n\nNewbie Friendly:  7/10 - Newbies will catch on eventualy, but the learning curve is a bit harsh.  But in a good way.   It is suggested to have some platformer experince before attempting Edge of Space.  Newer generation gamers may have trouble where as older generation gamers will have little trouble with landing platforms and timeing jumps.\n\nCommunity and Moderators: 9/10 -  Very few fights, healthy interactions.   Strong communication, very good staff members.  Moderation is fair and efficent and well handled.\n\nDevelopers:  10/10 -  Very approachable developers, they are always happy to answer questions.   They have sense of humor and are reasonable people.   Very good company to invest your faith and funds into.\n\nTL:DR Version:\n\nIs it worth it:  YES!","February 25, 2015","true","82.5"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","1"

The difference between EoS and those other games is how you play it. EoS has a lot more technology items, like jetpacks and laser guns, and is more futuristic, while Terraria is a mix between a fairy tale world and the deepest pits of Hell. The art style is superb, and the background art is just nice to look at. Though there is somewhat of a story, it's pretty noninvasive and isn't forced on you. The story just tries to give a justification for why you're on these planets. Updates have been coming in a timely fashion, and it's about to come out of Early Access.

It is now the first 1.0 'Official Release'as of last week.  I'm a thumbs up but if you read my full review you'll see below what can be impoved on as well.\n\nI've stuck with this game and I still enjoy it.  It is a crafting, exploring game in 2D... but it's in space!  And if you like space games that are open world and exploritory, I think you'll find this one not to like.  The are lots of materials to search for, interesting knowledge tree to work towards for crafting new gadgets and gizmos, and plenty of creepy monsters and weird vegetation to learn about.  So if you like figuring out the unknown, you'll like this.  It's kinda like Terraria, Metroid, and Star Trek blended together, with a dash of Avatar but something kinda unique too.\n\nThe Edge of Space development team says they will keep improving this game post release and I hope they do.\n\n3 things which need some immediate attention by the development team include:\n\n-  The game engine processes data and movement too slowly compared to other games in this genre.  The result is that movement is slow and battle can be clunky for game play.  I don't think this is my processors' or video card's fault as I play similiar games with even better graphics and gameplay, without so much latency.  Maybe the coding could be tighter / more real time.  Seems like a lot of processor overhead going on.\n\n- The opening movie is pretty untelling still.  It's better now that it's 1.0 but this is supposed to be the intro to the adventure.  The user doesn't get a good sense of what the background story is and where they fit in.  And what's with the other 3 organizations with different symbols?  Are they competitors or allies?  Are they the Ark Corp council?  Are they the ones who blew up our ship or was it an alien war?  It's hard to tell and it shouldn't be.\n\n-  The addition of Fineous the Shark has helped teach new players (and older ones) what the controls and game mechanics are.  It could be a little more obvious though.  Probably the best way is to make sure the Codex has more content and the user knows right away that this is their one stop shop for learning about their new world, and how and what an agent of Ark Corp is supposed to do and try to acheive.  Some more work on the goals of the game are needed.  The Codex should be like our 'Hitchhikers Guild to the Galaxy'; everything you need to know when you thunk on a new planet in a Cryopod without any friends or contact with where you blasted off from, after a long cryo-frozen nap. I like the sense of humour though so far; keep that going.\n\nThat's my thoughts on this game so far.  I recommend, as long as you don't expect perfection just yet but I think it's worth supporting and playing.  It's fun and interesting to explore.\n\nThis Review was written Sept. 20, 2015.\n","September 20, 2015","true","42.0"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","23","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Teirdalin/recommended/238240/","Teirdalin","Teirdalin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Teirdalin/","344 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEasily the most dull game of the year.\n\nI've been playing Edge of Space the past eight hours; with the single thought in my mind of: "This game must get better eventually, right?"  well; I've been essentially in the same spot with the same equipment for the past five hours.  Killing crabs n' jelly fish, and mining titanium, aluminum, stone, mud, clay, and dirt does get old after a while.  I found a strange white box with a blue arrow on it in a cave and tried to us eit, but that just flashed some screen for half a second and went away; and I was unable to interact with it again.  But let's put things into points for the sake of organization:\n\nGood things:\n*Good movement system.\n*Good art & music.\n*Online co-op.\n*Interesting concept.\n\nBad Things:\n*Very unpolished.\n*Bad interface & not very user-friendly.\n*No explanation for the purpose of alot of things, for example the matter recombiner; the game does not tell you what it does, and the description is simply: "You can't even wager a guess as to how this crazy machine works.", normally checking a wiki would help an issue like this, but their wiki is ancient and not updated.  And then there are things like the random events that go on in the world like the crab nests, and random things such as the weird white box with blue arrow-  no idea what purpose the box served, didn't realize the crab nest was an event.\n*Lack of things to do; the only goal you might have in the game is simply go lower.. And there is no reason to go lower as you have all the resources you need in the top areas.\n*Lack of resources; it may seem like a good thing that alluminum is basically the most awesome freakin' resource in existence, but it really makes the game boring when you're not bothering to actually look for things.\n*Uninteresting enemies.\n*Uninteresting areas; why would the devs think it was a good idea to make the entire game take place on some floating rocks ?\n*The relaxing music and police sirens(?) doesn't lower the boring factor of this game.\n*Terrible enemy AI.\n*Poorly made tutorial levels, tutorial more interesting than the actual game.\n*Extremely useless chests; for this let me explain how chests work, you craft one then place it in the world; then you right click it to open it, you then have to manually drag and drop each item you wish to place in it, into it; and the chest only has three slots.\n*Lack of creativity; how many times has the space shark and space animals concept been done now?\n*Very unprofessional dev team.\n*Just a shoddy game in general; people like to consider it as a terraria and starbound ripoff- but in all honesty that's an insult to both Terraria and Starbound.\n*I'm fairly certain the preview images which show awesome things happening are all fake.\n*Dropped items from full inventory disappear within seconds, made 7 chests to put my items somewhere- didn't realize my inventory was full,  chests vanish.  Make a full suit of aluminum armor, don't realize inventory is full,  poof.\n*Glitchy items:  Made two chests, had two slots free- placed a chest, the other chest vanished into nowhere.  Used an emergency recall, had two in my inventory; the other vanished.\n\nIf I had any suggestions for this game; I recommend they take a page from Windforge and add player made spaceships to fly around the edge of space.\n\nps:  Don't use the Omega research unless you have good equipment, it just brings you to a boss whom will murder you if you still are using low level stuff.\n\n\n\nWell,  all in all I recommend the game; but make sure you don't play it at night or else you're liable to fall asleep from the sheer boredom it causes; and if you're planning on buying the game because of the awesome screenshots you saw of like a desert and mechs and whatnot- those are definitely faked, there are four biomes; you can go to about two of them, a grassy biome and a cold biome.  There's also about 8 or so enemies currently and about six(?) different resources.","March 26, 2014","true","22.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

In an industry where developers leave their game to die with no content and sparawling fans: "cough, cough" DayZ.\n\nEdge of space is a 2D, Openworld Adventure game. The main story goes like this, You were in cryogenic sleep when your ship broke down, so you wake up and you go exploring the planet beneith you for recourses, not too shabby for a starting story. The story continues with a character named Rufus who is an interesting character to say the least. I wont spoil any more but i doubt you were looking at this game for its story. You want to know about the gameplay, the exploration. Well im glad to say that it's awsome. The game has many simularities to Terraria and Starbound but it improves on these things and adds more to them. For example in Terraria you have your ranks of gear going from a wooden sword to a Gold sword going to a Lights Bane. In Edge of Space, you have sooo many more options mainly because you have to earn xp to unlock new items which is awsome because you dont grind xp by killing mobs (well you can but there is a more enjoyable way to do it) you get xp for mining ore and it basically rewards you for exploring. You will also encounter these things called "nests" which you can explore and destroy for even more xp, which is cool. You also have your character skill trees, but when i say skill trees i dont mean like the stealth, the tank ect. I mean you specialise in what your doing. For example i could get builders armour, if i was interested in building stuff in the game, this would neglect the mob damage and illiminate annoyances that might stop you from building.\n\nThere is a large range of things to makr that you actually want to get unlike other games where they have you craft random crap just so you can continue with the story, Edge of space doesnt do that, instead they let you build mechs, pets, new weapons and badass jetpacks. These arnt just useless vanity items they do infact effect the way you play and make it more enjoyable.\nSo far im loving this game too pieces, being a big fan of Terraria and Starbound helped i guess, but i'd honestly reccomend it to anyone who loves open world exploration games as there is stuff to find and tonnes of things to make, there is no doubt a wealth of content here.....which is really great! :)\n\nWant a review that you can listen and see?

Partly because early access is really about development, not playing (and reviewing) a finished product. Partly because everything is in too much flux for the review to be valid for long.\n\nMostly because I'm too lazy to write reviews for finished games, let alone one still in alpha/beta.\n\nBut I'll make an exception here, because even in it's current incomplete state, it is already one of my favorite games. It's also a fine example of what early access should be: An engaged development team that listens to feedback, works with the community, and simply wants to deliver a great experience to the people who buy their product.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint (which is how early access should be approached IMHO), this is exactly the type of product I'd want to back.

Updates are designed to test specific features so that they can be polished, submitting tickets is on the main menu and the developers actually respond to posts in the forums. Although it sound like these are obvious aspects for any beta game there are too many early access games that care too much about people playing them, instead of testing them to make a better game in the long run.\n\nThe gameplay itself will be familiar to anybody who has played terraria, starbound etc, but with enough unique features to make it interesting. One of the best features is the crafting system that classifies materials (eg ice is a chemical, which is a raw material => raw/chemical/ice), therefore some recipes will require any chemical or any raw material etc.\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a good beta that will turn into a great game, I would recommend buying it now. If you don't want to be actively involved in improving the game, then wait until it is fully released so that you aren't disappointed and forget about it.\n","June 21, 2014","true","70.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

As such, in the future this article may not be a fair representation of the game.\n\nEdge of Space, developed by Handyman Studios and published by Reverb Publishing, is a 2D dynamically generated space adventure. Much to the likes of ever popular Terraria and recent debut of Starbound, Edge of Space allows you go venture through alien planets, build a home base, fend off the local wildlife, and most importantly, survive. It may seem like these survival games are a dime-a-dozen, but the fine folks at Handyman Studios have put their own spin on the whole “survivalcraft” genre.\n\nI am going to preface this by saying that Edge of Space is in a very early stage of development. It was recently updated and gained some traction through Steam’s Early Access, but the fact of the matter Edge of Space is a bit rough around the edges as of right now. It can be quite a turn off to play a game so early in development, especially if it gives you the wrong impressions due to bugs and other strange anomalies. I will say, though, that in the two weeks that I’ve been playing the game, there has been a staggering amount of bug fixes and patches that have really improved the experience. I wholeheartedly believe that Edge of Space will improve in this respect as the developers iron out bugs, UI issues, and add in more content.\n\nIn Edge of Space, you play as a lonely operative representing the Ark Corporation. After catching some beauty sleep in a cryo-chamber, you wake up and realize that you’re basically lost. Your only chance of survival is to depend on the amazing technologies that brought you to the, ahem, edge of space. The only problem here is that you’ll have to find the materials you will need to survive amidst a hostile and dangerous planet. Actually, planet right not even be the right word for Edge of Space. It’s more like an asteroid field where you bounce to and from different small land masses.\n\nOne facet of Edge of Space that’s particularly interesting is how the environment is constantly working to kill you. Make no doubt about it, you’ve arrived in a hell-hole that is out for your blood. There are plenty of enemies wandering around trying to eat you, but more than that, the entire gameworld wants your flesh. As you descend lower and lower in space, you’ll take exposure damage if you’re not fully equipped. This can really be a range of things, including radiation or lack of oxygen. In order to prevent this, you’ll want to fully make sure you’ll have the supplies on you to oxygenate the area, or get rid of the radiation. As an ArkCo Operative, you can also defend your new territory with a series of droids or turrets.\n\nAs of March 2014, combat in Edge of Space is completely centered around guns. There aren’t any melee weapons as of now. However, there are some interesting ideas with the guns. My favorite example is the Arklight, a gun that shoots out a sticky, glowing canister. This is extremely useful when spelunking through the various caverns you’ll find scattered throughout space, and it sure beats placing a torch down every 10 feet. In fact, torches have such a low-light radius that I tended to stick with the narrow glow of my laser pick and the Arklight.\n\nAs someone who has never played Edge of Space before, first impressions can kill the experience. I’m not going to lie, Edge of Space is pretty rough around the edges, especially in the first hour or so. Although it has improved dramatically since I’ve recieved the game, the biggest problem is still the UI. There are some peculiarities that really need adjusting to, especially if you compare them to the flexibility of similar games. One such example would be the hotbar, which is a bit complicated because it can take multiple clicks to slot in different items. The crafting menu is categorized into different sections, but you’ll have to individually click each item you want to use in a recipe. I see what it’s trying to do, and I really like the fact that in some recipes you can substitute many different items, but it’s clunky.There are other little things like this that really drag down the experience despite the survival aspects of the game working as intended.\n\nEdge of Space has a nonlinear sense of progression, but sometimes it is more complicated than it’s own good. There are plenty of machines that you can use to craft items, but when it comes to weapons and armor, you’ll have to go to an armory. This is really more tedious than it needs to be because you’ll have to drop down various unmarked chutes, and you’ll be given whatever weapon lies at the bottom as well as the recipe for said weapon. The first time I went into the armory, I fell down the chute and got a shotgun. Don’t get me wrong, shotguns are awesome, but I didn’t get to look at the other weapons I could have made.\n\nIn one of the recent patches, one of the developers of Terraria actually added a few things into Edge of Space. It’s great to see that Edge of Space has the support of a well-known and beloved developer, and it’s even better to see Skeletron inside of Edge of Space. Omegatron, as it’s called in-game, adds some much needed flavor to the typical crabs and floating snails you’ll find outside your base, not to mention he’s very difficult.\n\nIn the end, Edge of Space is still very much a work in progress. If you go in expecting a full-fledged game with lots of content and polish, you’ll be sorely disappointed. What Edge of Space excels at is creating a unique environment with interesting gunplay and addictive gameplay. It’s tough to quit playing when you’re in the middle of setting up a fortress, or going on an expedition to dangerous zones. Given a few extra months in the oven and I have no doubt that Edge of Space will easily turn into something that will be worth your money.","March 27, 2014","true","49.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The sheer variety of weapons, deployables, pets, mounts, materials, dungeons, bosses etc is impressive, and although there are some obvious similarities to Terraria for instance, it is in fact a very different game. I would definitely recommend trying to find someone else who you can play with though, as it does enhance the experience a lot.\n\nThere is a sort of tutorial in the form of a friendly laser shark who asks you to do a few short quests to get you used to the basic mechanics of the game, but the rest is mostly left up to you to figure out, (there are instructions on how to do everything if you dig in the menu) and so a degree of effort is required in order to get into the real meat of the content. Once you do however, you'll realise just how much there is to do and discover.\n\nEdge of space is very colourful and is graphically the equivalent of eating too many packets of Skittles in one sitting, the pallette is well chosen and easy on the eye, the art style is great, and everything stands out. Some players have complained about the lighting system but personally I haven't had any problems with it.\n\nThe music is great, very relaxing and suits the mood well. The best thing however is the splendidly warped sense of humour that the developers obviously have and that comes across not only in the design of the world but in many of the descriptions and explanations that are there to be read if you take the time (and I recommend that you do)\n\nGameplay is a lot of fun and some of the weapons in particular are extremely satisfying to use. I know I have only just started to scratch the surface but already I am enjoying flying around on a net full of jellyfish with a small glowing fox creature following me around and helping to light my journey into the planet's extensive cave systems.\n\nIn summary, if you like randomly generated 2D exploration games with crazy amounts of content and are willing to put in the time and effort required to get through the initial learning stages, then you will get very good value from Edge of space, even more if you can find someone else to team up with.","October 10, 2015","true","6.1"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","23","39","2","0"

EoS has a really good character customization layout, and for a beta game, it has a lot of variaty and choice, it even has 'Deal With It' sunglasses!! EoS is a Single-Player and Multi-Player game, which is very impressive since it is only beta. It does make sense how EoS is such a well-made game, the developers of EoS have also made some really sucsessful Side-Scroller/Sandbox games e.g. terraria, an extremely sucsessful game and has many fans, and is what brought me to that kind of genre of game, so if the devs have made an extremely sucsessful game like Terraria, then EoS has quite a high chance of being really sucsessful game, and it even has the chance to become even more sucsessful than Terraria itself! When you start the game there is a tutorial in your spaceship which gives you objectives to show you how the game works, and gives you items which you need when you go to the surface of the planet you are on, so far I have seen three lifeforms, which i will not spoil to everyone, you should buy the game to see everything for yourself. The crafting interface is really cool as you can select  what you want to make, then instead of going into your Inventory you can click on select on the material you need, then it shows you how much you have in your inventory and how much you need. Overall i think that when EoS is at its Prime, It could me the most sucsessful game of that genre.\n9.999999999999999999999999999999999999999 / 10","August 3, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I came over from Terraria, expecting a similar game, but Edge of Space isn't another Terraria. While some core features remain the same, the game styles are very different. I am very fond of the developing team, and I think they're amazing so far. Their updates go as scheduled, and if there's a bug or a problem, they address the issue right away.\n\nI have really high hopes for this game, and I believe it has a lot of potential.

Before starting, you create a character(similar to that of Terraria) and you are greeted with a tutorial on the wrecked ship in orbit beyond repair. You are introduced to mechanics and rewarded with equiptment thats later used ingame (though the tutorial is entirely unneccesary it is recommended for beginners unless given help by others). There are currently 2 biomes (two more are currently being coded into the steam version of the game) that are ound by decending into the planet. The first biome being completly shattered into pieces, and the 2nd currently unexplored by me. The bosses (and possibly dungeons) are found in wormholes that collapse in a specific amount of time corresponding to how long the dungeon or boss is. This is VERY similar to the dungeons in Realm of the Mad God, just timed. The death system consists of a main reconstrustion device found at the worlds spawn point. It starts with ten rods that decreases one with every death, upon depletion of the rods (you can create more) you drop items ( I have not died enough times so I am unaware as to what you drop armor and pet wise). The crafting is still a mystery to me as the wiki is completly useless and all guides are outdated, so I am unaware how your technology advances. The day and night cycle is a bit brutal, when is transistions, it happens automaticly (I am unaware if this is going to be changed). When it becomes night, it is pitch black, and lighting will be needed. The power is what most of all machines use. You must find a area of power (there is a tool for it showing blue for power and green for no power) and place a generator there, then you connect the + slot of the generator to the - slot on electronics (you will see it) and it should work. There is a energy bar that your upgradable jetpack consumes that can be increased with armor. Pets are found similarly to terraria, found in chest and can be activated for buffs such as lighting or just for a passive look.\n\nTerraria\n\nSome of you may want to know about the terraria connection. It is similar, in looks and gameplay. It also has the Omegatron, a mechanical Skeletron (NOT a Skeletron Prime) that appears to be the first boss fought. This is the only info I have though it looks as if there is a Eater pet from the corruption, and Magma Armor. I have no idea what the frozen Redigit is about.\n\nSpecial Edition\n\nThis edition comes with a better starting pick, better armor, a exclusive pet, a soundtrack and concept art.\n\nThat is all I know of this game so far, thanks for reading my review, and good day.","June 29, 2014","true","5.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game runs smooth, the 2D graphics are amazing; I definitely love how the developers broke away from the typical pixel art you see in most games of the genre. What definitely makes me appreciate this game, is not only the quality of the visuals and the sound; but what makes it different from other games like Starbound or Terraria. That being said, it has its drawbacks; which are mainly peeves on mine as mentioned in the cons section.\n\nPros:\n+ Exceptional 2D artwork and visuals, definitely shines brighter than others of its genre.\n+ Nice and fitting contemporary Sci-fi theme.\n+ Biome diversity and abundance of interesting places to explore.\n+ The PIOS system which allows you to wire power to objects.\n+ Technology tree and research aspects are present.\n+ Nice crafting system.\n\nUncertain:\n= The game feels grindy, but at the same time it prolongs the game.\n\nCons:\n- The NPC's you get are really lame. You have a flying shark that sounds like a 5 year old, and a bunch of annoying furry "aliens". Really devs, couldn't you be more creative and make up some interesting sentient alien species?\n- Sometimes, there is an excessive amount of creature spawns.\n- Some creatures have a very obnoxious knockback.\n- There needs to be more biomes/content.\n\nOverall: If you like these kind of open-world, randomly generated 2D platform games; this is definitely for you.","October 4, 2015","true","46.6"," 19 of 32 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","19","32","2","0"

The timer has a few days till the next update so I'll update this then but I have exhausted about all i can do in its current state in a few days time.  I do think it had more that is currently being rewritten that may be blocking me but don't expect the complete experience of a game like terraria yet but what is here is great and I'm happy to of supported this game early.  I could build more, explore for more upgrade capsules and such (and I may) but recipes are limited, just a warning.\n\nOnly 6 hours in so far but I like what I've seen.  This and starbound are apparently the 2 biggest games like this getting made right now (darkout deserves mention here since it could easily be the best if it gets more love) and with all the negative stuff I have read about starbound and the dev's attitude in general, edge was the one I chose.  Its fresh and new to me so I can't really critique it properly until I get to endgame to see how wiring and engineering possabilities stack up to terraria and have a better feel of the progression and what exactly is available  The fact that i have schamatics for various relays, switches and 'and gate' 'or gate' and 'not gate' makes me very happy even though I don't know if its possible to use them yet.  One thing I can say is that it will get enough time out of me to, at least, pay for the game in my eyes.  This won't be one of those many games on my list with 1.5 hours played and never touched again.  I'm more of a mechanics style gamer style game but I can already tell it has a ton of customization to those that like to decorate with TV's and such for whatever reason in the places they build.  I do appriciate the more advanced stats this has like various resistances and damage types.  Time will tell how it stacks up with terraria but I can't see any reason not to grab this if you want a new terraria experience to relax with at the end of the day.  It also has timers to show when updates are coming so thats nice and its kind of cool being in on the development cycle since I didn't play terraria till it was finished.  This way I get to see new stuff added and get ot be excited about it as it grows and expands.","July 13, 2014","true","20.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Edge of space is a really interesting game, it plays differently from Terraria and starbound, it's truly a breath of fresh air for the genre. The weapon focus is more on guns at the moment, although they told me they are to add melee weapons in at a future time. As for graphics, the graphics are amazing and have a interesting feel, actually kinda throws me back to the days of the SNES, kinda breaking away from that pixel feel but also sticking to it. As for the music the music makes me feel a lot of things it's ambient and interesting it's kinda sad but in a good way. Point is, It's a fun game really, the level design is interesting and there are many canverns and areas to explore. The game is challenging as a rhino trying to climb a tree made of tomato skin, it takes some getting used to. It's a little slow at first but once you figure it out, it's awesome.

Perhaps most importantly, it is actually fun to play. I was initially dubious, since I am new to this genre of game, but, at the behest of a friend, I decided to give it a chance. I am very glad that I did, because flying (even for short distances) with a jet pack is all that I hoped it would be. I am still waiting for my real-life jet pack, universe!\n\nAs I have never played this type of game before, it took me longer than the average person (I assume) to get through the tutorial. This was not, however, because the tutorial was not well-structured. In fact, it taught me all the basics I needed to know for this game without much superfluous fluff. I just had trouble with, for instance, remembering that I could jump down platforms.\n\nIn addition, it is clear from the regular patches and updates that the developers are highly invested in making the game-play experience as bug-free and enjoyable as possible. This is the first early access game that I've purchased, and thanks to my positive experience with Edge of Space, I will be taking my chances on other early access games in the future.\n\nBest,\nCV","December 18, 2014","true","3.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","1"

(If your reading this, and its been fixed, then disregard that)\n\nB. Enemy Detecting: I cant tell an enemy from a friend, the next thing I know a tiny little bug incapacitated me. The game is spacey so why not add a techno enemy detector or something spacey? It would be nice to have done in those 28 days before the MEGA UPDATE!\n\nC.

Only boss I found was Omegatron and he was pretty awesome to fight, but just imagine the other bosses they made.\n\nAgain, there is some optimization needed in the game, but the game is fresh out of launch and perhaps this isn't what they expected to happen at launch and I bet they are working on it right now, so just take it with a grain of salt, ok?","September 23, 2015","true","165.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Does it still have a few rough spots? Sure, but what game doesn't on initial release, but they are working hard on it, to fix what is going on, and are very connected with the community giving us regular updates on whats up.\n\nThe game is built around the idea of exploration, terraforming and expansion. Each of which is handled very well.\n\nThe experience system that has been added in replacing the old way of researching is MUCH better and a welcome addition, as is all the UI cleanup that has been done.\n\nOne thing I love about this game is there is nothing you pick up that is completely worthless (except building structure tiles if you don't plan to build with them). You can use Dirt, Stone, Biomass, jelly, shark stuff, to make guns, armor, jetpacks, tools and ammo.\n\nThe Game is deep, and has more content in it than I will ever have time to discover, but for those of you whom have enjoyed Terraria, Starbound and Crea this is a welcome addition to the collection.\n\nLike I said, it's not a perfect game, but it still a heck of a lot of fun, I'd give it a 8/10.\n\n(Also be very warry of the negative reviews, most were done while it was in EA and a lot has changed since then, or many have been posted since it went live, but they have 0.0 hours of play time since it has.)","September 23, 2015","true","20.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Never mind the old negative reviews, as they were made way back when the game is still in Early Access, with lots of bugs. Now there are still bugs out there, but it has improved greatly.\n\nUP points:\n- Vast world (The first biome can easily as big as, if not bigger than, a Large map in Terraria);\n- Various quests, both main and side;\n- Interesting mechanism, both leveling and crafting;\n- Good sound effects;\n- Neat 2D graphic;\n\nDOWN points:\n- Bugs. Bugs! BUGS! There are a lot of bug fixes needed.\n- The menu is not actually scaled with windows' dimensions (i.e. you cannot create new character in 800x600, in-game UI is partly of screen, etc.);\n- The whole world is loaded in Unity so it will greatly drop you FPS on low-end PC;\n- Character control is poorly built: the character's arm is like a stick attached to the body, it cannot bend so it is really awkward in close-ranged action;\n- THERE IS NO HORIZONTAL INERTIA! There is vertical onertia, which mean it take time for you to speed up and slow down vertically. Horizontal: Nope.

The AI is clairvoyant, always knowing where to aim at any moment, and the explosive weapon of one of the first three enemies you will face can break large holes into your base, allowing the rest to hit you directly, killing a player obscenely quickly. Secondly, the crafting is on a tech tree, requiring spelunking with useless tier-1 equipment to try to unlock tier-2 and so on, sadly, the depth you can reach is restricted, and a player will often never find anything before death forces them to their respawn point. The crafting is clunky and difficult, the UI is a battle to navigate with almost no quick access to the comically named "hotbar", and the tutorial is laughably incomplete. I bought this game believing I was buying into alpha software, and it felt like that, in mid-beta. The gameplay feels confused, torn between rogue-lite and Terraria-esque sidescrolling sandbox.\nEnemy variety is good, and the art style is unique and appealing, but the gameplay needs severe work.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews #54 - Edge of Space\n\nYou'll get an immediate sense of the quirky writing in Edge of Space as you start by having a conversation with a talking shark.  There isn't that much of a story to tell, just that your spaceship crashed and now you are stranded on a planet.  The writing is definitely tongue-in-cheek.\n\nI liked how the game began, and appreciated that it wasn't too difficult to begin with.  Although I do wish they had explained some things a little better.  The game includes a "tutorial video" that I felt was kind of a shortcut, as opposed to just better integrating a tutorial into the game.  Still, the first set of quests you get involve gathering various components to then craft into items, which is a pretty major part of the gameplay.\n\nI wish the controls were better.  I found mining to be frustrating at times.  You use a mining pick that you aim with your mouse.  But the aim is weird at times.  I kept wanting to just point my mouse cursor at a block to mine.  But the aim is actually based on the position of your cursor relative to a point on your body in order to determine direction.  This means sometimes, even when your mouse cursor is on a block, the aim is actually causing the laser to hit a different block.  It's a minor annoyance but mining is such a major part of the gameplay that it definitely adds up.\n\nIf you've played Terraria, then you'll pretty much know exactly what to expect here.  It's pretty hard not to consider this game a knock off.  There are some minor differences with crafting, like the way you can use different items to fill a recipe.  But as a whole the gameplay feels extremely familiar.   I don't hold it against Edge of Space for being a knock off, but when you're borrowing from another game, you should at least make some notable improvements.  And it really doesn't feel that way.  And when you add the fact that Terraria is cheaper ($14.99 vs. $9.99 regular prices), I really can't recommend this game unless you've just played Terraria to death and want to scratch that itch with a different game.","March 30","false","1.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Most of what usaully turns me away from early acces games is the devs forget about the players after a bit and turn the game into a money grab for them, but thankfully Eos's devs show no sign of doing so. (thanks guys)\n\nAddictive gameplay, EoS has a feel that you have to keep on going to the next thing, boss after boss, domain after domain.\n\nThe fact that you have categories instead of a specific item being needed for every recipe. In my opinion, this really helps because you can swap clay for dirt for mud for rock etc. This helps because you dont have to grind your way through the world looking for specific resources.\n\nIt has a story, unlike most games (except starbound) this game follows a story that explains why you are randomly stuck on a planet with a cryopod as a respawn point.\n\nCons: As of 9/19/15 i cannot think of any cons\n\nThe advertising video is a complete lie: 9/19/15 edit: not anymore!!! the trailer pretty much sums up the gameplay (congratulations to the devs for finnaly completing it)\n\nThe sections of the research list (my hotkey is L) of Experimental armor, Assualt armor, and Recon armor: 9/19/15 edit: no longer relevant =x\n\nAlso you cant get structure blocks for a base until a few hours in: 9/19/15 edit: FIXED: can get this almost immediately after creating the world\n\nAlmost forgot to mention the tiny damage of the starter gun: 9/19/15 edit: FIXED ;D starter gun is now has fair damage and guns are easier to craft Good Job Devs","July 24, 2014","true","60.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You start out in a game with a spawn point and are given lots of blueprints to activate then craft.  Where I get pretty annoyed and usually give up is the whole downward scrolling aspect of the game.  To reach the first 'layer' of a surface, you need to drop down,  which requires building stairs back up to the initial block of dirt you spawn in to presumably build your starting base.\n\nGetting back to the whole verticle scrolling aspect of the game.  Going up and and down all the time requires building lots of stairs and frequent use of your jetpack.  The problem is, it recharges extremely slowly,  resulting in a lot of time just waiting to use it.   Lighting is also trickier than in other survival games:  there's a few flareguns and torches to be placed,  but they all require using the crafting menu,  which is tedious. For example, to craft an item you need to select the materials you want to use first,  sometimes there's a huge list of materials you need and if you are missing one, you'll have to re-select all of them again if you want to try and craft again.   A lot of the time you'll find yourself in the dark trying to climb out of a pit of some sort, and hope you don't accidently fall further downwards to certain doom.\n\nSpeaking of tedious,  everything just feels tedious to me about the game.  Mining is about as exciting as watching blocks smoke from heat before turning into collectable ores.  Crafting requires dragging a blueprint to your inventory slots, selecting the slot,  holding left click to activate the blueprint,  then right clicking the inventory slot to remove the blueprint.  This is just a typical example of how something is done in this game and honestly I don't feel like any of it is as intuitive as it should be.\n\nCombat is also pretty sleepy.  You shoot enemies,  and they die.  There's no real weight to the combat and it's just not very gratifying.\n\nOverall tho, the game does feel solid as I say.  Personally I just fall asleep trying to figure something out,  but that's just me.  Many will find the game appealing because there is much to do and there's a lot of content,  so if the aforementioned things don't bug you, feel free to dive in.","August 17, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It obviously lacks of fun and ecxiting things to do but it has its simple charm of just simplistic things to do, I'm sure you'll have a good time if you don't compare to terraria and starbound. (unless you hate these 2D kind of games... why would you even consider buying this if thats the case....)\n\nLong Review:\n\nLets start with describing what its missing and what needs to change. CONS:\nFirst of all, as everyone would say about this game, is that its various inventory and crafting "pop ups" are complete rubbish. They need to change all of these because has it is for now, you have to press around 7 different keys to open 7 different things that literaly take up ALL you screen. And btw it also doesn't pause the game so you'll be sure to be killed if you don't pay attention. So all this inventory bussiness needs to be sorted out.\nYou'll also have a hard time getting used to this weird new crafting mechanic they use. Even though it isn't the worst, it sure is quite different... I personally don't mind it because it forces you to go out of your base and mine and kill stuff for experience. You then spend this experience on different types of weapons or armor. Tbh the armor and weapons they have at the moment are quite boring. There is nothing special about them so you'll end up just picking what does more damage and what benifits you the most. They will need to make each weapon type more special and more ecxiting.\nFinally the envirnment is also quite dull. A lot of what this game lacks of is just fun and cool stuff to do, to craft and to explore. There are some locations to fight and conquer, but there's nothing "special" about them...\n\nSo now that we've discussed the cons here are some of the PRONS:\nThis game has this ability to really start you offvery easily with barely any enemies to attack you at the beggining but has you go further down, the enemies only get stronger and thougher with chaging backgrounds as well. Not many games allow you to start off like this like this game does, and it really helps just to work out what you are supposed to be doing (cause thats quite hard at the begining).\nFor the reason above, this means that this is quite a relaxing game. It has a wonderfull soundtrack to it which really had an impact on me the first time. I really managed to fully relax and enjoy the game with this wonderfull soundtrack.\nI also think the mining in this game is great. You are able to last as long as you want (usually) just peacefully minning away without some great powerful monster sneaking up on you.

I would say to buy this if you are looking for something out of the oridnary and isn't trying to follow the same foot steps that terraria has left so give it a try (when it isn't as expensive as it is wight now because it definitely isn't worth that much money, basically get it on a sale if you are bored, k bye im done here...)\n","January 5","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, what is here is all good.  Edge of Space, unlike other games of this genre, is much more combat focused - collecting "tech" upgrades and data from the creatures you murder unlocks the next tier of craftables, which is a pretty nice change of pace from the genre staple "dig downward to win" scheme.\n\nHow it works as of this patch, however... kind of grindy.  It's definitely in need of tuning (and the devs have mentioned it's going to get said tuning) but the system itself is a nice change of pace.\n\nWhat the game sorely lacks now is content - the core systems appear to work well, so it really just needs to be loaded with items, enemies, ores, and mores.","July 17, 2014","true","9.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The forums were kicking on the main webpage and wheels were turning with update ideas and the direction of the game. Fast forward 2-3 years and there is a lot of development, a lot of change, and a game that has been finished. There were many character wipes and world wipes along the way = That was to be expected. I bought it on pre-order before early access, and played for about 6-8 months through early access, so a few save wipes isn't a huge deal.\n\nHowever, I think another user said it best " I think the negative reviews are born mostly out of frustration with how long the game took to get from early access to release."\n\nHere we are three years later with a game that is no longer in Early Access but still has clunky controls and somewhat of a grind feel. However - it has come a long way, and if you came  here NOT expecting to grind in order to craft and survive, I don't know what you were expecting.\n\nI played some of the most recent updates and will update my review from not recommended to recommended, but with a disclaimer attached: This game still doesn't feel 100% to me. But, Terraria never did either - far from it - and everyone loves to compare this title to Terraria. Terraria was lacking in story line, direction, but had an abundance of content and playability with constant updates. This game is proceeding along a similar path, but a  year or so ago they introduced a Tutorial stage at the beginning of the game. Instead of the tutorial level - the game now appears to have something else, that exists more as a dialogue feature that I won't spoil.\n\nI"ll keep checking in on the updates as they come along.","December 29, 2015","true","39.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

So I created a new character with the same name as my old one and without so much as an "Are you sure you want to do that?" my old character was instantly wiped from existence.\n\nThen I found out that you have a different set of characters for single and multiplayer, so I couldn't even use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that had ruthlessly murdered his predecessor.\n\nNot a great first impression.\n\nExtremely buggy, crashes often, lots of multiplayer glitches and gaffs, progression is very grindy. Artwork is kind of ugly, crafting receipes don't make sense (craft guns and high-tech looking workbenches out of dirt, mud, clay, and stone?) Inventory management is awkward as hell, controls are awful (Tab is both reload and switch between layers, but isn't mentioned in tutorial? Background bricks can't be mind unless they're borders, but ore generates in the bckground, ensuring that you'll always leave some behind? Double-press X to pick up furniture?)\n\nOverall, a prime example of a game that SHOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE YET. This is exactly what's wrong with early access.\n\nMaybe one day it will be good.

Also, there doesn't appear to be a dungeon in the 3rd biome\nLight radius is small (spamming torches helps but that's just annoying)\nWeapons never really get powerful, even the Death Dealer takes multiple hits on spike balls (personal con, I like to feel powerful when I get to the end of a game)\nStill a lot of stuff that feels unfinished (many items share sprites, no dungeon in 3rd biome)\nI didn't try multiplayer but it sounds like it takes quite a bit of work to set up a server and to get people to join\n\nThey are still working on the game, but at a much slower pace.  I hope they make another game because I have enjoyed Edge of Space for what it is and I would like to see something new using what they have learned developing this game.\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nI would recommend the game at the stage it is currently at if they sold it as a finished game.  So, the fact that they are still working on it and improving it all the time makes it an easy recommendation.  The devs are very active in the forums and constantly updating the game.  One of the devs even broadcasts on twitch sometimes while wearing a shark suit.

AND dont let my time played on steam fool you, trust me I have hours soaked into this game.\n\nNow for the pros and cons.\n\n-PROS-\n-tons of weapons\n-tons of armor\n-lots of really cool mounts, such as SPACE RAPTORS, gaint crabs, mechs and gunships, even ones that help you build and mine!\n-lots of really cool decor and important building items\n-has a really cool power system in which you can root a power supply to your lights, doors, and even crafting stations.\n-a great number of really cool enemies to fight from flying jellyfish to polarbears with artillery cannons on their backs.\n-has dungeons with some rather awesome boss fights\n-3 types of armor, fighter, builder and explorer, each pretty self explanatory.\n-constant updates which always fix problems and bring in awesome new toys.\n-as is,  the game has a ton of fun content that will keep you busy for hours.\n\nI could keep going but I think you get the point.\n\n-CONS-\n\n-You dont own this game\n-has a few bugs, nothing really GAME breaking, except for the UI problems, opening menus and such lag the menus out, this while really game breaking is being broken down on as we speak, so in a week or two you can most likely ignore this.\n-needs a bit more upbeat music, mostly for events etc.\n\nWell honestly thats all I can think of.. if you are a fan of games like terraria or starbound, or just a fan of 2d games where you can build, then give this game a go its great!  With the speed of updates and endless content they can put out for it im sure this game will keep going strong for a long time, once they fix that UI lag... good bye social life.\n\n","October 9, 2015","true","63.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

This game requires that you base build in order to survive the monsters in the night, and to have a grid of power to build new gear or get companions.

Playable. Hours of game play. Survival. Dont have to remember Crafting. Music. Can make anything with anything. You have the right to record EdgeOfSpace I believe. Has Mutiplayer. Tutorial on basics at the beginning. Achievements(Not a good thing to the game, just something I like about games).\n\nCons - Needs bug fixes, and more ores to find early on. Crabs are too OP at the beginning. Run out of energy too fast. YOu dont regain Energy as fast as you loose it. Everything wants to kill you. No tutorial on how to make Energy work with the doors or CommandCenter(which i believe will be added?). No trading Cards(Not a downside, just something most steam games have, which I believe this game will have shortly later).\n\nPersonal Review - Ive only had this game for 1-2 days, but I can tell you, this game is a great game and has a lot of potential for a early access game. Look forward to the updates and how it will improve to be a better game than what it is now. I strongly recomend this game if you are looking for a game like Terraria and/or Starbound to play with your friends. The energy/electricty system is a little hard to understand first, but I hope it will get better with the updates. With mutiplayer you can get things done a whole lot faster, as ive played with my three other friends. If you want a survival game I recomend this game. The music is great, and has a spaceish feel to it. Mutiplayer is easy to use, just open your ports, and get the IP, boom youre in. Playabe, and has hours of game play just to get the basic things.\n\nI Love this game so far, and I am looking forward to the updates to make this game even better! I am planning to make a gameplay series of this game, show the updates, and how to do things in the game.\nKeep up the good work Devs!","June 18, 2014","true","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I bought in on a whim in my early terraira burn-out phase. Wasn't much then, but the developers have been working hard to improve the game and it shows. Countless patches later this game could launch today and it would get solid reviews. I recommend this one to anyone with a love for rouge likes and has a taste for the sci-fi our fathers used to enjoy. Outside of that, this is at it's core a mining/crafting game. Nothing special to remark outside of differences from other games in genre. Overall not bad compared to other offerings either when it comes to controls, content and depth. Sure, it's not on the same scale as Starbound, and nothing is as polished as terraira, but this game has character and immersion. The rough edges of this work in progress are limited to a lack  of good interface and general tutorials that leave much to be desired. I haven't truly logged enough hours to speak about end game, but I want you to know that I havent regret my purchase since day one (well over a year before this review). Check it out, I think you'll probably end up feeling the same.\n\n(Additional Edit: 4/26/15)\nI just wanted to update my review based on the current state of the game.

Please, if you are like me and weary of seeing such things before you purchase, give each and every negative review a read to make sure. This game is a work in progress. It should go without saying, but this is going to have bugs. It's going to have wipes. They are going to release patches that break, change, or completely destroy previous things. Accept it or dont buy early access titles. For what its worth; I still give this game the "safe to buy in" approval. It's a little clunky here and there, but they have really done SO much to improve the game. Its got everything one would expect from a game of this genre. If you're a fan of SciFi and Crafting/Rouge-likes, you would be doing yourself a disservice to not take the dive on this one. Its a solid game already and the Developers are VERY attentive and constantly updating. Don't let the mixed review status turn you off.

I still haven't got to the end-game yet, in fact, I barely even started. According to my character, I have learned less than 10% of everything you can learn in the game.\n\nProgression Part 2\n-This may seem grindy, but Edge of Space made this slow progression curve actually fun. They broke up the progression in a way where there's branches you pick, like armor crafting, weapon crafting, base construction and even pet creation, and there's 15 tiers of progression in each branch, each successing tier costing more knowledge points. Everything gives you knowledge points to spend to progress further, and the deeper you dig into the planet, the more points you earn.\n\nNPC's and Crafting Stations\n-There's NPC's that hand out quests, which keep you busy, some requiring harder to achieve materials than others. And on top of these NPC's, there's a large amount of crafting stations, requiring you to have some kind of base. There's also command centers, which provide power to nearby devices which require power. It's a neat system I don't see in too many games.\n\nCONS:\n\n(Let's be honest here, no game is perfect. So, let's get to the chase, and say the things I've noticed and dislike about this game. Also, keep in mind that everything I have said is my opinion)\n\nTextures\n-Quite a few items in the game share the same texture, like Soft Chitin and Penguin Explosives. These 2 items are very different, but they look exactly the same, and it's a little annoying. This is one example of items sharing the same texture, and there are a few more instances.\n\nMultiplayer\n-Multiplayer is a bit janky. When me and my friend played on a server I hosted, we noticed you can have only 1 of each Quest NPC in the world, and command centers (They provide power), cannot be placed anywhere near each other. So, what I'm saying is you and your friend have to share a base, or your friend has to live far away, and one of you has to walk all the way to the other player's base to talk to the NPC's. Also, the quests are independent, but at least the dungeons you can go to are publicly accesible which slighly makes up for this. But all in all, I was far ahead of my friend, and had all the quest NPC's, which ruined his experience a little bit, because we were independently progressing.\n\nAll in all, this game has more pros than cons in my opinion, and makes for a great game. If you don't feel comfortable paying $14.99, then wait for a sale. I got this game for only $4.99 around Christmas, and trust me, if you think this game isn't worth $15, then it most certainly is worth $5, because this game has potential for hours of enjoyment!\n\n-KLuebbert","January 16","true","27.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The aiming system could use some tweaking or the enemies should move slower because it is very difficult to hit them. Im not sure if killing jely metroids is the only way to make torches, but it is very tedious with how the starting weapon is so maybe an alternative and easier method of crafting torches could be adopted if there is not one allready.\n\nThe concept is really nice, its good to see a scifi approach to this kind of sidescrolling adventure. I am looking forward to future imrovements and hpoing at least some of the above problems will be addressed.\n\nThis review is subject to change with future updates.","February 26, 2014","false","10.8"," 110 of 214 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","110","214","0","14"

My computer is an Asus Rog Gaming Laptop, win 10, and I have an nvidia card.\n\nThe mini patches since 1.0 hit have improved the game a lot, in my opinion.\n\nActive Devs that really want this game to succeed and are willing to do whatever it takes — though they get knocked around a lot by players that seem unwilling to give them time to hear and fix any issues that might be present…\n\nCons:\n\nThe Lead Dev has said the game was designed more for multiplayer, so mobs tend to spawn in waves that can overwhelm a single playing character… After reading that bit of info, I was sad, because I look at these games as something I wish to spend a lot of time with soloing. Like in Terraria when I played with a friend he wanted to kill this boss, and that boss, and I wanted to just find resources. I never played with anyone again, though once I got to Moon Lord I lost interest, because I realized that fight wasn’t balanced for single player at all (my opinion).\n\nEOS needs some patches to iron out the kinks, and I bet my life SO WILL Terraria Otherworld when it’s released. Even Terraria has had at least a half dozen mini patches since 1.3 hit, and I don’t see anyone knocking Terraria for it… And Starbound will continue to see many updates and patches before and after its 1.0 version hits… Whenever that might happen — sooner than later, me hopes!\n\nPlayers rush to leave negative feedback, rather than logging the problem and helping the Devs get a handle on it. They have asked and asked for player input via logs, but some grumpy, unhelpful players would rather sink their chance at sales than help get the game working perfectly for everyone.\n\nThe game is extensive and resource gathering takes a long, long time. And some ingredients are very hard to find and farm — like Penguin parts and even Headhunter parts, and though I love to farm resources, even I wish these dropped more often…\n\nSometimes things feel unfair, unbalanced, such as weapon upgrades that don’t do much to make you feel like the mobbies are being hurt… I swear there was a penguin laughing at me at a Penguin Rave — it was hysterical, this little penguin dancing at a Rave as I’m shooting him, pew pew for half a minute…\n\nIt seems New Players find the beginning confusing, and perhaps because the game is so extensive more time should have been put into a longer, more engaging tutorial, with an option to skip it for more advanced players…\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nPersonally I’m enjoying my time in the game, and though I have a large library, it keeps pulling me back with that one more node feeling, and I wake up excited to play and find new areas and new upgrades, etc. Some might not like gathering, farming games, and if the game is balanced around MP, I think MP should have been a bigger priority, as I believe a lot of complaints have stemmed from the MP community, AND I feel us solo players might not find the game as satisfying in the later stages, if the game really cannot be completed single player (which I’ve no idea if it can or cannot, but I’m hoping!!!)","September 25, 2015","true","88.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I own Terraria and Starbound but the latter left me burned with it's launch and follow through by the developers, but this isn't about that.\n\nI'd been interested in Edge of Space for some time and had it on my Wishlist for a couple months before finally picking it up. A quick look through the history of the games shows I missed some of the blunder years the game held and am playing it after a UI and tier revamp so I can't comment on anything prior to the date above.\n\nThe game looks good, though I wish there were more customization items for characters, the style they've presented works well and I had no probably playing my marathon session of the game these past 2-3 days (17 hours) and the music is pretty darn good as well. Normally I listen to my own music collection during these types of games but I left the background BGM on and didn't grow to hate it.\n\nThe controls are smooth as well and how you can move is really limited to your gear and how well you can control your jet pack, using weapons can be tricky sometimes however. The game has a few different weapon types in its starter tier from the basic automatic rifle, sniper rifle, and mortar launcher. I've found myself using the sniper rifle and mortar exclusively. You have unlimited ammo but there is a reload timer but that's not why I don't use the automatic, the main reason is damage and difficulty hitting enemies. I played exclusively in a local hosted server with friends and there were times were you can't hit an enemy due to their size, movement, and shots just passing through (most likely due to the server lagging) so we found more success with the area damage of the mortar and taking the risk with the sniper rifle.\n\nCrafting is pretty extensive as well. There are three armor types and many branches of crafting to "skill up" by using Science XP gained from mining, crafting, and hunting monsters (which is the best gainer later on) and unlike Terraria and Starbound the dungeons aren't found in the world but you rather transport to them after gaining enough coordinates to get to them. Once you enter the dungeon the rules change, you can't use your mining laser or jet pack. Having these taken away really changes how you go against an enemy as you now have to time your jumping and can't block or tunnel away from an enemy (or through a stage) and personally I feel is nice change. Unfortunately I haven't seen the dungeon boss yet as during the dungeon we had problems with the game failing to load or players games blanking to grey in the dungeon.\n\nOverall however, I am really pleased with the purchase and look forward to future updates with the game. It does have a learning curve and some of the UI elements are weird (I've hit escape hoping to clear a open menu more times than I can count, it doesn't work) but overall at it's current stage it's fun and playable.","November 28, 2014","true","74.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zolfuz/recommended/238240/","zolfuz","zolfuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zolfuz/","474 products in account","ENGLISH\n\nAn excellent videogame of exploration, building and combat in 2D with high doses of Science Fiction and a bit of humor.\nHer thrilling and beautiful OST it's a perfect companion for travel in the universe, it's really charming; and the punk-futuristic aesthetic make it unique!, like her ENORMOUS set of guns of all types, included melee, that are a delight in its execution. It's really a pleasure to kill enemies with such of variety of guns and type of ammunition (included energy!), giving you a lot of different ways to confront a battle. One of the best aspect of the game, for sure!\n\nAnother thing very important for this type of games are the tools for gather materials, because you spend a lot of time using them; in this case we have a Laser Pick for mining that feels really really well, you just need to familiarize with his use; and when I say "feels really well", I meant fun and addictive. And for harvesting the vegetation we have a Laser Saw, that feels very well too. Plus, an excellent sound and visual effects for both actions, It's felt very carefully, and this count for the whole game. Personally, when a game has very good sound and music, It becomes more pleasant to spend time in.\nSo, gathering it's very fun in this game and you can go faster in the job when you upgrade your tools and appear the possibility of craft different type of robots and bombs to help you in the job. Remember that this is a Science Fiction game, so expect a lot of crazy stuff, like bizarre enemies and the magnificent "Cloning Tank"!. I love that Station because it gave me my first best friend: The Fire Fox pet! <3 Then he was scratched by my Health Kitty... sorry Foxy! :P\n\nBuilding is very easy and quick, the range for title placement is very long, so you can build strange things according with the madness of your laboratory very soon. And there is a lots of furniture and decorations to satisfy your more deep wishes! I really enjoy building some special place to "live", but with the access to teleportation you can divide you lab in various floors distributed in different parts of the map, but be careful if a fly interfere in the process!\n\nThe Game had a remarkable growth during the Early Access stage, to conclude with a game very enjoyable and with a high grade of content for your entertainment. Obviously there is more room for improvements, and I understand that the developer team is small and sometimes users become more ambitious than the creators themselves, and they demand too quickly that all the aspect of the game were completed and in a perfect state, believing that life and programming are simple... but the true is, that the game give me a lot of satisfaction as it stands now, I enjoy every minute I spend in it, regardless of bugs or the lack of advantage in the UI that other games of similar play style has, thanks to the opportunity to mature for years and eventually, get the polish they want. Well, that's the path of Edge of Space, meanwhile you have a LOT of thinks to do, and the most important is, understand that this type of games demand time to get used to new concepts proposed by the gameplay, you have to read a little with attention and you can't pretend to impose rules rooted from other games: let me tell you that when you get it, the fun increase greatly! Another reason of why I think that this game is AWESOME! <3\n\nI believe that the key is "time and patience", because I'm sure that this game is going to grow up a lot more in the future, and I say it because I saw broadcast from the developers in many opportunities and I can perceive that they are good people, with an excellent predisposition for improvement, they are respectful and they are taken very seriously the creation of the game and the suggestions of the users; so they have earned my respect and support. And because I love the game, of course...\n\nBy the way, I highly recommend playing it in cooperative. It's really entertaining and the best feature of the game! Because friends and girlfriends are all in the life, therefore also to play ^^\n\nESPAÑOL\n\nUn excelente videojuego de exploración, construcción y combate en 2D con altas dosis de Ciencia Ficción y una pizca de humor. Su apasionante OST  y su estética punk-futurista lo hacen único, al igual que su ENORME cantidad de armas de todo tipo, incluso melee, que son un deleite de ejecutar; realmente da mucha satisfacción eliminar enemigos!\n\nTuvo un notable crecimiento durante su etapa Early Access, para concluir con un juego muy ameno y con un alto contenido de material para entretenernos. Obviamente que hay espacio para mejorar y entiendo que el equipo es chico y uno a veces se vuelve más ambicioso que los propios creadores, y exige demasiado rápido que todos los aspectos del juego estén resueltos y sean perfectos, creyendo que la vida y la programación son simples... pero la verdad, me ha dado mucha satisfacción jugarlo tal cual esta, lo disfruto a cada momento sin importar bugs o la falta de comodidad en la interface que tal vez posean otros juegos del mismo estilo al haber tenido la oportunidad de madurar por años y eventualmente lograr pulir el juego.\n\nCreo que la clave es el tiempo y la paciencia, porque estoy seguro que este juego va a seguir creciendo aun mas, y lo digo porque he visto los streaming de los desarrolladores en muchas ocasiones, los leo en los foros, en el chat oficial, etc. y noto que son personas buenas y con excelente predisposición a mejorar, son respetuoso y se toman muy en serio la creación de este videojuego; por lo cual se han ganado mi respeto y mi apoyo. Y porque amo el juego, por supuesto!\n\nPor cierto, recomiendo enormemente jugarlo en cooperativo!

Game music is good, better than starbound but not as cool as Terraria. The game is more complex then Terraria and Starbound which can deter players who play it for the first time.\n\nThe tutorial explains the basic controls and concepts of the game, but in my opinion, more could have been done to explain the game mechanics for crafting.\n\nYou have to read your codex entries after the tutorial to figure out what you need to do.

(please don't hit me again)\n\n\nEdge of space is like Terraria in the general gist of things.\n\nMany things however do differ.  In example you are in space in a semi futuristic setting.\n\n1.  The "tutorial" is not as god awful as last time and is easy enough to get it done.\n\n2. The gameplay Kind of interesting the prospect of research and what you can do with it looks like it could grant some fun.\n\n3. The graphics seem to be done by a few different people because they have slightly different art styles and overall design choices but over all get the job done.  However I think if they made the graphics more pixilated (Double or triple of terraria) the game would look and even run better.\n\n4. The sounds are okay a bit cartoonish but the game is not the most serious.\n\n5. The over all optimization of the game is better than a month ago but still needs work (Still playable on medium end machines) it runs and I can do things without it crashing in a god awful tutorial then refusing to start up again!\n\n6. The price is a bit high I would say 14.99 is too steep for the game.  Even the current sale price of 10.94 is.  7 bucks would probably be a good range for the game so wait for a sale if you want it.\n\nOver all I give the game a 6/10 but if a few patches fixing fps and screen tearing ( I tried on two very different computers and it happened on them both) came out it would be a 7/10\n\n\n","September 20, 2015","true","0.4"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","11","20","4","3"

There's some really great ideas in there as well as a unique art style (Though given the size of the sprites, I can't imagine there's much modding going on with people skilled enough to pull it off).\n\nThe problem is, as always, execution. Edge of Space feels very empty, despite its vast size, and there's not much to really  do other than "Dig deeper, grind for better gear". The controls feels pretty floaty, and the gathering mechanics tend to get very weird when you want to mine a block right in front of you. Their attempts at humor are dry and fall flat on its face, as I've come to expect of indie games lately. Also, on top of frequent bugs and crashes, the game also needs some SERIOUS rebalancing around the crafting system and output. Often times you will have to grind your butt off to get a better gun, only to find that the one after that is almost trivial to acquire. Enemy frequency and damage scale up disproportionally to your ability to defend yourself.\n\nSo what DO I like about the game? The crafting system is quite brilliant - Much like the (newly released at the moment of writing) Fallout 4, you mostly rely on braking down items into basic components, in this case minerals. For instance, you can build a nice looking base with just some basic metal and dirt, no joke.\nBuilding is also a charm, as you can place blocks all over the screen without a fake limit. It's also quite refreshing to get a hi-tech tool from the get-go. I s2fg, if I have to deal with another spacey game that gives me a pickaxe, I'm rioting.\nWhen the game works, it can feel very satisfying.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I cannot recommend this game, since it still feels heavy WIP, even if it improved GREATLY since launch (It was simply awful then). The content is limited, and it's pretty clear that the game is very much unfinished at this point.\nI've found a way to enjoy it, but without the intial reason, I would have abandoned the game for good.","November 22, 2015","false","28.5"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

Somethings aren't extactly balanced yet,but don't lose hope they should fix it eventally;so if you don't see much in the game right now,you can wait a while to see further development.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/recommended/238240/","Asvarduil","Asvarduil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asvarduil/","46 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n"Edge of Space" is a construction/adventure game in the vein of Terraria, only in space!  It's a very simple premise, but somehow, as of this writing, the game doesn't quite deliver on either its potential or the intellectual legacy of Terraria, which great effort is put into establishing.\n\nThe first thing to realize about this game is that there are some really cool ideas!  You've got a laser drill, and you start with projectile weapons!.  The graphics are a miss for me (I'll get into why later), but are certainly more detailed than Terraria's, and may not be as offensive to another gamer's eye.\n\n(The following edited as of 21 May 2015...)\n\nThe game has vastly improved since my playthrough last year!  The general user experience is far less irritating than it was, and actually warrants my giving this game a chance now.\n\nWhat Works\nThe game's crafting system is awesome.  Pretty much, the game is already similar to the "Terraria Leveled" mod in some ways mechanically, but the research lines are well-defined, and the experience amounts required to unlock a tier feel correct.  What's more the amount of things you can craft without a crafting station is great for upgrading your field arsenal (from what I've seen so far.)\n\nThey fixed the guns to always hit.  This was the dealbreaker for me before.  Thank you.  Note to other game developers: in an action game, RNG-based miss mechanics are very very bad.  What's more the base tier of stuff after completing the tutorial is actually useful, which is nice!\n\nSpeaking of the tutorial, it appears simplified from the version I played earlier, and is effective at basically teaching the game.  Less was indeed more!\n\nYou can rebind keys.  This helps to mitigate some of the confusing keybindings in this game, and let you play Your Way™.\n\nWhat Doesn't Work\nFirst, you still spawn on a sky island instead of the planet's surface.  I think this is a mistake, even with jetpacks being available immediately, because jumping into a void beneath your little sky island is too much of an early risk, that I don't think a new player wants to take - at this point, we're still getting a feel for the game and the world.\n\nSecond - re-evaluate your default key bindings.  V for crafting and C for character are really counterintuitive to me.  While providing rebindable keys is nice, nailing a good preset will help this game immensely.  It was irritating to have to click the menu button every time I wanted to craft something, until I found the hotkey.\n\nSpeaking of crafting, the way you spend XP feels incredibly clunky, and the increment/decrement textfield used to implement it clashes with everything else.  Since the upgrades are straight lines, not trees, why not just allow me to click an upgrade or a button on the upgrade in order to "buy" it with the XP?\n\nThe visual style to me is hit or miss, but this gets into personal preference; if Terraria is a Saturday-morning cartoon, then this is Archer on Adult Swim, which is what I think they're going for.  This point may or may not be a sticking point for you; this "Doesn't Work" bit is purely subjective.  Some sprite mods or the ability to create sprite/tile image mods might be a good idea, though.\n\nThe (New) TL;DR\nOnce, I did not recommend this game; it wasn't ready for the public.  Luckily a few patches seem to have come and gone to help resolve that situation.  The developers need to study up on good User Experience (UX) quite a bit more, and take it as a lesson learned going forward - UX seems to be one of their weaknesses that they have to fight against.  However, the interesting ideas in this game seem significantly closer to fruition.\n\nI recommend watching this title more closely...","September 3, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will enjoy the game when it leaves BETA too. It is a lot like Starbound, but set in a different dimension with slightly differents rules, laws, and phsyics.\nOh, btw, if anything, you can customize your character to be a human, space kitten, cyborg, android, as well as being tenchologically altered, influenced by a slime symbiote, and more, so it all ends up really cool with character customization! Starbound has its races, EdgeOSpace has its many bizarre character feature combinations, inventing your own race and what not is easy (its only aesthetic though)!\nI'll mention new things in my reccomendation as they come up... for now expect the occasional character wipe and the rarer world wipe as they alter and add things to the game.","July 15, 2014","true","30.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game starts you off in the wilderness wearing some basic light armour, a jetpack, and a rifle in-hand.  Using your laser pick you can mine out the natural resources of the world, and using your rifle you can blast the natural fauna of the world.\n\nAt first you only know a handful of recipes, so as you go you will build data disks to unlock more recipes and more data in order to advance even further.  Unlike in say Terraria, you don't know every recipe off the bat, and unlike in say Starbound, you don't have to deconstruct or kill a boss to learn new recipes.\n\nThe game seems simple and easy, until you get hit by a random event, in which case you might end up losing all of your clones in a matter of minutes as an unrelenting anomally continually destroys you as soon as you spawn.  For this reason, it's very much recommended to upgrade your gear as soon as you can.

This game has come a long way from where it once was, and only a few of us can attest to this because we come from an opinion that goes back to early alpha. On here it says I put 13.8 hours into it, but off of steam I had actually put 60+ hours into it. That was all mainly dedicated to testing out the new builds as they were being released and the new systems. This game went from being hard to figure out, to hard as nails, and then an awesome tutorial came through. Guess what, they kept up with the new tutorials making them more stream lined and easier for new players to pick up and play. Mind you, the tutorials at the very beginning were not nooby friendly, but they fixed that, and that was all based on players feedback.\n\nFrom personal experiences, this game is a lot of fun and offers a lot to the player base at an extremely low price. These guys have worked day and night to bring a better experience to the table with each major update coming out with new fixes and added crafting recipes down to materials. More feedback is always a must when it comes to the on going production of a title, especially a creation one. StarBound, Terraria and Edge Of Space offer different experiences all together and yet each one has worked on content for each other to help promote one another. Edge Of Space for me is a gem in itself and it shouldn't be looked over because someone elses troll review.\n\nInstead of trolling why don't you just go and tell the developers what is wrong? Because that would make to much sense I guess, give this game a try, 10. bucks isn't a bad deal and you are getting way more then that back in the content that is currently available.

Controls and seem to handle well and be responsive, the issue is no real way to set up items to hotkeys so have to scroll through a list of items to get to the desired weapon/gadget. I assume this is something that will be taken care of at some point.  Environments looks nice and sharp, music helps sink you into the world,  and you start off with a jetpack.

Terraria and EoS have similarities, and those similarities are:\n\n- 2-D\n- Plot (This more relates to Starbound's plot, but its the basic idea.)\n\nThose are the only similarities I can see right now. They have differences; many, as a matter of fact, and some of those differences are:\n\n- EoS has people with longer legs\n- EoS has no servers as far as I know of\n- EoS involves spaceships\n\nThere is one thing I would like to change, although people may disagree with what I want changed, and that's ok, but you may as well continue looking. That one thing I want them to do is:\n\nReduce complexity; this game is a bit too complex. It has a good plot, and it has a good start, but it's too complex to do.

The UI, windows, and keybar are kind of a pain to deal with, but I'm sure that'll be fixed at some point.\n\nIt's probably the most detailed of these pixel-y, crafty games out there, but I feel like the game should be a bit more "zoomed in" so it's easier to see all of those glorious pixel details, especially of your character.\n\nAll in all, I feel that this could easily be a hit for..

Graphics better but are more like SNES or Sega Genesis, so it still has that retro feel. Currently amazing even though it's in beta as I write this. Probably worth getting it at the "Dirt Cheap" special edition price, for an extra 5-10 dollars or so, but not sure yet. I am indeed enjoying it however. Ranged mining is quite useful too, crafting is simplistic, but it's a good challenge to get the materials. Night has been recently added to the game. The night could use a little work IMO. ( Without light you can see the background, which clearly has some form of light, [e.g. Stars] and your character perfectly fine above ground but when you look at the terrain, it's pitch black.

So if you're familiar with and enjoyed those games, this will be familiar to you but space flavored.\n\nIf you've never played such a game, then let me boil it down for you. EoS is an action oriented exploration game where the world is created procedurally (randomly) and you possess no state goals aside from survival. You'll take your trust space pick and mine out a little bit of safety while hoarding resources to use later. Use on what? To craft bigger and more elaborate spacesuits, jetpacks, weaponry and gadgets.\n\nExcept, it is beta, so how far that road goes is sort of limited. If you're the type who enjoys seeing games get bigger and more fleshed out then take a chance now and support the devs. Otherwise wait for the full buffet to come out later.","June 30, 2013","true","37.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Here...\n\nYour ship has steered off its path and taken you to a planet that appears to be imploding. You have nothing but standard issue gear ( a mining laser, gun, jetpack and useless armour). You have no choice but to work with your environment to make the planet easier to live on. On your way you encounter space dungeons, strange creatures and even a lot of things that come from terraria!\n\nGRAPHICS-\n\nThe graphics of Edge Of Space are sort of simplistic, like those of terraria or minecraft. I normally like simplistic graphics in games but you are forced to look at the same backdrops for AGES which can get annoying. Other than that, I like the graphics.\n\nGAMEPLAY-\n\nSandbox games are always my favourite types of games as they always have infinite possibilities. No storyline in this game means you are free to do what you want! The sandbox elements (building, breaking and crafting) are excellent in this game. Most sandbox games have a crafting sytem where you need a certain type of item to craft. Edge of Space is all about getting larger amounts of, well, anything! The building and breaking elements are the same as most sandboxes really exept for the fact that you get a huge reach for building, and if your laser is good enough, breaking.\n\nPROBLEMS-\n\nSadly, I now have to list the few problems this game has...\nFirst! Music.\nMusic in this game is a small problem. You hear the same backing track over and over again and it gets extremely annoying. It would be better if the backing track for normal days and nights was nice to listen to, like the title screen music, but it's not.\nNext! World Gen.\nWorld generation in this game is basically floating islands with dirt, mud and trees. It is literally impssible to find enough USEFUL stuff quickly, without going too far down into the exposure zones. It would be great if there was a small increase in generation of useful things.\n\nOther than that though...\nI would toatally recommend this game to any terraria or sandbox fan.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nYay. The Music is better now.\n\n\nWhy does no one like this game?","December 6, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The deeper you get the more radiation you will discover so dont forget your protection !\nOf course you can setup your outpost and craft all shiny furniture. You can research different armor sets and weapon types like phase and projectile weapons. It got even nice upgrade mechanics like improved health , deploying mini turrets or even a grappling hook !\n\nNow you say what ? Only 2 biomes and terraforming isnt implemented yet ? With terraform i mean turn the land into a more livable space with less radiation and hostile creatures. Base building you can do from the start!\nDont fool yourself the biomes in EOS work much differently than compared to terraria. Terrarias biomes are rather small and can be traversed quickly. But on the other hand EOS's biomes really feel vast and huge. So those areas really invite you to explore and discover new lifeforms and alien buildings :)\n\nBasically the end end goal upon release is to turn the planet back into a livable space with oxygen etc. But terraforming is a future feature.\n\nI think in the past 2 months this early access title did do huge steps in the right direction. I was just on a server now and got disconnected. So i was confused, but actually they pushed an update right now ! So those devs are really crazy with the updates. For example the christmas update included 2 new dungeons , 1 new boss, 1 special event and several new items to craft.\n\n\nTL;DR\nBasically its a blend of 2d metroidvania and terraria. Ranged combat is a huge deal with many rifles and laser guns. Currently you cant do melee combat, which is intended. Each crafted weapon can get different stats and clip sizes etc.\n\nIt maybe starts slow and you need to get used to the crafting and research mechanics, but im sure after 4-5 hours you feel right at home :)\nBut take notice Win Xp is NOT supported !\nMac and linux arent supported yet, but get a future implementation!\nJust check out the forums to get a better picture whats going on.\nWhen starting the game first time i strongly recommend doing the tutorial first.\n\n\n\nEdit: It got now tons of christmas content. It had so many updates i cant even follow up all ! I think currently it got two different biomes with different flora and fauna and now even a happy new year patch came out!\nSo obviously still recommended and the updates are amazing :)","December 29, 2014","true","195.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The gameplay is a little limited at the moment but it's still early days. The music is absolutely beautiful, I'm so glad I got the Special Edition so I can listen to this whenever.

Play this game, it gives Early Access a good reputation.\n\nEvery single day, this game becomes more and more appealing to play. balancing, additional content,\nThe averaging out of the reviews say the general feeling on this game is mixed, but the top reviews are nearly all absolutely positive,\nWhereas for Starbound, the general feeling is listed as very positive, but the top reviews are nearly all absolutely negative.\nWhy?\nBecause a game that was more polished at release with less attention from the developers (Starbound) is just isn't as good as a less polished game with more developer attention (EoS). This is why Edge of Space is in my favourites and Starbound is not.\nYes, this game DOES need more everything: content, detail, variety, bug fixes, polish, et cetera. But in the same volume, it is RECIEVING what it needs! DEVELOPER ATTENTION!! It warms my heart to see devs responding to reviews and comments and implementing changes based on community feedback~!\n\nThere are, however a few small issues I can think of which would address immediate issues.\n- Some method of pausing the action\n- an option to reverse the scroll for the hotbar\n- Beautiful as the background music is, possibly a touch more variety would be welcome\n- changing the tiles the master cryopod sits on would be fantastic for base decoration.\n\nOn a side note, I purchased the standard version of the game, and then later decided to buy the special edition, but none of the special edition content shows up at all.

It felt amateurish and pointless. The tutorial was vague and taught very little.\n\nThat was at the beginning of the year and I recently reinstalled the game to see what was new and if things have improved. I'd like to talk about these changes after some brief gameplay:\n\nThe first impression that I got was that the tutorial is way better. They aren't always necessary for this kind of game, but before I was baffled on how to build things, now I know. Immediately you are given a gun, fairly weak, but it does the trick, whereas before there seemed no way to kill enemies other than using the mining laser on them or the plasma saw or whatever it was.\n\nSo what do I think now? Alot better, my hat is off to you guys for improving upon a royal mess. Not perfect, but still not released. At this rate of improvement I am confident, however, that things will get ironed out.\n\nSome minor problems:\n\nFor some reason the install for a game of this type and look is enormous. 1.5 gb download and 3gb disc space. Where it all goes, I'm unsure, but as the art seems to be bitmap and bitmap has large file sizes, I'm inclined to think that it is that.\n\nScreen tearing is quite bad.\n\nBloody snails pushing me around. Probably by design but annoying.\n\nThe worlds seem extremely small. Could perhaps do with you being able to go to other planets or at least make the worlds alot bigger.\n\nOverall, my opinion has swayed. I see potential in this game and I am impressed with the improvements. Keep up the good work.","December 18, 2014","true","6.3"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

So if you're familiar with and enjoyed those games, this will be familiar to you but space flavored.\n\nIf you've never played such a game, then let me boil it down for you. EoS is an action oriented exploration game where the world is created procedurally (randomly) and you possess no state goals aside from survival. You'll take your trust space pick and mine out a little bit of safety while hoarding resources to use later. Use on what? To craft bigger and more elaborate spacesuits, jetpacks, weaponry and gadgets.\n\nExcept, it is beta, so how far that road goes is sort of limited. If you're the type who enjoys seeing games get bigger and more fleshed out then take a chance now and support the devs. Otherwise wait for the full buffet to come out later.","June 30, 2013","true","37.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The gameplay is a little limited at the moment but it's still early days. The music is absolutely beautiful, I'm so glad I got the Special Edition so I can listen to this whenever. The number of decorations for your base is incredible, and I really like the art style so you can have a pretty snazzy looking base (unfortunately I'm not very creative so mine isn't).

The deeper you get the more radiation you will discover so dont forget your protection !\nOf course you can setup your outpost and craft all shiny furniture. You can research different armor sets and weapon types like phase and projectile weapons. It got even nice upgrade mechanics like improved health , deploying mini turrets or even a grappling hook !\n\nNow you say what ? Only 2 biomes and terraforming isnt implemented yet ? With terraform i mean turn the land into a more livable space with less radiation and hostile creatures. Base building you can do from the start!\nDont fool yourself the biomes in EOS work much differently than compared to terraria. Terrarias biomes are rather small and can be traversed quickly. But on the other hand EOS's biomes really feel vast and huge. So those areas really invite you to explore and discover new lifeforms and alien buildings :)\n\nBasically the end end goal upon release is to turn the planet back into a livable space with oxygen etc. But terraforming is a future feature.\n\nI think in the past 2 months this early access title did do huge steps in the right direction. I was just on a server now and got disconnected. So i was confused, but actually they pushed an update right now ! So those devs are really crazy with the updates. For example the christmas update included 2 new dungeons , 1 new boss, 1 special event and several new items to craft.\n\n\nTL;DR\nBasically its a blend of 2d metroidvania and terraria. Ranged combat is a huge deal with many rifles and laser guns. Currently you cant do melee combat, which is intended. Each crafted weapon can get different stats and clip sizes etc.\n\nIt maybe starts slow and you need to get used to the crafting and research mechanics, but im sure after 4-5 hours you feel right at home :)\nBut take notice Win Xp is NOT supported !\nMac and linux arent supported yet, but get a future implementation!\nJust check out the forums to get a better picture whats going on.\nWhen starting the game first time i strongly recommend doing the tutorial first.\n\n\n\nEdit: It got now tons of christmas content. It had so many updates i cant even follow up all ! I think currently it got two different biomes with different flora and fauna and now even a happy new year patch came out!\nSo obviously still recommended and the updates are amazing :)","December 29, 2014","true","195.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The tutorial kind of sets you off right till they send you the the alien planet where you need to complete some objectives in order to go to another part of a space station. well, for me it was at night and this games lighting system is the worst part of the game for me. Literally you can't see jack and how the heck are you supposed to find stuff when you cant even see 1 inch past your character. After jumping around looking for stuff, how the heck should you know when your next jump will just rocket you 1000000 feet below to your death? nothing.. literally jumping around then you just die or fall in a 100 foot hole in the ground with a little fox with a horrible light that instead of 1 inch, its now 2 inches from pure darkness. So! right off the bat, I don't like to explore because everytime I leave something kills me or fall to my death and the crafting is kinda clunky. You will be mining a lot and the mining laser takes ages for 1 or 2 squares of dirt..... really....really... boring.

It is repetitive, bland and pointlessly grindy.\n\nThere is no joy of exploration because there is hardly anything to see. 3 Biomes with the same mechanics just reskins and renames of previous resources. And a handful of pre-built dungeons instances that you can travel to, and are awful.\n\nThe combat is terrible, there are only 3 weapons that just get reskinned over and over again. And worse, they are so horribly imbalanced that you use the rifle for 95% of combat, the mortar for cheesey splash-damage-through-walls tactics on the other 5% and the carbine is completely pointless as a crappier version of the rifle.\n\nThe mechanics are clunky. You can't run down sloped tiles and jump, even though the dungeons are designed with downward sloping jumps in them. Hit detection is dodgey, enemies in certain positions can be invulnerable to direct fire because terrain hit boxes seem to register before enemy ones so your shot somehow ends up blocked by the wall behind them.\n\nThe enemies are dull. There's like 16 all told, and half of them are just reskins of the same run-at-player-bump-to-damage design with bigger numbers.\n\nThe design is darn well ♥♥♥ backwards sometimes too, for example:\n\nIn the dungeon where all your digging and wall placement tools are disabled, the enemies ghost through walls. But out in the sandbox where you can cheese the mechanics, enemies are blocked by walls. Why, in the one place where you can be guaranteed the enemy NPCs can't be path blocked would you put in the world's most annoying terrain ignoring floating enemies?\n\nYou have to unlock higher tier crafting by spending experience on generic tech level up consumables and using them, and the amount of unspent experience you can have at any time is capped. So you have to stop every 5 minutes and craft more tech consumables through the laggy crafting menu or start losing out on experience. Why the heck would you try to half-♥♥♥ it through the existing crafting UI rather than give it its own UI to spend experience directly? And even more why the heck would you cap it? Especially cap it so low you have to stop and spend it about 20 times to level up even one tier at later levels.\n\nThe whole game is extrodinarily grindy. Everything of value beyond the starter tiers requires converting hundreds of hundreds of junk tiles into a general purpose crafting material (Carbon fibre and super coolant). When enemy specific drops -are- needed, the same enemies drop like 10 different types of item, of which you only need the 1, so you have to farm enemies for 10x longer before you can craft one of anything. And unlocking new crafting tiers takes waaaay longer than it takes to get bored of the last reskin you unlocked hours ago.\n\nAnd that's why I can't recomend this game even with furter development planned. Hardly any of the updates are exciting or ingenuitive, just more reskins called content. The design choices make no sense. And every system currently in place is poorly implemented. I have not one piece evidence the devs are capable of polish or exciting design in all these gigabytes of early access game.\n\nThey can make lots of hi-res sprites though. So there's that.","January 31, 2015","false","22.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","1"

Even the basics. As you need to grind load of enemies to get 15-25 points in certain research gategories at random in order to advance it further which requires 1000 or more per level and enemies wont drop reserach date always when killed.\n\nCurrently for some reason you cant even build the next weapon in line as its material tables are bugged and it wont allow you to put any of the right materials in to build it.\n\nAlso the current weapon system is kinda sad as you can only upgrade your weapon and not really build more weapons jsut the one you have.\n\nEnemies can spawn anewhere, even inside you and they sure like to spawn inside your base all the time. You need to constantly clear it out.\n\nEnemies also tend to have so much hp that with your 1 dam pea shooter you need about 30 shots to kill one enemy and yo ueven have to reaload it slowly. Thou the weapons are made randomly if you are lucky you might get weapon with 2 dam.\n\nThe lighting day and night system is getting an upgrade soon which is a great thing but at its current state it is horid. Black boxes that dont even fade in but appear instantly when night comes. Luckily this shoul be fixed soon but its been this bad for a long time.\n\nThere are many normal alpha game buggs that dont bother me like animatiosn are the wrong way, characters spazzing out when looking up ( this will be fixed soon too =) ), etc cant craft things, de-sync at servers, etc.\n\nThe developers are very active and have improved this game alot thou sometimes things have gone the other way too but currently I dont recomend this. This will prolly be good at some point but not yet.

If you really enjoy this type of game and/or you play it with friends you are probably going to have a good time.  Still can't completely recommend it but I am more on the fence now rather than a full thumbs down.  Try it on sale if in doubt and you likely won't be too upset if it isn't your cup of tea.\n\nNote: very involved and hard working developers.  I am sure this game will continue to improve as time goes by.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nOK game but quite repetitive, crafting doesn't make too much sense, i.e. use dirt and make armor, crafting button instead of 'craft' label has a 'science' label,... can you say non-intiutive?.  Early access so game not finished, world and characters deleted relatively frequently for updates.  Forced limits of exploration depth based on equipment type, i.e. can't skip equipment and just build higher levels tiers you need to plod through each level of equipment.  Never seen the cool shark and polar bear enemies advertised on the store page, just crabs on speed, flying jellies, cyborg flying brains with beaks, velociraptors, and a few others, some weird ecology going on there.\n\nRecommendation: pick up on sale but don't expect much and/or buy later when it's complete","September 27, 2014","false","37.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","2"

Do not be fooled by the fact that the game has been released almost 2 years ago, nor by the fact that those 2 years were filled with hyperactive developement - it still feels like a proof of concept.\nEvery time I return to it after a long hiatus (caused, usually by frustration at being unable to progress because, to give a few examples, the devs couldn't decide where some resource or other should spawn and deciced not to put it into the game at all, or there is a typo in a crafting recipe) my saves won't work, half the in-game systems have been changed and the others are broken (dev-speak for those is "not balanced yet").\nI want to love this game, I've spent a lot of time playing it, but untill the devs decide what they want to actually do with it it's very hard to recommend.\n\nEDIT: I'd like to clarify, now that my hissy fit is over, that if there ever was a game that shows promise, then EoS is that game. It's just that, well, I want my saved games to work - at least for my character, if not for the world itself.","May 11, 2015","false","139.9"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","10"

It's Terraria or Starbound, but with better graphics.  However, the content of the game, while not terrible, is still lacking a bit, and there's still a lot of work that needs to be done.  The recent 1.0 Release I feel was a bit premature, as they actually removed some content from the game with the intent of it being added-in later (hopefully not as DLC).\n\nI tenatively rate this with a thumbs-up, but I might change this depending on how it progresses.  I've heard some rumors that some of the planned content for the game will instead be released as DLC, but until that's confirmed I won't downvote it, as I have gotten my money's worth out of the game.\n\nThe easy description of this game?

Since you still get xp for mere dirt and can use most basic materials to convert them into a few of advanced components like carbon it never really feels like your "wasting space" by collecting 3 stacks of dirt like in starbound or terraria.

The premise is good and the skill tree is interesting, easy, and fun to make your way through. The game itself is still a bit buggy, with framerate on a singleplayer world as if you were lagging on a multiplayer one. The UI also leaves you wanting something a bit better and easier to use. However, the developers are still putting time into fixing up the game so I am hopeful that issues such as the framerate and UI are addressed. There is also a drastic increase of difficulty as you move deeper into the world, as the enemies become much faster and stronger than you really have any feasible hope to overcome...which means lots and lots of deaths, a minor issue. It just begins to feel grindy and repetitive after the silly penguins and/or bears kill you out of nowhere for the 100th time while you are minding your on business.","December 23, 2015","true","28.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Here...\n\nYour ship has steered off its path and taken you to a planet that appears to be imploding. You have nothing but standard issue gear ( a mining laser, gun, jetpack and useless armour). You have no choice but to work with your environment to make the planet easier to live on. On your way you encounter space dungeons, strange creatures and even a lot of things that come from terraria!\n\nGRAPHICS-\n\nThe graphics of Edge Of Space are sort of simplistic, like those of terraria or minecraft. I normally like simplistic graphics in games but you are forced to look at the same backdrops for AGES which can get annoying. Other than that, I like the graphics.\n\nGAMEPLAY-\n\nSandbox games are always my favourite types of games as they always have infinite possibilities. No storyline in this game means you are free to do what you want! The sandbox elements (building, breaking and crafting) are excellent in this game. Most sandbox games have a crafting sytem where you need a certain type of item to craft. Edge of Space is all about getting larger amounts of, well, anything! The building and breaking elements are the same as most sandboxes really exept for the fact that you get a huge reach for building, and if your laser is good enough, breaking.\n\nPROBLEMS-\n\nSadly, I now have to list the few problems this game has...\nFirst! Music.\nMusic in this game is a small problem. You hear the same backing track over and over again and it gets extremely annoying. It would be better if the backing track for normal days and nights was nice to listen to, like the title screen music, but it's not.\nNext! World Gen.\nWorld generation in this game is basically floating islands with dirt, mud and trees. It is literally impssible to find enough USEFUL stuff quickly, without going too far down into the exposure zones. It would be great if there was a small increase in generation of useful things.\n\nOther than that though...\nI would toatally recommend this game to any terraria or sandbox fan.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nYay. The Music is better now.\n\n\nWhy does no one like this game?","December 6, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a fun game the soundtrack is fairly nice and honestly I was a bit shocked to see people saying its a buggy mess perhaps I played right after major bug fixes were put in because my only problem is random hitching (2-3 second freeze which im guessing is a worldsave or trash collection that isn't optimized due to unity being a bit bad at stock).\n\nThe game has changed a lot since i played it when it first came out, it's a bit more non linear then some games and doesn't seem to have a clearcut path but that isn't a dealbreaker for me.  All in all the enemies are diverse and I've gotten about 10 tiers out of 15 into some of the research in a fairly short stint of time.   I would say it still meets my 1$ per hour level of entertainment quota making this game a suggested game in my opinion.\n\nCan't really come up with a pros/cons list at the time because I feel theres not a ton of super strong points to be made.  I'm a terraria fanatic and also loved starbound but I can't feel the need to compare them aside from saying "I enjoyed this one too".","March 13","true","30.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cynik/recommended/238240/","Cynik","Stud Deluxe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cynik/","215 products in account","Overall:\nI think that in it's current state the game shows a ton of potential and has some very great features. I really like the Terraria/Starbound 2D worldcraft type gameplay and the controls/combat of this particular title does the style justice. If you're a fan of these, this game is a must-play as it is a bit more forgiving than Starbound or Terraria in some ways but also very challenging in it's own right.\n\nPositives:\nThere is a great amount of appealing content in the game so far. The combat is a lot of fun. I like how easy it is to find and upgrade resources as well as unlocking content by simply fighting monsters and mining. Each (fighting/mining) give you exp points equally. There are also mini-dungeons you come across regularly to clear out. These in addition to deployable tower defense and other styles of mini-game dungeons adds a fun spin to the roguelike worldcraft indie style.\n\nNegative:\nThe biggest issues I have with the game are stability issues and bugs. After initially binging on the game for several hours, I lost everything I had built due to a client crash. I still had my character and all the inventory, but the planet/area's safe file was corrupted so I had to start from a fresh new save. This made me lose all my storage and the structures/bases I had built.  Also it seems that about half the time the game has trouble deploying your character as playable into the world. Sometimes the screen is dark and everything responds, but you cannot move or take control of your avatar. It is easily fixed by a restart or two (if it happens sequentially).\n\nNeutral:\nThis game isn't a solid world like in Terraria or Starbound. There are large open spaces inbetween land masses that you must use your jet pack to travel between while heading deeper in the map without taking damage on impact as the gravity is similar to that of earth. This I feel like has both negative and positive effects for creating elevator shafts and fast-travel between different levels. For instance, one thing I liked about terraria was creating an easily navigated mine-shaft to drop very deep very quickly, although in this you can just build a teleporter wherever you want and teleport straight to it. So it really allows you to focus on more combat if you want to.\n\nEnd thoughts. Worth overall.

I DO NOT see why people hate it...This game is great...Better than Terraria? Nope but still better than other side-scrollers and also you cannot compare it to Teraria as they are pratically two different games.\n\nFirst off, you create a charater, mine an awesome-looking female with a mask which screams ♥♥♥♥ off to any crab,jellyfish or any 'badguy' that thinks they can take a piece of me.\n\nThen we have the tutorial. I have read reviews where they say that the tutorial didn't help or it didn't give enough depth...well I'm sorry but you must be playing a different game. The tutorial has a video in the bottom right corner of the screen which demostrates how to do stuff and what you needed to do in order to advance through the tutorial. Yes I admit that at times the video played a bit fast so I couldn't keep up with the voice BUT there was text above the video so I didn't even have to worry about it.\n\nOnce the tutorial finishes you are thrown straight into the world with little knowledge of what to do next. My thoughts were to build a base...Captain Obvious here...Digging is simple, just like other games, and it wasn't long before I had a decent amount of materials in order to make a base. Now I had two options, Build it in the sky surrounded by jellyfish or on the ground overrun with plants and creepy crawleys. My choice...the sky.\n\nNow I'm not going to run it for you...Try the game you will like it.

(imho)\n\n-fresh outta EA, this games has a few little bugs here and there, which is only natural. but there's certainly nothing game breaking.\n\n-unlike other devs, you can be sure that these guys will fix bugs within a reasonable time and answer 99% of your questions in the forum.\n\n-similar to terraria and minecraft, this game won't hold your hand: there are some npcs and a in game guide (codex) that give you some hints, but quite a few things you'll have to figure out by yourself, so at least bring a IQ of 80 with you.\n\n-taking terraria as a reference value, EoS does some things better (again, imho):\n--> better ambiente: mainly due to the excellent in game music, EoS feels beautifully melancholic and mature without being depressing, it makes you thoughtful. coming back to terraria, you'll figure yourself on a happy LSD trip.\n--> better in game music (see above).\n--> placing tiles works smooth and easy from the beginning.\n--> beautiful art style, and it gets even more beautiful the deeper you go, especially the individual zone backgrounds!\n--> devs are 10/10 straight.\n--> progression is more versatile: get exp, spend in many different tech trees, find hidden stat upgrades in the world, random stats and bonuses for weapons.\n--> you can fly from the getgo with a jetpack, yay! (watch your fuel though!)\n\nKeep in mind: Overall, Terraria in it's current state is better, naturally. Terraria started this whole 2d sandbox genre: Due to a astronomically higher budget and a longer development time, you can't really beat it. If you played Terraria ad nauseam though, if you want to play something similar yet in many ways different, get EoS.","September 18, 2015","true","69.6"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","2"

It has been a few months since I last touched it.\n\nGoing into this game, I was launched into the tutorial, and got a far better grasp of the basic mechanics than I did when I first got thrown into Terraria. While both do not require special placement for materials and such, this game gave a different emphasis that yes, even dirt is an important resource.\n\nI think that's what really got me into this game. Every resource you mine actually has a use, and you don't have to dump piles of dirt into a chest so it doesn't clutter your inventory. You actually need dirt now.\n\nAnother thing that gives this game an edge against other games in this genre is the fact that you get decent ranged weapons through the tutorial. Normally you get a junk sword and all ranged weapons run on limited ammunition. Here, there's infinite ammo and it serves you well enough until you can research better schematics later on. I think that's important.\n\nFinally, I just like the overall look. The background, the creatures, and your character all have a pleasing look that also saves resources so it doesn't eat up the GPU. It has an art style that branches off just enough where it doesn't look too foreign, but still has its own identity.\n\nAll in all, good game. If you get it on sale, you got a really good deal.","August 14, 2015","true","1.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

It's fun and different enough from Terraria that it presents some unique value.\n\nThere are a couple cons: balancing and game progression.  You get relatively little guidance in the overall 'purpose' of the game - what you're trying to accomplish, all the features, crafting progression, etc.  This can be annoying, especially absent a robust wiki which Terraria possesses.  Moreover, the damage done by enemies is all over the scale, and it's hard to predict how a particular tier of armor will prepare you for the next group of baddies.  Right now it feels like enemies can swarm very quickly and do crazy amounts of damage quickly.","February 2, 2015","true","59.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The game gets regular updates and the devs are very involved with the community here on Steam.  One thing I really enjoy about EOS is the multi-leveled crafting.  Each resource is needed from the start to the end, so I don't feel as though I'm waisting my time gathering dirt, mud and rock on the way to the more valuable resourses.  You unlock new crafting opportunities by earning XP.  With this XP  you can "buy" data.  The data (once you get enough) gives access to better equipment.  I really like this system, I'm hoping that this is the one the devs settle on.\nThere are a few frustrating things about the game, such as the amount of time required to gather resourses for the equipment you need to progress.  Also, much like Terraria, the player is super vulnerable at the start of the game (this can lead to much frustration for players not accustomed to this type of game). The issue I struggle with the most is the lack of direction in the game.  The crafting is so much fun, but I have no idea what certain resourses are for or how some of the better equipment is crafted.  If you get too lopsided with buying data from one or two catergories you will be totally lost.  Make sure you unlock the data evenly to avoid any problems.\nIn conclusion, I totally recomend EOS.  I remember being frustrated as hell when playing Terraria after it first came out, but as time went along and I slowly learned new things the game became really fun.  I am 100% convinced that EOS is offering the same type of experience, who knows, maybee it will be even better than Terraria when all is said and done.","December 23, 2014","true","246.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

As it currently stands, it holds alot of promise, but suffers from usability problems.  For example. there is nothing you can do with your old gear - when you make new equipment, you can't salvage or sell your old items that are no longer useful, you have to delete them (or store them if you're a pack rat).  Also, the UI is still pretty rough - some recipe names don't match up to what they create.  This is a problem when you are trying to figure out where the 'crafting bench 1' recipe is, because its actually the 'computerized work bench' recipe.\n\nOverall its decently fun, but the clunkiness of the UI drove me to give up on figuring out what I needed to do next.","December 17, 2014","true","4.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I guess I knew it was early access but... at that point it was REALLY early access. It was the skeletal framework of the game and nothing else.\n\nFast forward to my picking it up on steam, and the game is completely different, more fleshed out and with its own unique personality. It's still very clearly not done yet. But the parts of this genre that make it fun to play, mining, gear and stat upgrading, and base building, are functional and enjoyable. It sounds like the developers have a clear vision in mind for what the game will be, and as it progresses in development that vision becomes more and more clear each patch both in the game's functionality and tone.\n\nTL;DR - It's early access done right. Game has regular updates and gets fleshed out more and more with each one. It's also fun to play in its current state of development.","June 13, 2015","true","15.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The crafting system alows you to craft an item without having the exact resource, for example.  instead of neading sand it might say Raw/mineral  which means you can use any dirt/metal/ or stone for this part of the recipe.\n\nThe vertical map design makes the gameplay more interesting as well.

I hardly ever write a review but I felt this game is worth my time reviewing. With all the new updates, I am actually going to set out some free time to play it again. In fact, I enjoyed this game even before all the big updates and patches were made (wipes included).\n\n\nIt is similar to Terraria in the aspect of genre but uniquely different in terms of content.\n\nEdge of Space speaks for itself what it's about (almost). You are an alien thrown into an unknown "world". Whether it was a planet or on an asteroid, even I'm not quite sure. Everyone complains it's hard to grasp but there is a tutorial at the beginning which I happened to accidentally skipped. Even so, I didn't find the game entirely hard to follow if you know the basics: collect materials, build a house/base, kill monsters, etc. Not to mention all the cool pets and mounts you can create. Come on...a laser to collect materials and space guns?! Jet packs to fly! It really sticks to the sci-fi feel. Oh, I would also like to add I love how smooth the movements are in this game.\n\nThe challenge is in figuring how everything works and the satisfaction when you do.\n\nSince last time that I played, the only thing I really would complain about is how each character was bounded to certain worlds if they were made in multiplayer/single player. You can't select any character to load into a world if that character wasn't made in that particular world. Some materials that can be collected in single player were unable to be gathered in multiplayer (but before I stopped playing this issue was already fixed). There weren't as many boss fights as I would like and their drops weren't always anything special. Overall, when I stopped playing I was merely waiting for more content to be released.\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews comparing this to Terraria and Starbound. If you like those games more then play those games instead of comparing it to this one. Why? Because if this game was exactly like Terraria then...that defeats the purpose of making a uniquely different 2D Sandbox game. Also, if you hop into the game for less than an hour and deem that it's awful then you're not even giving the game a chance.\n\nI would also like to repeat that this game is in EARLY ACCESS. There will be bugs and the sort so if you don't want a game that's in DEVELOPMENT, I would advise you to wait if you have no patience for an unfinished game rather than buy it and give it a bad review because it has a lot of potential.","July 7, 2015","true","63.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

It may or may not make it to the finish line, but from what I've experienced over a few years development cycle with this game, it's team is nothing if not dedicated and focused on the goal of pushing this game to release, so I'm fairly confident it will be released, just not as hastily as other titles.\n\nThe question to be answered, is whether or not this game is worth buying right now.  While it's in the same sandbox genre as popular (and depending on who you ask, infamous) titles such as terraria, minecraft, and starbound, the graphical style sets it apart fairly decisively.  It's not super high-res, but the cartoonish yet realistically proportioned characters are a nice change from the pixelized Devs-Don't-Give-A-Damn you sometimes see.  What can I say, some people like pixels, others don't.  For my part, I do like pixels.  Anyway, see the screenshots for a good idea of the art style.  At the very least, the art style is consistent throughout the game as far as I've seen.\n\nThe devs have taken an interesting direction in the way of progression, in that every action you take, whether it be killing monsters, felling alien vegetation, or just digging up some mud, nets you experience that can be spent toward research in the area of your interest.  It's an interesting component that I suppose promotes cooperation and teaming up with other players who can fill the gaps in your research to help fully kit out your base.  Materials aren't enough to build all that you need, you actually need the experience and research level to create equipment and objects, unlike terraria and starbound where you only need touch a component to know how to put it together.\n\nThe alien environments don't take the typical planetoidal approach to world generation, and instead you find your avatar cast adrift on a sea of floating islands, which you can hop from one to the next with a handy jetpack, which you get from playing through the tutorial at the very beginning of the game.  It's necessary to build a suit of armor with exposure protection in order to delve deeper into the world's depths, so progression is a multi-pronged challenge as you have to gather experience and then spend it correctly in order to build a base and equip yourself for the dangers you'll find in the lower levels of the planet.\n\nThere's not much else for me to say about this title, but if you're still on the fence after hearing all of this, know that the game is still in development, and in order to expedite the process your characters and worlds may be wiped.  So bear that in mind if it's a factor in your decision.\n\nFor my part, I bought it at 20 dollars a while back, and like where the game is going.  I trust this dev team enough to get the job done eventually, and really look forward to when it's finished.  If you have the money to spare and want to put it to a project, and this one sounds good based on all you've heard, great.  Honestly, this either is your cup of tea or isn't, and that's okay.  I will say that it's my cup of tea, and an interesting and very different entrant to the 2d sandbox genre.  I don't regret buying the game.","January 22, 2015","true","66.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Although all the buildings I have discovered have been empty, I remind myself its EA and the content will come.\nThe game so far has many features I love, that other sandbox games I have played are lacking; I love the crafting and research, the points system to unlock new tech, I love the companions and the mounts. Edge Of Space has dragged me away from the other sandbox games I am playing, and I can't wait for it to be finished so that all the content is in place. Do yourself a favour, if you buy one sandbox game this week, but Edge Of Space.\n\nThe one area however, where this game stands out against all others, is the extraordinarily first class interactions from the devs; I have never come across devs who are so quick to answer questions from the community, actively seek feedback and entrench themselves amongst the fans, and keep them informed constantly and consistently. This alone would make for a first class title, but factoring in all the other features, many of which. I haven't even mentioned, should,  I hope, make EoS a cult classic.","August 2, 2015","true","77.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The art style for the characters is a nice touch, but the textures for the more common things like dirt and mud are ugly at best. The music needs work and there are some game-ending glitches.\n\nWait to purchase this one until it has some polish. I wish I could say "more polish" but it feels like they haven't even started yet.

Was wrong. I think the epic music from the trailers sucked me it is the only real highlight. This seems a bit of a mess of a game with terrible controls, painful graphics, vague storyline and unintuitive gameplay. You spend an hour in horrible menus just trying to configure the thing to run properly. Then you get these tutorial videos in tiny windows that won't even fullscreen that still don't seem to make much sense. On at least two of my machines all I got it music because the game got stuck in the loading screen forever ... please spare yourself the pain.","January 7","false","2.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In all honesty, I felt that Terraria handled the ammo situation for projectile weapons very well, where you could have as much as you wanted as long as you had inventory space. Reloading of course is something they didn't incorporate but the upper limit on ammo makes projectile weapons nearly obsolete. Haven't tried energy weapons yet, hope they are better, otherwise its sticking to phase weapons forever just because of ammo constraints.\nMining can be tedious, as i have not found any new ores or reasons to mine besides the fact i need resources to farm xp from the enemies flying around, and your upgraded picks dont seem to be digging that much faster.\nDungeons on here are very exciting to explore, i was amazed when i first discovered the headhunters dungeon, and again when i found maps to other dungeons as you went lower.\nTransportation mounts, like the raptors, can't teleport with you to different command nodes, which i found to make them  not very useful since you get to them so much later in the game and need to move around between your main base and hub bases quickly.\nrandom events that happen are interesting, they are usually pretty tough, although the rewards are severly lacking. Kill x/x monsters and you get a couple blocks of some ore thats not very rare? not worth it.\nalso can we get a map early on? exploring's a ♥♥♥♥♥ without one, even if we have to make it but make it available from a fairly early point please.\nI am very excited to see this game get completed, hope that this review persuades others to invest in this game and help support the developers.","January 16, 2015","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Look at Steam Community score : only 57% approved this game, that mean +3% during last year. All score <75% always mean problems with devs or game is simply bad.\n\n- Don't waste time & money with pure rip off from original without bringing anything fun : Starbound & Terraria are both better experience.\n\n- devs don't solve players problems and ignore them. After many monthes i reported problems they ignored me greatly because they said on forum : "we are small team we need time to investigate all problems". There is difference between "needing time" and never answer. They wasted time to offer Santa event outside beta and not to fix all problems on basic beta build. They call that "beta". One worst support team ever on Steam. I don't believe they act like autistics person. They banned me to forum to be sure i'll never ask more about my crashes problem.\n\n- full censorship on forum : you write they don't solve your problem, you aren't agree with devs, you said to them truth, they simply call admin to get your permanently ban. Its 1st time on Steam i got banned. They closed my mouth like that and continue to lie to sell more copies !!!\n\n- gameplay : Edge of Space is bad gameplay. When you rip-off game, you have all time to improve  features from original. EoS gameplay is worst than Starbound or Terraria. This game require more tools bar, full control mouse UI. I don't know who designed UI but iam sure its not gamer, its simply someone who don't understand how computer UI should be. They lack of experience lead to boring UI which result in waste of time selecting and ordering what you want & need\n\n- lacks of good balanced weapons ruin game : all i know is i won't made war with Handyman Studios. They understand nothing about war. They are so unexperienced you'll get death in-game. When you see all weapons which exist in real life, and play Edge of Space (game in future), you'll be convinced by this voluntary act of ruining game to create fake difficulty.\n\n- annoying crafting system : you need to allocate all materials each time (should be auto select by default with lowest materials matching). Tons of time wasted to craft something you need fast. Why to inflict that pain to players ?\n\n- multiplayer : you join server writing direct IP. Never use your real IP because it's never safe & some hackers will be happy to use exploit from beta to hack your computer. I got lot of problems during beta multi. You'll play at your own risks. Because they banned me to not solve my crashes problem, i can't say its because i was hacked during play or its only because beta.\n\n- Handyman Studios is small team : even if game is in beta, you won't get any answer from support if you are alone/few to experience it because "small team" mean not enough time to solve it. In real, they are able to get your money but not to correct all problems. They are able to build exotic patch like Santa but not to help each players to fix problems. They do exactly what they want. For me its last time i gave money for early access game.\n\n- changing screen settings need to restart game\n\n- tutorial : incomplete & bugged tutorial\n\n\n\n- - - To end - - -\n\nSave your money & time buying Starbound or Terraria instead of Edge of Space.\nDon't feed Trolls\n- who try to seduce you with new games based on stupid ripp-off without bringing something better\n- who lie everyday on forum practicing censorship & permanently ban\n- who offer 0 support about crashes.\n\nIt's last time i give my money to indies during early access. Handyman Studios are blacklisted forever, anywhere on the web.\n\nIts time to start my Edge of Boycott : YOU SHALL NOT PASS !!!\n\nThx to read my evaluation.","June 30, 2013","false","114.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

It feels just like a flash game. Seriously. In the trailer you see smooth NPC's/Players, but when I bought the game and started it, it wasn't that at all. I bought the game to quick. I'm a really big fan of Terarria and when I saw this, I was completely sold. But I felt betrayed when I played the tutorial. Yes, it is an Early Access Game. But do not buy this because you thought the trailer looked ''cool'' or whatever . (Me) But I do see alot of potential in this game and I hope that the developers make a great game of it.

Firstly, it's a sandbox crafting game, with zero RPG elements. Sorry, but being in control of an avatar does not constitute, otherwise EVERY game would be an RPG. And just because you can augment items does NOT mean it's an RPG, nor is that even an element. That being said, NOT AN RPG, and it's certainly not the best, and I'm sure there were dozens at PAXE2014 lol.

I wouldn't recommend to friends.\nThe release version of the game feels more like a version that should be releasing on to Steam Early Access for the first time, to go through those last few months of finishing, polishing and feedback before actual release. It still feels in a rather "beta" state, which is disappointing for a game that's already been in Early Access for two years.\n\nFor instance rockets are represented in the player's inventory UI as an ammo type, but there is actually no weapon that requires it, nor any recipe to make it. An unfinished stub of a feature like this shouldn't be left in the release version, it's misleading and cringingly "beta".\n\nI wanted to like it, I like the genre and loved Terraria. I wouldn't have stuck with playing this for so long if I didn't, and I like some of what it does differently. I could list other problems I perceive with it, but instead I'll just say that overall It's a disappointment, and probably needs another year in the oven.","November 2, 2015","false","75.5"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","1"

There will, of course, still be bugs and pending/missing features. However, at this stage, it is still a pretty fun game to play. I'm still relatively early in the game, but I still got plenty of stuff to do and to look forward too.\n\nHowever, and I will say it again, IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.\nAt this stage, not many people may like it as it is. The developers are still working on getting a lot of things in the game. They have lots of features planned to be implemented which are currently not present at the moment. The game is not done and there is still a lot to add.\n\nAnother thing: Stop comparing it to Starbound. Just because it's a randomly generated, 2D scrolling, sci-fi themed, mining, crafting, and building based game; it doesn't mean it's a clone of that game. It has many different mechanics and the devs took a different approach to the genre. Don't compare the two.\n\nMy final note is this: If you want a fun terraria-like space game, you can go with either Starbound, Signs of life, or this game, Edge of space. Whichever you choose, don't compare it with/to the others two. I've only played Edge of Space, and I've loved it.\nHowever, if you don't like to playing unfinished games, I recommend you not to buy it; or at least not right now.

It is also one of the most tedious and uninteresting games I've ever played. The basic gameplay loops are completely uninspired and dull. Terraria has wonderfully satisfying Metroidvania progression that makes slowly mining the world in order to acquire better gear and be able to defeat more difficult enemies an absolute joy to play. In the strictest sense, it's a very repetitive game, but it all feels so good that it's wonderfully engrossing. Edge of Space achieves none of that. It's a grind that just feels like a grind, and even in 1.0 is still a bit toward the wonky side, particularly the jumping mechanics.\n\nI have issues with Starbound and it also misses some of what made Terraria work, but it at least feels like there's potential there, and even still in beta it is a lot more fun than this. Edge of Space needs fundamental design overhaul and the 1.0 release really is just polishing a game that never actually worked on the most basic level. One thing I can say for it is that I don't think the graphics are as bad as some other people are making them out to be.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/recommended/238240/","epeternally","Princess","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epeternally/","2703 products in account","Edge of Space is a Terraria but sci-fi effort in the same vein as the more popular Starbound, even going as far as to include Terraria crossover content, which was one of the selling points of the game for me. It is also one of the most tedious and uninteresting games I've ever played. The basic gameplay loops are completely uninspired and dull. Terraria has wonderfully satisfying Metroidvania progression that makes slowly mining the world in order to acquire better gear and be able to defeat more difficult enemies an absolute joy to play. In the strictest sense, it's a very repetitive game, but it all feels so good that it's wonderfully engrossing. Edge of Space achieves none of that. It's a grind that just feels like a grind, and even in 1.0 is still a bit toward the wonky side, particularly the jumping mechanics.\n\nI have issues with Starbound and it also misses some of what made Terraria work, but it at least feels like there's potential there, and even still in beta it is a lot more fun than this. Edge of Space needs fundamental design overhaul and the 1.0 release really is just polishing a game that never actually worked on the most basic level. One thing I can say for it is that I don't think the graphics are as bad as some other people are making them out to be. Don't get me wrong, they're certainly not great, but I don't think they're intolerable. In a very fun game, they'd probably be fine. Unfortunately this is not a game that plays well.","September 17, 2015","false","4.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

And just their face.\n\nJust get starbound. This game is fugly and the enemies are nearly impossible to fight due to them being tiny and do half of your health bar's worth of damage on a hit, and utter lack of melee weapons.\n\nNow for me, the aesthetic is garbage except for maybe the backgrounds and sky of the game.

Back when it was in open beta if I remember right.\n\nThe game, now that I've bothered to redownload it, still feels like it's in an open beta, which is disheartening. There's a lot of stuff that the game doesn't tell you easily, like about upgrades, progression, zones, etc. Granted this also happens with other similar games (including Terraria), but they don't feel like you're being thrown to the wolves. It took me most of one play session to figure out how to pick up items after you put them down, because the game doesn't explain it well and most online sources don't explain it well either.

Unfortunately, it did not deliver.\n\nFirstly, there are several menus. too many menus, assigned to keys that you could possibly change, but why? why are there so many?\nNavigating story text is also a pain, and the tutorial is horrible. it conveys the controls, but the way it does it is more of a chore it has to do, ticking off parts of the game on a checklist. You don't feel like you've learned anything.\n\nThen there is death. this is perhaps my biggest axe to grind. it turns death into some complex process involving crafting a chamber, and using rods, and I just give up at that point.\nI spawned in, tried to slowly edge down from the top of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ asteroid field it dump-ed me into really? couldn't have started with rolling hills? something normal??) and died. I had no idea what to do or how to do it.\n\n\nEdge of Space is a game full of potential. however, it is far, far too complicated. it has a LOT of work to do to get the gameplay user-friendly, and the death mechanic needs some serious reworking.\n\nIt feels like this game is trying to be terraria 2.0, while also trying to be starbound, but not grasping what makes starbound fun. It takes the sci-fi all right, but it takes the grungy abandoned-spaceship theme.

There's just the prospect to mine blocks, or grind creatures for XP, to "unlock" things that I can then build.\n\nI think that the UI is terrible, it's visually not appealing, it gives next to no feedback, and it's unresponsive. But I think I already read that 2 years ago. Once you mass up (unlock) items to build it gets rather hard to use. The components required to build things are questionable at best. Dirt, mud, clay, rock, to build a large variety of items, huh.\n\nThere are billboard missions you can take to get more rare stuff (is it the only way?) like aluminium or uranium, they are simple and seem buggy. For example, having two missions to collect 50 dirt immediately completes both if you have 49+ dirt in your inventory, and collect just one more piece of dirt.\n\nWhen you play the tutorials where you need to shoot humanoid training dummies, it becomes immediately apparent that the hit boxes are... let's just say, you have to hit them in a certain spot, their legs for example are completely off the hit box boundary.\n\nIf you have neither played Terraria, or the Terraria 1.3 update, I'd recommend that instead, or keeping an eye on Starbound. I've put over 100 hours into Starbound around December 2013, when they first made a public Alpha release, which really puts a unique spin on the whole Terraria feel and it has an absolutely amazing soundtrack.","August 13, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

The tutorial alone is worth playing the 13$ for, a lot of fun to be had. And it explains everything so well, with ZERO bugs.\n\nOh also, the combat? It is simply spectacular, tremendous, this game makes GTA 5, Mad Max, Metal Gear Solid all look like pieces of junk (compared to this game), hell any does not stand to the greatness that is Edge of Space.

Unlimited.....simply unlimited.\n\nTerraria / Starbound can simply NOT compare to a masterpiece that is this game.\n\nThis game makes Terraria look like an early access piece of junk. Same with Starbound.\n\nThe tutorial explains everything so well, definitely the best tutorial I've ever seen in a video game before. The tutorial alone is worth playing the 13$ for, a lot of fun to be had. And it explains everything so well, with ZERO bugs.\n\nOh also, the combat? It is simply spectacular, tremendous, this game makes GTA 5, Mad Max, Metal Gear Solid all look like pieces of junk (compared to this game), hell any does not stand to the greatness that is Edge of Space.

This is what would happen if I successfully did that after playing Terraria and Starbound.\n\nThe reason I can't recommend this is that I can't recommend Starbound either, - and Starbound even adhered to certain game design principles Edge of Space does not. For example, DLC or content purchases - and I can't help but feel like it's Starbound remade.\n\n/impressions\n\nSince reviews aren't just opinion meters and-\nOh, they are.\nWell here's a breakdown anyway:\n\nArtThe art is quite good, but I can't look past the animations, which I personally don't much like. They seem slightly unnatural somehow, as if forced or overacted.\n\nThe music is okay, and at times reminds of a certain game that parallels EoS a lot.\nThen again, there isn't a whole lot of it yet, so I can't be sure.\n\nUsabilityOne thing I quite like is how the game is actually somewhat intuitive. I mean it has all that arbitrary stuff where you go through the tiers of equipment and unlock things that you would realistically have beforehand, but I can overlook that since it's an industry standard, no matter how dumb it is.\nThe tutorial goes through the mechanics and controls at lightspeed. Something that's great for someone like I, who plays games like Xonotic, but would be really damn hard for anyone who isn't used to learning new controls extremely quickly. The rest of the game seems to just leave you to do what you want after the tutorial, which is good and bad, depending on how you look at it.\n\nGameplayAs usual, sandbox style progression using "tech", and unlocks of new gear.\nThere isn't much emphasis on building, possibly because there's not really much need, and possibly because the small hotbar and needing to manually stock it with stuff all the time is a nightmare, at least coming from games like Starbound which allowed you to place things by picking them up in the inventory. A small issue I have with it, but I'm sure many people would feel the same.\n\nSystems, bugs, exploits, map generation, etc.The map is automatically smoothed by making every top corner (tiles y-1 and x±1 are air) 45°. Not a great feature, since building with this in mind can be very annoying.\n\nThere are too many bugs to go into. I'm hoping this is because it's still in EA.\n\nThe map generation algorithm is pretty basic. Very similar to Starbound, but less to explore for lack of content so far. out of the few worlds I've looked at, all are the same flattish top island with other small islands above and below. It's a little like an extremely dense asteroid belt. It's not incredible.\n\n\nOverall, this seems kind of interesting, but not so much so that a person who just bought the Weekly Bundle would give it a good review.\nI don't recommend the game, but I don't recommend not playing it either. It's one of those things where you just don't quite know how it'll turn out.","August 22, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In other words, not just one, but TWO methods of forcing you to work your butt off to get a incredible reward!..... Just kidding, you 'll also get stuck behind so many progression walls there are enough for several mazes of utter misery with the slow mining and finding out SURPRISE!\nyou now need a new workstation. Alright, i'll go dig out ANOTHER massive crater to get some XP so I can research that. (An hour later) Alright let's see what I need for this thing. Looks like some uranium and a ton of aluminum (That's not actually a recipe but an example of the sorts of recipes there are) Time to go get some aluminum!.... Got that, what about uranium? Oh... I can't mine it. So what do I need to make a laser to (hopefully) mine it? Looks like more giant crater making for me. Hooray. Three cheers for whoever decided holding down on your mouse and moving it for hours was a neccecary game mechanic.\nWhat killed the game: There's no satisfaction to ANYTHING. Completing quests? Grindy and unrewarding. Exploring? Fun until you realize all the terrain is the same. Progression? There's progression? Where? Where'd you find precious progression? WHERE?!?! Combat? Yes there is! It's combatting the woefully weak jellyfish who die after about 20 seconds of holding the mouse button down! There isn't even different fighting styles. Sure you can pick between "pew pew" guns, "pew... BOOM" guns or "PEW............... PEW" guns but compare that to terraria where you can get a massive variety of weapons, from classic swords to lances to boomerangs to flails to variants that deal more damage, look cool, fire off an array of projectiles from various actions (hitting enemies, when swinging, whenever there's an active hitbox...) or inflicting debuffs. And that's just THE MOST BORING CATEGORY. Not to say they aren't cool, it's just they're the trump 6 out of sixes and tens. There's also guns, bows, bow/gun hybrids, spellbooks wands+rods and staffs, throwing lances, throwing knives, shuriken, yo-yos,  a portal gun, a voodoo doll, and that's just the stuff I thought of in a few minutes. Sorry about the massive rant. Overall, it's a 2.5/10 on the scale of games that aren't stupendous but aren't one of "those" games. You know them. Zelda CGI, Flight Control, Slaughtering Grounds. The type that get videos dedicated to laughing at the sheer amount of crap that they are. Anyway, hopefully this helped the devs and the people who are thinking about buying it. Here's some games that hold up to the 1$ per hour of fun rule. Terraria: a 157 hour epic, and i've only gotten to late prehardmode and skill is the limiting factor in that. Cave Story+: The original indie game with new graphics and a handful of extra content including difficulty settings, new characters and a new level cut from the original game because it was apparently too dark (clones of a friendly character who attack you) which makes no sense considering it involves drowning as well as being forced to kill a character who was fed the red flowers (you'll understand if you play it) along with a character who tried to protect his friends and killed them accidentally. Seriously. It also has multiple endings. Undertale: AWESOME game involving SPOILER SPOILER who SPOILERs SPOILER. It's kinda loses half its appeal if you already know the story. Not to say the story is great and the gameplay is bad; all of undertale is fantastic. It's just that the story and gameplay are SO interconnected that spoiling one makes the other not quite have the impact it's supposed to. Also, bring a friend and a tissue or two. Seriously. Undertale is the only game ever to make me laugh so hard or cry anything exept tears of frustration.","December 20, 2015","false","7.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Reinstallation of drivers and the game itself has produced no fix. Fabulous.\n\nSecond issue, which I should say was already mentioned by someone else in the reviews on this item...sluggish gameplay. It feels like you're trying to swim through molasses. I was trying to gun down uh, floating jellyfish and other unpleasant critters and it felt like I was in a slow-motion Matrix scene (minus the badassery by a long shot, that is).\n\nThird issue. There were no prominent enough sound effects for mining or busting something's skull in. I expected some splattering or crumbling or something. What I got was a ♥♥♥♥-poor puff noise for most of it. Seriously? What kind of horse crap is this?\n\nFourth issue. I'm very happy I was able to adapt to the game itself as quickly as I did, because the game not pausing with the tutorial UI up in my face was extremely unsettling and left me open to get owned by the nearest hungry maw. Someone with very little experience with games like this will not be so fortunate in the future.\n\nFifth issue. This game  has some sloppy sprite work on the player avatars. Normally I would let this slide, but I know this game has been worked on for quite some time, so no, I am not going to let it go. Hell no. You can definitely tell a lot of the features you're able to add onto the avatar in creation were lazily pasted on. Thankfully, the fitting futuristic artwork helped balance it out.\n\nSixth issue. OH HOW CUTE THE GAME ONLY HAS A RESOLUTION CHANGE OPTION AND V-SYNC FOR GRAPHIC SELECTIONS. LOL WTF IS THIS, 2004?!\n\nEdge of Space was supposed to be the answer to the demand of an outer space sandbox game like Terraria. In fact, when it was advertised, it was proclaiming to be better and a bit of a sequel to the installment. What a waste of cyberspace and time! Terraria is everything this game wanted to try to be. You know, functional and good?\n\nIn fact, if you want a good sandbox game similar to Terraria that occurs in space, either sit down with Minecraft and some mods, or get a game that actually does this ♥♥♥♥ right; STARBOUND.\n\nSave your money, ladies and gents. This title belongs in the dev studio for quite a few years more before it should touch the stores.\n\nI can't believe my friend wasted his money to get this for me. I want to actually pay him twice the amount of what he spent on this game just to compensate for the disgrace I went through in giving this a chance.","December 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/er_red/recommended/238240/","er_red","ZaZu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/er_red/","239 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI tried, i really tried to like this game. To win the battle against the horrible UI, annoying crafting system, constant dying, dull surroundings, dull music, dull combat, dull mining, dull building, dull everything. And to find the "potential" that people seem to be talking about. But it was a failure.\n\nI mean, what were the devs thinking? You know, "BETA" stage of development starts when you have an almost ready-to-go product, so you just need to eliminate bugs and test some features. Not when you have a game that's almost unplayable, AS WELL as buggy and unstable.\n\nWhere do i start? The world is pretty tight, so you can only explore downwards, but since you have no way to tell what's below you, 90% of the time you'll end up falling from great height, crashing and dying on impact. Not to mention that you can't go too deep since the exposure and/or mobs will kill you there. In my book that's not "exploring", just pointless trial and error.\n\nYou can build a base, but what's the point if you can't even respawn there? And it's not like in Terraria, where you always build a base near the surface - here you won't be able to get back up there unless you die again. And if you build it deeper, then every time you die, you'll have to go and find it again in the midst of a thousand identical floating islands. Oh yeah, and who would've guessed that these super-advanced spacefaring guys won't have a device to make a MAP of the area.\n\nSo here's how your first couple of hours in EoS will look like: you'll be jumping around, searching for at least something different from the dirt\mud\clay surrounding you, trying to get deeper, but mostly falling and dying constantly. Even if you succeed, you'll see that nothing really changes down there, except for tougher and more aggressive mobs, and the exposure timer won't let you go deeper until you get better equipment. And unless you think that painfully slow mining and crafting some aluminium pants or whatever is fun, then that's it, that's your only option here - you won't have anything else to do.\n\nTo make things worse the game gives you no clue on how things work and why would you need them. So i can build a GENERATOR and a COMMAND CENTER, cowabunga, now what? It won't even explain the basics. Like if you played Terraria, you know there's a difference between a block and a wall. But here, there are only "walls", by default functioning as blocks. You actually need to hit "TAB" button to be able to place your "wall" in the background where it belongs. Only you'll never guess it unless you stumble on it in some random guide, like i did.\n\nYeah, whoever in the devs team is responsible for the UI deserves a bullet to the face. Why can't i place items just by dragging them from my inventory? Why do i always need to bind a hotkey to do this basic thing? Why the crafting window is so bizarre and complex? Did you see how crafting looks in Terraria? Well, look again.\n\nProbably there is some difference in the later stages of the game, but i gave up here. It's not like "playing a game" to me, more like trying to fix a car without any idea of what you're supposed to do. And with the wrench constantly slipping out of your hands and falling so you need to go pick it up again and again.\nOverall, this is my most frustrating early access experience since Project Zomboid, but at least i didn't spend my money there.","April 13, 2014","false","2.7"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","0"

It feels very much unfinished, and there is no real goal to the game.  Progress feels very slow and grindy\n(e.g. an upgraded version of something takes lots of resources, but then is not noticably better)\n\nGraphics 3/10\nGameplay 3/10\n\nI think many aspects of this game may have seemed like a good idea in isolation, but unfortunatly it just hasnt come together well.  I dont think this game can be improved much though, because many of the problems are fundamental game-design issues.\n\nI imagine people who would like this game would also like Starbound.  Anyone who has played Starbound will see how heavily EOS has borrowed from it.  I have problems with starbound too (slow development, bad community management, broken promises). That said Starbound is a much more polished game than EOS, and has much more game play (from what I have seen so far).\neven its its slow, poor development never reaching the and of beta state.\n\nI really wanted to like this game... but I just can't do it, after 2.6 hours of REALLY trying to.  The game play is responsive enough, and I have found only a few bugs.  I would suggest watching a gameplay video before buying though.","September 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nanostrike/recommended/238240/","Nanostrike","Nanostrike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nanostrike/","327 products in account","I hate to say it, but this game is currently pretty bad.  Even in it's "Release" state, it has a lot of issues, including:\n\n-Extremely clunky UI, Crafting System, and Base Building.  It's an absolute chore to do almost anything involving inventory or crafting.  Few, if any, keyboard shortcuts to things, no "Deposit All/Quickstack" system like Terraria/Starbound, and very cumbersome stack-splitting is required for a lot of refining.  Myself and several other users actually have slowdown in the inventory/crafting menus as well.  I can overlook a lot of other things in the game, but in a game centered around gathering and crafting, having such an awful inventory system is pretty inexcusable.\n\n-Lots of grinding with fairly slow tools, especially early-on.  You'll find yourself spending several minutes trying to mine any Metal deposits early on and it takes a LONG time to craft some better tools and reduce this time.  You also have to grind plant parts, also with a slow-harvesting tool.\n\n-Controlling your character feels off.  You pick up falling momentum very fast, your character holds his weapon/tool awkwardly (Making it hard to mine/fight in enclosed spaces, which the game is full of), and your character generally gets knocked around constantly.\n\n-Lots of filler.  Tons of obnoxious passive creatures (Snails and Frogs) that spawn in droves and push you around.  Randomly placed monster "Nests" that you end up just blowing up for no real reason, and NPCs that send you on constant fetch-quests that never really seem to pay off.\n\n\n\nOverall, it's not terrible, but the game needs a LOT more polish.  This what I'd expect from a "Release" version of the game, especially with so long in early access.","September 18, 2015","false","94.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

I would love to see this used a good bit in later builds of the game. Random quests/tasks/challenges while exploring the world would add a good bit of excitement for me.\n\n\nCons + personal opinions/feedback:\n\n- The UI. Oh man the UI. This is the one thing that, if not updated significantly, will stop me from playing this game again. Every time I'd look for something I felt myself straining my eyes trying to discern exactly what I was looking at. Similar looking icons in inventory, small text in several places, and a very clunky and unrefined crafting menu (in a crafting game) made it so that every time I'd stop blasting things with my laser saw to go look at my loot or craft something I would grumble to myself a little bit about how I had to go back into the menus. I hope updates are coming for some of UI/menus, especially the crafting menu and/or system. Please oh please.\n\n- Also didn't care for the health/jetpack meters being on such a noisy panel up in the corner like they are. It was a hassle to try and read while running/fighting anything. I would rather just have a couple of bars or numbers above my character or some such thing so that I can see a gauge while I am looking at my character and moving about.\n\n- The [lack of] transition from day to night was so abrupt that I thought it was a bug or my game was crashing or textures had stopped drawing. Day/night is great to have, but needs to be a transition, not instant.\n\n- It seems like the way to unlock new things to craft is by collecting these little book things that give +25 or so to various crafting skills. I don't much care for that as a gating mechanic, maybe it would be better if more was available initially or if there was a better indication of how using different materials to craft the same item would make a better one. Additionally, I really didn't enjoy that I would find these little books, then have to go into my inventory, select them, equip them on my action bar, and then pull them out and use them in order to gain experience from them. Unless they are to be used for something else I am unaware of, I don't understand why they are inventory items instead of just experience type pickups that occur automatically and scroll a nice little "+25 Furniture!" or something over your head.\n\nI should stop rambling. There's my 2 cents.\n\nI hope some of this has been helpful if anyone's read this far. I know people compare this game to Terraria, which I have not played. It may very well be that much of what I don't like is based around Terraria's success and these elements I don't like just aren't to my tastes. If that's the case then I guess it just isn't for me - ignore all that junk above. :)\n\nMy conclusion - As it exists now, several different issues come together to make a disappointing experience. I hope that is just due to it being in an early stage, and that we'll see much more polish/improvement in the next few months. I think that when/if the right things are made better the whole game could come together quite nicely.\n","July 17, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","1"

Maybe I didn't played long enough, but in my opinion game shouldn't need 6 hours to get to "fun stuff".\n\nDoing same boring stuff for 2h just to drop one item I needed for gun upgrade. It would be OK for late game grinding for maniac players but at the start? Getting all aluminium I needed was also pretty non-exciting. I don't mind mining, I like minecraft, terraria or Starbound and all the mining didn't get me bored there. But here there is almost nothing interesting to find underground (or anywhere else TBH) and ores are sparse.\n\nSure it's early access - but I played many early access games that weren't that boring.\n\n\n+ crafting system - every material belongs to few "classes", crafiting recipes often require generic materials (for example - if recipe requires raw/metal  you can use aluminium or titanium or whatever else belongs to raw/metal),\n\n+ upgrade system - enemies drop upgrades that after use give you point in given subject (for example Armor), after gathering enough poinst you unlock new recipes,\n\n+ interesting world concept - small and large floating islands,\n\n+ base that actually is a base (different stations - like rafinary or w/e - need to be connected to main command center you build by blocks you craft - can't get away with dirt house)\n\n\n- your first gun is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's pretty weak, you reload more than you shoot and bullets are ugly and slow flying making shooting fast moving enemies nightmare. And you won't change it fast (after 6h of playing I managed to upgrade it to a bit less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun that still looks and behaves similar). I loved how guns "felt" in terraria (speed, sounds, power), here basic gun is terrible, it feels like shooting from plastic toy and you are stuck with it for long time.\n\n- I met only few types of enemies so far. Jellyfishes that suck your energy, small crabs that are freaking hard to hit with basic gun, flying brain-tentacle-thing that shoots at you and some kind of... errr... something that fires homing balls of death that get you through walls (and are hard to shoot down). And there were no "Hordes of enemies", usually just few of them at same time (and more would get you killed)\n\n- upgrades are pretty random, I still didn't managed to discover other classes of weaponry,\n\n- it's hard to tell how long will you fall after you jump (world consists of flying islands), you often die by falling down few screens because of missing island you couldn't land on beacues you didn't know its there,\n\n- islands don't vary in any way,\n\n- your pickaxe is slow (6h of play without getting a upgrade), ores are hard to find. You spend a lot of time at slow mining.\n\n- UI is bad:\n\n- prompts you all the time (everytime you craft it shows you result in a window. it would be enough to show prompt only for weapons)\n- selecting stuff to craft item and amount just takes too much time\n- if you click outside inventory it will ask you if you want to throw item (again - prompt!) instead of using it. it order to use item you have to put in hotbar (annoying when building or using upgrades)\n\n+- sci-fi feel (compared to Starbound, with is kinda mix of fantasy with sci-fi)\n\n+- I don't like graphic style of game (but that's very subjective)\n\n+- no swords in space (on the other hand I was begging for some melee weapon in some situations)\n","July 19, 2014","false","6.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Talk of features like terraforming and such drew me in when I originally purchased this on Desura long before it's Steam release, but if these features are implemented, I have never gotten to a point in the game where I could see them,  Instead, I have been confronted with a constant, and often fruitless hunt for materials to construct devices that ever seem to opperate as expected.\n\nFrustration always takes me over, and I quit in disinterest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phppro/recommended/238240/","phppro","PHPPro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phppro/","686 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is marketed like as a clone of Tererria. This is only partially true. I really like Tererria, but I don't like this game. I understand that this game is still in early development, but based on what I have seen so far it is headed down the wrong path.\n\n1. Everything is much bigger in this game. The character is bigger, the blocks are bigger, everything. This means you cannot fit as much of the game on the screen at a time, so you cannot see as far.\n\n2. There is no map. I use the map all the time in Tererria to find my way around and locate resources. One of the things I like about the map in Tererria is it shows open areas near you, so you can dig towards them. Since this game does not have a map it also does not have this ability. Finding resources is extremely difficult. I have spent hours digging around and ohly found very limited usable resources. Instead Edge of Space has a radar system that you have to craft, and beacons, which you also have to craft. Since it is so hard to find resources it is very difficult to find enough to make these items and so it is difficult to find your way around. Even with the radar, all you get is a little blip on a small radar screen to try and find your way around. This is so much less effective than having a map.\n\n3. So far I have not found any hidden treasures. In Tererria treasure chests and breakable containers are a great way to get resources and gear early in the game. This game does not have these so you have to manufacturer everything yourself. This results in the game moving a lot more slowly.\n\n4. This game does not have biomes like Tererria. For example every Tererria map has desert, jungle, forest and ocean biomes. These go along way to add variety and keep the game interesting. Since this game does not have these it gets boring really quickly. In tererria you also have weather and other events, like blood moons and such. This game does not have anything like that.\n\n5. Weapons suck. The only weapon you have is a gun and it has very limited ammo and has to take time to charge. This is a big pain because if you get attacked by a mob you quickly run out of ammo and have to run away until it charges back up. This makes figinting really difficult and not fun. In addition gun are not good close range, so if the enemies get close you will not be able to hit them. Upgrading the gun is also a slow process. You first have to get enough experience to unlock the plans for a new weapon before you can build it. Since gathering experience is slow it can take a really long time before you are able to upgrade.\n\n6. This brings me to my next dislike. The experience system is completly messed up. There are 18 different categories for experience, and upgrading them depends on which items you pick up. This means you may find a lot of upgrades for furnature, but not for weapons, which has happened to me, and so you have great items to place in your base, but really crappy items to fight with. I like Tererria much better because you only have to gather the materials and you can make anything.\n\n7. You cannot use items directly from your inventory. To use an item, even things like health and other consumable items you first have to put them in your quick bar and then switch to the item and use it. Then when you have consumed all of them it stays in your quick bar with a big red X over it. I would prefer that the item was removed from the quick bar when it was used up. Your quick bar has a very limited amout of space, only 8 slots, so you will be juggling things in a out all the time.\n\n8. Detail screens are split up into 4 different screens. In Tererria if you hit the esc key you see your inventory, weapon, item, and vanity slots and everything else. In Edge of Space you have to hit I for inventory, V for crafting, C for armor and item slots, and L for Experience. The 4 different screen also cover each other up and cannot be moved. So if you try and drap something from the inventory to the armor slot you have to juggle the two screen and make sure they are not covering each other or else it is impossible.\n\n9. The bug reporting system is lousy. When you go to submit a bug you fill out what looks like a standard email form with a place for your email, a subject, and a message. However it is extremely limited in that if you make a spelling mistake or want to go back and clarify something you cannot just use your arrows or mouse and go back to previous text. The only way to go back is to use the backspace key. This means you loose all your typed text up to where you want to change.\n\nAll I can say is I am glad I bought this game on sale because if I had paid more than $5 for it I would be extremely upset. Right now I am willing to wait and see if it gets better.","July 19, 2014","false","38.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I just don't like this game. I love Terraria and Minecraft though. (like Terraria, I don't think it should be compared to Minecraft). The game just doesn't look good in my opinion, is very slow paced, and is just generally boring. I also think the tutorial should be taken out of the game; if you buy this game, you have most likely played Terraria or Minecraft, so you know about crafting and things like that. Some of the fun from these games is learning what to do yourself, and one of the common complaints from the console versions of Terraria/Minecraft is that they even feature a tutorial. Not to mention that it is just FAR to long.","December 29, 2014","false","2.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","6"

This was my first "early access" game before I even know what EA was, I unfortunately fell for the trap of some cool trailers and the incorporation of some Terraria elements, making me hope this was a Sci-Fi terraria.\n\nWhile the fundamentals are the same (a 2d minecraft), the execution is just not even close and the polish of the current state of the game is going to make me wait unto 1.0 release. Upon character creation and the 10+ minute load time (I timed it once) you're forced without choice to go through a tutorial which is extremely frustrating after a character whipe. It lays out the very basics which you then shortly forget and feel very lost in the coming gameplay moments.\n\nBuilding and equipment progression seems confusing and not very straight forward, it's difficult figuring out where to get some of the less common materials without just randomly digging and hoping to hit a vein and what exactly you should be building next. Unless they aren't implemented yet, the distinct biomes are non existent. I walked a bit away from my spawn point and jumped down a few ledges and started taking environmental damage. I presume this is a barrier to prevent you from digging a hole straight down (a-la terraria) and gathering the best materials within minutes of starting a new game.\n\nI'll update when the retail version is released but at this time I won't be spending anymore time with this game.","November 17, 2014","false","11.3"," 46 of 98 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","46","98","0","10"
