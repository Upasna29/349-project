It wanted to deliever a fleshed out tactical rts/turn-based strategy expierence that was easy to understand, but hard to master. The game does deliver on this vision quite well, but isn't perfect.\n\nI suppose you could say with ambition, you sometimes sacrafice a little bit of quality.\n\nThink of the gameplay playing similar to Tom Clancy's Endwar. Except Cuban Missile Crisis is more complex with resource management, radation-infested battlefeilds, choices of avaition, authentic units, better story, better sound, and doesn't contain generic cliche characters that you'll get annoyed with in the first hour of the game. You can't launch WMDs, but understandably since that would be game-breakingly overpowered.\n\nOn the topic of overpowered units. Some of the units are a little too strong and can be hard to kill for seemingly no apprant reason.\n\nThe other problems are mainly visual glitches, typos, etc.\n\nOverall, if you want a game that's a refreshing trip away from the World War Two era. Try Cuban Missile Crisis. It may not be perfect in it's execution. But you can't hate the game for trying something different.","March 29, 2015","true","52.9"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","29","31","2","0"

Instead of simply selecting from a list of engagments, you must manage various formations balancing assaulting the enemy and keeping your army supplied and mobile.\n- Four (4) unique, interlocking campagins\n\nCons:\n- The free-form nature of the campaign leads to a high amount of scenario repetition with varation coming almost exclusively from different formation compostions. Players accustomed to more recent procedurally-generated games will find this particularly annoying.\n- AI at the tactical level is exclusively reactive, meaning you will always be on the attack and hunting the enemy.\n\nBonus Pro:\n- If you're running a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old laptop like me, the game will still perform beautifully.\n\nAt $4.99 this is a steal.","September 1, 2015","true","8.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

Built on the same engine that Blitzkrieg used, so it's got a solid pedigree there.  There is both a stragetic and tactical level to the game, giving it more depth.  You can order around units on the map, capture stragetic resources, etc.\n\nThe problem I have noticed is that everything dies.  Slapping a wet piece of paper on your tanks might increase the survivability of your tanks.  Infantry is pretty dumb, standing out in the open, and when told to entrench, they will rarely do so, yelling "No!" or a variation.  Artillery is completely useless in the hands of the player, but enemy artillery has pinpoint accurate fire, capable of counterbattery fire that makes me jealous.  Missions on the tactical level are bland.  These missions consist of take x, breakthrough x, or take and defend x.  Scenario missions offer some variety to break up the dull missions, but it take a lot of patience in order to get any large unit capable of actually finishing the mission to the mission.  While you can capture enemy equipment, this also holds true for the enemy.  None of the captured equipment is intergrated into your command, and if you lose the crew to a vehicle, and are unable to recrew the vehicle before the end of a mission, it will count the vehicle as lost.  The previously mentioned Blitzkrieg engine needs to be mentioned as well, because the AI for vehicles is on the one hand amusing and then completely and utterly frustrating.  Tanks, APCs, trucks, and infantry will clog bridges, preventing other units from moving forward, while enemy guns will kill several of units without breaking a sweat.\n\nOverall, Cuban Missile Crisis squanders its premise with a series of odd design choices, bland repetitive missions, and the frustration of watching carefully husbanded resources getting slaughtered as they try to cross a bridge.","June 20, 2015","false","15.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","4"

What a waste of so much potential. There were lots of authentic units, several factions to choose from, a good interface to work with, an interesting setting, and they screwed it all up. The enemy can engage your units from as far as his weapon can reach, but thanks to fog of war, your units can't see anything until it's right up in their face, and by the time you give them the order to fire, they're dead. Sending your infantry into combat is a bloodbath that accomplishes almost nothing. Dozens of them will die within seconds, leaving behind what looks like a watermelon patch that's been strafed by a Gatling cannon. But you have to use them to scout the way because the vehicles can't see past their own front bumpers. Their weapons are stronger, but they die just as quickly as the infantry, like maybe the tanks were made out of all the excess infantry carcasses lying around in the game world. I could kill someone with bottle rockets faster than the rocket artillery in this game would hit anything. Do not buy this game. Not even on sale.","March 6","false","4.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","2"

If you wanted more of that style gameplay, then by all means buy this. The control scheme, graphics, and engine are identical. The only real change us an (admittedly-cool) theatre level map where you capture infrastructure, build units, and march armies into enemy territory.\n\nI am not recommending this game though, because Blitzkrieg came out a decade ago, and while I have fond memories, it was frequently a very frustrating game to play.  The CMC single player campaign reminded me of this immediately - when I autoresolved attacks on lightly defended facilities I got zero casualties. When I managed those attacks myself, my units would be shredded by AT guns atop cliffs (in the Blitzkrieg engine, cliffs means they cannot be seen, and they will kill anything you send at them with impunity). So I had to resort to my old Blitzkrieg tactics - namely shelling every part of the fog of war until you're sure you kill anything that might be lurking there. In Blitzkrieg that was boring but doable, since you had infinite ammo. Here, however, you have finite ammo, so you can't shell blindly. But that's the only way to deal with cliffs, since no scouting or cloaked units exist in this universe!\n\nSo this game has basically kept some of the worst aspects of the original game, but removed the workarounds that made the game playable despite those problems.","June 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","1"

"To move a unit into position SHAKE sure you have selected it", instead of "MAKE sure"..... beyond all belief!

I wonder how pi55-poor the other language translations are? I bet it's Russian it's absolutely Putin perfect though!\n\nAnd you couldn't even reach "mission # 2" in the tutorial before hitting us with the first game stopping bug! The next objective does not trigger when you "unload your infantry at the cross-roads". Luckily there is a cheat that allows you to "auto-win" a scenario..... which I used, to only then find that there was ANOTHER such bug in mission # 4 of the tutorial.
