"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/416320/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","Rescue Team 5 is a time management game in which you have one or more workers assisting you with timed missions (unless you play on relaxed mode, of course).  As the name implies, it's the fifth game in the Rescue Team series.  There is a total of 50 levels and in each level, the missions will vary from rescuing stranded people to stocking up on certain resources and such.  In certain levels, you can earn special achievements which are indicated when you click on the Achievements tab in the main menu of the game.\n\nAs to my review of this game, I thought it was pretty fun, especially since I like time management games.  Some of the levels were definitely challenging although I thought that perhaps they were too challenging at times.  At times, it took me several tries either to earn expert on a level or to earn a special achievement.  (For me to want to smite certain levels as they frustrated me, that's saying something.  lol)  Although it did take me a while, I was able to earn all of the achievements as well as expert on every level.\n\nIf there is anything I would criticize, I would have loved for there to have been Steam achievements for this game, just because I like having that feature.  Overall, though, I did enjoy Rescue Team 5 and I would recommend it for those who like time management games and enjoyed the previous Rescue Team games.  ^^","January 25","true","18.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

Colorful stages that involve rescuing people, pets, and then things like animated planes drop you in much needed supplies. The time I've spent has been really fun. Very sharp and colorful buildings, boats, aircraft, and the animated rescue personell that stay pretty busy as you progress in difficulty. The sounds and music are well done. The control with the mouse is not a pure click-fest though. You do need to think and use some strategy when trying to complete these levels. I believe even children can play this at some of the earlier levels with ease. I have to say that this is one of the most vivid strategy/time management games I've played in a long time. Alawar doesn't disappoint usually when producing games and this is one that you can easily feel that your money, as little as it's priced, is worth the investment and time spent playing. If you haven't played the earlier rescue games (1-4) then I would suggest those also. Maybe one of the only things I woud've added is achievements for the Steam version.","January 8","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/416320/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Introduction\nRescue Team 5 is a fun time-management game where you control workers who have to clear paths, rescue people and animals as well as build buildings in order to clear each level. Each level offers different combinations of goals to achieve which require strategy and good allocation of time to accomplish. This game is a great casual game to play when you want to relax and kill some time, there are enough levels to keep you busy for hours. There isn’t a story, however, which isn’t a big issue in this type of game.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe game plays very well, you point and click to direct your workers to complete a task. Tasks range from clearing debris to fixing gas stations and, of course, rescuing people. Things start off simple at first: clear the roads and save people as well as build buildings. Other elements are added as you play, including police officers who stop thieves and doctors who can heal wounded civilians. Helicopters, boats, trains and other vehicles get added as well to help rescue people and animals. One part of the strategy element is figuring who to save first, what to build first and where to focus your efforts first.\n\nAnother strategy element is managing resources. You need money to pay the police and doctors, you need food to fuel your workers, so on and so forth. Choosing which buildings to build and demolish can make or break a level. While the game gives the option to play the game timed or very casually, without managing your resources correctly you can still easily get stuck and have to start a level over again. One feature I liked is that you can demolish buildings if you make a mistake building them or you don’t need the resource they provide anymore.\n\n\nGraphics/Audio\nThe artwork in the game is colorful and eye-catching, even though some elements are tiny to fit on the game map there is still plenty of attention to detail. The music in the game is a bit basic but not annoying to the ears, there are also sound effects as well. Police sirens, construction sounds and many other beeps and boops. While there isn’t much in the way of voice acting, civilians will say “thank you” when rescued, cats meow and dogs bark and my personal favorite the police and firefighters say “I’m on my way” when you deploy them in voice I found rather humorous.\n\n\nPros\n+ The game is very cheap.\n+ Offers a good amount of gameplay for the price, at least three to four hours worth.\n+ Overall presentation looks good.\n+ I enjoyed being able to rescue people and animals, a game with cats is always a plus.\n+ Can play the game with timed levels to challenge yourself or play casually with no time limit.\n+ It has trading cards.\n\nCons\n- Levels can get repetitive, best if played in short bursts.\n- Some levels can be a bit easy.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI’ve played other games of this type and this one is one of my favorites. It’s a fun experience but I really enjoyed playing the hero and helping people. All the tasks you must complete to finish a level make sense and help reach the end goal. I recommend this game to fans of casual play or for those that just want to change up things and relax.\n\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games.\n\nGame key provided by Alawar Entertainment.\n","March 5","true","2.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"
