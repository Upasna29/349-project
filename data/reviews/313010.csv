It was a bad idea, because you can see how identical the games are. The best part is they forgot to rename the program so it's still labelled as Cities XL if you play in windowed mode. It just shows the extreme laziness and lack of care from the developper.

But, this game is the exact same game as what came before.  The exact same buildings, the exact same tools, the exact same interface layout.  The only differences I have been able to spot are the new color of the interface (from blue to black) and apparently it has multi-thread support.\n\nI could have just saved the 20 dollars and played Cities XL, and gotten the exact same experience.  It is a bit sad that they repackaged an old game and sold it for so much while promising us "tons of new features".  Maybe a ton has a different weight value wherever this developer is located.\n\n\nEdit: Due to some legit points made in the comments section of this review I've decided to make an edit.\n\nOld players: Don't buy it, unless you play it every day, then you'll have bought it anyway.\n\nNew Players:  I would characterize this game as more of a City Editor instead of more of a city sim in the manner of the old SimCitys.  In my opinion, this game is just too easy to plop whatever you want down, and watch it build itself.  Yes, you can build a massive city in many of the ways you want.  But if you want to start with a small town, and work your ♥♥♥ off to turn it into a bustling metropolis after hours and hours of fun gameplay, and then have to deal with sprawl, aging infrastructure, and urban blight....then this is not the game for you.\n\nTo that end, I would characterize this game as a pretty boring way to spend an evening as you just point and plop whatever you want or need and then watch the grey boxes go around your city because you don't want to view your city one street at a time.","February 5, 2015","false","0.8"," 803 of 903 people (89%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","89","803","903","45","22"

IF you're coming in new to this series, or have a very old version of this game, this is by far the best version of this game and could be worth the price, but then again you could get an older version for a lot less and get basically the exact same game - except it runs much worse. The bad reviews have to do with the complete lack of any new content, controls, UI, anything - it looks and controls exactly like previous versions of the game, there is no increase in quaility, the controls still mostly stink - but it does run much better now.\n\n-------\n\nSo I've liked the older Cities games, enough that I pre-ordered this one. I boot it up and tah dah... well there is no need to relearn anything since its 99% of the exact same game.\n\nSo to recap the "NEW" version:\n\nPositives:\n\n- This is overlooked in the other reviews I've seen but the game does run much smoother than in the past. I wouldn't really say it looks better, but its no longer sluggish on my top of the line gaming PC. Older versions of the game ran pretty awful, even on top of the line hardware.\n\nNegitives:\n\n- It's the same exact game as before.\n\n- The controls still stink. If they had just upgraded the graphical engine so it ran much bettter (which they did) AND updated the controls so it worked more like SimCity, this game would have been worth the $20 to me. However they did not do that, it controls just as terrible as the previous versions of the game.\n\n- It's the same game... which means it will probably be on sale on Steam for $5 in a week.\n\nOverall this is very very disappointing. Hopefully with the workshop intergration fans will be able to do the job the devs decided not to do - and that is to give us a new game.\n\nIf you're new to this game just wait a couple of weeks, it will surely be on sale as they try to get people to buy this desipte all the poor reviews. This is the best version of this game since it runs better, but otherwise, again, it's the same exact game as the versions you can buy all day and night for $5 or less.","February 5, 2015","false","4.1"," 306 of 332 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","306","332","4","6"

For example, the blue rounded buttons have been replaced by dark grey squares with straight corners. Since these buttons are really small on my 1440p-screen (not to brag), I wonder where the extra X in its title comes from, but it certainly does not refer to these buttons. The sounds during interaction have not changed, the resources are the same, and trading works the same as it always has done. Omnicorp is awaiting your trades when you have no friends (or actually, other cities, as I have not found the online multiplayer yet which actually kind of made one of the previous editions of this game). But, I have to admit, when you start the game you get a nice but short animation carrying the word "Focus". Whatever Focus may be, a studio, a gang of angry Italian hamsters that took this game and tried to earn an extra buck by adding an "X", I dearly hope they have actually fixed the memory leak bug from previous editions. Then it may actually be worth 5 units of your national currency when it is on sale in a month or 2. Until then, just Focus. On games that may actually be worth it. Or that hamster gang.

They changed the color scheme to this black modern looking theme and added in workshop support and trading cards. The features on how to monitor and build your city are the EXACT SAME! They even had the nerve to use the same exact maps! There are probably a few more new buildings in Cities XXL but not worth buying another game just for that. Also on the old Cities XL when my city got around a population of 300k I was pretty much done because the lag made doing anything impossible. They kind of fixed it, I was able to reach about 600k population until the lag did start getting unbearable.\nSo basically all they did was make a new color scheme, sort of fix the lag problem, and add minimal buildings. I would not reccomend buying this game no matter what, even if you do or don't own Cities XL or one of their prior games. Focus Home Interactive should be ashamed for ripping all of us.

Cities X-whatever has essentially not changed very much since the original and I think that is quite apparent.\n\nThey say that the game engine is better; It still runs kind of choppy and has the same problems.\nThey say that the maps are larger; As far as I'm aware, they are the exact size that they've always been.\nThey say that the interface is new; The buttons are grey and make less annoying sounds when you click on them.\nBut hey, at least the music is all new.\n\nI don't hate the game.

If you do not own a Cities title, and wish to get one, then I suppose consider this one or a previous one. But if you want a better city-sim, go grab SimCity4. SimCity3000 is good, too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XanosPlay/recommended/313010/","XanosPlay","Xanos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XanosPlay/","187 products in account","First the most important: this game cannot really be considered as a "game", it is more of a paid patch to older Cities XL versions with many of the bugs STILL present. No surprise, that owners of older versions of Cities XL get a discount - In fact they are just buying the same game again (as I did -_- ).\n\nIf you already own one of the previous Cities XL titles, please don't make the same mistake I did: please do not buy this "game". The game is 99% identical to older ones, only the interface is now black instead of blue and the performance is slightly better. Normally, one should expect this type of change in an update instead of a new release.\n\nIf you are interested in how this game works and what it offers, I propose you may watch some gameplay videos on youtube, as they might tell you more than I could describe in a text here on Steam. However, I'll try with just a few words:\n\nYou start with one of different pre-defined maps, lay out roads, build a town hall and then start zoning residential, industrial and commercial areas. The game offers quite a few nice ideas: residential zoning is separated into different "wealth" categories. The different types of residents are required to operate different types of industry, offices or other workplaces. There are also different density options with higher density offering larger and higher buildings. The "trading" inside the city is calculated using "tokens". Heavy industry needs tokens of unskilled workers and generated heavy industry while manufacturing industry may convert this into manufactured goods which may then be used in commercial areas. If a city is in need of tokens of a certain type, or may have a surplus, tokens may be traded with other cities. However, this trading system is heavily bugged since the first version of Cities XL and was not fixed until today. Of course there is also power, water, pollution, leisure, police, healthcare, fire, etc... However, the simulation is only based on statistics, there is no "real" simulation of vehicles, inhabitants or anything like this.\n\nIf you look for an alternative in the City-Building genre Cities (X)XL might be the right game for you if you can withstand bugs. However, you might want to take a look at one of the (almost) identical older versions of Cities XL for a cheaper price ;)\nAnd again: please think twice before buying this "update" if you own a previous game of the franchise.","February 5, 2015","false","9.9"," 226 of 261 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","226","261","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MegaBearsFan/recommended/313010/","MegaBearsFan","MegaBearsFan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MegaBearsFan/","64 products in account","So right off the bat, Cities XXL is not substantially different from its predecessor (Cities XL). In my time with the game so far, I've only encountered two new features. Everything else, right down to the buildings available and the game interface, are unchanged. XXL hardly deserves to be called a sequel or sold as a new game. It's a content patch, and not even a very good one.\n\nWhen I first started playing Cities XL a few years ago, I was really impressed with it. I hadn't really played any modern city-builder games since SimCity 4, and so the jump to 3-D graphics, the ability to draw curved roads, and the sheer size of the maps was enough to win me over initially. But as I've played the game more, it's limitations and weaknesses have become much more apparent and hard to ignore. This is especially true in the game's interface and controls, which are very rough and full of nagging annoyances. When compared to the much smoother and organic controls of games like Tropico 5, the modern [disastrous] SimCity reboot, and even older games like Caesar IV, Cities XL really starts to look bad.\n\nThe biggest deterrent to enjoying Cities XL is its UI and controls. There's nothing that really single-handedly breaks the game, but there's a cacaphony of small, nagging problems that gradually wear down your resolve to play the game. The first thing that you'll notice is the ugly and disorganized interface. There are buttons and widgets floating all over the screen: build icons, overlay toggles, camera control widgets, zoning sub-controls, and so on. You can customize some of the UI elements by dragging them to different places on the screen, but there is no arrangement that really feels comfortable.\n\n\nRead full review on my blog:\nhttp://www.megabearsfan.net/post/2015/04/28/Cities-XXL-game-review.aspx","October 19, 2015","false","76.7"," 161 of 179 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","161","179","3","0"

And there's no vsync option so I can't help it :( In-game it's flickering terribly, random roads and buildings disappearing on zooming out.\n* New UI... Okay, maybe old one did need some facelift, but it wasn't that bad to replace it with this buggy hell. Some buttons require some searching for a spot that would register the click. Hell, it looks like exactly same UI that was in previous games, only repainted black, added transparency, and rounded buttons replaced with plain rectangles.\n\n\nI can't say much about other features, as I can't really play it because of the flickering and tearing (come on, give us vsync!), it hurts my eyes.

It certainly was more flexible than the limited options in SimCity 4. Unfortunately, Cities XXL doesn't really build upon its predecessor to really improve.\n\nThis is more of a paid patch than a new game. None of the central mechanics have been modified or improved much at all. In fact, there's only two big draws here:\n\n- An updated engine supporting multi-core CPUs and >4GB of RAM. The game is a lot more stable, especially with large cities.\n- Steam Workshop support.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the key mechanics of the game, trading, is completely broken without a mod. All trades in all cities will reset to 0 when loading a city, so it becomes impossible to actually trade resources around as intended. The mod fixes this, but why is it broken to begin with? I've also had several unexplainable crashes while playing that make me saving like a complete paranoid.\n\nIf this were a free patch for Cities XL, I'd be pretty happy. If it were a $5-10 DLC, I'd roll my eyes and be accepting. But $20 for previous owners and $40 for the "new" game? No way, son. My call is to wait for new patches to fix some of the problems, more Workshop content to improve the mechanics, and a Steam Sale so you can pay what the game is really worth.","February 10, 2015","false","5.8"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","59","67","2","0"

Yes, it does look graphicaly better, somewhat, and the Multi-core support is showen. But just barely. When theres zones being built, I see massive frame drops and the game starts to lag quite a bit. Which is surprising because it was suppose to be such a smooth game to play. The UI is the same, with only the play/fast-forward buttons moved, and the color of the UI is now a dark grey instead of blue.\n\nPersionally, this game should be running way better on my system, seeing as how I have a high end gaming PC, (system specs below), but it barely maintains 60 FPS on a 4K screen. Which makes no sence since BF4 and BF:Hardline, both way more demanding games, especially on 4K, runs better with a comfortable 74 average FPS on my 4K monitor.\n\nYes, the game does look slightly better, I will agree with that, and the map sizes are nicer too compared to SimCity, which I have played a lot of. But, SimCity does run better and looks way nicer with a better user interface then what Cities XXL has now. Yes SimCity 2013 did have an absolute horrendus launch, but after all of the patches and bug fixes that they have released, I'd much rather spend my time on SimCity then on Cities XXL.\n\nIf you have not played Cities XL 2012, or Cities XL Platinum, then you should still get the game. But if you already have one of those two, and dont mind the UI, and lower frames, then I do not recomend this for you unless you have a pile of money burning a hole in you're pocket.\n\nLet's just hope that Cities: Skylines will be better. From the game play that I have seen on youtube about Cities: Skylines, it seems to have a much better user interface and it seems to run better over all.

Cities XXL is basically cities XL with what seems to be an identical gameplay and slightly altered interface. It's actually quite insulting. But it's also a good lesson for all you young developers out there. Say you desinged a decend video game about a decade ago, made a bunch of money and lived a happy life. But now the checking account is running a little low. What do you do? Well, you sure don't feel like developing a new game, so instead you offer an amazing 50% discount to those who have already purchased the old one and promise them a new version. You add a letter or a number to the title (those suckes will fall for it every time) and you slap a few minor updates... and I mean minor, like say the color of the interface, and Ta Da!!!

The first iteration in 2009 felt like it was made with a lot of love. It had with its release the promise for a bright future. Since the demise of the original developer, Focus has had the tendency to ride it like a cash cow. It has neglected the franchise like an abusive parent witholding affection from its secretly adopted middle child.\n\nCitiesXXL is the latest annual crayon drawing posted on the refrigerator from the intern at Focus. Its release was preceded by an intentionally anemic campaign consisting of decent stills and an admittedly well-done video of the city they made for their marketing coordinator. Thinking about it now, it probably took that intern longer to build that city than the entire update to the poor shattered dreams of Monte Cristo's original code.\n\nIt's been made clear why the publisher was so quiet leading up to its release as the expressed promise of a new game would have been somewhat misleading. CitiesXXL is sort of a new game...\n\n..but it's more of an update.\n\nI wouldn't call it a patch because that would imply a fix. My experience so far has been that it runs a bit slower than XL Platinum. It uses the same maps, and the same textures on some buildings which clearly spell "CitiesXL". Ironically, this seems to be the only thing spelled correctly. The updated metro-esque menus are poorly QC'd and have flagrant visual bugs on the surface. It feels like I'm beta testing.\n\nWhile I would love to be completely on one side of the black and white vitriol I find in the forums, I find myself kind of liking this update. The flaws haven't so far been game-breaking, and I really like the Steam integration. Mods are now incredibly simple to install and they have improved my experience. There is greater control of the camera, an updated soundtrack, and an Expert mode which is a wonderful addition.  I still don't like the classism that plagues the heart of the series, but I understand how it works and Expert mode helps dull that edge quite a bit.\n\nAttention to some of these details but not others has left me confused. Why are the controls so strange? I know it's European, but I would love to use WASD instead of arrow keys and edge tripping. Why can't I edit these controls? Why can't I edit mouse sensitivity? I should be able to upgrade roads in place-- especially when I meticulously curved that one to fit that ridge. Ugh.\n\nThis isn't a bad game. Yes, it is an obvious cash-grab that should have been an update or DLC. Yes, Focus is deceitful and disgraceful. It is, however, an update to a pretty fun game. Casual CitiesXL Platinum gamers will be disappointed. This would likely be worth the purchase for avid players and new players who just can't wait for Cities:Skylines.","February 6, 2015","false","3.2"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","53","64","0","0"

Mediocre. You can see that only minimal amount of work has been injected into this "release". In relative terms, and to give you a measurable idea, the price of a small DLC would realistically reflect what Cities XXL is for previous owners of the franchise (especially Cities XL Platinum). In absolute terms, it's definitely not worth 40€. It remains a workable city builder without much life. Given other better titles out there with more customization, management options, silmulation and life dimmension, I would not recommend this game over even older titles like SC4.

ONLY RECOMMENDED if this is your first Cities XL title...This part of the review is ONLY for players new to the franchise!  If you DO already have a Cities XL game - skip to the second section below - or tl;dr - it's a rip-off patch for a game you already own.\n\nSo, if you don't already own a Cities XL game, then this game offers a lot of fun and creativity, and is arguably THE best city-creator on the PC scene at the time of writing.  Unless a new offering improves on the genre, then this is the title you want, even though it's not perfect.\n\nPros\no You can zone areas and let the game choose properties\no You can select property designs and styles yourself instead of zoning (with the community made mod in Workshop)\no The maps are huge and varied\no Granular choice of industry (you choose types of industry, farming and commerce)\no There is a rudimentary trading system\no A blueprint system as now used by Simcity 2013 for advanced developments\no Very mod-friendly with thousands of compatible mods for the Cities XL franchise\no Full cheat system so you can choose the constraints with which to play\n\nCons\no No dynamic population (unlike Simcity - no births, deaths, people who move in or out at will)\no No fires, crime or disasters\no Little choice of mass transit (nothing has been implemented properly since XL days)\no A buggy interface\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 7.5/10\n\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED if you are upgrading from an earlier Cities XL title...If you had performance issues with prior Cities XL titles, then this upgrade might be for you.  Otherwise, there is very little new on offer for Platinum owners and XL owners are justifiably angry about being charged for what amounts to be a performance patch (hence the swamp of negative reviews).  Even with my 'nice' hat on, I think FHI should only have charged a minor-DLC amount, not advertised it as an all-new game.\n\nSo what do you get?  There is a new 'sky' feature where you can select a pre-designed sky effect.  This is static (doesn't bring any weather effects) but does add a prettier ambience to your cities.  Right now there are around 6 to choose from (not many) but new versions have started to appear in the Steam Workshop.\n\nAll the primary buildings are exactly the same as before.  There are something like 8 new buildings added by this new version ('green' buildings for the climate-friendly builders) and a small number of additional maps, but no other content.  The advertised multiple international and period architectural styles are purely a category list which sorts the existing buildings (nothing extra).\n\nLighting appears to be a little improved, but old bugs remain (tree bugs, box vehicles etc).  The good news is that the mods that fixed these problems in the other games work here too - but that's not really surprising because the game is essentially the same as before.  The majority of custom content  mods from XLNations and other sites are compatible but I recommend you try a tiny few at a time because quite a few won't work at all.\n\nIn short, unless you experienced terrible performance in Platinum/XL, this is a greatly overpriced, superfluous 'upgrade' that you probably don't need.  Wait until it's around £5 or so then buy it for the prettier sky - but that's all.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 2/10","February 6, 2015","true","73.4"," 67 of 102 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","67","102","5","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/313010/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","In spite of whatever else might be wrong with it, there is no mistaking the sheer amount of creative freedom that Cites XXL allows. The ability to play as the benevolent overlord of a teeming metropolis entirely of your own creation proves to be a satisfying pursuit, yet it remains one that is uncomfortably similar to previous games in the series. And that’s the thing really; Cities XXL simply doesn’t do enough new to justify its full price tag over its predecessor and in doing so, its stunted evolution coupled with a general lack of polish ensures that this latest instalment in the Cities series flounders in the face of more ambitious city-building efforts. Nevertheless, while Cities XXL might not hold much allure for city building stalwarts and mayoral masters who already have tried their hand at Cities XL Platinum, there is enough substance here that it at least provides a suitable starting point for newbies to both the series and the genre as a whole.\n\nThe first stop for the uninitiated should be the game’s tutorial which in being divided up into a dozen or so topics, provides digestible lessons on how to get started in earnest. Certainly, the tutorial is in-depth and caters well for newcomers, ensuring that the lessons learned in the tutorial aren’t forgotten with in-game hints that are helpfully provided throughout to keep new folks on the right track. Clearly, Cities XXL is eminently welcoming to new starters. Folks familiar with the game’s predecessor on the other hand, Cities XL Platinum, will have a good idea of what to expect here and for better or worse, since Cities XXL doesn’t stray far from what we’ve seen before.\n\nBut how does it play? There are 60 or so prebuilt maps to choose from, but there are no options to manually landscape at all – which limits what can be done in the pre-produced spaces. The game provides hints about what your next action ought to be, and you can keep track of city happenings, but the interface is fair from friendly, with such data buried a few layers deep. Building zones is my favourite part of XXL. Square zones can be customized (how big should the roads be, what grid size should the blocks be) – while a free zone option allows building of areas that are of atypical shape, while the game inserts plots and roads at generally logical points. Zones can also be built plot by plot for those with an absurd level of patience. This allows for much more unique city design than seen in other games, and enhanced creative freedom. Roads benefit most from this flexibility, with the ability to build freeform curved roads.\n\nBuilding up the rest of the city is straightforward, as citizens begin demanding services at various population levels, and you add the necessary features. Trade also becomes more important as your city grows, as you must import the resources you aren’t producing, and export your surpluses. The trading interface is clunky at best, and getting a handle on what a trading token is can be frustrating.\n\nBoasting a new engine and tweaks, Cities XXL also states that many of the bugs and performance issues have been fixed, but as I continued playing not all of them have. I still ran into performance drops that spiked worse as my city grew to its limits. Sometimes my load screen would hang for a lot longer than any reasonable game should, and every now and then the game would completely crash. This may sound like a bunch of big problems but it is a step up from Cities XL, and is actually not too bad, just not as good as I had hoped.\n\nThe graphics and sound have not been touched since the 2009 release of Cities XL, but they have aged well and are still enjoyable. I love the street feature, where you can zoom all the way to the ground in a first-person view and enjoy the city you built. The level of detail and diversity within the town is also impressive, and makes you want to look around and enjoy, versus it just being a novelty. It also adds a sense of realism when your town gets big, and they can get huge. The sound is also well done, from ambient sounds to horns honking during a traffic jam. Not to mention the music is about on par with the other games in its genre.\n\nThere are a few additions to the mix here, but there’s nothing that will take your breath away. You’ll find a lot of “green” options to help tackle the rising pollution levels in your city, and you’ll notice that pollution is realistically centered around areas as opposed to just being spread across the city. There are also five entirely new environments that your map can take place in, and a moving skybox does offer a more lifelike biome for you to create your architectural masterpiece.\n\nHonestly, I’m not even sure why I’m shocked. After all, the Cities franchise does have a penchant for doing this. Cities XL 2011 was essentially Cities XL with a few new maps and features. Cities XL 2012 and Cities XL Platinum were the same type of deal as well: basically a clone of their predecessors, just with more maps and features.\n\nThe user interface and menus have been retooled in Cities XXL, but I can’t say that it’s strictly for the better. It definitely has a more modern feel to it, but it really looks like it was a rush job. Everything about it simply seems like it was thrown together. This is the definition of being nitpicky and on its own would barely be worth mentioning, but any graphic designers in the audience may want to prepare themselves for some fairly atrocious kerning. I’m not really sure how you can manage to have your typeface off-center on the main menu of your game, especially when it’s a game about micromanagement and fine details, but that’s part of the magic of Cities XXL I suppose.\n\nCities XXL represents a serviceable starting point for beginners certainly, but is simply too riddled with bugs, performance issues and recycled content to recommend to anyone else who has sampled the series previously. Much like how Cities XXL encourages the player to build their sprawling domains from the ground up, so too should the developer look to apply a similar work ethic to this tired series. Overall 5/10.","April 26","true","31.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","23","29","2","0"

However i caved anyway and purchased it. I honestly just really enjoy city building games. Being that i already owned XL 2012 platinum i got it at a discounted price of $20, which made my purchasing decision a bit easier. Another reason why i purchased is because of the talk of multicore support which is something the previous game suffered from, the performance was utterly garbage in XL 2012. However that being said the performance in XXL is no different, the game still has crap performance when your city finally starts getting decently large.\n\nI can't even place a bridge or road after a while as framerate drops when rendering out the bridge or road placement to the point where its not possible anymore. Starting out my city by careful planning and design, by the time large density areas are placed and built the design and care just goes out the window because of complete ♥♥♥♥ framerate when placing zoning areas or roads etc. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t performance issues as the previous game.\n\nAs city building games go the XL series of games are complete garbage when it comes to actual city building.  Sim city 5 while it has small building areas blows this ♥♥♥♥ out of the water. Also ♥♥♥♥ this company for releasing this game like it was something new and feeding us the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

I found that Cities XXL is the superioir game, but hardly. It just makes more fun to play because of the factr it is easier. Well don't get me wrong, challange is a good thing but I never felt much chalanged by cities xl as I felt "Chalanged".\n\nBut only if I look at the game without looking at the competition. I find simcity 5 still to be a much better game in many aspects of the gameplay. But finaly simcity 4 is a way better game. Even SiomCity 3000 is because of it's charme and it's mechanics a much better game. I wouldn't say it is worse than simcity 2000 or simcity classic but since those are about 20 to 30 years older than this game, this doesn't mean allot.\n\nThe best improvment over cities XL is the music.\nI say I will play it more than cities xl and will get arrant for my money but no sir, it is a rip off.\n\nAlso I didn't spell check because I don't belief the game is neither good or bad enough to be worth the time. I think that tells allot.\n\nEdit: Well the Music Tracks are awesome except "Synthesized Troughs", why is that so? Because it sounds like the put in the sound of a toilet flush with 22kbps sampling rate, severall times. How can you ruin your own music whith something that awefull that leaves a disgusting aftertaste. The good news is that you can just put that file out of the audio folder and steam doesn't try to replace itr, you can even put your own music there.\nBad thing is that for a game like this all the tracks are to short even they could be much longer. You can listen to the same music far longer but the titels are betwen 2-3 minuts while SimCity 4 for example 4-7minuts and even there I found the tracks to short for a game like this but at least there where about 20 not only like 7, but thank foxy than they don't sound all similar like in SimCity 5.\n\nOh and Btw. thje Multi Thrad Support works, but it needs a very while until it works. The game will start using one Core, at least if you minimized the window and maximized it after that. But after a while it will even use all 8 cores of an AMD FX8120. Sadly the Improvement seems subtle.","February 5, 2015","false","32.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The large tile zoning is excellent, giant maps are excellent, varity of buildings is pretty good, multicore processors was a drastically needed change.    Cities:XXL has many draw backs, one being that the game is very close to, or  almost identical to Cities: XL.\n\nThe game features broken promises from the developer, such as being active(non existent at the moment), adding free DLC(hasn't happened, no developer support).  Bugs aren't fixed at all either.  What is also disappointing is the modding community is very small, but the work they've added is very good in terms of mods and assets.

The UI is antiquated and looks like it was setup for the alpha version of a project with a 5 man team. The performance improvement mentioned by the developers with regards to a brand new engine is a straight up lie. The game runs just as bad as it's previous iterations.

There is honestly no depth to this game other than build a city, cool, look our artists added 500 new blurry textures with no real gameplay additions. Seriously, this does not make any sense whatsoever... there is really nothing different. Most of the differences like road upgrades are broken iterations that don't work.\n\nSound:\n\nIt has music and some noises.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPlease don't buy this game.

I'm not entirely sure what they were, because 90% of the game is identical to Cities 2012. When I played the tutorial and realised it was *exactly* the same as before, horrible character graphics and all, I stopped and went "No one else can make this mistake."\n\nAs many people have pointed out, support for various graphics or processor options does not constitute a new game, nor does slightly increasing the number of buildings.\n\nCities 2012 wasn't even that good a city builder, or one that gives you any level of connection to what you've built. The reason why I purchased this was down to it being marketed elseware as an "anti-SimCity" with much more space to build and better options overall. And it probably is better than the release version of SimCity. But that was several years ago, and things have changed in that game that make it much more engaging and less restrictive. This on the other hand feels like a £15-£30 cash grab.\n\nI am going to play more of this, and try to establish if anything of note has actually changed and if not I will edit this review accordingly to point these things out. But don't buy this game, buy Anno, buy SimCity, buy a casual city building game on your tablet but do not buy this game until other users have established whether or not this is just Cities 2012 with a slightly cleaner interface and less horrible music.\n\nEDIT: It does feel faster, having played it for a couple of hours. But it looks nearly *identical* to Cities 2012, a now three year old title. The interface is better and the music is better. Nothing else is different.\n\nI would go so far as to call this a con.

My roommate and i researched the best ways to build the cities, what key points to look out for, we have made multiple cities. Not once, not even once was I ever as interested in it as i was SimCity, which is disappointing because i found Simcity to have a lot of shortcomings.\n\nThe way the UI works is terrible.

BUT SEVERELY LACKING THE 'NEW'\n\nAs soon as I heard that a fresh new Cities XL game was on the horizon, I had really big hopes that this would finally be a new start for the series, a proper major upgrade from Cities XL that maintained the best bits of the series whilst introducing significant improvements in gameplay, customisation and capabilities. This is a game that had to be MORE that Cities XL was and, given the title's new X, one would assume this to be the case. But, alas, two hours in and I find myself disappointed.\n\nLike with previous annual 'new releases' it feels that Focus have merely taken the same old game, given it 2015's lick of paint and sent it on its merry way. Underneath it all, this game feels exactly the same as the previous three incarnations and offers very little in the way of new. Don't get me wrong, it's not a 'bad' game. As city-builders go, Cities XL (or XXL) is a very different take compared to others in the genre, and where it excels in some areas of micro-management, it's lacking in others. But ultimately, if you are looking for an evolution from the previous versions of the game, XXL just does not cut it.\n\nFocus are crying "wolf" with this latest offering, and had I known Cities XXL would be an almost identical carbon copy of Cities XL, I would have stuck with the Platinum version and invested the money in alternative new takes on the city-building genre, such as 'Cities: Skylines'. Whilst Focus' rivals, Maxis, may have their critics and problems with their latest SimCity offering, they've atleast made the effort to evolve the series, even if it is with varying degrees of success. And while the latest SimCity has been an education for Maxis, Focus have yet to demonstrate that evolution is in their nature.","February 5, 2015","false","16.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

Patiently and with some excitement I wait for this ruse to download/install/etc once done I proceed to launch what I thought was a "NEW" game only to find myself puzzled moments later. Wait a second, I think, did I just load Cities XL? Nope, it turns out I loaded the right game, it just has the same everything only slightly tweaked.  Did I really read the sale correct? Did I really just get suckered out of $20 for a patch? WTF? It turns out I’m not alone, this developer has either taken us to be fools or has suffered some form of traumatic head trauma. So BUYER BEWARE this is a classic used car salesman stich, you know "Used car for sale, belonged to a sweet older lady, only driven to church on Sundays…blah..blah,blah…suckers" this developer should be ashamed.\n\nFrom title:\n"Bigger and better than ever before with a more powerful game engine and new interface, become the mayor of your very own sprawling metropolis."\n\nTranslation:\nSo we slightly made a few tweaks here and there that we feel are ground breaking. BTW you know Steve in development? Yea it’s sad, his house caught on fire and burnt to the ground the other day. Then his wife ran off with one of the firemen. And if that wasn’t enough his car wouldn’t start this morning, he tried to push start it… ended up rolling the car over his sleeping dog. Poor little guy never saw it coming.  Soo needless to say, umm, yea he kinda, sorta, um well… he didn’t make to the release with the game content, so we released a repackaged version of the last game, our bad (it was totally for your enjoyment). Oh we also changed a few colors and added a useless interface here and there.\nTo the developer: Gee thanks guy, I’m really glad I could pay you $20.00 for the same game I bought years ago. You really should hold onto your marketing team though, they managed to polish the hell out of this turd.\nI have 2 favors to ask of you:\n1.	Get the game data from Steve (tell him were sorry for his loss) and give us the “New” game we all paid for.\n2.	Since I doubt the above will happen, in the next Cities game please include an empty jar of Vaseline in the games title menu. This way we will know were about to be royally f@#ked.\n\nSteam,\nI know this may not be a burning priority and probably wont set off any warning bells (it should), but in the best interest of your customers I feel that this developers actions warrant a major review. I mean come on, I could see this being delivered in its current state as a work in progress had It been billed as an alpha/beta. But taking a several year old game and polishing it ever so slightly does not make it a new game. We (your customers) were taken for yet another ride. Something has to give, at some point someone there needs to stand up, grow a pair and say this isn’t right. Not every game is going to be a winner, it’s to be expected. But this, this is unacceptable. At least I can still somewhat respect (for trying) the developers  who take the money and run.\n","February 7, 2015","false","119.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

The same bugs, the same graphics, the same annoying errors that stopped me from playing previous editions.\n\nIf you are new to this series, here are some facts:\n\nDuring first hour you will enjoy what seems like a vast array of buildings, options, possibilities.\n\nSoon you will realise that the fact that you can't control tilt of the camera is fricking annoying.\n\nYou can't map any keyboard shortcuts neither so forget about wsad camera movement.\n\nBuildings are pretty but most of the non gridded ones will not connect to roads in a nice way so they\nstick out like frick.\n\nRoads are really not flexible. Apparently you can bend them which looks like all hell broke loose on antyaliasing. They constantly have problems connecting one to another if you try to do anything else than 90 degrees. You can upgrade them on a random occasion but you can't preview your choice (not even statistics so you don't know what benefits you will get) and often choice is totally usless. Also, if you decide you want to delete a road in an area with many gridded buildings, and replace it with a bigger one, often preexisting connections won't won't work forcing you to reverse the whole process or deleting a line of buildings which you will have to do one by one or with a radial tool.\nSeeing how roads are exteremely important in this game, the fact that they often don't work is quite a biggy for me.\n\nRoundabouts are totally useless. Won't connect to some roads and cars dissapear on them.\n\nTalking about cars, I don't know if animated vehicles reflect traffic but I do hope the don't as they drive like a bunch of total morons. Turning left? Sure, I will use the most right lane and stop all other cars. All. The. Time.\n\nThe vast selection of buildings I mentioned before? Not really. Most of them you will find in a section called "pack". They are categorised badly, according to continents and have quite a few nice objects there, but it's difficult to find what you are looking and often they won't stick to your roads.\nIn default categories you will often face a selection of a single model of a particular building making you create basketball courts all over your city as there is almost no leisure objects and the most efficient ones are sea based and costs sums of money that must have been set by jamming a zero on a keyboard.\n\nThere is no multiplayer so whenever you have stuff to trade with, you often do it with a corporation that will give you a 1 to 1 exchange rate making it feel soooo realistic. For example, you can exchange 1 unit of unskilled workers for 1 unit of oil.\n\nYou can't overwrite buildings meaning that you have to delete them before you can build something on top. Doesn't sound like a big issue but it starts to get supper annoying when you have a big city and need to increase any of public services or add stuff where other stuff already exists.\n\nNottifications don't lead you anywhere. Unskilled workers need more leisure? Ok no problem. Which areas? F*** you. Find out on your own. Heavy traffic is making some roads unusable? Ok let's upgrade them. If only I knew which ones you mean. Yes, you do have some overlays to chose from (btw. icons here didn't change since I can remember) but still, would be so much quicker and easier if that little help was available. Who cares though, right?\nAll in all, I'm really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I spent £15 pounds on a game that I preety much already have. I had big expectations, I trully wanted to trust you Focus but you ♥♥♥♥ on me and people that believed in this.\n\n2/10","February 5, 2015","false","4.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

This could have been a small patch for cities xl premium to make larger cities playable. Fiendish behaviour by these guys; dubious at best - peddling 5 year old software as a new full priced product.

Performance is slightly improved from the previous version but there are some weird bugs now.\n\nOver 9+ hours of play this is what I have found that I consider game breaking:\n\n1. When you re-load a game the game forgets what ever trades you had set up. So as you may leave the game with a positive trade balance, you will now suddenly find yourself deeply in the hole.\n2. The moment I hit more than 500K people living in the city my office start dying for no apparent reason. This has a knockon effect to all the other industries. Basically the only way around this is to "import" office services, but that quickly eats up your exports (not to mention you cannot sell other stuff as they eat up your precious export slots).\n3. Randomly areas go from "happy with entertainment" to "not enough entertainment" even if nothing else has changed.\n\nAs it stands, it's unplayable.

As is stands with Cities XL Platinum it hard to recommend it.\nI have played Cites XL and enjoyed the breath of wonderful features and good graphics.  It allows for large cities in the millions, something Sim City has yet to do.\n\nNow to the changes, there are some changes from Cities XL:   user interfaces make over,  new/ugraded graphics engine, new music, and new upgrades to the buildings.    The user interface has been cleaned up and now looks more in line with Microsoft “Metro” look.  This works, It is easy to see and distinguish the icons.  I have seen little functionality changes though.  The newly upgraded engine is smoother show off better pixel shaders.  The engine is still fresh and I saw the roads gliching at certain zoom levels.  There are more and better skyboxes so that is a plus.  There are a few additional upgrades that you can add to the city utilities, but they are later in the game and look like minor changes gameplay.  The tutorial has not changed, for good or ill.  So what does $20/$40 get you?\nThe good:\nBetter engine, User interface, Sky boxes, Music variety\nIndifferent:\nFuctionallity (The same), Frame rate difference is hard to notice, Music changes\nThe bad:\nStill Glitchy, paying $20 for a large patch\n\nIf you want to get this game, buy fresh on a Steam sale.  It is worth is in $20-$30 new.\nIf you own Cities XL, then it is a tough decision.  Is the minor upgrades worth $20?\n\nFor me, no.  There needed to be more content or a less of a price tag.\n","February 10, 2015","false","19.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

I really like the genre. City building simulations are kinda rare, and I really liked Cities XL. It wasn't ground breaking, but an overall decent experience...\n\nThe Graphics? Are quite good, actually. I like them. The game mechanics? Nothing revolutionary, but they do their job.\n\nCities XXL isn't a bad game. I played it for short and it carried over the fascination of the previous installments. Actually, scrap that. It is pretty much the previous installment. And that's my major complaint. It doesn't really add to the franchise. You got the same world map, the same trade system (inter city and Omnicorp), the same buildings... oh, and even the same bugs. Allright, they added at least a tiny bit of new content... a handful of new buildings, a few new maps, some little recoloring and multicore support. Still, it's like they just copied and pasted the last incarnation, slapped a patch(!) over it and sell it now again. Yeah, you are paying for a patch. Or a stand-alone DLC, whatever. But it is not even one that fixes all the problems, that are haunting the game since, like, forever.\n\nIt is, on a side note, also not the first time Focus did that with this game. I don't know what they are thinking. Program a patch, rerelease. Program a patch, rerelease. Program a patch... it is one of the purest versions of moneygrabbing. Unfortunatly, I fell for it. Won't happen again, Focus, I tell you that. This is the fifth(?) installment of the series. Don't just sell us an updated version of the same game over and over again. It's bad enough that other publishers, which I won't name here, do that the whole time. You know what I did with their games? I stopped buying them, because in my eyes it wasn't worth it. Please, stop doing this. Cities is one of the last city building simulations left, and I would hate so see it going down.\n\nAs it is, I just can't recommend the game... at least if you already have one of the previous versions. There are way to little changes and content additions for a 20 Euro price tag. Everyone who hasn't got a game from the series might consider it... when it is on sale. Or wait for the next one, because it might be the same game... again.","February 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/minireddish/recommended/313010/","minireddish","¨¨","http://steamcommunity.com/id/minireddish/","827 products in account","This feels like an absolute joke.  A slap in the face to anyone who has owned the previous Cities game.  After a short time playing this, I've really not noticed much different at all.  The only differences being the change of colour in the UI, and possibly more formatting options when 'zoning' for buildings.\n\nDrawing of roads still feels the same as it was.  the curves of the roads are very angular and only really feel smooth on large winding roads. Combined with the zoning of buildings, which just seem to be square ploppable things, it makes the curved roads, and lining things up on them feel awkward at best, leading to frustrating at some occasions.\n\nAs far as other mechanics go, they all seem pretty much the same as they were before.  Resource mechanics boil down to rather abstract quantities which can make it a little hard to judge how much of a deficit or surplus you have in a resource.  With the resource layers also appearing to be static as well.  Placing a building just seems to consume a radius around it rather than extract the resources over time makes it feel that it's something you can just plop and abandon without much thought to it.  If resource production/extraction was dynamic based on various factors then I feel it would have presented more of a challenge, especially for later on in the game.\n\nEven the placing of services doesn't offer much interaction as far as I can tell.  It appears to me that by placing one it just offers a set bonus over a radius, I've not really seen much that changes this.  I think the density of road affects how far it projects, but beyond that, I can't really tell.  There's no real information as to who is using the services, how often they use them, and how easy it is to access them etc.  I can't help but hark back to SimCity4, which at least offered some information as to the quality of the service, and how many were using it.\n\nI suppose this one is more of an optional gripe into how the game works, and always has.  But the zoning for people is split through tiers.  So you can place rich people where you want, and poor people elsewhere.  Although this is nice if you're going for a tailor-made city.  It makes the game lose quite a chunk of the organic city growth feeling.  I always felt that the people that lived in an area, should reflect how that area grows and develops, and in turn it should visually change to represent that.  Be it becoming some crime infested slums, or millionaire mansions and parks.\n\nI know they've had plenty of time to implement a lot more than what they have.  It does raise questions as to why it feels as though so little has changed.  There's been plenty of inspiration and discussion from various communities centred around city building games.  Plus quite a nice amount of previous material to draw inspiration from!  I just want to know why they felt that it had to all be the same, despite it definitely having flaws from before.\n\nI just don't feel I could ever recommend this game, even to new players if they're looking for something that is more deep and complex in managing a city.","February 6, 2015","false","3.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This game has sooooo much potential, which was why I was excited enough to pre-purchase the new release several weeks before it was released, which was delayed. I wouldn't have minded the waiting and the money if there was some merit to the extra cost and the wait, but alas there isn't.

And I will have to say that this is however worth the money for once. I am actually impressed by the small things I have been annoyed by in earlier iterations of this franchise. Let me sumarize briefly what elements they've improved, and what is not changed about the game.\n\n\nImprovementsThis is my list of things I have considered annoying for the past few games, and the status of their current state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnoyanceDescriptionStateCommentRoadsnappingOdd or erronous roadsnapping makes laying roads difficult and is sometimes a tedious jobFixedFrom my perspective this is fixed. I have tried to place roads on top of roads, build tunnels under districts and placed bridges in places not possible in previous iterations. It feels more natural now, which is good enough for me.Traffic jamWhen building a block or a few streets, and want to allow the citizens commute to work, you end up with traffic jams all over the place and those "real life"- scenarios wont work as expected. Forcing expressways where a normal avenue should have sufficed.Fixed and FixedAt least, it seems better now, after making a few neighbourhoods as i normally would do, the difference is clear from CXL and CXXL, the traffic flow is just that much better, and I can focus on infrastructure the way it should have been from the start.PollutionIndustry and car pollution either grow to fast or is totally out of proportions from the start. FixedThis is where I actually became the most surprised! Things work so much better now, they've tweaked the industry so that the polution is less problematic where you expect it. And if you place coal-plants, they polute exactly how I expect them to.MenusThe menus lack certain areas, such as achievements - and they are extremely laggy and can sometimes crash you game if not used in certain ways.FixedNew shiny black UI, they've added a filter for housing - possibly to cater for the many mods which you can find in the workshop!! Good workshop integration as well.Multicore support and memory leaksGame goes haywire if you have a 300K+ city, this is due to several memory-leaks and 1 core utillization. The game runs as well on a pentium single core 4Ghz as it does on a 5970X.FIXEDCurrently I'm pushing 4 cores active on CXXL, memory usage is a steady 2.2GB and I must say the game is snappy as it can be so far!New content from developersVery little content is published by the developer and there is not much new stuff in terms of new housing, maps and blueprints. The variety of games features is heavily dependant on the work in our communityNot fixedHowever, they've implemented workshop -  which translates to a better way of adding mods to your game. Would have liked to see some more content anyway.\nRunning issuesWhile they've improved plenty, there are also many issues here. Some are even newly introduced and others are adopted from back in the previous versions.\n\nLong roads are laggy\nIf you place long stretches of roads, it becomes laggy when you lay new roads intersecting these roads. It stutters a lot but is not unplayable. They should fix this very soon.\n\nBroadcasting\nBroadcasting can introduce some lagg as well, Especially when you try to zone large districts.\n\nMany cities slow trading\nIf you a large amount of cities, it can have a slight effect on the trade menu.\n\nSavegames disapear/crash the game\nI have already experienced savegame corruption and crashes from loading saves. To avoid this, do not use workshop yet. And do not download the community pack yet. There are issues which have deleted my savegames  (or they just disapeard from the load menu). And when I load pre-workshopped saves the game just crashes. This is a must solve as soon as possible..\n\nNEW:\nInstabillities while playing\nIf experienced more instabillities, the game is very laggy when deploying new Metro Systems or other routes for public transport. Once you lay more than 10 stations of metro, and have a few lines running allready, you will start get lags and other issues like problems to move about, long waits while calculations are done.\n\nAnother point here is that it seems they have downtweaked the amount of people using the metro and bus systems, making it harder to maintain traffic flow and forcing you to be really smart when planning ahead for a new metro system. This can of course just be my imagination, but I feel that I need to be more careful now than in previous games.\n\n\nOmnicorp\nOmniCorp trading is just the same as before.\n\nNEW:\nNew content worth mentioningIt's worth mentioning a few of the things new to this game in terms of content. Here are a few things i've come across so far:\n\nFarm plopping\nIt looks to me as if they have tweaked the plopping of farming zones, it is easier to make irregular shaped farms around corners and along the boundries of the areas where farms can be plopped.\n\nTerrain\nTerrain responds better to changes done by development. For example, you will notice that laying out all types of zones in slopes and uneven terrain is easier and you experience less problems with road issues (Where roads cannot be constructed.) This is done by finding alternative paths for them in a more smooth way. I like it this way, makes more sense.\n\nMetro tubes disappears during gameplay\n\nIf you construct tubes with max amount of stations, they will just disappear after a while, leaving only the stations behind and potentionally crushing your infrastructure. This has to be fixed at some stage very soon!\n\n\nConclusionAll in all, the game is a fresh breeze of cold air on a hot summer day.. Still there are a few issues here and there, surely these will be fixed in later patches for THIS game and not for future COMPLETE rewrites of the engine.\n\nFor the TL;DR folks out there, many of the problematic traffic, population and polution issues are solved. And I can confirm that it runs on all my cores and has so far not burned up all my memory (at a stable 2.2GB RAM) I'd buy it.\n\nI give the game a 8/10 in terms of its current state, and 6/10 for the hefty price -  considering the amount of money I have spent on previous broken titles. Owners of  two or more from the same title should have received 75% off of the price.\n\n\nI can warmly recommend this game for newbs to the CXL scene, for you guys who own other games like this, or is saving up for Cities> Skyline, have a look at the myriad of new gameplay>videos and decide for your self - i`d buy it.","February 5, 2015","true","38.0"," 175 of 336 people (52%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","52","175","336","23","13"

The interface, the building tools, the game mechanics all seems the same to me.\n\nWhat's different?\n\n* Allegedly performance does not fall apart so badly in the end game as with Cities XL\n* Some new content\n* Steam Achievements\n* Steam Workshop\n\nPretty sure engine, achievements, and workshop could have been a game update for cities XL, and the new pieces of content could have been DLC for cities XL.\n\nSo why did I buy the same game released under a new name?   Somehow I thought it would be a different game.  Perhaps because it is sold as a different game.   But it seems to just be a port of mostly the same game to a new engine.\n\nWhy would you buy this?\n\n* You don't already own Cities XL and the game is on sale\n* You desperately want the steam achievements and the game is on sale\n* You desperately want the steam workshop support and the game is on sale\n* You desperately want the new content and the game is on sale\n\nEven at the 50% pre-order price offered to those who already owned Cities XL, this seems like a well played con job.\n\nOther developers have demonstrated how to update existing games with additions like steam achievements, 64bit builds, engine updates, additional content, etc..  It's a shame that Focus decided to ignore the good examples set by others, instead  pulling an insulting scam of a strategy out of their rear ends.","February 17, 2015","false","14.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is not much different than the older ones.  The only difference is a slight performance improvement like multi-core support.  However, it is super glitchy! it takes a long time just to even make a block of houses.  The graphics are not any better and while scrolling there is page tearing and graphics problems.  I am also disappointed that they didn't add anything or change the interface so that it has easier navigation.  Another glitch is that the bulldozer will say its locked until you wait a few seconds, then it will finally unlock. The overall game-play has gotten worse!  Truly a disappointment.  This should have been an upgrade to previous editions.  Not a new release.  I hope Focus realizes that they just killed their fan base.  They are truly just trying to milk off whatever fans are left.","February 19, 2015","false","4.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game should have been just a DLC for previous version, Cities XL.\n\nDo not buy this game unless it's your first Cities 'XL' buy and you're desperate for a city simulator, but even then I would not recommend giving your money to a company that would pull this kind of stunt.\n\nWith the exception of a handful of new maps and a couple of different colored buttons, THIS GAME IS EXACTLY AS ITS PREQUEL, Cities XL.  There aren't even any new resources, it's the same four in the exact same system (water, tourism, oil), or even any new inter-city trade options.     A whole lot of things they could have expanded upon or improved on weren't even touched, like the mass transit options, utilities, better control over power grid, etc.\n\nThey didn't even add new road options, though there are a few more maps to build on than previous version.\n\nI think the most advanced thing they added, with the exception of slightly improved graphic performance, is the fact there's a building filter.   Everything else is the same all the way down to how you start your city, 90% of the city utilities, and even many of the building graphics.  Oh, they added a 'shader' to change the lighting effects on the city, too.\n\nBeware after 100,000 people in a city, this game begins to lag significantly.\n\n\nThis is the last prodct I buy from this company.\n\nExtremely disappointed.   Should have just been a packaged update sold for previous version.\n\nThis company should have its product removed from Steam.\n\nIf I could get a refund on this game, I would.","February 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Twice, by the way. The very first version AND the Platinum XL"\n\nThe promised increased frames and decreased bugs and whatnot are nowhere to be found. I'd say the inverse implies, even. The frames do not actually drop, but the game plays somewhat laggy in a relatively smaller town (on a better system than the first Cities XL, that now runs smoother than its grandchild, Cities XXL).\nBugs. Well, can't say too much about this. It's a game that's just been released and with all the games that... *slap*\n- IF IT WERE A NEW GAME!!!! -\n\nHell, even the tooltip in the Windows taskbar still says 'Cities XL'. Forgot this in the copy/paste, guys??\n\nThe only improvement I've seen till now is the clothing of the inhabitants adapting to their living environment. That's not really shouting 'buy me! buy me!' is it???\n\n\n\nI sincerely hope Steam starts allowing refunds, because this game is crap-in-a-box for city-builder fans that have bought the older Cties XL games.\nI'd love to see a similar action to what happened on the Origin game platform, when EA failed to provide us with the promised things in that most recent SimCity game. OK, OK, I know... EA = Origin, so it probably won't happen in Steam's case...\n\nThere's one spark of hope. If you've never had the 'pleasure' of playing one of these guys' games : you need to check it out. It does have a lot of fun factors for new players.

Overall it comes across as having all the ingredients to be the the greatest city building game ever, and If they fixed some of the flaws it would be great, as it is, I just can't recommend it.\n\nI know of the big furore over this game essentially being a poor update on a previously released title "Cities XL", but I never bought those games and cannot judge this game against it; this review will just be of the game on its own and in isolation. If anything my comparison point would be "SimCity 4", because like most people we've all just been crying out for a sequel to that game that has never happened (at least not how we wanted it, looking at you SimCity Societies).\n\nThe Good:\n- You can build a city as pretty as the pictures above, it's all very zen.\n- The music is quite nice and generally the onscreen notifications aren't overwhelming or irritating.\n- Gameplay is fairly intuitive with nicely varied levels of difficulty, especially if you're used to the city building game format.\n- The trading system is balanced meaning specialisation of a city can be done easily, you want to build a tourist paradise or an farming utopia? Knock yourself out, it's a lot of flexibility with how you play.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Poor terrain modification tools, the maps look how they look and you'd better like it.\n- The UI is a little bit clunky, occasionally you'll miss-click things.\n- Zoom out a little bit and all the vehicles turn to weird grey/black boxes on the road. It upsets your zen greatly.\n- I can build individual buildings to a style or I can basically pot-luck it with the city zoning, I can't just set a style of building? You crazy.\n- Roads vs Terrain, being unable to properly terraform the landscape makes this maddening however.\n- The tutorial thinks it's funny.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- This game will crash on you, a lot, regularly.\n- Lag. Laaaaaaaaggggggg.\n\nVerdict:\nIf they got rid of the ugly, you could live with the bad, with both however you end up struggling to play the game, this then magnifies any flaws with the game. Like old Lara Crofts terrible camera angles, or resident evils weird control schemes, you fight with them for a while and then you put the game down and you just never pick it up again.","February 8, 2015","false","9.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For someone who does not own any of the previous games, this can be a great purchase.

Everything else is exactly the same, new content includes but a few utility buildings.\n\nI deeply regret buying this game believing we were finally getting a real improvement on a series that, despite terrible iterations, is at its core a competent and engaging city building and management game.

I dont know where to begin.  I had Cities XL, but never really played it because it just didn't run well when I tried.   I figured that since it was half off and only $20, and everyone said it ran well, I'd give it a shot.\n\nThe first major annoyance is that game doesnt use WASD and is fairly tedious in the controls.  The reactions for zooming and moving seem to have a bit of a lag and it's difficult to actually pinpoint where you want zones, roads, etc because of it.  I'm over the minimum for system requirements although I don't have a super gaming computer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jimmy1805/recommended/313010/","Jimmy1805","Jimmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jimmy1805/","1607 products in account","Swift Response\n\nThe initial response to the latest instalment of this huge city building game from focus interactive has been somewhat negative to say the least, certainly on Steam, you can’t move for cries of “rip off” and the now days inevitable  “Do not buy this game” threads.\n\nThere is an element of validity to some of the criticism levelled at the title, but it needs to be taken in perspective, more on that later.\n\n\nTailor made\n\nSo, for the uninitiated, Cities XXL is a city building game on a huge scale.\nThink Sim City on steroids and you’ll be on the right track.\n\nIn the equally criticised at launch title, Sim City, you were presented with a region in which you could choose a plot of land to found your city, or cities. In Cities XXL you are presented with a whole world to choose from!\n\nWhen you load up the game, you have a spinning globe in front of you with a multitude of vacant spots scattered across the continents, any of which you can select to build on.\nEach spot has its own levels of raw resources (water, arable land, oil etc.) and its own topography.\n\nYou could pick an ocean side setting and build your own tourist capital, gleaming with glamorous hotels and a bustling centre of entertainment.\nYou could choose an inland arable paradise with rolling farmland, nothing to break the sky line apart from the occasional silo stack you decide to drop down.\n\nFrom an Industrial smog filled manufacturing powerhouse to an elitist, country club dwelling hamlet of snobbery, you are not limited at all in what you can create.\n\nBlank Space\n\nOne of the noticeable differences which sets this title apart from its peers are the map sizes.\nThere are no Sim City postage stamp sized maps here; no matter which location you choose to build on, the maps will be huge.\nYou’re going to have space to plan out your city however you want, with multiple industrial, commercial and residential areas and still have room left for some pretty countryside\n\nWonderland\n\nIf you’ve played a city builder before you’re going to be on familiar ground here.\nYou can choose between industrial, commercial and residential zones and their placement in relation to each other is key to keeping everyone happy.\n\nA nice aspect is the ability to choose the population density of each zone, High Density for any potential Sky Scrapers, medium density for multi-story buildings and low density for one or two stories.\n\nYou can also place special themed buildings, beach huts, snowy log cabins etc. Which all help add flavour to the game.\nThere are your usual requirements of water and electricity needs to be met through various power station types and water extraction facilities.\n\nThere is also the really nice touch of being able to add parkland or plazas to fill in any gaps between your buildings and roads, this works like the fill brush in paint, click and it paint trees or slabs across the required area to fill in any gaps.\nI can’t state enough how much this fairly simple mechanic enhances the look of your city.\n\nHighway Don't Care\n\nCities XXL has a plethora of different road types to choose from, from small dirt tracks, through various sized avenues, expressways all the way up to highways. I haven’t encountered as many varied road types in any other game in the genre and it really does add something to the city creation experience.\n\nI Wish You Would\n\nWhat CitiesXXL doesn’t have is a rail network and it is sorely missed.\nWhy they’ve never chosen to incorporate train tracks and stations into the game I don’t know, maybe they’ve felt they had transport covered with all the different road types, but as great as the road choice is, I would have liked the option to have a train or two chugging around my metropolis.\n\nShake It Off\n\nAnother thing that’s missing from Cities XXL that are the disasters, no tornado’s, no alien invasion to level your creation, not even an earthquake to shake your metropolis to ground when you’re board or frustrated with it.\n\nI Knew You Were Trouble\n\nAs I said at the start of this review, there’s a lot of anger out there on the inter-web at the time or writing, Some of which is trolling, but some is justified.\n\nCities XL as a franchise has been around for a while now, it has seen several “updated” releases over the years and this is where most of the anger comes from.\n\nEach new release of the game, Cities XL, Cities XL Platinum, Cities XXL etc. are all essentially the same game.\n\nThey look exactly the same and they play the same but with a few additional buildings added in to try and justify the “new” release and whilst focus often discount the new version for previous owners, they still charge around the £15, $20 mark for what is essentially the previous release with a small content pack added. Understandably this upsets people.\n\nThere has also been a lot of talk about optimisation and the lack of multi core support in previous titles, the game tended to be more than a little laggy once your city grew to a respectable size.\n\nThere's a new game engine this time around and it does seem to run a little smoother for me than it has in previous versions, however, I also have a much more powerful system now than I had when I played the previous version of the game which might have just as much to do with the performance improvement than any engine optimising that has gone on behind the scenes.\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nNEVER PLAYED A CITIES XL TITLE BEFORE?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nPlayers gonna play\n\nViewed as a standalone title, and assuming you do not own any of the previous Cities XL titles, then this is game well worth the entry fee.\nThere is a vast amount of city building fun to be had here, huge maps, huge numbers of varied building types, a nice selection of roads to watch get clogged up with traffic and it’s pretty good looking too.\n\nIf you’re looking for a competent city builder that isn’t Sim City or Skylines then you should ignore the negativity surrounding this game and take the plunge.\nYou’re very own metropolis awaits.\n\nReccomended\n\n--------------------------------------------\nOWN A PREVIOUS CITIES XL TITLE?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nHaters gonna hate\n\nViewed as the next release in the series, Cities XXL does not do nearly enough to justify its price point. If you’ve played the previous titles, you’ve essentially already played this game and If you have any expectation of improved graphics (not that the graphics aren’t great anyway though) or improved game play you are going to be very disappointed.\n\nThere just isn’t enough new content here to warrant a purchase unless you’re a huge fan of the franchise and really can’t live without that extra X in the title.\n\nKeep building in Platinum my friends, there’s nothing new for you to see here.\n\nNot Recommended\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/  )","February 13, 2015","true","7.2"," 30 of 60 people (50%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","50","30","60","10","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalejd/recommended/313010/","dalejd","DaLe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dalejd/","244 products in account","Many if not most of the negative reviews for Cities XXL seem to focus on one of two arguments:\n- an engine upgrade, even tho offering 50% discount to Cities XL version owners, should be a free patch according to some. Surely an interesting topic, especially if one goes by that even on lowest graphical settings a game in its endphase (and rig filling specifications) allegedly didn't uphold a proper game experience and should therefore fix an arguably essential issue for free. Myself I don't remember free nor discounted upgrade e.g. from Windows XP to Windows 7, to name an example of where there was apparently not really addition of features neither, while it was arguably laggy or such with plenty of stuff doing in XP. So such argument sure may seem valid a lot, but it does not really seem a proper review for the Cities XXL version anyhow.\n- and argument about an "either - or" approach, which may be understandable if one wants to point out what may seem a better alternative but in my view doesn't justify a negative review as such. Meaning that just because someone may have more fun with one title surely doesn't mean that every other title of such genre is bad just becuase of that.\n\nAnyhow, Cities XXL review of my own:\n\nOverally, I found the video game Cities XXL to be an enjoyable city building simulation, which offers complexity with not really need for tedious micromanaging (besides issue of that inter-city trading may have been made more streamlined by offering a global pool, but isn't really complicated as is).\n\nVarious resources, possibility to build roads and large zones in different ways or plop individually, demands and desirabilities and population satisfactions (where eventual problems are mentioned with top bar where icons for industries, offices and workforces), plenty large maps in various setting (snow, beach, desert, greenlands), day-night cycle having various times of day with moving shadows and possible to switch inbetween (with moving cycle possible to be turned off), city overlay maps (such as for air or noise pollution, or particular satisfaction, and more), possibility to zoom-in to street level and as if walk around looking around, tutorial, possibilities with mods, all there.\n\nIn terms of performance I can't complain. With a what I would call mid-range rig (multi 3,2GHz (64), GTX 760, and 8GB RAM) and everything set on high I didn't really experience lag, even with city size having more than 10 millions of population. That is that zooming in or out quickly from top to bottom or vice versa did show a fraction of second lag, similarly sometimes on street level looking around, and at night when zooming out it took a moment for all lights to be rendered, but besides such it was fluent all the time. In around 90 hours of gameplay I experienced a few crashes, but such as far as I remember only when leaving a map, which was not much an issue to me since it successfully saved the map before the crash, so no building time lost with it.\n\nAs for gameplay more in detail:\n\nCities XXL offers both sort of career mode for every map as well creative building possibilities straight on, meaning that one can go with starting with low density buildings and have further possibilites unlocked as the city grows in population (recommendable to learn the ropes and mechanics), or simply use in-game option to unlock most buildings straight away, or even called cheat to have e.g. cash added, or even have mod for such.\n\nGame is rather resource rich, ranging based on map limited resources such as water and food, to resources such as heavy industry and workforce split into 4 categories (with each category having housing of their own), which makes it on a larger scale a good idea to develop more than one map with each city specializing and trading with each other. But it is also possible to develop only one map-city while trading as possible and needed with Omnicorp (which is in-game a trading partner having unlimited resources to buy and sell, tho usually at a rate giving 2 resource tokens for 3 resource tokens taken, but also offering easy way to increase cash flow with resources traded from surplus). Specialization also brings possibilities to increase production of commercial resources a lot, meaning that map-total e.g. electricity production can be increased by 40% by placing one building only, which has prequisites to be unlocked. Many a resource usually requires other resources (e.g. heavy and manufacturing industry needs some offices, electricity, water, waste disposal, variously skilled workers, while needing to be near a freight connection such as road connection at map border, freight airport or harbour, and so on), which is why specializations are handy to use especially where the resource production requires upkeep (with every map supporting full specializations of max. two resources). Resources get distributed automatically within a city as long a road connection is there (including water and electricity).\n\nInner-city mass transportation exists but unfortunately has only buses and subways (not counting mods) with no revenue from it (but limiting air pollution and usually decreasing travel time). Having to make those mass transportation lines manually is easy to do but may somewhat seem as micromanaging even tho with bus lines it requires no building of bus stops as in buildings taking up space at roads, and with subways it gives a map view where sub-stops are easily visible.\n\nDesirability factors (especially "quality of life") are important especially with higher tier buildings, such as offices and high-tech industry but also holiday hotels, which unlike business hotels require appropriate landmarks, which on some maps may be the whole coastal area in the beginning but usually require buildings (on maps with holiday resource). So while these things offer additional variety in terms of planning, I found the holiday factor in terms of gameplay rather boring quick tho since it doesn't seem that tourists have any impact whatsoever on retail nor leisure. So while it is easy to make a sort of eye-candy district for holiday hotels with retail and whatnot, in terms of gameplay it isn't really as if connected to each other as far as e.g. holiday hotels and retail is concerned, which is why I myself ended up trading for holidays from Omnicorp.\nWhile it may sound complicated that there are various resources with somewhat different requirements, it easy to keep track of, both in terms of having neat table overviews of which resources are lacking or too much off, but also since if e.g. offices lack business hotels the icon for offices in the top bar will turn yellow or even red with it telling what the issue is if one hovers with mouse over the icon.\n\nAll in all, even tho not having a sort of endless career mode such as in terms of SimCity 4 filling a region map with cities for sake of having a view of a huge metropolis, plenty to do in career mode and even more if one enjoys creative building. Therefore from my side a recommendation for this city building simulator.","April 27","true","92.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Also they need to fix the bug about the game crashing at launch. So many people still having this problem. You can't just ignore it and hope someone else fixes it for you. That's your job.

Multi-core so that you could build your biggest cities ever, improvements galore! Finally the time came to play, I loaded it up and....\nCried. The tutorial is the same as the previous game, the game didn't change at all from what I recalled. I'm glad I didn't pay the full amount and yet I am also ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about what they did. No changes what so ever. Same problems with the cpu and multi-core or lack of. If you don't have the game fine, but they pretty much just screwed with any remaining fans. I won't be buying another game from them.  Sadly this game comes from the same people who made Farming Simulator, a game I love to death. At least the differences between FS 2013 and FS 2015 can be seen and everything. Not so much here. Now I will be really looking at any "New" versions of Farming Simulator with a magnifying glass and WON'T be pre-ordering it like I used to. Probably will even wait until a Steam sale so they don't get as much of my money. How could they do this?  All this  'time spent' on this game here and what to show. Wow!  Money was already tough for me and now I'm out another $20 for the same damn game I had before! Oh well, I'll play this game whenever I decide to, but I won't be buying any more of their games at full price that is for sure.\n\nAnd before anyone says you don't have a powerful enough pc or something:\n\nIntel Xeon E3-1230 v3 @ 3.3GHz 4-core/ 8 threads (intel i7 w/out igpu, server grade cpu)\n16GB DDR3 1600 Ram\nNvidia GTX 770 2GB OC GPU\n120GB SSD Boot\n3TB HDD Games and Misc.\n27" 1920x1080 display\n\nMy other machine is a laptop:\n\nIntel i7 4710HQ 2.5GHz 4-core/ 8-thread\n16GB DDR3 1600 Ram\nNvidia GTX 980M 8GB GDDR5 GPU\n500GB SSD-Boot\n128GB SSD- Blizzard Games\n1TB HDD- Games and Misc.\n17.3" 1920x1080 Display\n\nThese machines can play anything I want them to and play the previous game just fine other than the issues of before.

I'm a big fan of Cities Skylines and I have + 6000 hours on Simcity 2013. I think the devs made a mistake on how they presented Cities XXL. It's not that renewing compared to XL Platinum. However bugs are fixed and the game definetely performs better.\nIn fact Cities XXL is a no-nonsense City builder and you can build really nice big cities. The trade system Omnicorn ha a little bit steep learning curve but is a great feature. The cities you build can trade with each other. The maps are very nice and there are plenty. The graphic setting of the buildings is realistic and the citizens a bit cartoonish.\nI recommend this game and give it a try especially when it's on sale.\n","October 31, 2015","true","143.7"," 31 of 66 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","31","66","4","0"

I like the fact you can choose street options (for example building lay out 2x4 , 2x5 and so on), i like the range of maps and slightly differnt UI.\n\nThe roads can still be a bit of a pain to lay and especially things such as bridges and tunnels and joining avenues to roads and expressways...\n\nI really do enjoy the game, however i feel it can be a bit annoying when objects won't go in a space and the game does not give an indecation of why.\n\nFor me, i only paid £15.00 for this game and it is a lovely step up from XL, but i can see how it for those with the newer versions of XL it feels like nothing has been changed.\n\nMy verdict is if you dont own any of the previous cities games, get this one- It is really good.\nIf you own XL (original) or older and you can get this at a good discounted price (like £15.00) go for it :)\nBut if you have the newer ones, it may not be worth it...\n","February 11, 2015","true","11.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

Large cities in XL were impossible to play even with two processors and decent graphics cards as there was no multi-core support.  The fact they are offering a 50% discount to owners of Cities XL makes upgrading worthwhile, just don’t expect much in terms of added content.  I have also noticed no bugs to speak of.  The game engine alone makes Cities XXL worthwhile as it makes the game far more enjoyable to play.  Don’t get me wrong, Cities XXL is the way Cities XL should have been after a patch.","October 30, 2015","true","8.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Having played this, Cities Skylines and Sim City (all of them) I can say they all kind of blur into each other and not one is perfect.\nMost of the negativity towards this game stems from the fact it is not much (if any) of an upgrade from Cities XL. I agree that it is not much of an upgrade. But that does not make the game bad it just means at the cost it's a bit disappointing (but still not bad) but if you don't have a previous version that negativity is void.\nThe second thing that has also been complained about is the performance once the city starts to get larger. Well my quantum computer suffers none of this, and Skynot AI said "Any more complaints and I'm going to remove humanity" Has anyone looked at the interconnected complexity of any of these games?? most games when you are playing them have nothing going on when you are not in that area so of course they don't suffer this issue. BTW all the Sim City style games suffer this issue to some degree. It's more program than you can handle ;-)\nA few notes on the BIG 3\nIf you want the best graphics, smoothest gameplay, smallest city, lacking mod support get Sim City (5 aka 2013 aka EA why oh why) it's not terrible but it could have been the one!\nIf you want the most options to select where you want to build in the world get Cities XXL\nBut if you want the game with the most mods get Cities Skylines (what I think is the best allrounder)\nBTW the hours recorded by Steam is not even close.\n","October 30, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

It recieved alot of harsh comments but all of them seem to be from people who were expecting some massive change from thier XL content. I have never owned Cities XL so I can say this XXL version is well worth the purchase. I love the global overview off the starts that allows me to basically build several citites on a continent and attempt to balance economies by trading between them. Its adictive...I find myself spending an hour or more on each city of mine daily to increase population and balance trade. No bugs or lag issues to speak of. I have a solid 30fps at all times even when conducting long roadway placements. One week in and I've got 4 cities up to 300,000 and each has a market niche to generate revenue. Once you find what your city excels at you can either trade to the game 'OMNICORP' for cash flow or use it to balance your other cities shortcomings. Stratigic thinking, decent graphics, larg scale cities & global economies make this a big winner in my book.","February 20, 2015","true","34.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

I've had issues before and after the patches. When I was actually able to play once, it seems the UI was changed, some buildings were added, and the soundtrack was changed. For those of us who've played at least one version of the Cities XL franchise; then you will be dismayed. I haven't played since Cities XL '11 but then bought Platinum during Steam's great Christmas sale; i see I haven't missed much. It's good to see the same bugs from the very first Cities XL ('09) welcome me yet again.\n\n\nThose new to Cities XL will probably like the game as I'm guessing those are the only "recommended" clicks. Sadly for those of us looking for a great Cities XL version will just say," oh well" to this.\n\nFor those who say, go thru modding; nope. I like to play the game and add whatever DLC I chose and I like expansions. Also, for those who think I'm a paid employee of Maxis (R.I.P.)/EA or Collosal Order and Paradox; NO on all accounts.\n\nCities: Skylines, while not perfect is a great addition to the city building genre. Hopefully Cities XL will get better. I would love to see an ultimate city building game where Cities Skylines, Cities in Motion 1+2, Simcity (2013), and Cities XL are combined.","March 15, 2015","false","3.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Not going to happen now i dont think.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/cxnjohn for later ref.\n\n\nEDIT:-\n\nThey have said via their forums that there will be free DLC for people who got the game pre order, so this is positive, they also recognise that people were expecting more from the "new" game not just what appears to be the same game with a new UI.\n\nNOTE:-\n\nIf anyone intends to use game footage on YouTube do not have the game music playing, your video will get a copy right claim against it, the vide of mine above has, so any future videos will be missing the game music.","February 12, 2015","true","24.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

The biggest selling point for me was, i got it for 50% off, the maps are massive and Steam workshop is intergrated now.\n\nThough It's clear that not much is different and it has enraged an entire population of steam consumers who wanted something new and if you want a completley new game, don't bother.\n\nBuy this game for it's size and Steam Workshop, the devs are clearly supporting the modding community with this one and if things continue to go forward, like it has, this will be one of those titles that really benefits from the fans and the developers support of the fans.\n\nI have not experienced any issues with this game and definitely none of this lag that some people are reporting.\n\nCities XXL is a game about creating epic cityscapes that span what seems like entire continents. I love how everything comes together and exploring the city you have created is so rewarding, especially when you get down to the street level. Obviously having a powerful rig helps in this case and it is worth having one, just to experience it.\n\nFor those of you who would like refunds, it's too late. This game needs to be played with an open mind, the maps are huge and varied, which all offer a very diverse set of challenges. The game engine has been improved and the detail that shines from your monitor is glorious to look at.\n\nThis may look like Cities XL of old but if you just give it a chance and embrace the community around it, you will enjoy your time playing this. If you want a new game with the ability to micromanage every small detail of the cities execution find something else. Let the vast environments of XXL suck you in and just enjoy it, i do.\n\nLastley i would like to add the following point. People are calling this a glorified patch for $20 but let's just agree to say it is and it would seem like a massive rip-off to all consumers to pay for a patch. Now, just think about every new game these days, they offer season passess for atleast $25 and map packs/skins new characters etc, some of which are extras outside the season pass inclusions. With this $20 patch, you get a new game engine, maps, challenges, buildings and workshop support, additionally whatever they decide to add later and it won't cost you anymore then $20. For a game to be released at such a low price and not even ask for a single cent more for content, you really can't beat that logic.\n\nNb. i am expecting alot of hate for enjoying this game, i challenge those to just play it for a couple hours, you will like it.","February 13, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Now they are selling a patch for £15. I pre-ordered it with all my excitement and so much expectations. Soon it became my ultimate regret of buying Cities XXL when I read all the negative reviews on the launch day - I thought I would never download this game.\n\nHowever, it is obvious that no matter how people complain about Cities XXL, there will be refund from nobody, no party, no cats or rats. So I finally decided to give it a try - I paid bloody £15 for it! Now after 40 hrs play, I would say, they do patch the performance issues - that's just saying the multi-threading issue - yet millions of others are left undone!\n\n------------------------\nCalming down:\n\nThere are thousands ways of making a new game over an old one.\n\nI have some knowledge about multi-threading and that is TBH nothing near complex - it is way too complex, and I can see that your effort on multi-threading has worked very well, but not been paid off. You can't simply ignore the remaining performance issues, such as memory leak, laggy zoning, laggy road placing, mysterious disappearance of metro/bus lines etc.\n\nPeople are complainng about seeing no change. It is SEEING no change. Can't you just make a better UI rather than changing colour schemes? Plus I don't like the current UI; check what Cities Skylines has shown us; Sim City 5 has a nicer UI as well.\n\n--------------------\nSober thoughts:\n\nThe game still looks OK. I can't say I am 100% admiring the graphics but I think it's reasonably good. The progression and contents are quite satisfying. Tokens and blueprints are very good endgame ideas.  BGM is a big thumb up! I absolutely enjoyed the main theme Sun Sleeper and many others.\n\nComparing with Sim City 5, I wouldn't think Sim City 5 is any superior to Cities XXL apart from its graphics and UI. Sim City 5 had a lot weird AI and agents-related issues which harassed me a lot and finally kept me away from the game, while I don't see these issues in Cities XL/XXL, which is super good! And I guess this is the reason persuaded me to play this game, although I have already developed so much hatred towards the game developer.\n\nMonths and months have passed since I left Sim City 5, you can't imaging much I would like to play a good city simulation game. When I saw Cities XXL offering such a generous discount, I clicked the purchase button with no hesitation and I even recommended this game to my friends. Now you presented me with a game that is still full of bugs and visually unchanged from Cities XL.\n\n--------------------\nFair scores (out of 10):\n\nGraphics: 6\n- variation in models is great, but the quality is bad.\n\nMusic: 9.5\n- bgms are being played repeatedly now.\n\nGame Content: 8\n- enjoyable contents.\n\nAgent AI: 8\n- no serious issues. I love my citizens.\n\nPerformance: 5\n- bugs are everywhere, please fix them.\n\nOVERALL: 7.5\n- it's OK.\n\n\n----------------------\nCan I still recommend this game to others? No to anybody who has already had Cities XL. Yes to anybody who wants to play a city simmulation game.","March 17, 2015","true","50.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Overall gameplay is better than the new SimCity...\n- hold on to more mods. I'm testing them out from my 2012 version, most of them make the game crash.\n- when it gets the Realistic Highway mod. That should be standard by now...\n\nSide note - running fine under Windows 8.1 on bootcamp (iMac with crappy Intel Iris Pro 5200, max settings). But the game lags when building... smooth when just viewing and walking around... haven't made a ginormous city yet, so can't tell if it keeps its FPS high on max settings...","February 5, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsmichaelnow/recommended/313010/","thatsmichaelnow","The CroMinion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsmichaelnow/","59 products in account","My Personal Review of Cities XXL\n\nFirst off, I put less than 2 hours playing CXLPlatnium, (which I did get on a deep discount), because of it's cam controls. Being able to get the latest version CXXL on a deep discount was a sweet bonus. I was hoping for a cam controls fix or at the very least, a place to adjust the sensitivity of the mouse movement. In spite of the cam controls, I spent no less than 22 hours straight playing once it was finished installing.\n\nAn immediate reloading of the game from a shut down seems to bring about a downloading of data for the game each and every time it is re-loaded directly after shutting the game down (still looking into this). So, game re-load time is a bit slow. The cam controls are just the same as in CXL but I've decided to just do my best at learning to manipulate the cam and adjust to the super sensitivity of it. Alternatively, there are key commands that can be used to control the camming as well. During the first 20 hours of play, not once did the game ever crash on me. Kudos to the devs for that man. Not withstanding that at the time of posting this review, I found this tip posted by my good gamer buddy Monterico at http://youtu.be/HQgg1S2OgBI\n\nNow while I've not put hardly any time into the previous version, there are at least 3 noticeable differences between CXL and CXXL: 1. A whole new interface. Getting use to it was not difficult at all. 2. Adjustable sky options which act sort of like mood filters. The Rainbow and Black Storm are my favorites already. 3. New Maps. Oh yes, the maps are freaking huge and there are some new ones albeit I do not know at the moment which ones they are exactly. In any case, if you didn't like small map sizes in previous city building games, you'll spend a lot of time trying to fill up a map in CXXL.\n\nA sinde note here is that of the first 22 hours of game play, it never once crashed on me.\n\nThe fact that I spent 22 hours straight playing this latest version should tell you a lot about my first impressions of the game. I love being creative but prefer low impact games due to my failing health issues. Use to love shooter games but now, I just like a game I can play while laid back. I was asked often last night while streaming my game play, "So is it better than SimCity?" To answer that in a nutshell, no, it is just another city builder style game. Big maps or small, I don't care about that and find that some of the gaming community is a little to stuck up and demanding when it comes to what "they" think should or should not be in a game of this style. I enjoyed SimCity a lot and the multi-player online feature was what made the the latest version so much fun. While CXXL does not have multi-player, the shear sizes of the maps should keep me busy for a very long while till "No Mans Sky" (the next game I am holding out for) is released at which time you may find my solely playing that exclusively if not permanently. Until then, sorry Maxis/EA, you just lost a loyal fan till you can come out with a bigger, better SimCity. :p\n\nI wonder how long it will take to even try to fill up a full map in CXXL. Guess well have to wait and see. Looks like I might have to go after the 10 million population achievment at least.","February 7, 2015","true","68.0"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","13","30","3","0"

If you're not a fan and you're expecting something brand new, stay away.\n\nIf you've played Cities XL, then you've played Cities XXL. This shouldn't have been a new game, this feels more like a fix for all the bugs that plagued Cities XL, but instead they introduced it as a brand new game.\n\nPros:\n- Supports Steam Workshop now (YAY!)\n- No more memory leak like in Cities XL (that I can tell so far...)\n- Game runs a bit smoother than its predecesor.\n- Sky box leads to very pretty screenshots of the city.\n- New buildings and offers more in terms of environment and countering pollution.\n\nCons:\n- It's still buggy, and still lags when the city population gets too high.\n- It feels like it should've been an update to Cities XL.\n- A handful of new buildings and fixed bugs doesn't make a new game, not really.\n\nDo I recommend this game based on what I see purely upfront? No, I really shouldn't. However, consider Cities XL and all its bugs. Most of it wasn't fixed with a simple patch because the issue lay with the core engine. Focus Home decided to tackle the engine problems and release the improvements at Cities XXL. As a city-building sim fan at heart, buying this at $20 was like buying really expensive DLC content. Is it worth it at full price? Not really. Why do I recommend this then? Because at the end of the day I still think this is a better game than Simcity.","February 10, 2015","true","15.8"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","12","28","2","0"

There are videos showing that there is a large amount of lag while actively tracing out large zones. I can confirm that this does happen, but it's not even remotely game breaking. As soon as the zone is drawn out and confirmed, the lag disappears. If you did nothing but build a city using this tracing tool and traced out only zones of a size that create significant lag, you'd likely fill the map in a matter of minutes. It's not something that many people are going to do and would defeat any sense of city planning.\n\nA second problem that people are complaining about is that the game appears to use only one core (CPU0). I have no idea why this is the case, but it simply appears to be a load-balancing issue on game startup and does not affect game play. The other cores are used, but for some reason CPU0 is favored. After the game is running, you can prevent the game from using CPU0, then allow it to use CPU0 again and from that point on it will evenly distrubute processing on all cores. Again, there is no noticeable difference in the game before or after this process.\n\nOverall, I like this game. I don't think the simulation algorithms are as complete as SimCity4, but I haven't checked out all the mods for Platinum and there aren't enough mods in Workshop yet for XXL. From what I've read, Platinum had quite a few mods that dramatically improved gameplay and improved simulation. Perhaps with time these will be brought over into Workshop and improved. As far as graphics and being able to lay out unique city styles/shapes, it certainly is better than what SimCity4 offers.\n\nAs far as the company Focus goes, I think they did some things to earn their reputation reflected in the reviews for this game. This version of Cities is a step in the right direction, but the effort to enable multicore processing should have been made 2 years ago after they took over development from Monte Cristo. As for those giving negative reviews and outright lying in the review (especially about multicore processing and lag), they need to move on with their lives.\n\nOverall, for someone new to the series, I recommend this game. For those that are angry over past releases, this will be the game you should have received 2 years ago.","February 8, 2015","true","39.6"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"

While I do agree that Cities Skylines is a better city simulator OVERALL than Cities XXL, the buildings and structures in Cities XXL looks way better and much more realistic to me than the buildings in Cities Skylines. When you are down at ground level simply looking around, down the street and/or across the way,etc. Cities XXL is a better experience in my opinion. I therefore play both and would recommend this game to anyone truly interested in ALL aspects of city building simulation - especially if you don't already own Cities XL.","March 23, 2015","true","19.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","0"

(Cool mods out there, visit this link http://xlnation.city/ Playing mods are more better :) )\n- Pedestrian walking with styles (base on how they live in unskilled, skilled, executives, and elites)\n- Many landmarks in real life.\n- Can see pedestrian do in outside buildings. (Like beach, Stadium, and football field, go-kart, and etc)\n- Make more populations with unlock many options building. (Like on scenario campaign)\n- Have winter theme world and in snow buildings. (I like this)\n- It combines all previous Cities XL series in one game. (If you not have own previous Cities XL, this game is for you)\n- Can be trades resources in another regions. (If you have two worlds or more on earth)\n- Have cheat options such as add cash, unlock buildings, and more. ( still you get achievement if you play cheat :P )\n- Many more\n- I have upload a video about my gameplay 'Cities of Kuala Lumpur Malaysia' in Youtube, better watch it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QA8u92LdFqI\n\nNotes: Buy this game when on discount, it very worth it and cheapest and also you will like it.

They're a cross between the odd social strata-juggling of the series' originator, City Life, and the more familiar 'build it and they will come' of the Sim City games, with the emphasis more on the building than the social stuff. That still remains an important core mechanic of the game though, so if you're looking for a city-builder with a bit more emphasis on the link between population and urban growth, Cities XXL is the one to get.\n\nIf you've never played any of the Cities games before, this is the place to start, if for no other reason than that it's a technologically much smoother, more stable ride than its predecessors. If you already have a Cities X game, then you'll have to decide for yourself if it's worth the money (there's a discount for previous owners). XXL is currently the best representative of the series, and an excellent alternative to the Maxis games.","February 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the haters. It's less 'gamey'than Simcity 5, less trendy than Skylines, but its visuals and organisation are superb. It's 3d.  BTW I've played its predecessors a lot. Eventually gave up on them to try something new and am soo glad I have now come back to CIties XXL. It's a relief after all the hyped up other games. This one's honest and beautiful. Of course it can still be imrpoved, but that's what they're slowly doing. Like a wordprocessor gradually evolves and improves - eventually beyond recognition - so does Cities. Each step is small, but important. With all those haters it makes me wonder: are they just jumping on the poppy bandwagon, or are they paid by a big company/competitor, or are they just being trendy i&*^ts?","June 25, 2015","true","32.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

The exact building is a must. EX. Clicking on a residence shows need for education, open menu to schools and they have yellow and green borders around them. That means....er...um.. idk so I place the green one(10-18yr old) on an adjacent block wait a few ticks....nope, must be the yellow one(elementary), place it too right next to it, Wait a few ticks...nope. open menu again and see there isn't anything left but a school that is 10-14yr old and not 10-18yr old and place it and bam they are happy. What?...\nRetail is broken the same way. Demand is huge groceries but if you place a zone the game will put down a bar. Place a whole block and it will put a shopping mall, bar, and everything else but groceries, then commerce will start to go OOB because to much retail. No problem I'll sell excess to Omnicorp....oh wait they don't buy retail. SO a huge block of commercial next to residence and still dissatisfied cause they want a grocery store. Now you can manually place a grocery store, but you can only guess at what specific building they want by plopping down ...test ...destroy, plop down different one....test.\nHi-tech says it uses waste, but in fact it uses the resource of waste removal, so it produces waste...er no cause if the waste removal resource is used up, they just go bankrupt.\n\nSize of fields do not equate to product produced. Ex. 30x30 forest vs a 4x4 park. Yes the 4x4 park @ 5k per tick reduces pollution better. So how about a 6x6 park? Nope, does nothing. Garbage dump 4x4 costs the same as one 10x10 and produces the same er... rids the same amount of waste and produces less pollution.\n\nBus and Subways are designed so segregation of class blocks are the only cost effective way to use.\n\nMemory leak is still an issue, runs fine for a couple of hours post 500k, but then just gets worse until close and restart. Still not as bad as XL.\n\nFactories have to be placed at borders next to city connections or they will pollute and destroy your city and not be profitable for the lack of freight. They did add making building E+ friendly, but hardly ever stays when you switch from one city to the other. (there is a workshop fix, but that is not what I am reviewing)\n\nIf you are going to buy and play this game, a pre-fab computer from Best Buy will not cut it. You need quality parts not new parts. The pc I use is 6 years old home build. Yes VISTA was brand new at the time. I play a lot of different games and have no issues at max settings.\nAMD Phenom II x4 955\nRadeon HD6870\n8G ram\nWin 7 pro (blu ray playback forced the upgrade)\nNothing special by today's standards, but runs game fine for hours.\n\nI'm not going to mention the UI, it is bad but there are other reviews that beat that horse to death.\n\nRecomend? Yes and no. On sale for $10 and you don't have XL, yes. Full price or already played XL, no.","February 13, 2015","true","251.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Performance is way better, and by that I mean that it doesn't laaaaag after a city gets larger or after playing for a few hours. I know this because I did beta testing and I have hundreds and hundreds of hours playing Cities XL 2012 version. That laaag the previous versions had made a lot of people give up after reaching a certain population / city size. All that is now gone.\n\nIf you played any previous version and liked it then you will love this one.\n\nIf you are a new player and want a great city builder/planner that looks great and has large maps (11x11km) then look no further.\n\nThe game by it self is fun for some time. Like any other city builder you will get bored after making a few cities. That is the case in any Sim City game as well.\nBUT!\nThankfully the game has a great modding community which took this game to a whole new level.\nSo you will never get bored because existing mods and new ones coming out on a regular basis will keep you hooked for a long time.\nThere is a great comunnity forum that you just must check out:\nwww.xlnation.city\n\nDon't listen to the trolls saying the game is not better, it's the same as before etc. etc.\nLike I said I have hundreds of hours in previous versions and this one is extremely improved. Yes it is the same in many ways which is a good thing considering that old mods will be compatible.\n\n- It now spreads the workload of the game across all cores of the processor which makes it run smoother when the city gets larger. Is it true multicore or not doesn't really matter as long as the performance is better, and it is.\n- It now has DirectX 11 support\n- They added the workshop option\n- Now you can use fbx format to make mods\n- They added eco green upgrades for Heavy industry and Manufacturing buildings. Upgraded buildings produce much less polution.\n- It has some new transportation options (new park & ride bus system, new cargo airport)\n- New leisure buildings (including a large leisure airport, speed boat marina and a yacht marina)\n- New skyboxes to choose from (with clouds)\n- New parks\n- New polution reducing/enviroment improving buildings\n- New camera (just hit 'C' on the keyboard and use page up, page down / arrow keys / Ctrl button to move around)\n\nAll in all this is a great game if you want to have FUN making/designing your dream city be it modern american style city or an older looking european city or even an asian style city. Or maybe all of those on a single map. The possibilites, specially if you use mods, are endless.","February 8, 2015","true","75.3"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","6","18","0","0"

It's a mixed feeling at first because it starts out slow. I still would buy if it was released today though.\n\nI like that the cities are large (not like Simcity), but size isn't everything.. The game needs to be fun. The cities seem to run well so far, the Steam workshop is a very nice feature and will continue to grow, some added buildings, like the bridges/road options, freeways, etc. Zooming in and seeing things in more detail is nice, clicking a car and seeing things from that cars perspective going through the city is nice. I also want to mention that there are some cool building options.. I just noticed I can place certain restaurants, a night club, etc. There are a lot of cool new buildings that you can select and place; this is in addition to the standard ones that develop in zones. These extra buildings are growing on me, and really could help make this game much more enjoyable for me.\n\nThere are tutorials in the beginning menu, and I suspect most people have not even looked at them. I am going through some of them now, and they are very nice. There also is a hidden menu on the right that shows more detailed information like traffic areas on the map, satisfaction, etc. If you hover your mouse way to the far right of the sceen the extra options come up; this is in addition the menu options of top of the screen..\n\nAs the city gets larger it becomes more of a joy to play.. I am enjoying setting up the transportation system, seeing the city expand, demand change, etc.\n\nThings I don't like include the buildings don't develop like in Simcity which to me is a big deal (at least it was for me when I first started playing), the city progression starts out really slow (demand for goods seems to stay pretty low for a while which I think is where some people lose interest, but it gets a lot funner soon after), and the graphics/buildings aren't all that exciting to me (it is growing on me though like I mentioned in regards to the specialized buildings). Trade/manufacturing chains are to simplistic. .\n\nI'd say if you want a large city builder this could keep you entertained, but shouldn't be the only city builder in your aresenal imo. City Skylines looks like it will be good as well, Simcity was nice from the manufacturing/trading standpoint and it was fun, but small maps. If it were me and I either liked Cities XL but wanted better performance, or you like city builders in general I'd pick this up. I will say that we also live in an 'instant gratification' world, and 1 hour of gameplay isn't going to do it for those people; so expect to see the enjoyment increase as the cities grow.\n\nI will say I haven't developed a 'huge' city yet mostly because it starts out really slow, but I am now enjoying this game and see myself playing this more.","February 9, 2015","true","14.7"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","6","18","2","0"

Unfortunately the opinions of players has been mixed at best. So is Cities XXL better than Cities XL or worse in every way? We have heard people say this is just a re-branding of an old game, so we decided to find out for ourselves.\n\nCities XL first launched in 2009 and was a spiritual successor to City Life. The game offered expansive landscapes in which to build your dream city along with online capabilities (long before SimCity). However this did not live up to expectations, the online was a flop, the game suffered from poor optimization such as only using one core on multi-core systems and various memory leaks. Despite this, fans of the series have remained loyal. Despite its faults, Cities XL has offered a very fluid and flexible city building game.\n\nWhen Cities XXL was announced, it was detailed to have an all new engine, more low-level micro-management and various improvements including to performance. These alone should make it a worthy upgrade or entry point for a budding city builder.\n\nWell the first thing we questioned is the games engine. It is possible this is a new engine under the hood, but on the surface it looks very much the same engine as before. Graphically the game looks the same, albeit with a new black UI. The controls work much the same way and the menus are largely the same. So on the surface at least, the engine seems to have been tweaked rather than fully re-worked from the ground up.\n\nPerformance wise, this game is far better. Our city of 425k inhabitants is still as smooth as when we started. In Cities XL Platinum, a similar sized city we had suffered from terrible frame rates and choppiness at this point. The UI is also more responsive than before. We did encounter some minor graphical glitches, mostly that at night, streetlights would illuminate a grid beneath them. But nothing game breaking.\n\nThere are some new buildings to place in your city, like a pollution sensor and an eco-car dealer. There are not enough with too little function to add much weight behind a new game release, but welcome additions.\n\nTalking of pollution, this has been greatly tweaked and works more the way you would expect. It makes more sense than ever before to ensure your industry is far from residential areas, where as before it was more of a case of “Does City have Heavy Pollution? Yes, City becomes polluted everywhere quickly”.\n\nWhat we found most disappointing is there is not much of the low-level micro-management that was promised. What sets the Cities XL/XXL series apart from the SimCity series is the latter focuses much more on micro management and is more organic. In SimCity you say where you want residential, commercial and industrial areas, then depending on the desirability of the area would dictate what would be built there. This would not be static, you could have a luxury hi-rise apartment, but if crime in the area goes up this may become abandoned becoming an eyesore on your landscape. Cities XL/XXL cities generally remain the same, you will not find one neighborhood going from being desirable for Elites to suddenly becoming deserted.\n\nDespite this short coming, one major addition that will help over time to make the Cities XXL the city building game we have been waiting for is the inclusion of the Steam Workshop. I really look forward to seeing the modding community making new buildings, new functions, improvements, fixes and potentially new functionality.\n\nIf you are a fan of the series, the current 50% discount off the price is very reasonable. Even not as a full game but £15 as a kind of expansion is not bad value. If you’ve never owned a game in this series and you want large sprawling cities rather than the small towns in SimCity then this is a game well worth picking up.","February 8, 2015","true","10.3"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","4","14","0","0"

If you are expecting this to be a brand spanking new engine full of bells and whistles, I feel you may see this as a sore disappointment, however if, like me, you were hoping for the trend of steady improvement, that the developer has demonstrated before, along with apparently the same dedication to community created content found on sites like XLNATION, then I would hope you will be pleased with a product that does not break from tradition and only polishes what is essentially a very, by now , competent city sim, with 1000s of models, both official and custom content, to create your dream city. I also must add that in contradiction to many games nowadays on release, it DOES actually function, and is not a black hole of broken promises. It is not a game for everyone I realise, but if you like other games in the series, I cant believe you wouldnt like this one. It is not a game which holds your hand through the process, it gives back what you put in, and any person who has the interest in design, city management, or who loved ant farms as a nipper should try this out.","February 8, 2015","true","76.5"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","2","10","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakle23/recommended/313010/","jakle23","Hooch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakle23/","105 products in account","Disclaimer:  I have never played Cities XL or any other Cities game, so this is my impression as someone who is new to the franchise (not city builders though)\n\nRating as stands: 8/10\n\nI have been excited about this game coming out for a while now as SimCity even after the release fixes still left most of us wanting to build a truly epic city not constrained by such a small map.  The title XXL is definitely well earned, these maps are huge!  Even the ones which have decent water coverage are still much bigger than even the all land maps of SimCity.  Cities XXL has some very similar mechanics to SimCity such as having three different types of zoning: residential, commercial, and industrial.  In this regard however it shares more in common with SimCity 4, where you customized what zones were low, medium, and high density rather than road size doing that for you (which is how the latest SimCity is).  Here you will also pick which commercial zones are for industrial, high tech, office, etc. rather than your cities population dictating such as having your factories converting to high tech jobs due to high education.  This makes it easier to plan your city and insure you have enough workers to fill your jobs.  There are four classes of residents in this game: unskilled, skilled, executive, and elites.  As you go up the affluence curve you are expected to provide more and better services.  I really enjoy the way you place the zones, you can do a simple grid but for more variety I use the free form which places small roads to make it look like a real neighborhood.  In SimCity I was always forced to make a rigid grid just to maximize space whereas here that is something I have only used for downtown since I still have tons of room to expand outward.  I also really enjoy the background music, it is well done and has pleasant melodies.  Consists mostly of relaxed indie-style and electronica (a couple songs remind me of Gramatik).  If those aren’t two genres you like I wouldn’t worry about it as the music does not overpower the game/gameplay.  Its only shortcoming is that there aren’t a ton of songs which I mention only because updates and DLC generally don’t look to add new background music so this might be it.  There are a lot of options for managing your city from trade to transportation.  It reminds me some of the options in Banished (great city builder game although it is more of a village/town builder).  I consistently found myself thinking small due to playing SimCity so much, and would micromanage a small area of maybe a few city blocks rather than pushing outward.  The maps are simply huge comparatively.\n\nIt isn’t all perfect though, one of the first things I noticed were how awkward curved roads looked.  They basically look like a lot short straight roads (think of an octagon versus a circle).  Another issue with the roads is how TEDIOUS it is to upgrade them.  It’s no better than SimCity! Worse if you consider how big the maps are and how long it will take to click on each road!  You are basically better off deleting the road, but then sometimes you cannot place a road of the same size because it keeps saying there are buildings in the way.  I also cannot for the life of me understand why they chose the color scheme for the city information UI (black text on a dark gray window?!).  I haven’t gotten to a truly massive city yet, but it is worth noting that I read Cities XL had some big problems with cities of a couple million citizens (or more) grinding your computer to a halt and crashing regardless of your hardware.  It runs very smooth for me and I have not heard of this problem occurring in this game.  Additionally, while the city certainly shows sign of life with pedestiran and vehicle traffic, there arent any of the animations you'll be used to from SimCity.  A couple times my city outgrew my police force but I never saw (or heard) any crime or saw police cars rushing around the city.  Similar for healthcare and fire services: never saw an ambulance or a fire (or even a fire truck).  Maybe my citizens are all lawful, healthy, and flame retardant?\n\nIn all if you like city builders and was disappointed in the overall lack of size of SimCity I would recommend this.  It is unfortunate that EA did publish something more like this, but this is a great example of the free market: make what the people want or someone else will.","February 6, 2015","true","13.4"," 19 of 46 people (41%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","41","19","46","6","0"

Because of how poorly optimized the last Cities games were, people began developing some sort of bias that any future Cities game will always be bad. That's not the case here, anymore.\n\nCities XXL is actually a big improvement from Cities XL 2012.\n\nI remember getting CXL12 back in 2013, and that was sort of my replacement for the awful SimCity game. Originally, I thought it was pretty cool. I made over 20 cities in a span of 5 months, but that's not the point. The game was no longer stable by the time my city was as big as a quarter of the map, and that's not good, of course. After a year-long hiatus from the game, I've wanted to play it again, but it's not even playable anymore. The game would randomly crash every 15 minutes or so, and that was very bothersome, and the game couldn't go above 30 fps, and it basically became a slideshow. CXL12 was ruined for me.\n\nBut that was when I realized that I could get CXXL for a 50% discount. I've looked on their website and it says that they've improved their engine, which would make the game run faster. Being a customer of Focus for over 10 years, I knew they wouldn't lie to me, so on the day my father gave me a $50 Steam gift card, that was the first thing I bought with it.\n\nI began playing the game now and wow, they really weren't lying. There was definitely some improvements to the game's engine. Of course it still goes crazy after about 10 million residents, but remember, this engine is based off of a 2005 game engine that can only use one core, which is pretty impressive if that's true. My game was able to stay at a stable 60 fps even with a million residents, and so far, no crashes yet!\n\nThis proves once again that a terrible video game franchise CAN become good if problems are fixed. I recommend this game to anyone.","March 5","true","3.3"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

I love City builders and this game in all its versions has sersiously frustrated me. It's a good game but just as you get going in the previous versions it would lag to an unplayable state.\n\nThat being said, I want to note a few things for people that are considering buying this for first time as well as upgrading.\n\n1) So far im well past population where issues start occuring in the old version and I have flawless performance. So the folks on here and youtube that are stating there is no performance increase I'm calling BS.\n\n2) It's a GREAT City builder that got a bad rep because of past versions performance issues (this HAS been fixed)\n\nNow on to a few points concerning the company.\nDo I think they are shady and does it anger me that I had to pay 20 bucks for a patch? Yes\nIs this the same game reskinned? Yes\nIs it a bad game? NO\n\nThe people raging on Steam are simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off that this isn't a new game. I watched the trailers and any people that has played the previous games would know by looking at the trailers that it was the same game. What do you expect? They have released 3 "new versions" that were literally the same game. I didnt expect any less. I just wanted the performance fixed so I could enjoy the damn game for what it was and unfortunately I was forced to pay $20 to do so.\n\nFocus you should be ASHAMED for treating your players like that.\n\nThey said a long time ago that the game needed to be rebuilt to get multicore support and maybe thats how the justified the "new game" this time. But its the same game WITH MULTICORE. People are saying there is no multicore support when indeed there is you can see it in your CPU monitor.\n\nIs it even across all cores? No, but it works and it runs great.\n\nSo take the complaining with a grain of salt. A lot of people expected something different when the trailers clearly showed the same damn game and anyone that spent any time in XL knows it.\n\nThanks and I hope this helps you buy or not buy the game. As for me, I am enjoying it and going to recommend it based on the fact I got it @ 50% off (still a ♥♥♥♥ off) and I am actually able to play it again. Also going to up vote to help counter the RAGE reviews.\n\nI want to DOWN vote it based on Focus being a slimy money grubbing company that treats their gamers like crap.","February 7, 2015","true","38.3"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"

I find myself much more immersed in this game than I am in any recent version of Sim City. The framerate chugs a bit when laying roads or residential zones, and the overlays for power, water, waste, and fuel could use a little work, but overall this is a big city builder/manager that is a lot of fun!\n\nCompared to the most recent Sim City (and all Sim City's for that matter), there seems to be less focus on things like utilities, police, fire, health, and education, but a much larger focus on managing unemployment rates and happiness levels. Happiness is affected by unemployment rates, utilities, police, fire, health, and education, so I guess it all comes together in the end. It's obvious that the primary purpose of the game is to grow as big as possible, and keep everybody content while doing it. Not a bad thing. I find myself wanting and trying and succeeding in getting bigger, before I am forced to try and catch up with my citizens by building luxury buildings to give them something to do, upgrading/rebuilding roads to handle the increase in volume, and trading with an NPC AI to help cover my shortcomings.\n\nAnd I'm having a blast doing it!\n\nBased on the size of the map when I zoom out completely, my city of 150,000 people, with a land area similar to that of an entire Sim City plot, is maybe a little less than one-fifth of the total area I can build upon. And I'm pretty spread out. For those who like to build one massive city, welcome home.\n\nIf you are new to the series, I highly recommend this game. I understand why all of you fans of the Cities series are so upset. But for someone with no expectations, it seems to be well worth the time.","February 7, 2015","true","37.6"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","2","13","0","0"

I like the ability to be able to switch between zoning and individual building placement.  This feature gives you the ability to build your city in more detail.  My favorite thing is the Steam Workshop application.  Modding is going to be what makes this game rock.  Though I would have liked to see an above ground rail network I am not totaly disapointed in the game.  Hopefully this will be added in a later update.  I would have also liked to see the traffic interacting in the city like ems responding to calls or police like sim city that is the only thing that game really had going for it!  I would also like to see car crashes if traffic is to bad.  But my over all impression is there is alot that one can do with this game and with steam workshop and some great modders who have not given up on this franchise I think this game has a lot of potential.

Skylines is 100 times better and even has water physics and everything. However if you insist on getting a Cities XL game then XXL is the one to get.\n\nComing from Cities XL 2012 to this, gameplay wise, its almost exactly the same game.\nIts got the same UI, just recoloured from blue to black (although it does look a little more tidy).\nResources are still all the same as well as all the categories of buildings such as heavy industry.\n\nI have noticed a few new features and buildings in the game such as being able to edit how many plots the game places in the square building zones when building and choosing if the game places plots on one side or both sides of the road with the linear zoning tool. New buildings include things like the pollution sensors and electric car dealership just to name a few.\nNow whether these new features and buildings were in Cities XL Platinum, I have no idea. I never played Platinum or have seen any gameplay of it.\n\nThe graphics look slightly better in this than Cities XL 2012 but its really not by much. I'm not sure if its me but the colours look a bit more vibrant in XXL though.\n\nPerformance is much better in this than XL 2012. Focus Interactive have finally figured out that multicore computers are a real thing. In Cities XL 2012 there would be a noticeable drop in performance once your city hit around 50k population and would gradually get even worse as the population grew. In Cities XXL however, I have a city with 600k people and although there is a bit of a loss in perfomance it is no way near as bad as XL 2012 and still perfectly playable.\n\nFor a new player to the Cities XL/XXL this game would probably be an 8.5/10. For a player who has owned previous Cities XL games its a 5/10 at best.\nSo basically if you're new to the Cities XL/XXL franchise. Get this.\nIf you've owned previous Cities XL games and are willing to pay for some really minor new features and multicore support then get this but maybe wait for a sale.\nIf the performance of previous Cities XL games doesn't bother you then don't get this\n\nI'm gonna vote yes to this game simply because of the fact that you can now build massive cities and still get a playable frame rate which in previous titles was almost impossible.\n\nTL;DR\nThe performance is a lot better. The are some very minor new features. Other than that its pretty much the same as previous Cities XL games.","February 6, 2015","true","10.8"," 12 of 36 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","12","36","0","0"

It runs smoother than previous versions and does not sufer from the horrible memory leaks found in prior titles. I find the new UI to be a step in the wronge direction. Much of the text is hard to read because the colors are so close (black text on a grey background for example.) It does take up slightly less screen space so those with smaller monitors may find that a plus.\n\nAs far as what is new:\n- The new freight airport is a nice addition.\n- Also found in the marinas is a few new leisure options to make the waterways more usefull.\n- In the view panel you have the option to set a different background option and is nice for screenshots.\n- Some of the roadways are available from the start without turning on expert mode. This helps early game traffic managment and city planning.\n\nThe main reason i recomend this title is for the people who have not played this title before and are looking for alternatives to games like SimCity. This title has the feel of SimCity 4 but with greatly improved graphics and trade options done on very large maps. It does however have it's own bugs and oddities though most are just anoying in this version and not game breaking. The steam workshop support allows for easy mod access. If you are new to the series watch some youtube video's and tutorials first (as mentioned before Cities Xl 2012 videos are still valid with only minor changes.) This game is not like other city building games and you will want to get used to the diferences.","February 5, 2015","true","34.8"," 17 of 48 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","17","48","0","0"

Replayability is super high, as you'll learn from your mistakes and want to start over, or at least that's how I feel. My advice when you start is to not skimp on roads!!! Congestion becomes a real problem at around 20k, and then you probably have too many things connecting to small roads and would need to knock them down -- that is unless there is an upgrade feature, but I haven't found it yet if there is.\n\nThe negative reviews appear to be an angry mob, rather than a coherent group of people experiencing real problems with the gameplay. I haven't experienced any problems, however, the one thing that did frustrate me was the no load of a self-saved game at menu, BUT once it loads from autosave you can load your Save, so that is not an issue at all.

It does have some new content, though much of the game is the same. Clouds, and other little features are sprinkled around the game.\n\nBasically, everything that they said was going to be added, was. It's worth the $40.00 bucks if you haven't played it before, as it is the prettiest city building game around by far. Its worth $20.00 as an upgrade, because multi-core does indeed work, and works well.\n\nAnyone hating on the game, saying nothing was added is wrong. By default, the mere fact that multi-core was added makes their statement wrong, as that is not something that is just easily tacked on. As it stands now, a lot of the bigger mods, such as RHM aren't compatible, but is already starting to be converted over. Is XXL perfect? No. Is it an improvement over Platinum? Yes, a big one.

Its nearly the same.\n\n+ New maps and new music. But the music is also a negative part, but we will get to this later.\n\n+ I already have a pretty big city and didn't experience fps drops so far.\n\nAnd now the negative parts:\n\n- The music. Really, am I the only one who thinks that this music is absolutely depressing? Its a sad, female voice most of the time, it gives you the feeling you are doing something terrible, like killing a family with a shovel or something. I accept the typical citybuilding - chillout music, but this? Okay, its only my taste.\n\n- A few graphic glitches, like flickering streets in building mode and stuff like that. Nothing they coulnd't fix in a few small patches.\n\n- As I mentioned in the positive part - this game is very similar to Cities XL. Very, VERY similar. Imagine Cities XL with a black interface and thats it.\n\n- Wrong messages. At something around 2.500 Citizens you get the achivement you unlocked the medium buildings for the workers and the supply stuff, like electricity. Wrong message, because this happens at 5.000 citizens.\n\nAfter the first small game I can say: This game is definitly not 'new' its basically Cities XL with a new Interface. If you like City building games you can buy it, if they fix the small bugs I mentioned above.\n\nAnd please, developers, give us some happy music. Make it dubstep if you have to, but not this depressing stuff which makes the game hard because you cant see ♥♥♥♥ thorugh your manly tears.","February 5, 2015","true","71.6"," 30 of 84 people (36%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","36","30","84","9","0"

It's better than SimCity and doesn't suffer from *most* of the previous games' performance issues. If you like city building games it's worth picking up on sale. The game looks ok but still seems like the developer copy/pasted the old game into the new game. The multithread support helps however it still seems the game is jittery and has lots of screen tear issues (no vertical sync option?). I have an i7-4770k and every game I have thrown at it runs smooth except this game, the screen tears are really just annoying more than anything. The game is great for capturing single screenshots of HUGE cities and the trading works well (although can be easily exploited). I don't yet have a lot of hours however I can already see it's almost identical to the previous games, of which I own them all.\n\nOverall I have liked the previous games and this is the best of the series. That being said, it's more of the same old game. I'll dump 50 hours or so into it within the next few months, but it's not going to blow me away. It's still better than SimCity though since I can have a functional city larger than the size of a single neighborhood.

This game has gotten a lot of bad press from some very angry people, but I have to say... I LOVE THIS GAME!!!\nThe positives:\n- The graphic are great!\n- Things are running smoothly on my machine\n- I like driving through my city and standing on top of buildings looking at what I've done\n- The farms are expansive\n- It's really fun seeing all the different buildings\n- It's challenging trying to balance the city needs, especially trying to solve traffic issues\n- I love that services are distance-based and not radial, and they have decent coverage\n- There are so many things to do and new things unlocking all the time\n- The tutorials help a LOT\n- I haven't encountered a single bug.\n\nThe negatives:\n- The MUSIC... omg\n- It's lacking some flexibility with the roads (tight angles, on/off ramps... maybe I just haven't gotten that far)\n- I don't like having to bulldoze long stretches of roads to make minor tweaks and to upgrade roads.\n- It's more difficult than I thought to master the mechanics.\n- The "look around" feature with the mouse wheel is WAY too sensitive. It's an art form to pan where you want.\n- I wish I could choose whether or not to have suspension beams on my high-traffic viaducts.\n- It's kind of a pain having to drill down into each tool (and having it reset the default tool)\n\nThe neutrals:\n- The controls are fine once you know how to use them, although some people are REALLY passionate about this.\n- The UI is intuitive and clean in my opinion. I used the tutorial so I know where everything is.\n\nOverall, I REALLY like this game so far, although I do get what people are saying about not being able to "connect" with the game. Something is lacking there, but I can't put my finger on it. Still I find it very enjoyable. I personally think the developers did a great job because the game is beautiful. I can imagine the challenges they went through. I think people are nitpicking over some very small things, but maybe I feel that way because I haven't owned a previous version of this game (and that was by choice, not from a lack of knowledge about the game).","February 5, 2015","true","24.3"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","19","6","31","0","0"

I like how they added a lot more detail to the game and also made it utilize more than a single core.  The maps are a lot larger too and there are many, many different types.  I have been playing the river delta terrain map so far.  Once again, I can't stress how much the graphics are improved... don't forget to turn them all the way up though. :)    They also added a flat UI to the interface, which doesn't matter to me as much.  I don't have any negatives that are specific to this game.  I have played hundreds of hours of Cities XL Platinum, Cities XL and Sim City 4.  I love the city genre and this game stays similar enough to Cities XL Platinum that I would say it's more of a SP then another game.  Though you have to realize that in order to achieve the multicore support, it probably took a huge code rewrite to enable.","February 5, 2015","true","13.5"," 3 of 24 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","3","24","0","0"

Otherwise, it's the same game it ever was, complete with stutters and jutters and rather poorly realised calculation tables that means as the city gets larger, the whole thing slows down.  This was always a talking point of earlier versions, but looks like the programmers have simply ignored all suggestions (yet again...!).  I've yet to get a really big city going, but a medium sized one is already showing signs of buckling under the claculations strain.\n\nDespite this, it's still a better game (in my view) than it's big-company rival Sim City, with its kiddy graphics and sandbox square townships.  It will appeal to those who just want to get on with building a city, along more accurate simulation models.  Just be prepared to fill your swear box when things start grinding to a standstill.  Oh, and they've changed the muzak yet again.

It will give you some insight about the Thumbs down.\n\nIf you are an avid Cities XL player Skip this first part.\n\nNew to Cities? This game is for you. Stop reading the thumbs down reviews. they really aren't helpful….period. If you're looking at it, it's most likely because you are looking for a more original city building simulation game. Its simple mechanics allow you to focus more on the city building while easily managing economic efficiency.\n\nOnce you spend the first 30 minutes going thru the tutorial *i recommend* your basicly ready to lay out something quickly and effectively. Starting is very simple and allows you to focus on the design and layout. While later slowly introducing elements that open up more economic strategy. City utilities are managed on a simpler and more macro size scale. You can create trade routes between two cities to share resources, *yet to explore it more* and so on.\n\nBasicly its enjoyable.\n\nNow for quality. This game has no more bugs than an average AAA title does that releases for “your console of choice” or any other system. I personally have not run into anything. I have a 2014 edition of the razer “blade pro” playing on full settings at 3k. I have not experienced any lag or slowdown. I average about 60 fps and dips down to about 45 fps while exploring on ground level. So im sure anyone with a mid core gaming desktop or consumer laptop should be able to run this ok. I have also managed to run it on low settings on a surface pro 3 i5 variant. Runs around 20fps, so hopefully that gives you a benchmark range of what to expect.\n\nWell what's with all Bad hype behind Cities XXL?\n\nLets be real, what more do you want to see from this particular series? A future space theme skinned game that really gets no improvement in gameplay and just adds more bugs?\n\nIf you are familiar with the Cities XL game and really enjoyed it for what it was, then you will like Cities XXL. Not a lot of re learning so we can focus more on what we love to do. Build huge gigantic cities! I dont have the biggest city yet *only been playing for about 3 hours on 5x speed* but so far iv not run into many hitches.\n\nCities XXL is basicly the same thing as Simcity: Cities of tomorrow was. But less disappointing.\n\n\nTo be fair in their advertising “at least from what i saw” never said it was going to be a new engine. And all the screenshots look like they might have been taken from Cities XL. So what did you expect when buying itt? I feel the game undertook some massive improvements as far as rendering, and speed. I treated this buy more like an expansion then a whole new game. Yes it does suck they did not just improve the old engine but.\n\nI mean we got multiple truck simulators, farm simulators, bus sim…..you get the idea. Only so much can be done with a game series that is so fragile right now no one wants screw anything up.\n\nThey added steam workshop content to the game and which is like the developers giving us the tools to build whatever you want. So for the hardcore citie player you have nothing to complain about. If we give it a chance to grow it has the chance to become basically whatever we want.\n\nNo online multiplayer, And honestly this should really be no surprise. Games like Anno and Simcity do not have the best track record of been successful at multiplayer online. Why risk breaking a perfectly playable game with multiplayer. We can still share cities with our friends.\n\nSteam workshop. Must i say more?\n\nIn short i got exactly what i wanted. Hoping that the community will grasp it and love it for what i believe it deserves.\n\n7/10 would buy again. I really want the creationist user to grasp modding this game. While i'm not looking for anything in particular it would be cool to see what people come up with.","February 5, 2015","true","5.2"," 3 of 25 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","3","25","0","0"

The new additions were merely evolutionary and cosmetic and thats ok; more of a DLC than a new experience. Worth the $20 pre order in my case.\n\nGOOD - Cleaner Interface, new building filter meu, atmospheric back drops (skies), environmental enhancements simply provide a generic improvement to areas around them (new parks, ?sensors?, etc.), a new freight airport, new cruise ship port, and soundtrack.\n\nBAD - Persistent bugs - roundabouts and highway interfaces fail to visualize traffic flow (cars disappear), will take awhile before moddings translate from previous titles (if you find alot of use from modding it may be wise to wait a bit), core fan requests still not available (i.e. missing intercity/above ground rail infrastructure)\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you enjoy city building games then the game is worth its weight. Is it perfect? No. The game excels in such a way that its shortcomings are glaring; hence the frustrations lobbed its way. Whether Focus Home Interactive should/could do more will fall to the sea of opinions. Decide for you. And while I certainly fall in the camp that asks more of FHI, I still find enjoyment in the title's current state; the Black Swan that it is. What can I say . . .

All the negitive nacys are just idiots and have zero sense of game desgin.\n\nGame runs far better then the old one, even though I never got very far in the last one.  One thing that is still lacking for a good game is multiplayer, to work together to build a mega city.  The maps are by far big enough to support it.\n\nWith Steam Workshop support I am sure someone will figure out how to add it in via modding.  At least this one has steam support so cool stuff like that CAN happen.\n\nOverall the game is great if you like to build super cities, and were found lacking in the new Sim City (I felt the same way, game was good but needed bigger building plots).\nThe game is very playable now (over the old one), however that is all dependent on your computers hardware configuration AND what other programs are running the background.","February 5, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 30 people (17%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","17","5","30","2","0"

The shadows were improved and the texture filtering is better (no blurry textures).\n\nThere are some new buildings like freight airport, a new sport marina, bike rental, and many more including new transport related buildings like Park and Ride.

Same old game with different UI. There is new structures but nothing like "WOW!" It would be more interesting if it was sold as an addon rather than a "new game" because there is nothing really "new" there. Also, its suffers from the same annoying CTDs, just like previous versions.\n\nThis game is pratically a copy from the old one. I had put my mods folder from XL Platinum just for a little testing and guess what? IT WORKED!\n\nSo, my sincere opinion: I recommend it on 2 conditions:\n\n1 - buy it when it in a very nice sale (50% off or more);\n2 - only if you appreciate the series and this kind of game.\n\nPS: Sorry for any grammar errors. I'm still learning english. :D","February 5, 2015","false","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems to have helped a little bit, but it's still not exactly butter smooth.\n\n*The game is a resource hog, but you'll be able to power through it with a quad core. Graphics requirements are mild.\n\n* It does seem to have some lags when you're changing your zoom and going through different tools because its pulling textures and file from my HDD on the fly - something many games get away with these days.\n\n*The "upgrades" not enough to get me back in after the last ones, though some new tools and tweaks make life a little easier. For someone brand new to this franchise, you'll probably love the scale. I know I did with these games. I've always thought of them as more of a sandbox than a challenge in management. They do make mechanics and cause - effect simulations pretty easy to figure out, so you can learn it pretty fast.","February 6, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep your money, go to Cities Skylines.\n(The only way I see that this game will get back a good review is if micromanaging got a huge upgrade and being able to see almost every little stat in your town like how many crimes, where those crimes are committed, how efficient is your facilities are being, basically redo the whole game please, that'd be grat)","February 5, 2015","false","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically it’s a city builder. You place “zones” rather than specific buildings. The populace will start to create and fill your city based on your zone. I haven’t played too many city building games so I won’t be able to compare it to much. I enjoy it a lot.","June 4","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
