The basic overview of the game is that it is better than Demolition Company, in terms of building stability. For those who do not own Demoliton Company, it would suffice to say that sometimes you only need to walk into a building to cause parts of it to collapse; with this game that does not happen.\nIt is certainly not Construction Simulator 2015 as you are only constructing parts of a building rather than digging foundations, pouring concrete and delivering materials to the site as was pointed out in another review, this game utilises rubber band physics, a great indicator of this is with the mobile crane, the jib of the crane moves around which in turn causes the wire and hook to bounce around pretty much resulting in damage to materials.\nOverall I would say that the game warrants a 7/10 as there are some issues there which need dealt with. If any developers are reading this, a proper demolition simulator with the same physics as Construction Simulator 2015 would be fab. You could have all the hand tools needed plus excavators of various sizes and types such as high reach, or with a sorter head, claws, shears etc!!!!","June 21, 2015","true","10.3"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","29","36","3","1"

Vehicles slide way too easy, even when driving slow. even the Excavator slides around\n2. several imaginary barriers, that you will bump into.\n3. vehicle fuel usage set a little too fast.\n3a. vehicles only have one speed, hint: (turtle power)\n4. vehicle suspension does not function properly on rough terrain.\n5. no customization availible for paint schemes. Just plain dull yellow.\n6. A lot of repetitive effort on repeatables in order to purchase machines and upgrades.\nAll in all I am dissapointed in the game, and would not recommend it to a friend\n","July 8, 2015","false","14.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","16","23","5","0"

This is another that does not deliver well. It has some great promise. While I like the repairs the fuel is a bit excessive. A real vechile could go days with out a refueling. A 5 gallon gas can on any of this is not even worth the time. The some of the eq is fun to operate and most are most difficult. I was sad to see that you can not use a joystick nor game pad.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1zzler/recommended/355330/","s1zzler","SizZLeR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s1zzler/","40 products in account","The title is misleading at the point where it says "simulator", because it most certainly is NOT a simulator.\n\nIts an arcade game where you are to demolish stuff using tools and machines and unlike real life, you will be breaking it down by simply driving into it with frontloaders and excavators.\n\nFor each job completed youll be awarded some money, for which you can buy new machines, which will grant you access to other jobs for which you will be awarded some money, for which you can buy......aso\n\nThe game is somewhat fun for a short while, it soon becomes very repetitive though.\n\nControls are simple and clumsy to use and after fiddling with the controller setup for a while, I got it mapped so I could use my Xbox one controller to play the game.\n\nHowever, you cant configure all the controls, for instance, on the excavator, to raise and lower the boom, you will be using the same controls as for driving forwards and backwards.\nIn other words, controls cant be configured individually.\n\nThe machines has rubberband physics, not as bad as Construction Machines 2015, but still, its rubberband.\nEspecially the excavator is hard to drive when you need to turn, straight backwards and forwards works though, but the belts doesn't really seem to work independently.\n\nPhysics are pretty much like in early construction machine games, where concrete chunks has a super slippery surface and no feel of mass to them.\n\nThe machines aren't driven by their belts or wheels, its more the other way around, the machine is moved and the belts/wheels follow.\nYou can easily tell when you drive the wheel loader and one of its wheels lose contact with the ground surface, because it stops spinning when in the air.\n\nGraphics arent bad, though not pristine in any way, but basically its allright.\n\nThe only good thing about this game is, that the physics are slightly better than it is in the much older Demolition games where you can really drive machines into things to break them down successfully.\n\nSo by that one thing, this game is a step in the right direction, but its far from good enough.\n\n\nOnce again im sitting here with another claimed construction simulator that isnt worth the pricetag.\nIt feels like this game (just like every other similar game out there) was done within a narrow budget, so that everything is just below par.\n\nIf you like arcade games though, this game may keep you entertained for a few hrs, but still i think youll find the amount of entertainment this game has to offer, is very/too pricy.\n\nIt would be gr8 if we could have one good construction sim game at 80 euro rather than the pile of 20 euro trash we have now.","June 20, 2015","false","1.0"," 36 of 72 people (50%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","50","36","72","8","6"

It's more focused on the destruction / preparation of a work site than fully building. If you enjoy smashing and destroying things then I'm sure you'll find something to enjoy here. If you want to fully micromanage all aspects of a construction company then this one will leave you feeling empty. The destruction physics feel satisifying and there's a decent selection of vehicles and tasks to keep you busy.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iCnv7S1UqtE","September 18, 2015","true","7.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

About 90 minutes into the game I have had two crashes which resulted in Blue Screens of Death. A unique experience to say the least these days. Controls are frustrating as well. I would stay away until the game at the very least is stable and on sale. $10 would be a more realistic price point IMO.\n\nSo far it has been an interesting take on the construction simulator games. Very enjoyable to smash down buildings and seems to have a unique variety of missions however do not expect AAA graphics or anything of the sort. Fun game so far.\n\nWill edit after I have played more.","June 20, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 22 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","7","22","0","5"

The number of construction vehicles is less than demonstrated on the film clips of the game. Game clips showed construction of a high rise apartment building but such construction was not part of the game play. Very misleading. The physics is acceptable but far from perfect. When you decide to go  to free play, all you get is a rehash of the different scenerios already played. Dissapointing. Although I rated this game as recommended, the real recommendation is mixed.","June 1","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
