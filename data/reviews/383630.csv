The keyboard controls can't be rebound, so if you don't like the way the coders laid it out (ASZX trying to emulate the layout of a controller), then you're screwed. Using A to run, S to jump, and X to attack just feels wrong.\n\nYour attack extends about ten pixels, the "jumping" feels off (hard to properly explain, but easy to understand once you experience it), there's plenty of "walking dead" situations (for instance, if you run out of special attacks when you're faced with a puzzle that requires special attacks, your only option is to kill yourself and restart), at least one stolen sound effect (hi, Megaman), every time you start the game up you have to sit through a bunch of "credits" screens, every time you load the main menu you have to press F4 for keyboard - the list of little flaws goes on and on.\n\nAnd, finally, $12 for this game is far, far too high a price point.\n\nJust because you use pixel art and make references to video games doesn't mean you can counter all criticism with "oh, it's retro, you just don't get it". Sure, it's retro - but the retro games it brings to mind are Color Dreams and Sachen multi-cart games. It's not quite Action 52 bad, but it's far from Megaman and Mario - or even VICE: Project Doom or River City Ransom. And it's not really "Bad Dudes" so-cheesy-it's-good.","August 25, 2015","false","3.2"," 51 of 60 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","51","60","0","0"

Although it tries to emulate old games, it doesn't even have the NES look, the visuals look more like what someone does on microsoft paint.The platforming is terrible. You slide when landing, take a while to start running, sometimes you don't jump far enough to the side, sometimes your guy jumps super high, while others he doesn't. Sometimes he moves super quickly to the side when you jump and then others he doesn't. It's just very loose, floaty, and inconsistent. The combat is you running up to people and punching them. They run through you while you do it and you just mash punch. You have these special abilities, but they run out pretty quickly, and only one is very helpful.\n\nThere is basically no save system. If you run out of lives or quit the game during a level of a world you lose all progress. Then once you beat an entire world, you go to a shop. You can use coins to buy the ability to start from that world, but its stupid. After collecting all the coins I could find I had 17, and just to get a save point it cost me 30? So the game wouldn't let me save my progress, say if I wanted to quit the game. This also is dumb because it costs coins just to beat a level (3-5 per level).....uh why? If I have to spend coins to do things later in the game, why would you just randomly take some of my  coins when I beat a level? Terribly stupid design decision. Then, you get 3 lives to start, and never get more, unless you buy 1 at the end of an entire world. Then if you die you lose all your progress in the game. So I have to beat the entire game on 3 lives, with 1 extra life per world, if I don't want to save. Even mario wasn't this stupid. It's like this game wants to capture old-school vibes, but adds antiquated mechanics that aren't around anymore for a reason, and are actually worse than the games it tries to emulate. All of the enemies are pretty boring and just either run from left to right, or shoot a projectile at you. There's nothing else to the game. Busch league game.","September 28, 2015","false","4.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

While this game isn't terrible it's also not great and much better can be had for $12.  I got it cheap in a bundle, otherwise I likely wouldn't have picked it up at all.\n\nThe gameplay is decent, typical platformer fare though occasionally I found myself going through blocks or not quite being able to make precise jumps.  You have a (very) short-range punch, special abilities that change per level and the boss fights are nicely varied in type.  There's a co-op mode as well but I've not tried it and likely never will.\n\nNow for the obligatory Pros/Cons list:\n+Unique boss battles\n+Minor puzzles (use ability here)\n+Shmup minigame\n+Interesting level-choice mechanic\n+Trading cards\n\n-Floaty digital-only controls using the analog stick with seemingly no d-pad option.\n-640x480\n-Video stuttering (surprising with a 970GTX for a game running at 640x480 with little to no effects and fairly poor graphics)\n-Repetitive gameplay\n-No achievements\n\n~SEEMS short but it's tough as balls so until I can finish up the third world I guess I won't know for sure...\n\nOverall it's not a bad game and I'm sure I'll finish it up someday but I feel the asking price is a bit much for what it is.\n\nHere's my gameplay video, sans commentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZBdlCZ4Nbc","July 21, 2015","true","18.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

The mechanics are solid and the graphics and characters are very cool.  The game works great for all fans of retro-games.\nI’ve seen no bugs, apart from some acceptable glitches with some blocks.  And I have completed the game three times, I was not limited to gaining cards to sell... .\nAnyway, I think the game is not just simply a "cut and paste" of some great titles of the past. The developers  tried to create something new with the concept and the gameplay.  It is more of a mix of many platform games of the past, like Super Mario, Castlevania, Kid Chameleon and others. The result is incredibly good for those who have the patience to learn how to play.\nSteam needs productions like this, made with passion.  Maybe it is not for everybody, but this doesn’t mean it is not well produced, and it is worth the money.\n\nPros:\n\n- Good "retro-feeling".\n- Puzzle sections.\n- The boss battles are very fun (seems "mini-games").\n- Charming characters (I love Miss Devil <3 ).\n- The maps like Super Mario Bros 3.\n- Have a lots of contents to unlock (extra levels, info and a new mode).\n- Cool pixel art and good chiptune themes.\n\nCons:\n\n- Not for newbies\n- Some achievement (like "kill yourself with a bomb..." LOL).\n- The sub-menu is very poor.\n- Some glitches.\n\n7,5/10","January 18","true","7.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I love the Super Mario jaggy lines at the finish line. I am not immune to the appeal of the old school. But there are no other negative reviews. And there's a lot wrong here.\n\nThe tutorial helps, but the controls are still counterintuitive. It's still ultra-awkward pressing one button to run (while moving, and provided you have enough space) and then pressing another button to jump, in order to clear obstacles. And there's no impact in collisions with enemy characters. I punch once as I'm apparently passing into an opponent, and then punch a second time while we are submerged in one another, and it seems to do the trick, but I'm left unsure if I've sustained damage. I then have to keep my eye on the top-left corner in the next fight to try to figure out if I have, and discover I haven't. This is the first time in my history playing games that I am let down that I haven't sustained damage. It just FEELS wrong.\n\nThe sound design is underdeveloped, too. When I throw a punch, I need a sound that helps me believe there's been an impact. And the controls are just slow enough to respond that the whole thing feels floaty and dreamlike. That's not a recipe for immersion for me, or for fun. Especially not when the P/R sets me up for a responsive, intuitive, satisfying old school experience.\n\nAt 2.99, and to support a couple of guys trying to get started, I can see it, but 11.99 is hard to justify. I can't in good conscience recommend this one.","August 25, 2015","false","3.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

It's designed and developed by two guys from Italy who truly love gaming and helping us experience old school games with a new twist.\n\n2. If you dug old school platformers like Commander Keen and 2D Duke Nukem, you will find some serious nostalgic joy in Seep Universe. I really appreciated the attention to detail with branching paths and even the purposefully placed cheap sections that killed me. That type of intentional design is something you don't find in modern games.\n\n3. The controls are slightly less than stellar. When you're developing on sweat, tears and caffeine, sometimes it's tough to perfect mechanics. The controls are not bad, but they could have used a bit of fine-tuning to make this a truly excellent experience. But look at it this way...this is a true tribute to the old school as very few games had perfect sticks.\n\nFor more on Seep Universe, check out my playthrough - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If1lF-pYYmQ&index=4&list=PLzwQfBinnPorct4WgoQJy8EkPHSryVsdB","August 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

But it's 2016.   This is a poorly implemented, clunky 2D retro super mario ripoff, without the same level of endearing gameplay.\n\nThe Engrish is strong: "This game support the xinput controller" is the first thing the developers smack you in the face with.  Telling you that it's not really aimed at the English market, and it's not aimed at the PC gaming market.  Who's it for then?  Confused Italians, is my best guess.\n\nGraphics are terrible (it's been a long time since the NES came out - 30 years, in fact).  So when your highest technological achievement is something that was surpassed 30 years ago, some introspection is badly needed.\n\nGameplay is weak - the only positive is the addition of co-op gaming on a single system (because apparently it's 1985 and networking protocols haven't been invented yet).   It's a super mario ripoff with a push mechanic instead of a jump on head mechanic.\n\nNo reason to buy this.  Better examples of this dead genre are out there, if you're that way inclined.","May 17","false","3.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
