(while troubleshooting, Steam even claimed that I was playing 'Ten Pin Alley' so perhaps that's a hint at their future intentions with said branding)\n\nThe music, thankfully, seems fully intact but the aspect ratio is set to 16:9 in fullscreen and thus stretched if you aren't playing windowed. All of the buttons use the original PlayStation icons and it wouldn't surpise me to find that the save files are compatible with existing ps1 emulators. (or can be converted)\n\nThe resolution options are extremely limited: 320p, 480p, 720p, and 1080p.\n\nAt this price I'd still recommend the game but just know that it's a very obvious ps1 port, needs some serious patching, and that you'd probably be better served by just emulating it or purchasing it on PSN for the PS3.\n\n*Updated to reflect that 1080p now works.","June 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

You cannot play the game in offline mode. Note that the game has no vital online functionality to warrant this.\n\nOne of my favorite games on the PS1, and probably the best tube shooter on the system, period. This port could use some graphics enhancements--it runs in an emulator and it would be nice to see some of the features you'd see in common PC emulators, which this game will look much better on, if you increase the resolution and add some smoothing. So all in all I would not say this is a definitive port of the game but it does at least have support for ps3 controllers. Some Vsync/triple buffering control would be the least I would ask for as well. I bought it anyway because it's a great game, but great 3D games of this era typically have actually really nice graphics hidden under the PS1's poor standard resolution. This is a really trippy game and it runs pretty fast so you won't really notice the graphical jags in the environment but you won't be able to see the detail on all the insects either.","July 5, 2015","false","3.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

To me Tempest can be a stressful game where as I have always found N2O to be an amazingly relaxing game, maybe it's the soundtrack, maybe it's the awesome psx visuals or it could just be that the whole package is a sweet sweet ride. A+ gme and fingers crossed this pushes through some more excellent psx era ports to steam.","June 29, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

As awesome as I remember it. Fly down looping tubes and shoot bugs. Great soundtrack. There are a lot more special subweapons than I remember and the scoring system is absolutely clever. It rewards passing enemies in the tube and letting them swap colors and power up and then chaining together enemy kills that share colors. unlike most shooters your score is actually used for something. After each level you use the credits you have accumulated to buy screen clearing bombs or more points, which is like buying more lives. So there is a tension between how much do you think you are going to want to sweep the screen and how much you think you are going to die. There are a lot of little bonuses in each level that can only be earned with specific methods, shooting things in certain orders etc.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say about it is the draw distance is abysmally short. This is usually  hidden by the bending in the tubes so enemies can creep right up on you. But that is a function of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ps1 hardware the original developers had to work with and it doesn't detract from the game too much.","July 23, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

N2O is a game that takes space invaders, and puts it on a three dimensional acid trip, where you shoot bugs and jam out to some fantastic music. N2O was originally released on PS1 and got rereleased to PC by Console classics, who will be releasing 32 more PS1 games over to Steam. The game is fun, It's soundtrack is literally the album Vegas by The Crystal Method. Now as a game, I would recommend it in a heartbeat (I still have a hard copy of this game from back in the day). The port is nice too, but my only real complaint about it, is that Steam Overlay doesn't appear in fullscreen. So if you want to see your achievments, you're going to have to play in windowed, until they update it for the overlay to work (if they decide to update it).","September 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It offers no audio or visual improvements at all, running at a painfully dated VGA resolution (320x240x256c). It doesn't even seem to run at 60-fps on a desktop gaming tower. You don't even get the benefit of a copy of 'Vegas' on CD and, for that matter, a way to play another CD in-line.\n\nDo yourself a favor: find a copy of the PlayStation CD-ROM, get an accelerated PSX emulator (some of them are free) or even just a used PS1.
