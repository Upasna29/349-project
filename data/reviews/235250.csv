The ability to level up, use player skills, assign talents to amp your towers or even your personal skills depending on the map you're on. This is all alongside creating your own maze by placing blocks just like you do in the original Sanctum games. This is certainly worth the few dollars their asking.

I don't even know why I started to play this game, but for sure I didn't have any expectations. And I realised that I have 13 hours playtime. That was good time for sure. This game is well designed, difficulty level grows with every level, so it's not so hard to start but it's getting difficult after some time. But you will want to pass only one level, and next after that, and maybe next... And so on.\nGenerally very well designed, polished and properly balanced piece of a game. It's really hard to find something as good in such a price. Good job.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you're a fan of tower defence games, this is good one. Try it, you won't regret.\nIf you have only few bucks and want to play for long hours, this is it!\n\nLike this review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adilor/recommended/235250/","adilor","Adilor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adilor/","188 products in account","First off, I do actually like the game. I really do. It is quite pleasing aesthetically, and has a great system in place that lets you play the game how you want.\n\nProblem is, how you want to play the game might not be very successful.\n\nIt is of this gamer's opinion that a tower defense game should not be a puzzle game. There should not be a narrow band of builds that will actually grant victory among an immense number of combinations that could be played. With 15 different towers and 17 skills, picking just four of each can be difficult, yes, but it affords the player the ability to define how they want to go about defending their cores, and that's not even counting the perk points, which add another layer of depth and customization. This system by itself is fantastic, but the execution that makes use of it is rather poor.\n\nThere is progression; not everything is available from the start. This progression, however, cuts off quite fast. Everything is unlocked at the point of hitting level 12, but the levels keep going, rather pointlessly. Perk points are gained differently, at a rate of 1 per completed map, and when you feel like you're not powerful enough to get past a particular map, there's a problem.\n\nNow, I can understand a TD needing some strategy; if one doesn't make you think about what you're doing, then it's probably not very good. SSTD, though, feels like it asks too much of strategy, putting the player on a very fine line between perfection and failure. I was doing fine with this game through the first few levels. I made a blunder here and there, and learned from what were clear mistakes (setting all Violators to attack the highest HP targets was a bad idea, for the record). There were some tougher levels that took me a couple attempts to figure out, but it felt okay. The challenge was fair. Then along came Works.\n\nWorks is the map that I feel enforces an unfair level of difficulty and shows that the game really wants you to use a very specific setup to get through it. I have taken numerous attempts at it with different builds and have yet to even see the boss wave. I have beat my head against it long enough that I don't really care to continue. Maybe it's a fluke, maybe the rest aren't so bad after it, but I'm not going to put myself through the torture of trying to figure out the exact combination of towers and skills it takes to get through this map that seems to have too much of everything.\n\nSure, I could just use the magic of Youtube and look for a setup that gets through it so I could continue, but that's not how I play; I would get no sense of accomplishment and may as well have used Cheat Engine to bypass the level in terms of enjoyment. When a game completely shuts down a player's ability to progress, without giving them an opportunity to either adequately learn what they're doing wrong or power up to overcome the challenge, then there is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe game doesn't need to be easy; it just needs to cater to more than an elite 1% of builds. Don't tell the gamers how to play their game.","February 12, 2014","false","9.0"," 46 of 63 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","46","63","0","4"

All enemies had a little too much health but it was still managable, given that the player was able to use the right combination/positioning of towers and mazes. I found myself patiently restarting levels over and over again just to finish them perfectly before moving on to the next. I played this casually to let off some steam from schoolwork and studying. Despite the slight problems in balancing, I was actually enjoying myself.\n\nFast forward to Dec 23 when I decided to play it again after exams.\nI opened up the game and was surprised to see all the changes: the UI had an all new look, the pricing of towers/blocks increased, monsters had even more health now and numerous other things changed as well. I already thought the game was hard enough as it is, but for some reason the developers thought it would be a good idea to make the game even more unforgiving. I am now unable to go past a really early level in the game because of this.\n\nSuper Sanctum TD has a great concept, with a variety of towers and powers you can utilize. I also liked being able to set up a maze for the monsters. Unfortunately, the balancing is currently out of whack so players will be struggling and wasting time trying to get past even the easiest of levels. If you think you have the patience, feel free to try it out but I doubt you'll go very far with the current version.","December 26, 2013","false","3.4"," 82 of 145 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","82","145","0","8"

I was not expecting much but this has been one of the most solid TD experiences so far. There are a lot of towers and tactics you can use, I try using different towers all the time cause it mixes up the gameplay. You get upgrades depending on what difficulty and "mission/map" you have completed. It can be a little overwhelming at first if you don't try every tower out to find your own playstyle... I had trouble with a TD map early in the game before trying some other towers that made that TD map waaay easier, so just experiment to your hearts content (^_^) You also have abilities which is a neat feature. I would give this TD a solid 75 out of 100. It's quite enjoyable.","November 26, 2013","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spootaloo/recommended/235250/","Spootaloo","Spootaloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spootaloo/","191 products in account","Super Sanctum TD was a game I picked up for the combination of ridiculous sale price ($0.79) with trading cards. When I saw a game that looked to be similar to the original Sanctum games with the fast-paced FPS action taken out, I expected it to be a sloggy, boring grindfest - my standard opinion when it comes to the majority of tower defense games.\n\nMuch to my surprise, Super Sanctum TD manages to dodge the most common gripes I have about the TD genre. Most levels have an open-ended "create-your-own-maze" approach, allowing for a lot of freedom and creativity in level solutions. SSTD also does away with long streaks of easy early-game snore-inducing levels - strong planning, resource management, and intelligent skill usage are all needed as soon as you complete the two training levels. The difficulty remains fairly consistent throughout, giving what seems like a paltry 14 stages a pretty beefy amount of playtime, as you'll likely need a few tries to figure out a suitable plan for much of the levels. On the other hand, if you find yourself breezing through the game, there's plenty of replay value in the form of an optional Hard difficulty, as well as infinite survival modes for every stage.\n\nSSTD isn't without its flaws, however - most glaringly is the game's fondness for crashing. Thankfully, the game does a fairly good job of autosaving, letting you continue right at the start of the wave you were left hanging on. The high difficulty I praised earlier can also be a bit of a double-edged sword - with a completely linear level structure, getting stuck on a stage will bring any semblance of progression to a screeching halt. An optional easy difficulty setting may have been a good idea for this reason.\n\nSuper Sanctum TD may not be the most innovative game in the world, but what it does, it does very well. If you're a big fan of tower defense games, then this game is an absolute steal.","February 26, 2015","true","18.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

But no worries,the only thing you have to do is Level up. With an higher Level comes next to new Towers also Abilitys,from Black Holes which take for an short period of time an group of Enemys out,to mass damaging-thunders to damage increasing Buffs(of your towers for sure).There are also Towers which only can hit not flying Enemys,and 1 Tower which only deals damage to flying enemys(theres an ability that sends enemys flying,so they will be attackable for that Tower for an short period of time.)And they deal alot of damage,that doesn't mean use only them,you will need other Towers in the game later on,atleast to the point i managed to reach in the game.End Part(long ♥♥♥ end part)So when you are awful at these kinda games you maybe shouldnt play that,but looking at the price, and the playtime you can have by playing it, (+ it has badges but i don't think,that it is top priority for everyone)you can easily say its worth it.atleast more worth it then some 60€ games i saw so far.Sure it can be boring,so i would only recommend it to some people which are,let's say half way good at td games or better. Because it will become alot more frustating lateron in the game.\nBut overall,i would recommend itIt was fun,even when im not an huge fan of TD games,and i can gladly recommend it to everyone,since it doesn't costs this much","October 13, 2014","true","15.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The first few levels are easy and simple, but once you get to the fourth level the difficulty instantly ramps up. By killing waves you'll earn XP that will level up your profile, unlocking more secondary abilities and giving you the power to upgrade other variables, like increasing the gun damage of your turrets.\n\nThe 2D design is charming and fits the game perfectly. It's all shown from an isometric view so you're not thrown into the action like the first or second Sanctum games. It still works very well, and for a game that came free with the second game it's an excellent addition to your collection.

I can't really complain though, it's fun and I got it for 39 cents. 4 dollars is NOT a large amount by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nMy overall rating-7/10\ngameplay-8.5/10\nart/music-7/10\nAmount of content-5/10\nfun-YES","July 28, 2014","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than two game crashes I never had any issues with the game. It gets a bit challenging later on as more advanced units are thrown at you but if you can figure out a decent strategy it's quite rewarding to crush your enemies, see them driven before your towers and hear the lamentation of their slowly charring fleshpods. Or something like that.\n\nPick it up in a sale and it's a real steal, but I'd say it's probably worth the asking price. Not a bad addition to your tower defense collection.","July 21, 2014","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Classic TD with various abilities you can fire off to affect the enemies directly, and some skills which you can raise to improve certain types of towers and such.\nIf you've played a few TD games there's nothing much here you haven't seen before, but what there is works well and it's also pleasant with this kind of pure gameplay from time to time.\n\nThe only issues I've had is that the difficulty is a bit uneven (the very last mission is far easier than the next-to-last, for example), and I don't much like the way the Survival mode (endless waves) is done; enemy types just get more health as you progress and it's not very evenly done, so an enemy that was easy to kill in one wave can be next to impossible the next.\n\nI've also had some crashes which I suspect are due to a memory leak. At least, if I restart the game after playing a number of missions (~10), there are no problems.\n\nMore campaign missions would have been nice too, but considering the price I paid (less than one Euro in a sale), that's not really a fair criticism.","March 27, 2014","true","64.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have blocks which you can put down to form a maze & loads and loads of different types of enemies.

Other than two game crashes I never had any issues with the game. It gets a bit challenging later on as more advanced units are thrown at you but if you can figure out a decent strategy it's quite rewarding to crush your enemies, see them driven before your towers and hear the lamentation of their slowly charring fleshpods. Or something like that.\n\nPick it up in a sale and it's a real steal, but I'd say it's probably worth the asking price. Not a bad addition to your tower defense collection.","July 21, 2014","true","24.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/235250/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick Summary: Unlike the previous Sanctum games, Super Sanctum TD is pure tower defense, so you’re not running around shooting the enemies, only your towers can attack. It’s also a much smaller game in terms of graphics and gameplay. I wouldn’t be surprised if someone told me Super Sanctum TD was built as a browser game.\n\nAlso unlike the previous games, Super Sanctum TD has basically no storyline. The game is broken up into individual levels where you’re just trying to prevent the aliens from reaching the portal at the end of the level. The base layout of each level changes with each level and in most cases, you not only place towers, you also place the blocks upon which the towers are built. The aliens cannot pass your blocks so you can use them to create little mazes that give your towers more chances to blast the aliens. Since you’re not actually a player on the map you don’t need to worry about being attacked and the aliens do not attack your towers.\n\nAlso unlike the previous Sanctum games, you have special skills/spells that you can activate during each map. The skills are generally area attack bombs or ways to slow down the alien advance, giving your towers more time to destroy them. These spells, along with the decent variety of towers available to you are the only way to block the aliens. It’s all strategy and planning with no real “skill” involved except for aiming the spells.\n\nEvery time you beat a level, you earn a skill point that you can use on perks such as increased tower damage, increased area effect for spells, or decreased costs for blocks. You also gain experience as you play and unlock different spells. The skill points and levels are independent, so you can be level 30 and only have beaten 1 level but have all the skills unlocked. You can and must replay levels over and over for experience.\n\nPros:\n+Uncomplicated game with a fast download since it’s so small.\n+You can be unskilled and still win if you look up strategies online since it’s your towers doing most of the work.\n\nCons:\n-The game becomes super hard very quickly. I think I was only on the 3rd or 4th level before I got stuck and had to look online for help.\n-I said you could look up strategies online, but there actually isn’t much to be found except watching Youtube videos. This is probably due to how low profile the game is. Nobody wants to write a guide for a 100 megabyte game.\n\nOverall, the game is ok if you just want something to occupy your time for an hour or two at a time but it gets extremely frustrating if you’re trying to actually beat the game.\n","March 17","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is one of those games. It is so tight with resources that you either do everything right or fail every time. No room at all for anything else. And this is on normal game difficultilty mode, I dred to think what hard mode would be like! Add to this the fact that each mission has 10 waves of enemies and if you discover in later waves that you did not do something that was vital, then you will have to redo all of the previous waves for this map again. just to correct you mistake, to win the mission. For example, one of the early missions starts air enemies on around wave 4, if you do not plan for this and build anti air prior to this, you will have to do the early waves again, including building anti air in preparation of what is to come. If you are a fan of patheticly hard games, enjoy, if you don't mind redoing maps while you advance your abilities, enjoy!!!\n\nAnother dislike is if just one boss gets through then it is game over.\n\nWhat is with the bug that decides that none of your weapons will do any damage to anything.\n\nI doubt I will play this game much!","June 19, 2015","false","9.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

(example from the last map i played: Snakes, on the leftmost i can't see enemy health because the GUI showing towers obstruct vision. And on the bottom i cannot see how many enemies are coming because the bottom-left GUI is in front of the "next wave" GUI.)\n-I pressed ALT+ENTER to go to fullscreen and see if i can scale the game and solve it, NOPE, the GUI scaled with the game, AND THE WAVE STARTED, pressing alt+enter to toggle fullscreen starts the next wave.\n\n-ANTI AIR HAS VIOLATOR SOUND, AND IT SPAMS WHEN ATTACKING. (had to mute the game in order to play, causing my next negative point)\n-The game i dead silent between map and menu, victory music is considered a sound effect and it is muted if sound option is set to 0.\n-Not really that many options available on the options menu.\n\nOh thank you for 1 thumbs down and 1 "found this funny". /sarcasm\nOnly an idiot would notice this and defend as a good game design.","May 13, 2015","false","3.7"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","10","19","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/recommended/235250/","syrsly","Syrsly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/syrsly/","745 products in account","TL;DR: This is a very simple, casual version of Sanctum without coop mode and without the 3D visuals.  The level of dificulty will scare some away almost immediately, but tower defense veterans may enjoy some of the subtle gameplay mechanics which allow for deep strategic thought.  The problem is this is not like other Sanctum games.\n\nRest of the review:\n\nSanctum was great, and I loved Sanctum 2.  I didn't get the Super Sanctum spin-off game until the 2014 winter sale, because I wasn't really fond enough of the 2D graphical style to part with much money for the game.  Well, the game finally dropped to an absurdly low price, so I took the bait and began playing.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the combat was almost entirely about the towers and wall placement.  This is not Sanctum-like.  I was expecting a player character, but I got instead a god-like view with generic tower defense fare.  I was disappointed but did not let that sway me from giving the game a fair try.\n\nThe tower options were very bare to begin with, but after a few completed levels, I unlocked a lot of towers.  You start with the gatling gun tower and eventually unlock more towers as you beat levels.  You can go back and replay levels using your new towers and new abilities in survival mode.\n\nThe abilities are the closest thing you can get to player interaction with the game world, but I found that the best abilities were the ones you didn't actually get to use manually.  For example, you could have abilities which add to tower strength for a limited time when used, but you're better off unlocking the abilities which enhance towers indefinitely.  None of the upgrades are ever permanent, so there's little reason to replay the game from the beginning, but achievement hunters will enjoy the grind, I guess.\n\nThe story is non-existent.\n\nOverall, I liked the game in a casual time-wasting way, but I cannot recommend it unless you're looking for something extremely simple, something intended for the most casual of gamers.  Considering the game's intended audience was Sanctum players, I doubt many will be satisfied with this game's more generic approach to tower defense.","January 11, 2015","false","5.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/235250/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Super Sanctum TD is a low budget Sanctum series spin-off that lets you play a “retro” style 2D tower defense game instead of the usual Sanctum mix of tactical tower defense and engaging first-person shooting. If you’ve played either of the full-fledged Sanctum titles, you’ll immediately be familiar with the towers, the enemies, setting and soundtrack. However, Coffee Stain Studios may have pushed the “retro” thing too far. While the graphics and the soundtrack are pleasing, there’s no widescreen support and the sound effects are not only atrocious, but after a while they get pretty irritating. There’s really no reason for this game to be this low budget.\n\nThe game plays like a typical 2D tower defense game with a few twists. There’s a decent number of towers although less than in the main series. The usual staples are here: gatling gun, laser towers, etc. You even get the slow and amp fields from the original Sanctum which for some reason didn’t appear in last year’s sequel. The aliens are back as well and there’s less of them as well. They range from big brutes, fast chargers, annoying flying ones and big bosses. The objective is to build mazes and place your towers in a way that’s most efficient in destroying as much aliens as quickly as possible before they get to the core.\n\nKeeping in line with the hands on approach from the main series, you also have a number of skills at your disposal which you can use during the alien onslaught. For example, you can set up mines, freeze a group of aliens, make them hover in the air for a limited amount of time, strike them with lightning, send them backwards for a bit and so on. All of these skills have varying cooldowns so you need to use them at the most opportune time.\n\nThere’s not much content here. The single-player campaign spans 15 missions that you’ll be able to finish in under 10 hours on the normal setting. After that you can play each level on hard or in survival, but as far as game modes go, that’s about it. This is a low budget spin-off that never pretends to be anything else which is reflected in its price as well. The full price is only 3,99 euros, but it’s not unusual to see it slashed by 90%. And if you sell the trading cards, it’s likely that you’ll break even.\n\nIn the end, Super Sanctum TD is a solid tower defense game that’s worth playing as it manages to deliver that tactical and addictive experience that such games aspire to offer. And even though it’s too low budget and extremely light on content, at that price you really can’t go wrong with this one.\n\n6 OUT OF 10 (ALRIGHT)","March 19, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

An endless horde of horrible space monstroids is pouring out of a weird invasion portal cabbage and it's up to you to place a variety of defensive turrets in the way to stop 'em! Along with your chain guns and flamethrowers and gauss rifles, you also have access to a variety of special abilities you can activate to blast those determined jerkfaces who manage to scrape their way past your gauntlet. As you play, you earn experience, unlocking new turrets and abilities. Level layout and wave composition are well-balanced, keeping up the challenge and often requiring multiple level attempts to achieve any sort of victory. And when all is said and done, you can go back for further challenges by attempting earlier levels on Hard Mode or Survival Mode.\n\nUnfortunately, this game comes from the same people who made Sanctum, which was a delightfully innovative tower defense / FPS hybrid. Dropping all the innovative aspects of the game just makes this seems like an attempt at cashing in on the franchise's name, which, y'know, isn't terribly exciting to the fans; the lore was never terribly compelling to begin with, and this entry contributes nothing new on that front. If you're an avid tower defense enthusiast, sure, the game isn't bad, but you'd be better off playing the other games in the series or trying out a more polished, well-developed tower defense game like Sol Survivor.","January 28, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I will let you know right now that you should not play this game if you're not trying to play an intensely hardcore difficult tower defense game. You will try set after set of possible configurations of pathways and towers just to beat a simple level on normal difficulty once you make it halfway through the game. They will send far too many enemies and some of the strongest enemies in the game right at the start of the level with very limited resources in a way that borders on unfair. Also, don't expect much help from the community as there is few to no guides to help you if you get stuck. I'm all for difficult games but this is a tower defense game that seems built specifically for the player to fail, so I cannot recommend unless you enjoy torturing yourself.\n\n6/10\nWith all the tower defense games out there I cannot recommend this one unless you get it on the cheap.","December 18, 2014","false","11.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is a true 100% turret defense game unlike its bigger TD/FPS hybrid siblings, which is mostly why I found myself addicted to it. However, it bears a number of the annoying signature characteristics found in the Sanctum series. And by that I mean the player is tasked with building the foundations for the turrets, and using these same foundations to shape a maze like path for enemies to corral. That on its own is fine, but the problem lies with being able to build an entire maze before the game starts and only having enough cash for 2 or 3 turrets that can't manage the first wave.\n\nThis is the only turret defense game I've ever played where its not mostly passive building strategy, the player has to be very active between targeting and zapping enemies with manual weapons and sometimes even tear down and rebuild turrets further down range as the wave is still running.\n\nThe other really annoying Sanctum characteristic in this game are the turrets themselves. Some of the turrets are junk. Their purpose is to be abondoned and never used again as soon as something better become available. The turrets are also unbalanced in that a number of them aren't worth leveling up since its not cost efficient nor as effective vs building more weak towers. I'm not quite sure they did things this way\n\nAlso typical of the Sanctum series, SSTD is severely limiting. Out of the dozen or so turrets you can build, you're restricted to the 4 you choose on any map. I assume Coffee Stain Studios feels this adds to the game's strategy, but it doesn't. You can't exactly plan ahead for what you're going to need, so picking and choosing turrets tends to become trial and error. And speaking of bad strategy, the later levels force the player to pick specific perks. Of course I'm talking about the perk that has a chance of turning dead enemies into cash. Its not completely vital a perk to have, but oh boy does it sure help.\n\nIn spite of everything I've said so far, Super Sanctum TD is an OK turret defense. Its no Defense Grid, nor is it meant to be. And for what it is, it's pretty damn fun. The other reason I'm giving it a positive review is the cheap price.

I'm not new to the TD genre but this game simply doesn't have mercy on its players; you have to optimize your maze layout to perfection and be very careful of selecting which towers to employ or there's no way you'll progress far beyond the training area. The 16-bit graphics look nice and serve their purpose, but the sound design is weak and rudimentary.\n\nGenerally speaking, the game is way too hard and demands a far bigger commitment than I'm willing to make for what is basically a 2D flash TD game. Could've been much better if the devs weren't so hard-core. But I guess even the TD genre has to have its masochistic version of IWBTG.\n\nScore: 3/5","April 2, 2014","false","2.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I got this on sale for under $1, and it delivered everything that it promised.\n\nTower balance is reasonable, though obviously positioning them properly is always crucial. The in-game skills/unlocks present several different ways to tackle most levels, be it ability-heavy or tower-heavy. I rather liked the 100% sell value unlock, as then I could move max upgraded towers around to kite slow moving bosses, or explore strategies like powering up one lightning tower until it 1-shots everything. The game has just enough cheese in its strategies to keep you amused, as you plow through all 14 levels.\n\nThe achievements have good diversity - you'll unlock most of them just by playing. 1 or 2 are puzzle achievements, that require you to think about how to structure your maze and how to use tower synergies to unlock them. If you go for them, they force you to understand the game mechanics a little bit more, making you a better player.\n\nThe normal and hardmode achievements are well thought out (play every level on hard and win; play every level on normal and don't lose health) - easy for any TD veteran to accomplish.\n\nThere is one grindy achievement - kill 10,000 walkers - I groaned when I finished the game with only ~2700 of them defeated, as I thought it was going to take forever to get. It's actually not that bad... one playthrough of lvl 3 on survival with chargers and splash towers (like ACPs; take your pick) will get you most of the way there.\n\nOverall it was quite fun. I didn't notice any severe engine glitches that didn't work in my favour, but there were a few minor ones. Comboing time-rewind and teleport abilities has some odd/ineffective effects... Saving/loading is bugged, messing up tower stats and sell values, so be careful resuming a previous match. The game is also very likely to crash if you spam hundreds of mines at the end of your maze. I did have two crashes early on that were unrelated to cheese, but they happened on the first levels, which take only minutes to get through.\n\nOverall this TD feels like a 7/10 or 7.5/10. Priced right, with just enough polish and cheese. I enjoyed it.\n\n-BikeHelmet","December 21, 2014","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a masterpiece; it feels like you are playing a flash tower defense game, but good, and not in flash. It is far better than an extra gun skin for Sanctum 2. It is an experience you will come out of saying "Wow!", and suddenly you lost an hour, but it was worth it. It is so good, even if it were more expensive, that I wanted to share it, so I debated buying four copies until I realised I didn't have that many friends.

A simple game to play while you wait for a train, your next class, lunch break(?), in a five minute to 30 minute gap of doing nothing, etc.\n\nHOWEVER, it's not as fun as you advance in the waves.  Whenever you complete one mission/area, you have the option of continuing into survival mode. In these cases, you'll either instantly die or find a point where you've maxed everything out, but the enemy will ultimately obliterate your defenses without effort.  If you always want to win, tough luck, this game will make sure that you're destined to lose at one point or another.  Also, there will be times when you're forced to place certain structures up, in order to win, taking away your freedom of choice and flexibility in the gameplay.\n\nStill... I guess this game isn't for people who want to try hard to the max, but more of a time waster for periods of waiting and thinking.  Might as well get it if you can't be asked/fked to find a book to read instead.\n\nNote: This game does come with steam trading cards, which will help pay off the final price of this game.  Also it's literally a five second download.","June 23, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not some random "kill the runnning bugs" stuff you can find on free gamesites thousands of thousands times.\n\nThis lets YOU to build the concretes which turrets are built on. It changes routes of monsters to make the level your kind, to suit your tastes. Also, it's not some easy "i'll just put this and slap that" thoughtless building. The game is actually enough challenging to make the player think their choices. Also, the turret types, abilities and money are limited. New turret types, abilities, slots and stages are unlocked as you level up.\n\nGraphics won't need to be the usual 3D HQ for modern games you can fing behind every corner. It's old school gameplay and idea are the only things that matter and makes this therefore better than many other games you might pay over 10 euros for.\n\nIf arcade games are even a little bit your thing, I'll warmly recommend this. Low price makes it easy to buy and test out. And how about myself?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BikeHelmet/recommended/235250/","BikeHelmet","BikeHelmet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BikeHelmet/","1261 products in account","Super Sanctum TD is a short and sweet, simple flash-TD equivalent. I got this on sale for under $1, and it delivered everything that it promised.\n\nTower balance is reasonable, though obviously positioning them properly is always crucial. The in-game skills/unlocks present several different ways to tackle most levels, be it ability-heavy or tower-heavy. I rather liked the 100% sell value unlock, as then I could move max upgraded towers around to kite slow moving bosses, or explore strategies like powering up one lightning tower until it 1-shots everything. The game has just enough cheese in its strategies to keep you amused, as you plow through all 14 levels.\n\nThe achievements have good diversity - you'll unlock most of them just by playing. 1 or 2 are puzzle achievements, that require you to think about how to structure your maze and how to use tower synergies to unlock them. If you go for them, they force you to understand the game mechanics a little bit more, making you a better player.\n\nThe normal and hardmode achievements are well thought out (play every level on hard and win; play every level on normal and don't lose health) - easy for any TD veteran to accomplish.\n\nThere is one grindy achievement - kill 10,000 walkers - I groaned when I finished the game with only ~2700 of them defeated, as I thought it was going to take forever to get. It's actually not that bad... one playthrough of lvl 3 on survival with chargers and splash towers (like ACPs; take your pick) will get you most of the way there.\n\nOverall it was quite fun. I didn't notice any severe engine glitches that didn't work in my favour, but there were a few minor ones. Comboing time-rewind and teleport abilities has some odd/ineffective effects... Saving/loading is bugged, messing up tower stats and sell values, so be careful resuming a previous match. The game is also very likely to crash if you spam hundreds of mines at the end of your maze. I did have two crashes early on that were unrelated to cheese, but they happened on the first levels, which take only minutes to get through.\n\nOverall this TD feels like a 7/10 or 7.5/10. Priced right, with just enough polish and cheese. I enjoyed it.\n\n-BikeHelmet","December 21, 2014","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also predicts the path(s) that the creeps will travel along (although not always correctly).\n\nAnother positive: powers.  There are many of them and (when fully leveled) you get to pick 4 of them.\n\nEnjoyable retro soundtrack and lovely pixel art.\n\nOne small technical note: there does not need to be a toggle for survival mode as one can simply enter it after playing through identical campaign levels.  I once accidentally played through 9 levels of survival while trying to up my star rating on a level.  This was annoying and unnecessary.\n\nNo plot except what you bring to it.  Sort of a Catcher in The Rye kind of thing; the monsters exist so that you can stop them instead of the cliff existing so that you can save the lives of small baseball players.\n\nFinally, since no review of a tower defense game would be complete without a comparison to Defense Grid: this game is unlikely to make you realize that sometimes the portion of our lives that we are not simply an intelligence ported into a computer for tactical reasons and that we must take time every day to enjoy whatever berries may be in season.\n\nIn my opinion: worth about $2.99.","April 4, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can call airstrikes on these cows, and they will survive. Also, a tower uses electric sticks, and the electricity can go to the cow about 10 feet away. The most an electric bolt can go is 6 feet. Also, the cows have utters on the back, and not on the bottom. As a result, it looks like they have jelly mohawks. Finally, you kill the cows, they disappear. If they disappear, what's the point?

You have a creative variety of 3 towers, Telsa, Electric Beam, and Bases. Bases are extremely important, as you need one in order to put the towers on. There are also skills, like the cardboard cut-out storm. Overall, the mechanics are excellent.\n\nThe DLC is also cool. For $1.99, you can get the cow pack, which turns the enemy into cows. You can also get the ending pack for $4.99, which unlocks a 2-minute cutscene showing the ending.\n\nIf you can look over the unrealism, this is just cocaine. However, I just can't play this game right. It just doesn't feel like cocaine because of it's unrealism.

It's not some random "kill the runnning bugs" stuff you can find on free gamesites thousands of thousands times.\n\nThis lets YOU to build the concretes which turrets are built on. It changes routes of monsters to make the level your kind, to suit your tastes. Also, it's not some easy "i'll just put this and slap that" thoughtless building. The game is actually enough challenging to make the player think their choices. Also, the turret types, abilities and money are limited. New turret types, abilities, slots and stages are unlocked as you level up.\n\nGraphics won't need to be the usual 3D HQ for modern games you can fing behind every corner. It's old school gameplay and idea are the only things that matter and makes this therefore better than many other games you might pay over 10 euros for.\n\nIf arcade games are even a little bit your thing, I'll warmly recommend this. Low price makes it easy to buy and test out. And how about myself?

Both companies agree in taking their time into the game, which is good. You run a resturant in uptown Bethesda, and you have to keep you customers happy. However, there are cows that are don't want to be eaten, and they escape. So your goal is to chase those cows. First thing I want to get off my chest, is that this game is very unrealistic. You can call airstrikes on these cows, and they will survive. Also, a tower uses electric sticks, and the electricity can go to the cow about 10 feet away. The most an electric bolt can go is 6 feet. Also, the cows have utters on the back, and not on the bottom. As a result, it looks like they have jelly mohawks. Finally, you kill the cows, they disappear. If they disappear, what's the point? You don't get the meat! Finally, the graphics are TURRIBLE. The games graphics are JUST PIXELS. It looks like an Atari 2600 game. All of this result in an unrealistic experience.\n\nIf you can look over the unrealism, then this is one of the best tower defence games out there. You have a creative variety of 3 towers, Telsa, Electric Beam, and Bases. Bases are extremely important, as you need one in order to put the towers on. There are also skills, like the cardboard cut-out storm. Overall, the mechanics are excellent.\n\nThe DLC is also cool. For $1.99, you can get the cow pack, which turns the enemy into cows. You can also get the ending pack for $4.99, which unlocks a 2-minute cutscene showing the ending.\n\nIf you can look over the unrealism, this is just cocaine. However, I just can't play this game right. It just doesn't feel like cocaine because of it's unrealism. It feels more like cheap weed.\n\nOverall, this gets a 3/11\n\n*To be serious for a second, this is actually a good game. I personally enjoyed it, and this is a steal for .60.

You are given a selection of boards to play on for the various missions and unlock new towers and powers as you go, between each wave you're given build time which also acts as time where you're able to plot out the pathway on the boards, though the earlier levels are very linear.\nThe game has a good selection of towers and powers that can catter to varying play styles, though using the shock tower pretty much gaurantee's a win on levels which only use ground targets, making the later game somewhat dissapointingly easy compared to how it should feel.\nOnce the game is completed, you can tackle the levels on hard if you hadn't already done so, or try survival and see how long you can last for against wave after wave on enemies.\nThe soundtrack and audio is quite simple and enjoyable, nothing majorly memorable but pleasent non the less.\n\nFor a 30p purchase, I would say to buy this game even if you're not that much of a tower defence game fan, its only 30p after all, you wont even notice the change is gone and I've managed to sink about 9 hours into it thus far. At full price, I would say to only buy if you enjoy retro tower defence games, though it may feel a bit short at full price.","March 14, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A simple game to play while you wait for a train, your next class, lunch break(?), in a five minute to 30 minute gap of doing nothing, etc.\n\nHOWEVER, it's not as fun as you advance in the waves.  Whenever you complete one mission/area, you have the option of continuing into survival mode. In these cases, you'll either instantly die or find a point where you've maxed everything out, but the enemy will ultimately obliterate your defenses without effort.  If you always want to win, tough luck, this game will make sure that you're destined to lose at one point or another.  Also, there will be times when you're forced to place certain structures up, in order to win, taking away your freedom of choice and flexibility in the gameplay.\n\nStill... I guess this game isn't for people who want to try hard to the max, but more of a time waster for periods of waiting and thinking.  Might as well get it if you can't be asked/fked to find a book to read instead.\n\nNote: This game does come with steam trading cards, which will help pay off the final price of this game.  Also it's literally a five second download.","June 23, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've always enjoyed the genre, but I guess its never been able to keep my interest. However, Super Sanctum TD has opened a door for me, and beyond it is a genre I want to fully experience.\n\nThe difficult thing about reviewing Super Sanctum TD is that I have no other experience to compare it to. That being said, I really, really enjoyed it. As a beginner to the genre I found the pacing to be on point, as the waves steadily grew in difficulty. I'll admit that I became stuck on a level for a few hours--trying and trying again to survive the onslaught. My mistake was thinking that it was your level (and in turn what items and weapons you've unlocked) that mattered when in reality it was a matter of strategy. Strategy plays a huge part in this genre, and when I realized that it wasn't my level but how I had set up my paths that was the problem, I beat the level with a perfect rating. Super Sanctum TD was teaching me that brains beats brawn in its playground.\n\nYou have access to a wealth of different towers and perks to unlock as you progressively beat levels of the game. There are countless combinations to try out, and I have no doubt to each item's viability. There's also a lot of variety here, that lets you figure out your own playstyle. I for one leaned towards slowing enemies down while they got pummeled by towers that used AOE attacks. You also have access to a skill tree that grants bonuses to your towers and other areas. I haven't played much more after beating the campaign, so I haven't fully explored the tree. I did like the ability to regain all your points for redistribution whenever I wanted. It was helpful when I realized I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nIn the end, all I can really say that I found Super Santcum TD an awesome experience. It certainly makes me want to play more of the genre. I definitely recommend this one for those times when you just want to sit down and play something for a few minutes without having to go too indepth.","March 5","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has all the fundamental right, but lack any extra touch that would make the whole better than the sum of its parts. It tooks me 15h to get all achievements. Not a bad experience by any mean but  a little lack of excitement though.\nThere are clearly better low price TD, like Kingdom Rush or Defender Quest for example.\n\n- There are many tower types, but you can select only 4 tower types (same for special powers) for each map, which feels a bit low. Especially when there are flyers creeps Anti Air tower is almost mandatory, which leave 3 open slots.\n- only 14 levels, the first two being more like tutorials.\n- Production quality is just above amateur.\n- a few ugly system crash which needed a computer restart in Full Screen mode, windowed mode is OK\n\n+ 35 perks to choose from\n+ online leaderboard\n+ endless survival add alittle replayability, it is a bit repetitive however\n+ some levels offers decent mazing options, but experienced TD fans will easily figure out the best path.","May 6, 2015","false","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not some random "kill the runnning bugs" stuff you can find on free gamesites thousands of thousands times.\n\nThis lets YOU to build the concretes which turrets are built on. It changes routes of monsters to make the level your kind, to suit your tastes. Also, it's not some easy "i'll just put this and slap that" thoughtless building. The game is actually enough challenging to make the player think their choices. Also, the turret types, abilities and money are limited. New turret types, abilities, slots and stages are unlocked as you level up.\n\nGraphics won't need to be the usual 3D HQ for modern games you can fing behind every corner. It's old school gameplay and idea are the only things that matter and makes this therefore better than many other games you might pay over 10 euros for.\n\nIf arcade games are even a little bit your thing, I'll warmly recommend this. Low price makes it easy to buy and test out. And how about myself? I ended up spending hours on this, and what's the best, Super Sanctum TD takes more than just few hours to play through completely.","June 23, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It implements the old tower defense games into the sanctum universe. The missions/levels are not overly linear so it has some variation in map-size/map-form.\n\nThe tower-balancing is very interesting as the beginner-towers are almost useless in the last levels. That's sometimes sad because I liked the first tower 'Gatling', although it is very logical.\n\nI had some knowledge of the hostiles so I had that going for me, which is nice. In my opinion, this Sanctum is better than the fps ones.\n\n7.4/10","December 29, 2014","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It starts up fine and doesn't lag at all. Each tower can be upgraded three times. Some towers attack just ground, some just air, and some ground and air. All levels have a survival mode, and every level has a leaderboard.\n\nThere are upgrades that carry from level to level in the form of commander upgrades which can be reset at any time without penalty which lets you experiment with different tower specs and loadouts. There are also special spell-like abilities that you can employ such as a bomb that resets every 20seconds, croud control effects such as freezing, and temporary tower boosts.\n\nThere are strategy elements to how towers are placed, how abilities are used, and what your spec is, and how they compliment each other. There are lots of options to play with, and it is fun to experiment. It is not as deep of strategy as a larger game, but this is not meant to be that kind of game. A basic level can be completed in 10 minutes. In survival mode a level can last an hour easily. This game is very very accesible and easy to drop in and out of.\n\nThe difficulty escallates rather slowly, but with survival modes and leader boards you are ensured a challenge. That said I am past the first half of the game, and did so casually from my baby's hospital room. I got this title on sale for under $1, and it has been well worth it. Very happy with this game and purchase, and replayability is awesome.\n\nFor the price, depth of strategy, and replayability I give this a solid 7/10, and if you like tower defense it is a no-brainer to pick it up I believe.","March 11","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's what you want from hard mode. The survival mode alone is worth the price. Havent messed around with defense grid enough to see if it has survival but i like the controller support. Where's Super sanctum TD 2 with some next gen 2d graphics is what i want to know. I didn't think much of the fps sanctums. Orcs must die has that crown. I'll probably grab OMD some time if it has a survival ranked global leader board like this does and most games should have. Super sanctum TD is a well pollished tower defense that every tower defense fan should own. It has that one more go feel i dont really get from others tower defense games.

I've always enjoyed the genre, but I guess its never been able to keep my interest. However, Super Sanctum TD has opened a door for me, and beyond it is a genre I want to fully experience.\n\nThe difficult thing about reviewing Super Sanctum TD is that I have no other experience to compare it to. That being said, I really, really enjoyed it. As a beginner to the genre I found the pacing to be on point, as the waves steadily grew in difficulty. I'll admit that I became stuck on a level for a few hours--trying and trying again to survive the onslaught. My mistake was thinking that it was your level (and in turn what items and weapons you've unlocked) that mattered when in reality it was a matter of strategy. Strategy plays a huge part in this genre, and when I realized that it wasn't my level but how I had set up my paths that was the problem, I beat the level with a perfect rating. Super Sanctum TD was teaching me that brains beats brawn in its playground.\n\nYou have access to a wealth of different towers and perks to unlock as you progressively beat levels of the game. There are countless combinations to try out, and I have no doubt to each item's viability. There's also a lot of variety here, that lets you figure out your own playstyle. I for one leaned towards slowing enemies down while they got pummeled by towers that used AOE attacks. You also have access to a skill tree that grants bonuses to your towers and other areas. I haven't played much more after beating the campaign, so I haven't fully explored the tree. I did like the ability to regain all your points for redistribution whenever I wanted. It was helpful when I realized I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nIn the end, all I can really say that I found Super Santcum TD an awesome experience. It certainly makes me want to play more of the genre. I definitely recommend this one for those times when you just want to sit down and play something for a few minutes without having to go too indepth.","March 5","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
