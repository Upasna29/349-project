"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toroikun/recommended/440/","Toroikun","fuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toroikun/","103 products in account","My hours. help.\n\nI wrote something for real!\n\nThese hours are legit, I played this game a lot in the past to avoid some tragic stuff in real life. I was young and didn't really have my gaming consoles anymore because of my brothers and I had a really bad pc, which i still own. TF2 was one of the games i could play pretty well on this pc but with horrid graphics, but it was one of the more fun games I installed. I met some real cool and nice people on this game as well as people who i plan to keep by my side. The community back then was more humble compared to nowadays. You have competitive gamers who spam their bind keys with unfunny/gross jokes and very obnoxious people who are either yelling at you or telling you to do specific things to win the game. When really, it doesn't even matter if you win or lose.  However, you also have those people who are really awesome and you may meet some nice friends along the way! Although you never know what kinda person you're going to meet on this game. In my honest opinion, if you want to have a game to just waste time on (and money) or just mess around with people you know (which is what I do now), this is perfect. Esspecially the mann vs. machine co-op. I mainly play that now. Although to me, the game lost its touch, update wise, and I moved onto other games.\n\nI believe it's worth a shot to try it out but other than that, I'd keep it as a casual game. I don't think the competitive scene is worth getting into anymore because it's being flooded by crude people. Atleast from my experiance after over about 4+ years of playing it just got worse and worse. You will eventually be tied into drama even if you try to avoid it. You'll be more stressed than actually having fun, I'll tell you that!\n\nAlthough in all seriousness, this game is losing its touch and probably isn't worth making it your main game MAINLY because the updates they've been releasing are becoming very dull and not as great as they used to be. BUT, it's a great game to just play to pass the time and have fun! All you'll really notice nowdays is...people really love to trade more than actually play. Living off as a free to play would be very tough and you'd need to be patient with items you would want, unless you got that MONEY! Hope this helps.\n\n\nOne last thing, I am not saying this game is bad in any way. I am saying that it's worth trying and playing with friends, or even meeting people! Although there are some downsides that you won't like, such as some stuff I pointed out above. Strictly towards the community. I personally think you should have this game as a side game rather than your come home to play sorta thing. Have it as a once in a while game, because it's nothing to be big about, unless you really do not like most of the millions of other games out there.\n\nJust give it a shot and see what you think! Have fun <3","October 12, 2014","true","868.4"," 5,212 of 5,605 people (93%) found this review helpful 1,111 people found this review funny","93","212","5","111","347"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/440/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","I think Jerma summed up this game pretty nicely...\n\n"Maybe you got like two Pyros that just installed the game ten minutes ago. They don't have any hats, they're spraying ♥♥♥♥ and they're having a blast. They might even be at the wrong point. They might be going backwards to the point that's already been capped.\n\nOn the same team, there's a Scout with a Hale's Own Scattergun. He's got 18 kills with a 17 killstreak, he just got 18. He's going 'I just got 18, sick!' He runs up the stairs, he's trying his ♥♥♥ off. He's get *beeping noises* dodging the 'Oh, the sentry almost got me!' He looks up to his left when he gets up the stairs on Gorge and there's two sandwich Heavies having a ♥♥♥♥ing picnic. So he stops for a second and goes, 'Two... nnnggh!' so he walks forward and gets blown up by a soldier's rocket next door...\n\n...The two sandwich Heavies then decide to move their picnic. There's ants. 'There's ants here, honey. I wanna get out of here.' So they get up, they pack their sandwiches, pack up their lunches, and their breakfast, and whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they're eating. They get up and walk toward the door to go to RED because they think, 'That spot near the A point for RED is pretty good.' They walk out the door, and they see four Level 3 Sentry Guns pointing at them. They get shot a million times and blow up, and there's like nine Engineers swinging their wrenches in random directions.\n\nThe BLU Scout, at this point, respawns, and walks by the at least 3-4 statues because we all know there's four people AFK when you play this game, you go by the museum of people standing still. He walks out the door and readies his weapon, he's ready, 'I'm going to get another 20 killstreak, just you watch Gaben, I'm going to praise Gaben!' And he goes forward and starts shooting, and he gets backstabbed by a Spy that has been sitting with the Cloak and Dagger in the corner for at least the last 68 seconds."\n\nNormally when I do reviews, I turn into a critic and start to examine that game, pointing out every little flaw and pro and determining a final score. However, Team Fortress 2 (or TF2 for short) helped me make so many memories that if I actually tried to make a fair review on it, it would still be way too biased to consider a valid review.\n\nTeam Fortress 2, is, obviously, an amazing game. The teamplay is necessary and going out and attacking solo may be difficult. You need teammates in order to survive and win. The graphics are unique to a shooter game and really makes it a special game.\n\nI'm not here to explain the gameplay or graphics or whatnot.\n\n\n\nI love this game because of its charm.\n\n\n\nThe game has such a unique and diverse cast of characters, you can't help to love all of them at some point. Scout is cocky and overconfident. Spy, another one of the characters in the game, is technically Scout's father. Soldier is a crazed WWII American patriot. He never actually joined the Army, but instead, he had his own personal Nazi killing spree. His roommate was a magician named Merasmus, who grew to hate Soldier. Pyro is mysterious, but portrays the world as one big happy paradise, known as Pyroland. Demoman is a Scottish alcoholic who, due to Merasmus, lost his eye that is now haunted. Heavy, although he appears to be dim-witted, is actually very intelligent and looks over three sisters. Engineer is very intelligent as well, and his grandfather was a major contributor to keeping the war with RED and BLU continue. Medic isn't fond of normal forms of medicine, but is still an important member nonetheless. Sniper is from New Zealand, but was raised in Australia. He prefers working from a distance and his backstory is very similar to Superman's. Spy is the master of disguise, and is technically Scout's father, as said before. Of all the characters, he appears to be the most "mature" and appears to be the ringleader at many times.\n\nNot only that, but the game has an interesting story. I would not like to get too detailed with it. However, it makes little to no sense but is still funny, engaging, and gives TF2 much more depth. There is also a storyline that takes place a few years later where Mann Co. is being attacked, so the mercenaries have to defend it, called Mann vs. Machine. This game mode ties in with the TF comics, which explain many characters' backstories and is currently still in the works as of this review. The other comics (all of which can be found on TF2's official website) are all funny and charming in their own way as well.\n\nThe community has been quite debatable on how nice it is at many times, but in the end, it's still an overall great community. I've seen people give out stuff, others mentor some of the newbs (something I do as well) along with much, much more.\n\nYes. the game is considered a "pay-to-win game" but it isn't necessarily a pay-to-win game. With lots of patience, you will get what you want from the game, whether it be hats, weapons, or whatever it is you want. The game has a learning curve that isn't too steep, but become dedicated and you'll fall in love with it.\n\n\n\nNo matter how many times you rage to a W+M1 pyro that destroyed your 16 killstreak, or cheer when you unbox an Unusual, or maybe discover a few friends or learn a few things, Team Fortress 2 has been a huge part of my PC gaming life and without it, I would be as bored as hell. I cannot recommend this game enough, and I hope that many more memories are made on here.\n\nValve may be cash cows, but you can't help but admit they are amazing when it comes to making games. Portal, Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike, but this game stands out from the rest to me.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, yes, yes, YES.","May 7, 2015","true","123.8"," 2,074 of 2,259 people (92%) found this review helpful 825 people found this review funny","92","074","2","825","66"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/440/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Team Fortress 2. Being ranked as the third most-played game[steamcharts.com] on Steam, Team Fortress 2 is probably one of the best free-to-play games we've got.\nWhy is it so popular? Let's take a look, shall we?\n\nFirst off, the obvious: It's free. 100% free. This means its accessible to everyone on Steam. This is just the icing on the cake though. What really shines about TF2 is the game itself.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 usually consists of two teams (Red and Blue) going head to head against each other. Sometimes fulfilling certain objectives or just downright killing each other. There are many, many maps and modes, such as Payload, Capture Points, and Mann VS Machine. But the general idea no matter the map or mode is to KILL EVERYTHING THAT MOVES! And my god, is it fun to do so. The game has 9 playable mercenaries, each actually being a certain "class". Each class is divided into 3 different roles: Offense, Defense, and Support. Let's go over each role and class.\n\nOffensive roles specialize in dealing damage to the opposing team. These are your main attack force. Scouts are the speedy hit and run class, with the ability to double or even triple jump depending on equipped items. Soldiers pack a bit more firepower with their rocket launchers, which gives them not only power, but mobility due to the ability known as "rocket jumping". The Pyro is great at setting the opposition on fire, as well as extinguishing burning teammates using an airblast.\n\nDefensive roles serve to inhibit enemy access and to hold enemies back from vital points on the map. Overall, the defensive group has the most firepower of all the groups. Demomen can safeguard areas with stickybombs that they can detonate when enemies come by. Heavies are great for mowing down incoming troops and pushing back forces. Heavies can also keep enemies in an area while whittling their health for teammates to finish off. Engineers can build Sentry Guns for effective area defense, as well as build Teleporters and Dispensers for logistical support of the team.\n\nSupport classes cannot hold the fight on their own, but their specialized abilities can tip the balance in their team's favor. They offer the offensive and defensive classes an extra edge in battle and can help turn the tide of the game. Whether crippling the enemy advance from behind or keeping teammates healed, the support classes are always handy to have around. Medics are the team healers, capable of providing numerous buffs depending on their equipments. Spies are great for sneak attacks or eiliminating key threats. Snipers excel at long range, also eliminating key threats, as well as extinguishing burning teammates with jarate and providing a damage boost to teammates.\n\nNext, let's look at the presentation.\nTF2 has a very unqiue art style. It's somewhat cartoonish, but very appealing. It's simple, and un-complex. But it doesn't need to be complex. It's simplicity is it's strength. Everything is detailed enough to where you can easily tell whats going on, what a specific model or item is, and they all stand out. The soundtrack is also very appealing and catchy, especially the main theme. I personally have it as a ringtone/alarm tone on my smartphone! :)\n\nOne of the best aspects of TF2 is the Steam Workshop. Users can submit designs for items and weapons, and possibly have them added to the game! A very lucrative sub-market has also emerged from this game in the form of the Crate Keys. That's a whole different ballgame in and of itself, so we won't get into it here.\n\nDuring normal gameplay on most servers, you can obtain random items, weapons, and sometimes crates, and taunts....through the item drops system. You can only receive so many drops per week, and you will get them randomly as you play. You can use these items and weapons to customise your mercenary's loadout, or you can use them to craft other items, hats, and weapons. You can take multiples of items and craft them into Scrap, then Reclaimed Metal, then Refined Metal. You can then use these metals to craft specific class weapons/items, among other things. The crafting system is simple yet robust, with lots of possiblities. Some of it is very luck based. You can take some very common items and end up crafting a super rare hat or gun worth a lot of moolah on the Steam Market!\n\nAll-in-all, Team Fortress 2 is just a very fun game. Endless entertainment awaits when you start up this game, especially if you play with friends on your favorite server. Probably the best free-to-play game on Steam.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383235670\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","October 23, 2014","true","266.8"," 1,254 of 1,392 people (90%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","90","254","1","68","32"

There is absolutely no other simulator quite like this one. The first time you start the simulator, you join a server where you can play a minigame where you show off your hats and items. If you kill a person three times in a row in the minigame, you get your very first hat: the Gibus. This is where it really starts; To play the simulator correctly, you have to spend money in the market place, made by Valve. After that, while you play the minigame, you can find hats which you can trade for, or collect! There is many other people who wants to collect and trade hats, just like you! After you collect enough items and/or hats, try joining a trade server! There, the REAL fun begins!

I was a filthy console peasant at the time who only played games for achievements. I booted it up on my Xbox 360 and didn't get what I expected. I thought of games such as portal and half life like stupid creations. I saw that they were probably some of the best games I've ever played in my lifetime. I was dumbstruck with how I could have missed these games for 3 years. After finishing portal, I played Team Fortress 2. From what I learned, It was an xbox live only game. I was disgruntled and I thought it was a bad game.\n\n1 month later, I got xbox live 12 month card so I could watch netflix for as long as I pleased. I suddenly remembered The Orange Box. Out of curiosity, I played a match of 2fort (the xbox 360 version is still not updated to this day and still has 5 maps.) I was bewildered by its gameplay, and intrigued by its cartoonish graphics. I stopped being a COD fanboy due to this game. I remember my first kill was between me and another scout, as we swung baseball bats.\n\nI played it for a long, LONG time. In 2011 I learned of Steam. I realized it was made by the company that made TOB. Estatic, I downloaded it on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC, not caring if it was a virus or not. I would later then learn this was a F2P game. I would be lieing if I told that I hadn't just about ♥♥♥♥ my pants about all the content in it. Although my PC lagged like a ♥♥♥♥♥, I played it in amazement from how different it is, so I sold my Xbox 360. I got a better PC and kept on playing.\n\nI soon used the real purpose of steam and played Hotline Miami, POSTAL 2, The Binding of Isaac, etc. But I always came back to this. Soon I had logged 4000+ hours into this game. I lost my skills from this game and had also lost interest in this game since all Valve focused on was the HORSE♥♥♥♥ING SHITEATING ♥♥♥♥♥ SNIFFING ♥♥♥♥ ROBBING COW HUMPING BULL♥♥♥♥COCKADOOKIE games known as DOTA 2 and CS:GO. I still miss the days when this game would be constantly focused on by Valve.\n\nIn the end, I quit TF2. I still love this game and always will, but it hurts to see it barely updated with the exception of patches. I had the dream of reaching for an unusual flaming teams captain, but I failed at trading and it was impossible for me to find good deals. A friend I have who started TF2 a year ago mastered the game in 100 hours. He gained 3 unusuals during his first 100-600 hours when it took me more than 3600. I am going to give him all of my valueable items. So in the end I want to go back to doing what I love, and its to playing many games.\n\nOverall, I give this a game a perfect 10/10, and I'm not being sarcastic. This game changed my taste in all games, and I love it for that. This is why I recommend this game.","August 12, 2015","true","015.2"," 1,552 of 1,742 people (89%) found this review helpful 370 people found this review funny","89","552","1","370","41"

Remember, don't play well, but pay well as you are given very interesting and informative facts about your mother's social life and the size of your crotch from intellectual children wearing their student loans as digital representations of hats.  But hold on there, tiger, there's so much more!  This here is a team game with 9 classes.  Your team mates will pick very strategic combos such as: pyro, pyro, pyro, pyro, scout, scout, scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, pyro, engineer, pyro, soldier, pyro, and defenitely not medic because why heal when you can squeal (yes, the E button to call for heals).  "But why does this matter when I can dance the conga in the spawn?" good question my boy! You don't have to leave the spawn!  This is called setting up the Armaments Fun Kamp (also known as the AFK) where you can trade, taunt, and even just join and leave your keyboard to show how much you love using up space on a server.  Plus, you too can witness the decorative atmosphere known as "capture points" and "intelligence briefcases" that are placed in very important places on the map for you to stare at, but don't touch! As best said by xXx_W0lF_xXx "Why get the objective when you can get kills?" A modern wiseman he is.  You can complete your wallet vacuum experience by opening a "crate o' ♥♥♥♥" which is literally $2.49 to ride an emotional rollercoaster which ends in disappointment and a gun that was good the month before you received it. But that's ok! You can make your pathetic peashooter interesting by purchasing a nametag and conjuring up creative nomenclature for it such as "noob punisher" and "looks like ur dead lel Xd".   So what are you waiting for? Grab your lighter and all the dollar bills you can find because this is an offer you don't want to miss out on! I definitely didn't play over 1,000 hours of this!

Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.\n\nAt the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.\n\nPlayer versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.\n\n'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour".\n\nIn addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.\n\nIn addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.\n\nThe game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since November 2007 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.","February 15, 2014","true","971.0"," 542 of 601 people (90%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","90","542","601","12","104"

And you think you're starting to get this whole "trading system", but you don't exactly see why it's so important to everyone.\n\nMonths 2-6:  You are addicted to trading, more than playing the game itself. You have countless hats, stranges and keys, and anyone you trade with and all your friends admire how extremely rich you are.\n\nMonths 6-12: You've just changed your name to (xxxxxxx) #RoadToUnusual.

When I first got Team Fortress 2, it was an experience that can't be beat. This first-person shooter can't go to say that this is probably the greatest in gaming history. From trading to crafting, this game will keep you on th edge of your seat until you know it's ready to stop playing. There are 9 classes, each that is unique and makes the game fairly balanced, making th game experience even more fun. With all the updates, there are some positive and negative effects than can affect the Team Fortress 2 trading community as a whole, but the whole aspect is to game, have fun, and enjoy your time on this game. It's your decision to buy from the store. It's your decision to craft metal and hats. It's your decision to play, idle, or even be a teammate and balance the rosters. The community is just like this game: random. So if you wish to stop playing other FPS titles and take a break from imbalanced games, then your choice is this: you won't be dissapointed.","November 25, 2013","true","626.9"," 684 of 805 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","684","805","0","7"

As the download was running I sat on my chair eager to play the game, I started searching up some videos on the game and basic gameplay mechanics so I could get the edge on the competition, I learned many things that I could apply in battle! Before I knew it the download was complete! Awesome!\n\nI sat there as the game loaded up, eager to get into a server! I saw a map called "ctf_2fort" "That map sounds fun!" I exclaimed, I joined the server and was greeted with a class selection screen. I figured I should play the sniper since my experience in other FPS would help me through.\n\nMy first ever spawn!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebastionoforder/recommended/440/","thebastionoforder","Blades","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebastionoforder/","29 products in account","I should have probably written a recommendation for this game a long time ago, as it is literally the most fun I’ve ever had in an online game. Playing with, or without a team of friends, competitive or casual, this game delivers consistent fun that never really gets old.\n\nThe dynamics and balance of class-based shooter gameplay that exists in this game is unparalleled anywhere else that I’ve seen, with no one way to play being superior.\n\nThe pay-to-advance mechanics in other freemium games aren't present here, as aside from a few utility unlocks and different play styles, the stock weapons are largely the best for every character, with the microtransation and trading economies being largely cosmetic and for non gameplay-affecting in nature.\n\nThe community support for competitive play is amazing, with all levels of skill supported, and many servers dedicated to skill improvement, in addition to casual gaming. The community is also amazing, with no shortage of community content, media, artwork, and a plethora of gaming networks that bring the TF2niverse to life outside the game, and into the rest of the world. (Still waiting for the civilian bobblehead from Meet the Sniper)\n\nThere is also a virtual macro economy, with Valve's random item distribution system leading to a diverse market for all things TF2, within TF2; hats, specialty weapons, memorabilia items, that can all be used in-game to customize your character and add depth to your actions in-game and within the steam community.\n\nThe bugs due to lack of optimization, and occasional grief caused by players abusing vote-related moderation systems are two things that I can complain about with the internal game, as it's good, wholesome fun regardless if you're just starting, or are a competitive pro. Although the presence of random critical hits and lack of attention paid to weapon balance- as seen by the countless items banned from competitive play due to being role-breaking or requiring too little skill to be effective is proof of- is a cause for concern.\n\nIf valve put as much effort into balance (and incorporated professional and community feedback) as they did into cosmetic items updates, then we'd be golden.\n\nEven though this game is many years old, the community that plays it really brings it to life once you get into it and with the nonstop fun that it provides, It’s one of the genuinely few online games that I can wholeheartedly give my seal of approval to.\n\nDo i reccomend this game? Of course. There's no boring tedium of waiting around for your opponent to act, and hard-set roles and proceedures that needs to be adhered to, lest your team's fun gets ruined thanks to one person slipping up like in many of the other games these days. (heck, you can charge at a rocket launcher-wielding enemy with a claymore sword, and kill him if you pull it off correctly) I think it allows for more personal expression and playstyles than i think exist in a lot of games.\n\n9/10 for doing almost everything right that can be done in a game; it'd be a 10/10 if they would just listen to community feedback and remove RNG and rework ancient, unbalanced maps and content that are relics from the launch game.\n\nAlso for providing not just something fun to play, but a universe to be part of.","March 19, 2014","true","679.5"," 171 of 179 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","171","179","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BuryWhatsLeftOfYe/recommended/440/","BuryWhatsLeftOfYe","Soop Can","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BuryWhatsLeftOfYe/","5 products in account","I have played this game for an entire year;  time for my account on it.\n\nI have logged 2,407 hours at the time of writing this review.\n\nThe fact that this game is pushing a decade old, and is still the 3rd or 4th most played game on Steam should hint to you something; This game is good, and at the price of absolutely free, why the ♥♥♥♥ have you not downloaded it yet?\n\nThis game has a special place in my heart; there's not one game that has let me know people from all sorts of walks of life, and get to play with, or against them, or end up being Sandvich-sharing, congaing friends in the end; a game that can hold your interest for 2,407 total hours, and people's overall interest for 9 years, is obviously a game you need to try.\n\nNow, to the core value of the game; this is easily the most balanced shooter out there; this game is "Pay2Pimp", otherwise known as pay for a crapton of virtual hats that give you no actual advantage in-game except making you look more suavy. Everything in this game can be earned by just playing the game, and there's nothing in this game that exclusively a P2P user can get over a F2P user that actually gives them an advantage in-game, it's truly F2P, and doesn't require you to buy stuff to get ahead in the game, unless you want to really get involved in TF2's dynamic trading.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 has more gamemodes than any shooter I have ever seen before; and I CHALLENGE you to find a game with more gamemodes and variety than TF2. Along with the core implemented gamemodes in TF2, there are a ton of mods, or other gamemodes made by the community if you get tired of Capture Points, Payload, King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, Attack/Defend, Mannpower, Territory Control, Medieval Mode, PASS Time, Robot Destruction, Mann vs Machine, Player Destruction, Payload Race, Arena Mode, Competitive Modes, Highlander Modes, and Special Delivery, along with 86 offical maps to go along with these core modes, along with more maps from the community workshop being added into the game over time; you'll never have something you haven't done in TF2.\n\nNow, off the topic of TF2 and it's overall core gameplay; people keep saying they don't want to try TF2, saying it's for little kiddies, or the hackers make this game ruined; VAC now detects LAMEbox Premium; the hack that was said to be "un-VAC-able" this game can please any demographic, to people who want a fun game to pick up once, and never put down, to people who just love to trade and upgrade the value of their inventories with the game's dynamic economy, or even the competitive demographic, as Valve is testing Matchmaking Beta for TF2.\n\nThis game is free; there's no risk to trying it. You have nothing to lose, and so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much to gain, after playing it for a little; I wish everyone could see the magic behind this game.","May 3","true","627.7"," 164 of 180 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","164","180","23","32"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/440/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Team Fortress 2 is a FPS game, developed by Valve, releasing in October 2007 on Steam, Xbox 360 and PC. You are probably going to see this review and think “Why are you reviewing TF2, everyone knows what it is about!” You will be right; however there is a small portion of people who have not ventured into TF2’s world, so this will be for you!\n\nGameplay for Team Fortress 2 is based around various different game modes, which you take part in online servers.  You join a team and choose one of nine different classes to play as. Some of the game modes include the classic capture the flag, control points, king of the hill, and payload – which requires you to move a cart across the map with a bomb attached to it, into the enemies base. The 9 different classes all feel very different to each other, but ultimately will fit into one of three roles; offense, defence and support. Offensive characters are the ones built for dealing large sums of damage to your foes. The defensive ones, whilst these also deal damage, are much more equipped for doing this from entrenched positions, and the support roles add different features to the team with healing or other special abilities which act as a benefit for your team, or a hindrance to the opponents.  The classes are all really simple to learn how to use, but can be pretty tricky in mastering the art of the class.\n\nMy favourite game mode in Team Fortress 2 would have to be Mann vs Machine. This is a six player co-op mode, where you have to defend your base from waves of AI controlled enemies. In between waves you are able to purchase upgrades for your character to use for the rest of the match. This game mode also offers a “Mann up” mode, which requires you to purchase a ticket, in order to take part in events on official servers, to be in for a chance to win cosmetic items after you finish the mode. Even if you stick to the free side of this mode, you will have a boat load of fun if you can find a team of players and get on voice chat together.\n\nGraphically, since the game is running the Source engine, it looks gorgeous. The cartoony style of art on show gives the game a unique charm and feels which cannot be mimicked by any other game to date. Sound effects and sound tracks are all on point too.\n\nTF2 has a training mode that will ease newer players into the game; this is especially handy for people who are particularly new to the FPS genre as well. This is a game which definitely gets better the better you are at it; and getting better at it only comes with practice. If you find a class you are interested in, and stick with it, you’ll soon get to a point where you are coming top of the scoreboard at the end of the game. Of course it helps to have a little experience with all of the classes because diversity is key in these multiplayer type games, but having a main is also a good idea too.\n\nMy play time on TF2 is dwarfed by many, I have only been playing for about seventeen hours so far, and I have only really started playing it properly in the last few weeks, having dropped in and out of it a few times in recent years. Mann vs Machine has really got me hooked on the game again. If you are a FPS junky, this is about as good as it gets for the genre and you will be able to get hundreds of hours of game play out of it before it even becomes tedious. Some people have thousands of hours in this game and I cannot blame them. On top of the huge replay ability factor, TF2 also has over 500 achievements, which should keep even the keenest of achievement hunters busy for a sufficient amount of time.\n\nThis game is so perfectly put together from a technical stand point; I have had no bugs, no crashes, and the graphics are perfectly optimized that even when playing on a 4k resolution with all of the settings ramped up to max, I still had a 200 frame rate.\n\nTo sum up, Team Fortress 2 is the perfect model of a free to play game done absolutely right. As you may have been able to notice, I have not once mentioned the market and microtransactions part of this game in my review, and this is because I found no reason to ever need to put my hand into my wallet to buy anything. Real hard-core fans will be itching to purchase a few cosmetic items, but if you are looking for a casual first person shooter experience, Team Fortress 2 will tick all of the boxes, and it comes out on top of most, if not all of the recent shooters out there to date. If you are one of the handful amounts of people who have not played TF2 for any substantial amount of time, I seriously urge you to give this game an evening of your time, and let it suck you in to its highly addictive nature.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It also breaks a lot of conventions in the genre and has continued to be a proving ground for what a game is truly capable of. For the past five years or so TF2 has consistently evolved through a series of major updates introducing new game-play elements(minor patches for bugs are issued at least bi-weekly), and, occasionally, festive seasonal updates that make TF2 more eventful.\n\nUnlike a lot of FPS out there, Team Fortress provides plenty of things to do other than just "shot bullet". TF2 has a really nice replay feature which you can direct, star in, edit, and render in Über quality(regardless of system specs) your own wartime films that can be posted to YouTube via in-game function. TF2 was also one of the first FPS to have a tradeable item drop system which has produced a very large and viable trading community and market where loot found or crafted in the game is exchanged for other in-game valuables like fancy apparel, rare Items/Weapons, games from the steam store, or even real world $ on the black-market. This micro-economic meta-game is what will essentially help support the game indefinitely, and rewards players for there time spent playing the game, and making it a worthy investment for learning the game.\n\nThe only downside I can note about Team Fortress 2 is that it is currently over 12 gigabytes in size and it will eventually get much larger if it continues on this upgrading trend. Being the king of free to play games, I give Team Fortress 2 a perfect score 10 out of 10.","August 9, 2013","true","350.4"," 114 of 124 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","114","124","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/440/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","All the way from 2007 and still going strong. When I quote, ''going strong'' I usually tend to think so in the community workshop and hat section of this game. Although they aren't the main aspects of this game, but on a serious note, this game is excellent, fun and arguably flawless. So, what's the best of it now? Well, it's totally free and definitely worthy of the quote; ''The most fun you can have online.'' coming from the humble editors of PC Gamer magazine.\n\nThe game has a wide and diverse selection of 9 different classes, ranging from their own unique abilities and strategies that can be performed against the opposing team. Similiar to a ''rock, paper, scissors'' scenario, where everything is fair and there are no ''over-powered'' classes. The fast, Boston-talking and even more fast running Scout, to the towering, minigun-wielding hulk of a Russian man, known as the Heavy. Every character class usually represents a soldier in a common FPS' of some sort. What I truly love about these characters is the fact that Valve has openly breathed life, vibrant personalities, characteristics and nationalities into this rag-tag bunch. I also enjoyed the customization of weapons and accessories, named after the witty puns, along with the slight ethnic slur and referenced culture of that said character. This really brings out the comedic flare within the game and shows that humour can mix amusement in along with entertainment the players from around the globe can express and relate to, depending on the gamer's nationality.\n\nWhen it comes to the plot of the game, the elements of storytelling isn't entirely shown into clear perception. It mainly focuses on the two, competitive industries of RED (Reliable Excavation Demolition) and BLU. (Builders League United) Who both subsequently conquer half of the world, known as the Badlands. Each corporation administers its half of the world with a multi-disciplined army of paper pushers. One of those ''paper pushers'' is you and your whole team, when playing this game.\n\nA fantastic thing to note in this game is the fact that it's holiday themed. Either new campaigns modeled after a specific holiday, down to the newly cashed in, fan made hats are launched to the public to bring in funds for both Valve and the original creator at hand. Halloween, Christmas, Easter just to name a few are a great example and addition to the game's growing campaign and community. It's also important to note that the game is getting updated at a steady pace, with the occasional UI updates and other fun concepts, such as poses and character interactions being frequently implemented to wet the appetites of the individual player's preference.\n\nI don't have much to complain about this game, other than the fact that majority of the servers you connect to, you'll most likely encounter 13-year-olds who constantly nag and try their luck to command the rest of the whole team, which sometimes resorts to foreign/eastern european person nagging about the 13-year-old's nagging, so it's not rare to see a big kick off between young kids and ignorant foreign kids going absolute bonkers on a connected match. It's more fun to not say a word at this point in time and just watch the ultimate climax between the raging two forces.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. Not just down to the fact that it's free, but because it still remains fun to this day and constant updates on campaigns and official hat accessories keep this game alive, making the game overall timeless...which, doesn't affect the game's mechanics at all but, only along the lines of taunts and so on and so forth.","November 2, 2014","true","141.0"," 166 of 197 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","166","197","3","0"

The 3 things that seprate it from all the FPS games out there are it's:\n\n1. Great community\n\nThe Tf2 community is very friendly, and you can always find people to play with and hang out with on servers, from group hosted events to just chilling out with your friends.\n\n2. Balanced classes\n\nThe balance between classes is another thing that makes this game the way it is. There is a counter for pretty much any weapon, so it's a battle of skill and prediction.\n\n3. Everlasting entertainment\n\nIt's almost impossible to get bored of this game because of the hundreds of weapons and styles to play each class that exist, from trolling engies to tryhard soldiers to spawncamping demos. There's also hundreds of maps and gamemodes to play as well, so the fun never ends.\n\nCons:\nError, not found.\n\nRating:\nAll in all, hugely recommended for any experienced or new gamers. Try it out, and I guarantee you won't be dissapointed! 10/10\n\nEdit: Hats make you a pro at this game.","August 20, 2015","true","245.6"," 132 of 155 people (85%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","85","132","155","39","32"

Surely you can buy most stuff from the store but it never feels unfair.\n\n- Many outdated in-game tip's.\n- Load times can get long in-game.\n- Solo bot matches are not pause-able.\n- Bot A.I can get odd and weird at times.\n- Some of the beta-game modes get little to no updates.\n- Runs on a very old engine, which is why many odd optimization issues.\n- Many weapons have specific stats that are not stated in the description.\n- Many,many Bugs,bugs and bugs thus leading to many odd things and exploits.\n- Overtime they nerf a weapon so much that it becomes useless and buff 1 or 2 a lot more.\n- Not such a good community, everyone does Lenny-faces and ♥♥♥♥. f2ps get flamed on and much  more.\n- A big learning curve you will most probably need to log in more than a hundred hour's to understand most of the stuff.\n\nGuns are solid and hits do register, fast reflexes and quick thinking required and much more, while many,many bugs and overall not a good community with many scammers and much more.\n\nGraphics+ Great,great Animations.\n+ Well even though old but very bearable and fine enough.\n\n- Needs many texture-improvements.\n- Backpack icons are poorly rendered.\n- in game-models need many improvement.\n\nWell graphics mostly are just fine and animations great,while bearable but need many texture improvements.\n\nDesign+ Menu is good enough and well organized.\n+ A feel of the 19s but with many futuristic elements.\n+ Map design is fine not to different but not to similar.\n+ Cartoonish and done right, feel different and pleasing.\n\n- Some poor design decisions in some maps.\n- Menu gets unresponsive many of the times, either when opening your inventory and such.\n\nCartoonish kind of pleases your eyes, map design fine and much more, while some poor design decisions.\n\n\nSounds and (OST)+ Good voiced character responses.\n+ Music is just great with a oldish touch.\n+ Guns and all that have solid and pleasing sounds.\n\nNot much to say here. But something fully done right.\n\nConclusionFully recommended if you are just looking for a fun and casual fps.

As well as tons of fun official and custom maps to enjoy. My personal favorite game mode would by Capture the Flag on my favorite map 2Fort.\nEven though TF2 is 7 years old its still very active and keeps getting update with minor as well as major updates which add all sorts of new content.  Usually the major updates are pretty good, but there are times when they can fall flat. But that doesn't happen too often. BONUS DUCKS!\nAnd of course I wouldn't dare to end this without mentioning the hats.  The many hats and misc items for every class allow you to stand out among your fellow players and make you look unique.\nThere are tons of unique, interesting, and ridiculous combination you can make by combining the wide assortment of cosmetic items and I simply love it!\n\nThis game is awesome and overall unique compared to the other multi-player FPSs I have played and that's what makes it so great, it's different and that's the way I like it.\n\nAlso, the Pyro is a light bulb until proven otherwise, and even if he is proven to be otherwise, disregard it and continue believing he is a light bulb, because he is a light bulb.

The game revolves around a set of 9 classes, each of which have strengths and weaknesses and counters, whose duty it is to conquer the opposition.\n\nThe thing about TF2, at least for me, is the artstyle. The comic cartoonyness of the characters and world is incredibly fun and light. It's the perfect game to blow off some steam and relax after a long day. The players, at least in my experience, are all generally really nice. I feel this is because being "bad" at TF2 is not really a factor.\n\nRegardless of your skill level, how much time you've spent on TF2, or how much money, everyone can contribute and everyone can have a great time.\n\nOne of the strongest parts of the game is that losing, dying or being killed doesn't lead to hate or anger or frustration. A game in TF2 can last from 3 to 10 minutes, and these short rounds contribute to a lack of concern if you lose. Not in a bad way, not in a way which results in you not caring about the game in general, but in a way where if you lose you don't blame yourself, or your team mates, for the loss. It's refreshing and fantastic.\n\nHugely recommended from myself. I've spent about 550+ hours in the game, am in no way a master, half-decent maybe, and I have no reason to stop playing. The game is consistently updated with new maps, items, lore and content and I look forward to many more hundreds of hours of gameplay.\n\nNilesy","July 12, 2012","true","628.5"," 79 of 85 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","79","85","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kutar/recommended/440/","kutar","Kutar FOX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kutar/","3690 products in account","PROS:\n- Hats.\n- Free to play.\n- Strong community.\n- Graphics and caricatures.\n- Community and user-generated contents.\n- Lifetime support and updates confirmed (it is Valve.)\n\nCONS:\n- Hats (sick of them.)\n- Lack of tribute to id and Quake.\n- Internet memes and half-brained UGC.\n- More players means inevitably more kids and toxic players, too (statistically speaking.)\nEDIT: For those typical lowlife kids with extremely low intelligence who fail to grasp the language and understand the review in its entirety, read the part where It says STATISTICALLY SPEAKING. The word kid has a negative connotation especially in gaming communities becuase kids are more likely to be toxic than adult gamers in general. It is the fact that kids are immature and that immaturity is the source of all problems and annoyance so you cannot argue against it. If you are a kid but you think you don't belong to the lowest common denominator, good for you; then there is no reason to get offended. Otherwise, grow the ♥♥♥♥ up and ♥♥♥♥ off. Strictly speaking, this game is rated M for MATURE.\n\nFinal Remarks:\nI pre-ordered The Orange Box back in 2007 and I have watched from the start how Team Fortress 2 (TF2) evolved into something perpetual thingy and Valve's flagship of their both economically and experimentally successful multiplayer game (now of course DotA2 and CS:GO have risen to stand along and they all pretty much surpassed it.) Do you realize how monumental this game was (and seemingly still is) to gamers and even to Valve themselves? Steam Achievement and later drop system along with hats were first introduced for TF2. I remember when hat phenomenon was all over the place and everyone wanted Fancy Fedora so much.\n\nHere is one fun story about the game; A guy from SourceOP known as Drunken F00l got VAC-banned for making idling tool for TF2 and for cheating an event item known as Golden Wrench. Including him, people who used idling tool got their hats and items taken away meanwhile all other active TF2 players were awarded with Halo hats for not using the tool. But after sometime the ban on the SourceOP guy was lifted and he officially started working at Valve for his TF2 Backpack and something more. Well, that guy had talent and Valve definitely knew about it so they decided to hire him in spite of all violations of user agreements as a Steam user. It reminds me of the FBI hiring a genius financial fraudster and there is even a movie about it. So much drama over TF2, aye? You see, this game just has so many interesting stories to tell.\n\nWhen TF2 switched to F2P model, the community even got bigger and stronger than ever before and it is still growing even after many years have passed. All official updates and endless user-created contents enrich the game; more drops, more hats, more weapons, more maps, more Halloween and holiday events, more updates, more everything, and now skins and competitive matchmaking system just like in CS:GO; OMG VOLVO. And its market is being sustained on its own economy. Quite amazing. I personally no longer play this game anymore because I already played enough of it, but it is easily understandable why this game is still one of the most played games on Steam.\n\n.

10/10/2007.\n\nAs years went by,Valve released more and more hats,and people complained that too much effort was given into cosmetic items and less into the gameplay,the game was turning into Hat Fortress 2,and people claimed the game was dying,even though Valve constantly updates their game with gameplay content,like maps,modes,new weapons,and bug fixes.\n\nAs years went by,Valve made more and more promotions for pre-ordering a game and getting items for TF2,and people claimed the game was dying,even though you usually can get these items without paying for the pre-order and most of them are just cosmetic items anyway.\n\nAs years went by, new gameplay content was being made more by the community, while Valve focused more into the cosmetic content, and the game was dying because Valve left the game for us to improve.\n\nPretty much everytime the game gets a balance patch, with classes and weapons being nerfed or buffed, people say the game is dead, usually people that loved that weapon that was nerfed.\n\nOn 5/20/2009, a new weapon was showed, the Jarate, a Sniper weapon that is just a jar full of urine that he throws, people complained that Valve was being kiddy and adding immature toilet humor, and the game was dead because of that, also, Jarate now is considered the best Sniper secondary weapon.\n\nAlso, the next day, 5/21/2009,the game got its first 9 hats,people probably marked that day as when the game became a "Hat Simulator",and the game died.\n\nTo get those hats, many people started idling,don't play the game and just wait for the hats to come with the new item drop system, some players, even made programs designed especially to idle, but in 9/2/2009, Valve decided to take away all the items from players that used those programs, and reward the players who didn't with a halo for you to wear, people that got their items taken were infuriated, and the community was really divided, servers started banning people who weared the halo, and there were other servers banning those who didn't, and the game, was dead for many, many people, also, idling persists to this day.\n\nIn 6/10/2010, the game got the Mac Update, that made TF2 playable on MAC OS X, this angried many people, especially Apple haters, but what made the biggest complaints, were the Earbuds, earbuds similar to those made by Apple, and you got one by playing the game on MAC OS X during some days, just that item made the community rage and ban players that used it, there was a petition to remove the item, and the game was dead again, most people just logged into a Mac to get the item and continue playing on Windows.\n\nOn 9/30/2010 the game got a store for microtransactions, people claimed the game was dead, because now we had to pay to win the matches, even though we never had, getting weapons that change gameplay is easy, you can easily trade weapons you don't want for one you want, expensive and rare weapons are just reskins, and the cosmetic items don't change anything, they're just decoration, there was a time where some hats combined with some weapons gave you bonus stats, but that stopped a long time ago.\n\nOn 6/23/2011, the game became Free to Play, people claimed the game was dead because now the game would be full of noobs and annoying players, like if other multiplayer games didn't have the same issue, and like everyone started playing this game well, some people even asked for refunds, like if you sell something to someone, and then started giving the same thing away for free, the person who bought it deserves the money back, people raged because your only reward for paying for the game was an ugly hat that proves it, when you also were instantly given a premium account, that has some advantages over free players, but no advantages in actual competition.\n\nOn 9/6/2011,Steam Trading came,and people complained that Valve was going too far into allowing people to trade games for hats,and the game was dying.\n\nOn 2/14/2012, the game got a new item, the "Something Special For Someone Special", a wedding ring that costs $99.99,goes to two different players and it's a sign of engagement between them,people claimed the game was turning into some sort of dating simulator and the game was dying.\n\nOn 6/27/2012, came the Meet the Pyro short along with the Pyroland mode, and people again claimed the game was dead due to Valve making the game cute and cuddly and making the Pyro even more crazy than we thought.\n\nOn 8/15/2012,the game got the Mann vs. Machine mode,and people claimed Valve was being greedy because there was a mode that required a paid item to play,the Mann Up mode,and the game was dying,even though the only difference in that mode is that you get exclusive cosmetics and reskin weapons that you don't need to win.\n\nOn 1/10/2013,it was announced that the original 9 hats from 5/21/2009 were going to be retired,so no one could get new copies of them anymore (Except from old crates),but you could keep the ones you had and trade them,and you could still buy the hats for two weeks before that,the game was dead because Valve was doing a desperate measure to sell items that weren't selling well,also, Valve never did that again.\n\nOn 10/29/2013, the game got a unicorn hat called "The Magical Mercenary", and people claimed the game was dead just because one single hat.\n\nOn 5/17/2013, the Robotic Boogaloo update was released, a community update, and it was just a bunch of robotic versions of cosmetics that the game already had, people claimed Valve didn't care for the game anymore,again,and the game was dying.\n\nOn 6/17/2014, people claimed the game was dead again, because of the Conga, a taunt where players can dance around the map instead of shooting each other.\n\nOn 10/29/2014, the game got some bumper car minigames, people claimed Valve was running out of ideas, the game was turning into Mario Kart, and the game was dead.\n\nOn 12/8/2014, the game got the End of the Line Update, another community update, it was kinda boring, it was heavily focused on ducks, and the map Snowplow was cut because Valve thought it was too complicated, and people claimed the game was dying, also, Snowplow was added later.\n\nOn 7/2/2015, the game started having painted weapons just like CS:GO, and people claimed Valve was adding more and more ways to get easy money, the game was turning into TF:GO, and you had to pay for an item to get these weapons and crates to get them, you were paying to get crates and pay to open them, and the game was dead.\n\nOn 10/6/2015, the game got the Invasion Update, again made by the community, people claimed the update was boring, not much new content, and again the game was dead, even though it had a new mode.\n\nI made this review 12/3/2015, and the game didn't look like dead back then, the peak that day was 56,632 people playing.\n\nTF2 is set to die again with Blizzard's Overwatch,let's see how that goes,people said the same about World of Warcraft and its clones.\n\n12/9/2015 came, and the new thing that made the game dead is the trade holds, also called the ESCROW, where you're going to wait 3 days to trade items if one of the two traders don't protect his account on a phone and confirm every trade on it.\n\n12/17/2015 came with the Tough Break Update, and the the game is dead again because of two things I mentioned earlier, because it's just like the Gun Mettle Update where you have to pay to get the reskin weapons and also pay to get crates and then pay to open them, and because of nerfing the Pyro and Demoknight, when the Pyro was actually buffed, only the Degreaser and its combo weapons like Reserve Shooter and Axtinguisher were nerfed.","December 3,

I will never play TF2 with you."\n\nBut one day, one of my friends was feeling down, and he's really into TF2, so I offered to play with him. And it made him happy and not sad and that was good.\n\nThen another one of my friends told me that if I played 70 hours of TF2, he'd buy me Skyrim. I don't have my own money to buy things online with; all the money I make online goes to my friends' PayPals. So I said yes, and I started logging hours.\n\nIt was slow going at first. I said to him, "It's a good game, but I'm really bad at it. And I guess that's okay - everyone's kinda bad at it. But I'll never be like you and my other friends who play this. You won't get me addicted to TF2; I'm doing this for Skyrim."\n\nAfter I got Skyrim, it became my bae and I was the clingy girlfriend. As my burning passion for being a male lizardbeast died down, I started playing TF2. Mostly because, being F2P, many of my friends played and still play it. So we played TF2.\n\nIt was gradual, my downfall. But it was inevitable, and in hindsight, even predictable. I want to say I'm not addicted to TF2, but then I'd be lying, because once I played for six hours straight to achieve a score of 420 and I didn't stop 'til I hit that eight hour mark. I played TF2 for more than six ♥♥♥♥in' hours, man. I could've stopped at 420. No, I could've stopped an hour or two in. And yet I didn't.\n\nI started playing TF2 regularly, sometimes for long periods of time.\n\nI won't say that that was my aforementioned 'downfall'.\n\nNo, it would have to be me being around TF2 bloggers on Tumblr. I watched and learned about other fans and their interests.\n\nBut let me just say.\n\nPlaying TF2 is one thing. Playing TF2 often is part of that one thing. But reading and writing shipping fanfiction about TF2? Getting innocents into shipping fanfiction about TF2? Well, I wish I didn't fall into this black hole of gay, but it's too late now.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nPlay TF2.\n\nBut do so carefully.\n\nSo as not to become what I have.","September 19, 2014","true","079.5"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","62","69","6","15"

For fashionistas you can design and paint your character as you see fit. For shooters you can ignore it all and focus on playing.\n\nEven amist the heat of battle, your enemy could become your best friend seconds later. Say you're looking down a hall. you see a soldier. You blink. There's a pyro now too. You blink. The soldier is now dancing the conga. The pyro is now too. You run up to them and dance aswell. Blink. Both teams are now crowded in a room raving.

What also makes TF2 also a unique FPS is that it is a Multiplayer only video game. TF2 is one of the games that you don't have a pro to enjoy the game. For other FPS games, such as COD , you would have to be a pro at the game in order to get the other weapons. For TF2, you just have to play a certain amount of time and then later you will acquire some new items! If you're lucky, you could get a misc or even a hat. There are many different qualities for items and weapons in the game. They are Normal, Unique, Strange, Vintage, Genuine, Unusual, Haunted, Collector, Community and Self-Made.\n\nThere are 9 classes which are the Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Heavy, Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Spy. These classes are divided into 3 categories. They are Offensive, Defense and Support. Each class specalise in a particular area. The Scout can double jump and is the fastest out of all class which means he can escape from danger with no diffculty. The Soldier can rocket jump to get into higher areas. Pyro can burn enemies and can do compression blast which blasts projectiles away such as rockets and grenades. The Demoman is able to make traps for enemies. Heavy is able to take a lot of damage and has the most health. Engineers are able to construct buildings such as a Sentry Gun to defend points and support the rest of the team. Medics can heal fellow teammates so they are able to survive in battle longer. Sniper can do a significant amount of damage with sniper rifle. Spy can disguise as the enemy team and can sap Engineers' buildings to disable them.\n\nAs you start Team Fortress 2, there are detailed tutorials that teaches you how to play the particular class efficently. When you finished these tutorials, there is a "Training" Mode which enables you to sharpen your skills on bots. Training Mode also has several diffculties.\n\nTF2 has many gamemodes. Some examples are Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and Payload. Each gamemode has a certain objective and requires everyone in the team to contribute. Team Fortress 2 is one of those games that requires a lot of teamwork. If there is no teamwork, the team is unable to advance to the next point. A unique gamemode called Mann Vs Machine is when 6 players work as a team to prevent waves of invading robots deploying a bomb at a certain point. As you advance through, the waves of robots begin to get increasingly more diffcult. There is also a "Mann Up" version. This is the official version of Mann Vs Machine played on offical Valve Mann Up servers. In order to get into these servers, you would need to purchase a "Tour Of Duty Ticket". After you complete a mission , you earn a pile of loot which you get at the end when it is "Victory" Time. When you complete a Tour Of Duty, you would get normal weapons, Botkiller weapons, Killstreak Kit, an Australium Weapon and many more. TF2 has also many custom mod servers which consist of unoffical gamemodes. Some of these mods are TF2ware and Versus Saxton Hale.\n\nThe best feature of Team Fortress 2 is that there is always update which contain new items, weapons,weapons changes, maps, gamemodes and THEY ARE ALL FREE OF CHARGE!!! This says when you go on Team Fortress 2, there is always new content to enjoy. TF2 also celebrates special events such as Halloween and particular maps change their looks to match the event. In these events, they are special event only items that you can acquire.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 are just those games that get very hard to bored of. They can get so addicting that you would just play them all day. NOT TO FORGET, IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE HATS. TF2 is an absolute MASTERPIECE!!!!! I give this game overall 1,000,000,000/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","January 19, 2014","true","026.2"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","66","77","0","1"

The community is also a nice bunch of people. The game has it's own charm, that keeps a big, goofy smile on your face the whole time you play it, maybe it's the art style, or the personalities of each classes, and maybe it's how the game sort of make fun of itself and takes itself so un-seriously. There are frequent updates that keep adding new items and features that get the whole community excited for a good reason, these new items can throw a real curve ball in the right situation.

I would describe it more as a social hub for people to hang out. This game have two teams that are supposed to fight each other, but only in Team Fortress 2 with two people of the opposite team giving each other high fives, stop fighting during the game and walk around crouching, or dance together!\n\nThere are nine classes divided into three groups; offense, defense and support. But Team Fortress 2 have changed so much since release that it does not really mean anything anymore. Pretty much every class can function as any of the three groups with the right loadout, but they are still very different from each other. You got a fast Scout with little health, and a slow Heavy with a lot of health, and anything inbetween that! There is no way you will not find a class you prefer sticking to.\n\nValve never added a new class, but they added tons of weapons! Some of them are really silly (punch an enemy in the back to make him stop and laugh, a great way to get silly taunt kills!), while others generally are a big improvement over the stock weapons (like the Degreaser). However most of the weapons are very situational and I prefer the stock weapons.\n\nThere are many game modes to play. Capture the point, capture the flag. Payload where you push a cart through the map while the other team try preventing you from doing it, and if you're a fan of tower defense, you will enjoy Mann Vs. Machine! You're a team of up to six people who are supposed to kill a huge army of robots before they move their bomb to your base. Some of them are small, others are big and really hurts, and others are big and runs fast. But what really makes this game mode different from the more traditional Team Fortress 2, is you can upgrade your weapons. Fire speed, damage, reload speed, damage resistances, running speed, jump speed and so on. It is really fun, and if you are lucky you can win a huge prize for completing a Tour!\n\nCosmetic items are a huge deal for many people. Hats! There are so many hats in this game, and they are all so different. There is no way you are not going to find one you like and will wear and be proud to wear every time you play. Many of the cosmetics can also be painted into your favourite colour!\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is free to play. Is it pay to win? No. All the weapons you see in the store, are weapons you can get simply by playing, or you can use items to craft the weapon you want. If you buy premium you will receive weapons faster, your backpack will be larger so you can keep more items, and you can trade with others. Trading is a good way to get the weapon you're looking for.\n\nIt is a lot of fun! It is fun to play the actual game, or just hanging out with people ingame like you can not do in any other game. This is the game where you make friends! ^____^","September 22, 2014","true","305.0"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","45","51","0","6"

When I started playing tf2, I only played it for the gameplay. It was (and still is) real fun to play. But after some months, I discovered trading. The wonderful trading. After months of trading, I learned a lot about it. And now, I do it almost every day! It will always be my hobby. c: It's even a great way to earn money! :D I have to say, there aren't that much weapons. There are more cosmetics then weapons. I'm not really a fan of cosmetics, I prefer have weapons (that's why I almost have them all, except 5). And when there comes new items during an update, then that are only cosmetics/reskins of weapons/weapons in an other quality. For now the qualities that are coming more of: Strange and Collector's. Collector's is a new, and pretty expensive quality, but not really diffirent then the 'unique' quality. And Strange is a quality that counts kills/points/etc that you made with the weapon/misc that's in this quality. I'm a truly fan of Strange weapons, and I own 41 out of 120 (this is except Australiums, Botkillers and Festives, because that are 'just' reskins) Someday I'll buy the rest of them too :D\nAlright, I told pretty much I guess, and I hope this review was useful for you.

Players play one of 9 mercenary classes working for one of two corporations (RED and BLU) duking it out tooth-and-nails over a variety of objectives ranging from briefcases, to giant bombs in mine carts. With a tons of weapons, achievements, hats and maps, this game has incredible longevity, and will keep you latched to your screen hoping for that one achievement, or that specific weapon(Golden Pan for me) you’re looking to get.\n\nClasses:\n\nSpy(My Fav): Proficient knife fighter and mother lover, the spy can feign death/cloak and disguise himself into the enemy team.\n\nDemoman: Trap-setting, one-eyed Scottish demoman with a knack for blowing things to pieces.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActionOrg/recommended/440/","ActionOrg","Vitality","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActionOrg/","32 products in account","I've had TF2 for a long, long, long time and it was fun when it lasted. However when I started looking at chat and the community itself I started to realize how toxic and bad the majority of the TF2 fanbase really is. This review is primarily focused on the community and the community itself. Keep in mind that these are my own personal opinions of what I think so please try to keep calm and don't get mad over it. Here are 3 primary reasons of what I think is wrong with the TF2 Community (This is gonna be a long read, be warned) P.S: I suck at paragraph formatting.\n\n1. P2Ps and F2Ps: Oh boy already bringing out the big guns! I cannot stress enough how bad and immature the community is and I'm really not surprised they haven't matured yet. First is P2Ps and F2Ps yea thats right I'm talking about P2P's relationship with F2Ps. I know that there's a number of P2P's who are respectful and nice to F2Ps but a majority of P2Ps see F2Ps as lesser prey and easy targets, as such they don't seem to respect the fact that all they want to do is play a game they see as fun and can play as they see fit (except MvM of course). P2Ps seem to forget the fact that all of them were at one point or another a noob whether they liked it or not. Sure you may come up with the argument that says they brought the game before it went F2P but I said "noob" not F2P. In Team Fortress Classic you have to pay for the game and right when you start the game up your a noob not a F2P as the game was never F2P to begin with.\n\n2. Second reason why the community is particularly bad are player's relationship with other players during MvM. Now MvM's votekick situation has been a lingering problem for years and it has yet to be resolved, the first problem are the MvM elitists. These guys feel like they have the ability to control other players and force them to change something that's wrong with them. If the other player is confused or refuses then they have a high chance of being kicked by the elitists, now I understand that going Sniper or Pyro when their unneeded is questionable but kicking a confused player who doesn't know what to do is kinda rude. What if your mic is not clear? What if they couldn't hear you? Have you ever question these possibilities? Yes I do know that MvM takes a while and most people wanna finish it as quickly as possible so that they can get their loot or move on to the next tour but I'm sure you can clear things up between you and that player right? Next are some minor problems that are just annoying rather then actual problems but I feel like I should address them. There are a lot of people who have a high number of tours that when they feel like their team won't make it they leave after 1 LOSS instantly, some even start the next round then leave to rub it in. Back to F2Ps and P2P relationships this time however in MvM. I decided to do a social experiment by equipping what most P2Ps deem as noobish, I equipped my Ghostly/Ghastly Gibus, Pyrovision Goggles, and Mercenary Badge but also use the loadout most people see Scout in MvM should use. This experiment was tested in 25 MvM missions with 5 missions for each tour so this may or may not be accurate.\n\nOil Spill: 3 leaves, 2 stays (this tour are the ones most new players begin with, as such P2Ps cant kick all of them if they feel like it)\nSteel Trap: 1 kick, 2 leaves, 2 stays\nMecha Engine: 2 kicks, 2 leaves, 1 stay\nTwo Cities: 3 kicks, 2 leaves\nGear Grinder: 5 kicks (wowzers)\n\nNow you can see that it's getting worse as the tours get harder even if I'm use the correct Scout loadout I still get kicked and in Gear Grinder they kick me as soon as they saw me along with throwing insults in my way! I did my job as Scout just like everyone else but the cosmetics got me kicked even when I used the correct upgrades and loadout.\n\n3. Now the last reason why I don't like the community is very personal to me as it describes most of the community as a whole. Note that I said most as some players are friendly and fun. Now lets see a list of what most of the community does in chat: Lenny Face spammers, "rekt" spammers, "m8" spammers, and "bruh" spammers. Along with these overused memes seem to be very inappropriate insults related to race, gender, sexuality, weight, etc. Also while browsing through my friends profiles and looking at their comments there are many of these blah blah blah send to friends or blah blah blah will happen to you. Clearly this is a meme and when I clicked on the profiles of Steam users who spam these memes I find it unsurprising that most of them are TF2 owners. Oh no you don't want me to talk about this don't you want me to look at the kid problem, aw come on fine I'll do it :P. While I do question their parents motive of letting their child play a T to M rated game (ESRB was the only one who rated it M) that contains blood, guts, guns, and swearing but hey its the parents decision so I'll let it slide. However if the child is playing the game without the parents knowledge then that's the child's fault as they know they are playing a gory and messy game and decide to keep playing it anyway. Its not the parents fault if they have no knowledge their child plays this game in the first place, they might play while they are at work or something.\n\nRight back to the reason ahem, children who play TF2 don't care about the rules (except server rules and VAC rules) as they will LIE to the age confirmation page to get TF2 and they will rarely even care about the Steam rules and policy, no they just wanna go straight to the game. (like most of us I suspect) Alright after that unlisted reason that most of you wanted me to do even though this review hadn't been finished yet but if your reading this then yay its finished! K back to the 3rd reason or sub-reason IDK, the cheaters. Yes every games got them and yes most of you either like them for doing your job for you or hate them for stealing your kills. From hackers to exploiters, TF2 however have been suffering from cheaters for AGES. Take a look back at the patch notes and what are one of the things Valve fixes the most? (besides crashes and prices) EXPLOITS! Its clear that Valve had to release TF2 before its forgotten (After 9 YEARS in developmonetand I know that every game Isn't perfect but Jeezus Christ how many exploits are there!? Normal, unskilled hackers who download detectable hacks from a bootleg website are the majority of most VAC banned players. However since technology has been improving, hackers have been proving too! They can rapidly change their profile name to other people's profile names in-game and try to trick you to reporting the wrong person, they can use undetectable and multiple hacks to suit their own greedy needs. And even if you know that person Isn't the hacker it's gonna be very tricky to try to get the hacker's actual Steam profile as most of them are private and don't even show up in the players tab. Some of them even have firewalls to prevent vigilante hackers into trying to get a hold on their Steam profile and expose it to Valve. While I don't consider mods and skins cheat I do question myself of this opinion. Seriously there's a wallhack on Gamebanana right now for TF2! and Gamebanana gives custom stuff except custom hacks so what the frick?! There are some sounds that COULD be considered cheating like Musical dispenser as it will give away a unprotected, full Dispenser. Anywho I think my statements and reasons are falling apart right before the kid reason so I'll end it here :P.\n\nIn conclusion, TF2's community can be immature, rude, and bad but there are plenty of good parts to it and if your looking for a 75% bad 25% good community this COULD be considered. However if your looking for a respectful, nice, and mature community avoid this game like The Walking Dead Survival Instinct.\n\n~(insert whatever name I have here)\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos and stuff.\nEdit II: Fixed more stuff.\nEdit III: MORE STUFF :C","August 18, 2015","false","006.1"," 200 of 304 people (66%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","66","200","304","16","37"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/23456987/recommended/440/","23456987","ViperLoL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/23456987/","4 products in account","Let's start.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 it's a FPS (First Person Shooter) game made by Valve and published in 2007, after the beta. The game has nine classes:\n\nATTACK CLASSES:\n\n°Scout\n\n°Soldier\n\n°Pyro\n\nDEFENSE CLASSES:\n\n°Demoman\n\n°Heavy\n\n°Engineer\n\nSUPPORT CLASSES.\n\n°Medic\n\n°Sniper\n\n°Spy\n\nEach class has his advantages and disadvantages. For example a Spy can kill easily a Heavy, but at the same time he can be get killed by a Pyro. Or a Scout can kill without problem a Sniper or an Engineer, but at the same time he can be killed by Demomen or Soldiers.\n\nThis system of advantages and disadvantages makes the game very funny.\n\nThe game has also a drop system, which allows to find randomly new weapons and, if lucky, new hats. Infact the game has a lot of weapons, which can be unlocked with achievements (Example: The Force-A-Nature) or can be picked randomly during a game. Each weapons has his own advantages and disadvantages, making the game balanced. For example the Phlogistinator, a Pyro weapon, can gain easily crits but it can't use the compressor (which is essential for airblasting projectiles).\n\nThe game has also a lot of hats, which makes Team Fortress 2 a original FPS. The player can use the hats for customizing his own character. Hats can be purchased by the Mann. Co Store or being traded for refined metal (Which is the "money" of the game).\n\nThe game has also a trading system, which allows players to trade weapons and hats, keeping the "TF2 economy" alive.\n\nNow let's see what it is inside the game!\n\nTeam Fortress 2 has a lot of gamemodes, for example Attack/Defense or Capture the Flag.\n\nIn Attack/Defense the BLU must cap every RED's point. The BLU will win if they will cap every point before the time expires, otherwise the RED will win.\n\nThe TF2 community is always active, expecially on trading, but I don't refuse to say that in the community there are some disrispectful and discriminating people, often following the ideology "You have no hats? You're a noob!". Beside this the community is quite friendly.\n\nNow my personal opinion:\n\nI play this game since 23 May 2014 and it never tired me. I enjoy playing this game because it's wonderful how you can meet new friends and working with them for win the match. Every character has his own stereotype, and this make me laugh (in positive sense, of course).\n\nI think Team Fortress 2 was born as team-working FPS and not "I'm the most pro player in the game!11". And that is just wonderful.\n\nI say thanks to Valve and thanks to Gaben for making this fantastic game, which is my favorite.\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nFINAL VOTE:\n\nGameplay: 10/10\n\nSounds and music: 9/10\n\nGraphic: 9/10 (It's quite old but I like that style)\n\n(Sorry for my bad English, but I'm from Italy!)\n\n\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","758.0"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","34","37","6","9"

I have over 5,500 hours in the game and have a lot of Competitive experience into TF2 being 1st Place Steel S.18 and moving to High Silver now. Feel free to add me if you have any questions!\n\nNow on with the review... there is a TL;DR in the bottom.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 Pubs reminds me of Mario Party, you can have SOME skill into it but in the end its just RNG and what other people are doing that really lessens the skill factor.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is absolutely no doubt the most addicting first person shooter I have ever played hands down!\nThe game has variety of full teamwork ability and strongly encouraged.\n\nI played Team Fortress 2 back in the end of 2010 and to the beginning of 2011. I even played TF2 on my Xbox at 2009 and on Xbox I was ranked 60 worldwide for a while. TF2 now a days... is just not the same as it is. The MAJOR problem in Team Fortress 2 is Pubs. The games main focus is pubs for new players and pubs are just... awful. If you're new however you wont notice this as much. Its basically a Deathmatch of all classes and the worst part is there really isnt any variety in classes. Everyone in TF2 mains either Scout, Soldier, or Sniper (mostly sniper).\n\nThe TF2 Gameplay Mechanics are good for what their class does but new weapons introduced made the game just... less enjoyable. Lets put into the example of the Phlog. The Phlog was always hated by practically the whole community and Valve knew it. Instead? They BUFF it instead of NERF it. They finally (nerfed) it so its actually "kinda" fair now but its things like this where I wonder if the TF2 team actually has any idea what they're doing. Valve also for whatever reason loves random crits in Team Fortress 2. They used to have an option to where you could vote on the server to turn off Random crits but they instead realised "Hey... that's dumb, people aren't supposed to have fun in this game lol." Then added back Random Crits to stay and you cant vote it off. I honestly think Valve takes Team Fortress 2 as a game of Mario Party.\n\nThe TF2 Community IS DOWNRIGHT NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT TOXIC!!! At times i'd say it can possibly be even worse then the COD community. I ATLEAST had a few laughs with people in the COD community (not saying its a good community its just an example) If anyone tries talking in the mic its usually "Shut up ♥♥♥♥♥♥" The community is also really stupid... fights will break out everywhere for the dumbest reasons and most people have no idea how to actually play the game and if you try giving them any tips whatsoever the topic of choice usually ends in a arguement of how "you're bad". Chatting in TF2 is nonexistent because chats are usually filled with overused le lennys and stupid binds that are honestly awful and not funny and to the point where people will only use one bind the whole game and actually focus on using binds more then actually playing the game. The Fanbases... Christ the Fanbases... are just everywhere... I really dont have a problem with them but the thing is that they're the kind that like to jam it down your throat.\n\nThe TF2 Market is so boring now. Unusuals back in around 2010-2013 were pretty rare to come by and when people saw you with an unusual they thought "Wow how cool, this guy is original" thing about Unusuals NOW is that everyone practically has one, being a game second focused on design this gets pretty boring and old to say the least considering that unusuals were made for the purpose of being "original" and were fun to look at back then. Escrow also made the TF2 Market 100% WORSE. TF2 Trade servers are mostly dead with just a couple that still live with a full server of people who actually go there, really due to escrow (you ♥♥♥♥ed up on that one Valve)\n\nThe TF2 Updates used to be so cool and fun. Valve however decided that it would be cool for the community to make some. Which was honestly, a good idea. Too bad they thought that EVERY MAJOR UPDATE should be community based. Yeah great... Its not even the Communitys fault for the updates they make but it lacks DEVELOPMENT of what a real MAJOR update could be, you know... the COMPANYS JOB!!? Now all new updates consist of NEW SKINS AND CONTRACTS. WE DONT EVEN GET NEW HATS BARELY ANYMORE OF WHAT THIS GAME IS FOCUSED ON. The worst part is that Valve doesnt even know what to do in the game anymore. A good example of this is that Valve nerfs Engineer when Engineer is pretty balanced... Just when people found tactics on how to effectivly play Engineer, their response is to nerf Engineer to the core and make sure he cannot do anything to protect anything. This game is supposed to have variety with all classes and they completely spit on certain classes like Engie. Also weapons like The Beggars Bazooka for Soldier should really only be available in gamemodes like Mann Vs Machine. Some weapons in TF2 are just flat out broken and I still question "Who the Hell even THOUGHT of this".\n\nThe TF2 Competitive Scene is by far the ONLY GOOD SUBJECT OF THIS GAME! Good luck starting in a TF2 pub. You will not get any practice of any actual competitive interest except aiming and shooting. The Competitve Community for TF2 is... better? It's still pretty toxic. Competitive games for TF2 are fun if you're playing for real. There are two gamemodes that are focused in competitive being Highlander and 6s. Highlander consists of being more teamwork based. Its one of each class fighting another team that consist of one of each class, HL's desired maps are usually Payload and King of the Hill but can consist of Control Points as well. 6s is more Deathmatch based but still desires teamwork. 2 Scouts (Utilities), 2 Soldiers (1 Pocket, 1 Roamer), Demoman, and Medic are the prime classes on each. Different classes are allowed however usually the Scouts switch IF NEEDED (For example if one of the Scouts is good at Sniper they can quickly switch to Sniper and play Sniper for the time being until they want to switch out to another class or stay Scout) The reason why the Scouts are called Utilities is because they are probably the best set in 6's but can be switched as they aren't as important as having Soldiers or the Demo or Medic.\n\nThe TF2 Matchmaking I mean... its in beta so I cant trash talk it to much but saying FOR NOW atleast its pretty bad. Most people off class and use stupid gimmicks (Two scouts on a team running crit a cola... really...) and if you're rolling the enemy team they're most likely going to rage quit and leave so you dont get any experience. Also experience doesnt matter if you singlely carried the team by frags (kills), assists, healing, exc. It only matters on if you win or lose which really honostly stupid.\n\nPROS:-Addicting Gameplay!\n-Amazing Competitive!\n-Wonderful Multi Mod Gamemodes (VSH/FF2, Deathrun, ect.)\n-Addicting Seperate Gamemode, Mann Vs Machine!\n-Thousands of different sets to have on every class!\n-Classes are pretty easy to learn\n\nCONS:-Horrible Community\n-Most Major Updates are focused on being Community built, Valve avoids doing anything themselves.\n-Pubs are most of the time stacked and not worth playing other then for DM\n-Few weapons I can count with my fingers that completely ruin the game's entertainment\n-Class mains used to have variety. It's now mostly focused only on Scout, Soldier, and Sniper (again, mostly Sniper)\n-Company takes no interest in TF2 anymore. If anything, almost looks like its waiting for it to just die...\n\nTL;DR: The Game depends on how you play, if you want to have a good time and you have some friends try out the game. Its not to late to get into competitive but most of the good players are gone and moved to CS:GO.\n\n-bonko\n\nEdit April 24: Changing some of the things in the review that seem more fit for the time now","January 26","false","766.1"," 251 of 391 people (64%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","64","251","391","36","64"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorror/recommended/440/","Gorror","Gorror","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorror/","194 products in account","This review is very lengthy, as I have a lot to say about this game. So sit tight, you are in for a long ride.\n\nLet's get the verdict out of the way before we get to the real talk: Yes, I recommend this game.  I have spent hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars on it. Is it worth playing? Yes. Is it worth investing your time for a deeper experience? Probably not.\n\nI already predict a lot of hate for this review, but I need to get it off my chest and explain the issues I have with this game. Once again those are my own opinions that a lot of people happen to share. It is completely fine if you want to argue against it, I will just ask you to be honest and less defensive because TF2 is in a critical state.\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to point out that I've spent 1780 hours, which might be low for some, high for others. I started playing in late 2009-early 2010 and in intervals of several months between late 2010 and early 2012. I enjoyed this game a lot since it was a fresh change from the FPS games I used to play back in the days (CoD 2/4 or CS). It was extremely fun, and trust me, I do not regret a single minute I've spent on this game, before early 2014 at least. I'm not really the Shakespeare of game reviews, and English doesn't happen to be my first language, but I'll do my best to explain my points clearly. I'm going to spend some time explaining each major part the games.\n\nI - Competitive:\nWhy do I want to list this subject first? Simply because this will be a quick talk: Competitive TF2 is basically the best place where you can fully enjoy TF2. The competitive community is mostly made of good and helpful people.\n\nYou will play the game the way it should've been played, whether it's a lobby, pug or a UGC match. For my part, I didn't really want to get into UGC because unfortunately I was already getting into CS:GO and couldn't get the time to look for a team but there is no reason you shouldn't.\n\nII - Trading:\nWe had the good part, now the okayish part. Barely spent anytime there. I never got interested in it mainly because I'm not patient, and I can get the thing I need directly without spending 3 years working for a bigger backpack. Most of TF2 is usually into trading, whether they spend 1 hour a month or 23 hours a day in a trading website/server. The trading community is really mixed. It has good people in it, but it also has scammers and idiots. Yet, this is where I've got to meet a lot of good friends, and where I've been amazed by the ego of some. At the current state of the game, according to many professional traders, unless you have some insane item, you won't make any profit. With all the useless hats added, the supply of cosmetics is insanely high, the demand is scattered and the value the currency holds keeps dropping, dragging everything down with it. In short, trade if you want, but watch out for scammers and sharks and stick with the good people. There aren't many, but they are out there. Trading would've been one of the strengths of TF2 if Valve and the heads of some communities didn't ruin it.\n\n\nIII - Community:\nIt's really mixed. You can find good people if you go to the right pubs, as well as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who will instantly kick you if you aren't a "friendly heavy" or if you ruin their conga or any kind of circlejerk those guys are into. I wasn't lucky with Valve servers as well. Most of the times I played in those servers I was left with autistic meme spouters, 300 ping brazilians or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will call you a tryhard if you simply try to play the game as intended. Some people also blame bronies or furries for making it worse. I honestly don't care about both, I had to witness a lot of pubs with regulars I've enjoyed playing with dying, and if there is something to blame it is not one of the game's communities such as the ones cited above, but rather the direction the game is currently taking.\n\n\nIV - Updates:\nThe game is making a terrible turn. It went from a game that could've been a success in eSports to a casual cash-grabber made to attract more people into Steam. They keep on adding useless lore-breaking cosmetics aswell as useless weapons that keep on making the game worse. Many want Valve to add more weapons to the game - I don't. You have to understand that the point of unlocks are, or were to be very situational items and could also act as a costly alternative such as the Gunboats. Some weapons now are either completely useless such as the new grenade launcher or the Back Scatter or completely random such as the Base Jumper or the Tide Turner. Many people are complaining about EoTL for being one of the worst updates possible to the game. It was overhyped by you guys because you couldn't understand that this was the way Valve wants the game to be. Don't blame those who made EoTL, the ones to blame are those in charge of TF2. They had then to throw in a broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mode that seemed to be coded within a day, as well as a couple of useless weapons or taunts to calm the community down after the disaster. The sad part is that it worked. Meanwhile, almost everyone is still waiting on that "confirmed" matchmaking system which also got "confirmed" back in 2013. Everyone's hyping it, so please, for the sake of the people who still have faith this game, whoever now's in charge of this game, do NOT ♥♥♥♥ it up.\n\nThe game is now 8 years old and still a success for the wrong reasons; but how long is it going to last before more and more people get tired by the way Valve handles the game? Once again, most of these are based on my opinions as well as the opinions of others. I hope this  might be useful for some. I had to write it to unleash the anger I had against the incompetent team supposed to replace the original developers. So go ahead, enjoy the game, play it as its fullest. If you've never played this game you are missing something, so do it now while it lasts. Thank you for your time.","March 18, 2015","true","778.9"," 56 of 73 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","56","73","8","13"

This game provides a helpful tutorial to anyone who isn't ignorant (which I assume the readers are not as they are reading this review, doing research and are eager to learn), teaching basic concepts and how to play more of the unique classes such as the spy and engineer. There is even a training mode to play against AI if you feel that playing against real people is too challenging to begin with. Team Fortress 2 is definitely a game you should get if you are new to steam or PC gaming in general.\n\nTF2 is very different, very diverse compared to other FPS titles. You play as one of nine classes, all with varying roles and weaponry, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. With easily over 100 different weapons in the game, there are many different things to try out. This list keeps growing with the variety of maps and gamemodes to choose from, such as Capture the Flag (a staple in many FPS games), Payload, Mann vs Machine and PASS time. The game also gets somewhat frequent updates, both community made and official, always adding new content and therefore more fun, all without paying a cent.\n\nMicrotransactions exist in this game, however not in a pay-to-win function. They solely exist as a cosmetic function, allowing players to add hats, beards, almost any sort of visual appearance to the mercenaries they play as. Now, as this is only decorational, free-to-play players (or F2Ps for short) don't miss out on anything if they choose to not buy these things, however the option is there if they want to spend money on something they enjoy.\n\nThe community is definitely one of the biggest things in this game, having kept it alive for 9 years as of later this year. There will be good encounters and bad encounters like everything, however, finding your place will ensure you a great time. Unfortunately, many of the pay-to play players (P2Ps for short) frown upon F2Ps, judging them as "unskilled and foolish" among other things of the sorts, however there are also many people who are willing to help out newcomers assuming the newby is willing to listen.\n\nWithout going into too much more detail, this game should definitely be on everyone's to-play list if they haven't done so already, although just prepare yourself for a very unique experience and many great times ahead.","March 30","true","200.6"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","3"

A lot. This doesn't mean the game is awful and should be kept away from. The core gameplay has stayed the same and great, but there are other reasons why I wouldn't recommend getting into it big-time.\n\nFirst of all, no - I do not dislike this game.\n\nThis game is supposed to earn its longevity through updates, yet these are becoming more and more rare, and getting an actually good update is like getting a full mark on an exam. What used to happen was: Valve released updates regularly. These updates contained new weapons, maps, balance changes and game modes - exactly what the game needed. But now, every new update is a cash-grab where you pay 5 Euros to have a woman tell you to play the game and for playing the game for about 20 minutes you get either a lame skin to a weapon, or a crate you have to pay extra 2 Euros to open and get another skin.\n\nThis practice is somewhat new, yet people have been complaining about the updates for a long time. Let's take a look at the 3 most recent actually BIG updates, containing stuff which made the game a bit different and new:\n\nThe Gun Mettle update 2/07/2015\nThe Love & War update 18/06/2014\nThe Two Cities update 21/11/2013\n\nThe Gun Mettle update was probably the most controversial of all. It introduced the contracts and weapon skins along with major balance changes.\n\nThe Love & War update included some new weapons, taunts and reskins - all-round a good update.\n\nThe Two Cities update added a new tour and maps to MvM, along with the killstreak mechanics.\n\n"But I don't even care about the updates!" I hear you cry. The problem is that playing the game is becoming more and more difficult. The optimisation gets worse with every update, the community is becoming increasingly toxic, servers are like the ying-yang and players are either complete noobs who have no idea how the game works, or pubstompers who destroy everyone on a public server.\n\nAgain - the game is good, but there are a lot of issues that prevent me from having fun with it. And the worst thing is that I don't think anything can be done by Valve to solve it. It's fine to jump in and play casually once in a while, but becoming a Team Fortress 2 player will be difficult and not fun.","December 20, 2015","false","723.4"," 374 of 595 people (63%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","63","374","595","30","42"

The Demoman is a anti-stereotypical to the point that it becomes offensive, trying to detract from his african american origin as much as possible.

The sniper is the most incorrect character since 1. He is not a kangaroo and 2. He isn't upside down. The Medic is a nazi. The heavy is a false display of an incredibly overweight Putin with an insuffurable amount of brain cells.

You can play from a hyped Scout kid that seems like he's on coke, a dumb in the head soldier, a crazed Pyro who thinks burning people is like spitting rainbows at fairies, a drunken demoman, an adorable yet horrifying heavy, a chill engineer who drinks on the job, a crazy headed medic who does live surgery, a professional sniper, and a classy spy who gets the job done. Point is, this game is very well developed and has had a lot of effort put into it. Though there are only 9 characters, there are hundreds of weapons that you can use too.\nOnce you get further into the game its more addiction and entertaining, in the start it may seem boring but you just have to get a bit further into the game.

Gather 'round the campfire and let 'ol PSi tell you a story.\n\nIt all began back in 2011, when I was but a young lad. One day, I heard multiple people discussing the game Team Fortress 2. At the time, what I heard was beyond belief. A game where I could ruthlessly murder the friends I didn't have WITH the friends I didn't have? Sign me up!\n\nNow at the time, my pockets were filled with nothing but air , lint, and broken dreams, so I was delighted to hear that this experience was being offered to me for the low, low price of absolutely nothing. Once the lengthy download was complete, I wasted no time learning the ins and outs of the game. I practiced for quite some time against bots, and once I felt I was ready to get murdered in style , I ventured out into servers filled with actual people, all of them hellbent on killing each other. My response? I simply picked up a sniper rifle, flashed a murderous grin, and uttered beneath my breath "Let's. Freakin'. Go." I then proceeded to get shot in the face 50 times before registering my first kill.\n\nOver the next 3 years, I was whisked away on a thrill ride that featured pyromania, robots, weapon nerfs, comics, bakery goods, and of course, hats. By this time I've spent well over 400 hours of my "life" playing the game and making my teammates angry by failing to snipe stationary Heavies. 3 long years without a single regret.\n\nWhat's that? You kids wanna experience what 'ol PSi's been through? Well I'm not stopping ya. Just head down to the Steam store, search for Team Fortress 2, and give it a download. You've got nothing to lose but countless hours of your precious little lives.","July 9, 2014","true","818.5"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","32","36","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoamRifle/recommended/440/","FoamRifle","Foamy the Fearsome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoamRifle/","77 products in account","Team Fortress 2 is a great game for a wide variety of gamers: it has a diversity of fun and original characters, each with their own playstyle, and even within each class you can attune the items in your loadout to your preferences. The game combines competitiveness with silliness in a very balanced way; the characters insult their opponents upon killing them in such a facetious and amusing way they can barely even be considered offensive, and yet they can drive your mind nuts about that one scout that is just too fast for you, that spy that keeps sneaking past your offensive front or that soldier that lands on your head outta freakin' nowhere! What tops this all off, is the Domination/Revenge system which induces a sharp focus on killing tough opponents, granting great satisfaction whenever you get your revenge, or better, when you get to dominate that pesky little pain in the behind that keeps bugging you throughout the round!\n\nPros:\n- Completely free to play; you can make it as expensive as you want, though\n- Original, witty and funny characters with GREAT voice acting\n- Silly, yet competitive in a very balanced way\n- Wide variety of playstyles to suit everyone's preferences\n- A LOT of different weapons, WHY CANT I HOLD ALL THESE WEAPONS\n- Weapon qualities that give specific properties (Strange weapons that count kills, strange parts that count other achievements with a weapon, killstreak kits with an increased showoff-level etc) keep the game interesting and always give you a target to play for\n- Great graphics and animations! Simplicity suits this game perfectly\n- HATS! HATS EVERYWHERE!\n- IT HAS THE CONGA. I LOVE THE CONGA! need I say more?\n\nCons\n- too damn addicting!\n- votekick system bugs, which allows trolls and cheaters to throw off an entire game (luckily only happens seldomly)\n\nOverall rating: Solid 10/10 would hat again\n\nSo if you're bored and looking for something cheap and fun to play: don't look any further - Try TF2! It's free, so you have nothing to lose (except for your free time once you start :D)","December 20, 2014","true","261.5"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/recommended/440/","bipabrena","Metatron | trade.tf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bipabrena/","31 products in account","This game is fascinating. I remember I tried playing it a year ago but I sucked ♥♥♥, so I gave up on it, even though I played for about fifteen minutes. I tried it again this year, because I read the reviews and everyone seemed so fascinated, claiming the game ruined your life because it completely consumed you, some people going as far as saying that something as simple as the whole hats deal was addictive. I'd laugh it off, thinking "It can't be that bad".\n\nAfter almost two months of playing, I can confirm; yeah, it's that bad. Perhaps worse.\n\nThe first few weeks the liking was soft, I liked the game, the "Meet the" videos were amusing and really drew me to the game, but I was extremely bad at first, "15 kills, 10 deaths" type of bad. I dominated just one player every two rounds; and I even got really excited when I got a revenge (Jesus, it's embarrassing to admit). That's how bad, and even n00by I was. I was coming back to online PC gaming after six years of sticking to console, so that wasn't helping. But then, when I started playing a little bit more... when it was a domination after domination, when I'd become friends with my pocket Medics or the people I was a pocket Medic to... Life changed. This game literally consumed me. I wanted to use a portion of my birthday money to buy myself some cosmetics *just* for my Medic, make him beautiful ya'kno, and I ended up spending all of it in cosmetics for many of the classes. I'd stay up extremely late at night playing, sleep little, to then wake up early to play again. Now it's gotten to the point in which I've played 12 hours straight of TF2 with little rest in-between, two days ago it was *fourteen* hours. With a lot of effort I got up my ♥♥♥♥ to work out today just to not be too sedentary, and it was exasperating because I wanted to play. The game's just special like that, ya'know? It's fun. It's unique, creative. And I love the small details like the angry faces the classes make when they're shooting or fighting, the happy faces on the partner-taunts, the faces of agony when they're with low health; details like that make it special. And it's just generally very addictive.\n\nMy point? This game is f*cking terrible. I don't give a cr*p if it's free, DON'T INSTALL IT. IT WILL CONSUME YOU AND RUIN YOU. F*CKING RUN. RUN WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!!!! (I still recommend it, though. Just because you'll have a lot of fun)\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to playing.","April 4, 2015","true","153.4"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","83","38","46","30","16"

But over time I stopped playing for fun and instead began to play with the sole intention of getting at the top of the score board, or a high kill count. Once I started doing that, TF2 quickly went from the quirky and fun game I used to play a few times a week for fun to one of the biggest sources of stress and anger in my life, while at the same time becoming a mild addiction.\n\nPeople joke about wasting tons of money on this game but its a serious problem some people have, myself included. I've blown more money on this game than I care to admit, money I could have put towards funding a new computer or really anything physical, instead of virtual guns and hats that have no value in the real world. I thankfully managed to stop myself before I blew $50+ on Unusual, but I still wasted money that I now sincerely regret spending. Going pay-to-play might be one of my biggest regrets in terms of video game choices, and I've played the Mass Effect games.\n\nGameplay wise TF2 is severely unbalanced right now; and if you disagree you're most likely a part of the imbalance yourself, or are up to your eyes in denial. Every update Valve releases just makes the balancing worse (to be frank there hasn't really been a "good" update since Love and War back in 2014, two years ago (note: L&W was my first tf2 update, I'm aware it's not one of the better ones balancing wise but it was a fantastic update for me in terms of memories and sheer enjoyment)), and with no concrete anti-hacking failsafes, Hackers are still a very real - and very aggravating - issue. (Also good luck if you're new to this game, 'cause pubstompers are even more numerous and aggravating than they were before, and anti-f2p/newbie hostility is at an all time high in pubs.) And don't even get me started on the HUD glitches, dear god.\n\nThe community outside the game is well and nice enough, but in game it's a vile wasteland. Pubs (and even some community servers) are full of hostile and toxic players who will cuss you out for making simple mistakes, as well as "pro" players who kick newbies and f2ps just for being both of those things. It got so bad that I started muting everyone the moment I entered game servers so I could play in peace without the text and voice chat distracting me.\n\nAll of these problems just snowballed to the point that I was playing this game merely out of spite rather than to have a good time with friends like I used to. I wanted to prove an invisible audience that I was GOOD at this game, and damn it I lost a lot of sleep and money trying to achieve that goal. I came out unhappier and broke as a result, and all I can do now is look at my 1800 hours and my measly inventory with nothing but regret and bitterness. I wish I could go back and stop myself from going down tryhard lane, but alas.\n\nMaybe I'll pick up Team Fortress 2 again sometime in the future, and I'll go back into it with the intention to have fun once more. For now though, I'm locking up my stranges and hanging up my hats, and leaving this game on the virtual shelves until that day arrives. (If it ever does.) But with its current state - and with my own current opinion of the game - I cannot reccomend it.\n\nTLDR; Game constantly bugs you to go pay-to-play until you buy something, unbalanced gameplay and toxic in-game community. This game used to be good but is now a shadow of its former self.","February 23","false","871.6"," 169 of 264 people (64%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","64","169","264","17","114"

This game is very fun when playing with friends but going to random server always ended to me with being thrown rude comments at. Comments about me being bad at game I could take because I have played so little that I can not compare to veterans but I think that does not need foul language or people calling me with rude names and going to personal stuff.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaelanfrey/recommended/440/","kaelanfrey","kaelan!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaelanfrey/","204 products in account","This is the single most entertaining online FPS on the market right now.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is a free-to-play online class-based first person shooter which pits two teams of nine classes against each other in various game modes and challenges. Players can unlock weapons and cosmetic items by completing achievements or winning them through death (though this is random and has a limit which is reset each week). While some bonus weapons are borderline direct upgrades, the unfortunate Scout is still extremely powerful with his stock weaponry, for example. These extra weapons are more comparable to VARIATIONS than upgrades - most of them are designed as side-grades. The only example I can think that is really overpowered is the Medic's Übersaw, but why the hell would you get close to a Medic anyway? His normal Bonesaw can tear you to shreds just as easily, if not EASIER. My point is that unlike other free-to-play games, you can have plenty of variety and do just as well as a similarly-skilled player with your normal or bonus weapons.\n\nLet's talk about the classes: there are 9 in total, with at least 3 weapons each. They are divided by 3 groups, the Offense, the Defense and the Support. But these groups are useless labels. I'll play by Valve's rules, though. Let's see...\nOn the Offense, we have the Scout: the fast-as-crap, annoying ♥♥♥♥wad who can kill you easily while up close. He can also double-jump! Meanwhile, he's borderline useless at long range.\nNext up, the Soldier: he has a rocket launcher. The rockets' damage degrade over distance, so long-range spamming isn't a huge deal. He is slow as ♥♥♥♥ on his own, but since he can rocket jump, he is literally one of the most mobile classes in the game.\nLastly, the Pyro: he burns you. A lot. He also can extinguish friendlies on fire with his flamethrower's compression blast, which is ALSO USEFUL TO REFLECT ENEMY PROJECTILES (not including bullets, of course). This is a huge feature that makes the Pyro really stand out. Educate yourself on the Pyro and he's far more useful than just his job of burning enemy spies.\n\nLet's check out the Defense. First off, we have the Demoman. As his name suggests, he is a demolitions man, and he can blow ♥♥♥♥ up easily. He has a grenade launcher and a stickybomb launcher, and the latter needs to have it's projectiles blown up on-demand. He can have 8 sticky grenades (or "stickies") active at once. This class is really good at defending an area and blowing up buildings by the Engineer.\nBefore the hardhat, we have the big tub of russian meat called the Heavy: he has a minigun which WILL tear you a new one up close. Boasting the largest default health pool in the game, he is a force to be reckoned with. However, by himself, just like anyone else, he is pretty useless. So don't get too confident.\nNow we have the Engineer, one of the most unique classes in this game. Aside from his Shotgun + Pistol, he has a Wrench and 2 PDAs for construction and destruction, respectively. He can build a Sentry Gun, a Dispenser and a Teleport Entrance/Exit. They all can be upgraded up to Level 3, which improves their peformance.\n\nFinally we have the Support classes. This is probably the least misleading label, because they ARE support classes, therefore, YOU DON'T NEED A MILLION OF THEM AT ONCE.\nLet's start with my favourite class, the Medic: Hohoho boy, seen as a pansy man of medicine, he has a syringe gun which can really hurt a careless someone and a bonesaw which REALLY hurts too. His greatest power however is the Medigun; with it, the Medic can heal a person up to 150% of their health, and once his Ubercharge meter is filled, he can turn himself and his healing target invincible for 8 seconds. He can also heal two targets quickly while deploying his Ubercharge to have them both invincible aswell, but the duration of the Uber will be decreased to 5 seconds. If you're even FASTER, you can have 3 people on godmode too!! But it'll be over so soon that it's not worth it.\nNow we have the Sniper: as his name suggests, he has a Sniper Rifle, the only stock weapon in the game that can Headshot people. I don't have much to say about this one. Just have good judgment, PLEASE. This class is nearly useless in some situations - if the situation demands it, swap. There are just too many sniper teams that lose so easily to teams with varied classes.\nAnother overused class is the Spy, also a very unique character: He can cloak, aswell as backstab people with his knife for a guaranteed instant kill, given they aren't Ubercharged by the default Medigun. He also has a Sapper, which disables Engineer buildings and after a while they blow up. When used correctly and sparsely, he is an EXTREMELY dangerous fellow. Again, solo judgment please: if you already have more than two of these in your team (in normal 12x12 games), don't switch to a Spy.\n\nThat takes care of the classes. What about the maps?!\nOh good lord, there are so many official and custom maps that it'd be impossible to describe them all. There are quite a few official modes aswell: Control Points (CP), Payload (PL), King of the Hill (KOTH), Capture the Flag (CTF), Special Delivery (SD), Payload Race (PLR) and Mann vs Machine (MVM)\n\nIn CP, it depends. There are Attack/Defense maps, which has BLU attacking the RED control points, and there are 5CP maps, in which both teams need to be in control of all of the control points to win.\nIn Payload, the BLU team needs to push a railed cart into the RED base to win. Of course, RED needs to stop them.\nIn King of the Hill, you have a central point which needs to be captured by one team and held for 3 total minutes. It's pretty much the same as KOTH in other games.\nIn Capture the Flag, the team needs to go get the enemy's briefcase and bring it to their briefcase's spawn point. It's the same as every other CTF game, but the flags are briefcases and their returns are timed - you can't grab your own briefcase to return it.\nSpecial Delivery is a 1-point CTF mode, where one team needs to go get the briefcase somewhere in the central edges of the map and bring it to the opposite central edge. Like in normal CTF, the return is timed, and only one team can have control of the briefcase at a time.\nPayload Race is an absurd one. Both teams need to push their own cart while stopping the enemy from pushing THEIR cart. It gets pretty crazy and it's quite fun.\nIn Mann VS Machine, you have one team against an army of ROBOTS based on the classes (and a Tank). They come in waves and it's the only mode where you can upgrade your weapons and have a special canteen to hold bonuses.\n\nThere are custom game modes aswell, such as WarioWare Minigames, Surf, 1v1 MGE Training, Team Deathmatch, vs Saxton Hale (A Juggernaut/"1 versus Everyone else" mode) etc. Once you've gotten pretty good at the game, you can try out competitive TF2, where you'll learn a much higher degree of teamwork, coordination and combat in comparison to normal public servers!\n\nAnd the weapons? Good lord, there are so many that I'd lose count. Let's leave them as a surprise, yes?\n\nMy only nitpick with this game is it's... optimization. It's not that well optimized. At all, actually. This is due to the over-abundance of updates since the last 4 years, but luckily, you can get custom configuration files to fix this problem somewhat. I've also heard if your game gets cluttered with custom content, you can reinstall it for a fresh new start and have the game running amazingly, but I have never tried it.\n\nSounds like fun? I'm sure it does, and it gets better when you start playing. So, what are you waiting for?! Some final words? A numerical value?? SEVERAL ONES, MAYBE?? Fine, but I'll get you just one! Here's your damn score:\n\nTF2 gets a score of 9/10. It's extremely fun and it never gets old. It IS counter-intuitive at first, but when you get used to it, it's awesome!","April 22, 2014","true","423.4"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","7"

It is considered to be one of the best free 2 play games ever made next to Dota 2. Did i not mentioned that these two games is published by Valve ? Yup anything that Valve made is a masterpiece.\n\nThe game had a total of nine classes. Ranging from sniper,demoman,scout,heavy,engineer,soldier,pyro,medic & spy. Each of the classes had their own role and different play style.\n\nEach of the classes had their own charming personality and likeable characteristics. You can also taunt to kill your enemy if you are lucky.\n\nThe games provide a massive tons of modes and it rare to see in a first person shooter game. Just look at these list : http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_game_modes\n\nYou get numerous weapon,different parts of outfits as you play through many matches.\n\nThere is also a crafting system where you combined different parts of weapon & scrap to obtained a much more powerful weapon.\n\nEach of the weapon provides different types of ability & stats. Most of it have their own pros & cons.\n\nThe game requires a lot of teamwork sometimes depending on what modes you are playing. Also medic + heavy = OWNAGE.\n\nGRAPHICS : 10/10\n\nFor a game that come out in 2007,it age extremely well and still to these days the cartoonish artstyle impress me a lot.\n\nA lot of the texture are well details as well as the character models.\n\nEach of the maps provide different variety of background & well thought out level design.\n\nThe animations perform from each character are well done and doesn't look like crap.\n\nThis game also have blood & gore in it too and it is pretty well detailed too.\n\nAUDIO : 10/10\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is superb especially the main theme songs. All of them are done in an orchestral theme.\n\nWhile they don't go for a realistic sound effects since it doesn't fit in with the game theme,they go for a much more funny approach in making all of sound effects that really blend in with the feels of the games.\n\nThe voice acting for each of the classes is excellent ( except for pyro cause he mostly mumble random stuff ). Each of them have their own unique taunts & quote.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 10/10\n\nThis games provides more modes than any first person shooter game does along with an on-going update with every 2-3 weeks or so.\n\nThere is a huge amount of items you collect during your gameplay sessions.\n\nNot to mentioned there is a bunch of custom map that you download & play on.\n\nIt even much more fun if you have friends to play with you adding a ton of enjoyment into the game.\n\nYou will never get bored with each of the class since there is always a challenge when dealing with certain type of situation.\n\nNot to mentioned the amount of achievement you can get just by playing the game is huge so this will keep you busy for a long times.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 10/10\n\nReally recommended for everyone especially to those who are not a fan of first person shooter game.\n\nEvery game that Valve made have their own special moments,innovative gameplay & unique style.\n\nA truly masterpiece of arts.\n\nGRADE : S ( Masterpiece )","June 6, 2014","true","24.2"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supa_man141/recommended/440/","supa_man141","Jarr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supa_man141/","112 products in account","Absolutely awesome game! A great range of classes to choose from. Scout is a fast running class that is mostely used for doing the map objective (capture the flag, pushing cart) and just generally annoying people. Soldier is a slow moving class armed with a rocket launcer, a shotgun, and a entrenching tool (shovel) soldier is one of the main damage dealers in team fortress 2. The Pyro is a masked psycho armed with a flame thrower, a shotgun, and a fire axe. Pyro is again a main damage dealer but instead he/she uses his/hers flame thrower to burn enemies alive. The Demolitions Man (demo man) is much like the soldier with explosive weapons instead a grenade launcher, a sticky bomb launcher (manually exploded bombs that stick to walls etc)\nand a bottle! The demoman is a main damage dealer aswell but used as a defence class because of his sticky bomb launcher to make traps he is also very drunk! xD. The Heavy weapons guy is as you guess, a guy with big ♥♥♥ weapons! he carries a minigun, a shotgun and uses his fists to punch people! Heavy is the God of damage dealing, he can kill all the other classes quite easily, but be careful! Heavy is a very slow class and is quite vulnerable to take damage from behind!\nThe engineer. The engineer is a defence class that creates Sentry guns to defend, he can upgrade his sentry 3 times. level 1 being a normal sentry, level 2 being two chainguns on the side and level 3 with a rocket launcher on the top!\nThe medic is the support class healing his teammates who are in need of help, the medic is the second fastest class in team fortress 2 he also has a thing called Uber charge, which is you and the person you're healing have a few seconds of invulnerability. The sniper is a long ranged Damage dealer he uses a powerful Sniper rifle, a SMG and a machete the sniper can take out most classes in a quickshot however you can keep scoped in to fill a meter which makes your shots more powerful, when this meter is full you can take out a heavy in one shot in the head! The spy is a very different class... The silent assassin, the spy carries a revolver, a knife and a electro-sapper the electro-sapper is used for destroying enemy engineer's sentry guns although the engineer can destroy these sappers that doesn't mean that you can't backstab him! an important role in the spy is to backstab people with your knife to instantly kill your target the spy has the ability to make himself temporarily invisible and has the ability to disguise as the enemy team to fool them! That is all the classes in team fotress 2! I hope this review was helpful and i hope to see you on a server!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLairOfTheChair/recommended/440/","TheLairOfTheChair","Chair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLairOfTheChair/","25 products in account","Radically different from the going FPS standard.\nA gem gameplay wise.\nIt's free, there's no excuse not to give it a try.\n\nThat was the short version.\nIf that didn't convince you yet, move along.\n\nThe mechanics the 9 playable classes are based on are remarkably creative and pretty unique:\nWhile one class is able to perform a Mario-style doublejump, another can literally blow back enemy missiles at their rightful owners' faces, and then there's a soldier whose playstyle revolves around surfing on exploding rockets' knockback - just to graze a third of the available characters.\n\nThe variety in gameplay is still increased by unlockable gear for each of them. And believe me, whether you're going to fight your foes with a pistol or a glass of milk DOES make a difference.\n\nTalking about unlocks, a widespread disease of free to play games with unlockable content are those being "pay to win" options - not in Team Fortress 2.\nOwning more items than yor foe will not ensure you an advantage; either all their upsides are balanced by negative side-effects or they are purely cosmetic.\nThis makes the game very beginner friendly because it prevents new players from being straight-down outgunned (additionally all of the gameplay-relevant stuff is easily obtainable for everyone; you recieve a free item every ~40 minutes of playtime) while it also allows advanced players to customize their characters to both, visually and gameplay-wise, better meet their taste.\n\nCombat itself too breaks away from the norm in many (positive) ways.\nThere's a static health pool instead of the genre-established regenerative system, and although revolving around mid-ranged combat, this game shows a complete lack of assault-rifles of any kind.\nI guess the most noticable difference to other games of the multiplayer-FPS-genre though is that confrontations between players typically last significantly longer, with fights designed around the recieving party nearly always having a chance to react - which is something I greatly appreciate, for that's what I personally feel titles like Call of Duty are lacking.\n\nThere's only few negative things to mention about the gameplay mechanics; minor annoyances such as the 'randomness' damage-modifier and an at times wonky melee hit registration (though, that's a flaw shared by literally every multiplayer game there is) are just that: Minor annoyances.\nEventually they don't spoil your overall expirience.\n\nAlthough 7 years old, the game still is steadily growing and updated regularily, with bug fixes, balance patches, new maps, items and game-modes being released every month or two, ensuring you won't end up bored.\n\n\nSo, to recap:\nWhether you are casually or competitively motivated,\nwhether you like proving your skill against other players, or prefer fighting alongside them against hordes of robots,\nwhether you like stealth, traps, mobility-based combat, or sniping,\nwhether you want to beat your foes by setting up turrets or slapping them with fish,\nyou _will_ find something to enjoy in this game.\nAnd yeah.\nThe only thing it costs you is the time it takes to download.\n\n\n9.5/10, would will play again.","December 27, 2013","true","223.6"," 35 of 44 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","35","44","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuuIsHuu/recommended/440/","HuuIsHuu","huu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HuuIsHuu/","177 products in account","Ah, TF2...what can be said about it that hasn't been said already?\n\nFor those of you who hate lengthy reviews, here's a short pros-n-cons review:\nPros:+Fast-paced, addicting gameplay & game modes\n+Unique weapons\n+Rather fun crafting & trading system\n+Great maps\n+Mostly friendly community\n+Awesome mod support (except for Valve servers)\n+Hilarious, distinct, fun to play as, 9 different classes\n+HATS!!\n\nCons:-As more "big updates" come out, the worse the game performs\n-Valve servers don't allow mods\n-Slow support from Valve\n-Community can become agressive with free players\n\nDo I recommend?YES!\n\nShort review done.\nNow, for the lengthy one.\n\nI was first introduced to Team Fortress 2 in 2012 by a real life friend, and at first - I thought "pfft, this game is ♥♥♥♥, never gonna play it." That is, until I made my own Steam account & tried it myself. I became addicted. So much so, that I spent 10 hours at my friend's house EVERY SINGLE DAY, just playing TF2.\n\nNow, TF2 is a first-person shooter, as that wasn't obvious enough already. If you've played a first-person shooter ever in your life before, getting accustomed to TF2's controls is going to be easier than picking up a rock and throwing it. And that's the thing - anyone who comes into TF2 can have a very basic understanding of how to play the game. But be warned - just because it's easy to pick up & play, doesn't mean it's easy to master. Every class has their own specific strenghts & weaknesses, so no class is "the one true god", every class counters each other in one way or another.\nAs for game modes, we have multiple - Payload (my personal favorite), Capture the Flag, King of the Hill, Control Points, Attack & Defense, Payload Race, Special Delivery, Mann vs. Machine, Robot Destruction (Beta), Mannpower (Beta) & Pass Time (Beta). None of the game modes come off as "confusing" and all of them are, really, pretty straight forward. So, don't worry about not knowing what to do.\n\nEach class has their own arsenal of weapons they can use. I would take an entire day trying to describe the item system for every class, so let's just leave it at the fact that each class has a lot of new weapons they can use that aren't the stock ones, alright? Alright.\n\nCrafting is very easy. Much like the item system, I'd be sitting all damn day explaining the many different combinations you can get. But I will say this - crafting is 100% optional, but if you use it, it's absolutely easy to use, all you need are the right items.\nSame goes for trading, but trading is a lot more complicated, so for that one, I recommend actually reading a guide, or you'll end up just annoying everyone in the trading scene. Since this is a review, I won't be explaining that. We have to get a move on, after all.\n\nNow, the community is both my favorite & least favorite part about TF2. More times than 10 have I encountered people who are, just - absolutely awesome. In many servers, there will always be at least 1 person trying to be "friendly" with everyone, giving heal items or sharing a good laugh, things like that. They're almost everywhere, it's absolutely awesome and something I encourage. However, there will always be those tryhard scumbags who will try to kill literally everyone in sight because they bought a new 0.33 ref Strange weapon that they want to level up.\n\nThe mods, oh god, THE MODS! You can literally make your characters look like freaking anime girls and have them shoot each other with water guns. Yes, you can do that! You can change the huds, sounds, etc. it's all possible! However, just remember, that - if you go to a Valve server, they are going to be disabled, due to sv_pure 1. I am unsure why they updated their servers to include that, but it's the reason why many players don't like Valve servers.\n\nAnd the classes - each class is really fun to play as, as well as hearing their unique, and sometimes - even hilarious lines! If I had to give my personal opinion, my favorite class is Demoman, while my least favorite is Pyro or Engineer.\n\nBut now, let's get to the bad stuff.\n\nFirst of all, every single time Valve releases a new major update, the game runs worse. Take it from me, during Dec2014-Jan2015, my game ran BEAUTIFULLY on a 16v16 server, with a mostly constant 250-300 FPS. Now, with a few "updates" under the belt, my game struggles to get 60 FPS on a 7v7 server. That's not good.\n\nI've also mentioned how Valve's official servers don't support mods, which makes no sense (to me).\nBut what I haven't really mentioned was how Valve seems to care less & less for TF2. It's understandable, the game is getting older, it's over 8 years old at this point, but the updates for TF2 & blog usually take around 2 months. Sure, they might release a patch that fixes like 1 or 2 things, but as far as releasing those said major updates & other things that desperately need fixing, they take 2-3 months, if not - longer!\n\nAlso, as I've mentioned - the community can become excessively aggressive with new players or "f2ps", as they're called. There is no reason they should be this way, but they are. No worries, though, there will be someone who'll come out of the shadows to start protecting you from those bullies, but, again - there is no reason the community has to be this aggressive with new players. Don't get discouraged and just do your best to ignore them!\n\nSo, in the end - I love Team Fortress 2.\nEven if you don't have friends, the game is insanely fun to play even by yourself - and there's even a chance you'll make new friends from TF2!\n\nI absolutely recommend Team Fortress 2 to everyone, it's a game everyone on Steam must try.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 gets a score of:8.3/10.0\n"Hands down, the best f2p game released."","August 25, 2015","true","707.6"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","30","36","3","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/recommended/440/","skillless","Peashooter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skillless/","238 products in account","I got the game along with “the Orange Box” back in 2007. Of course, Team Fortress Classic was, like Portal, just a side character where the protagonist was really Half-life 2 Episode Two. Before I begin on Team Fortress 2, allow me to spend a paragraph or two on its predecessor. (Skip the next 2 paragraphs if you are not interested)\n\nMore than a decade ago, during the era of 56kbps internet and much frustration for both the internet users and phone callers alike, I bought a disc which contains a number of Half-Life mods, including the all-time famous “Counter-Strike 1.5”. I was very fond of this little piece of gem back then, as downloading a 500mb file is near impossible. Little did I know that I will be spending most of my time on something else that I have no idea what it as back then, a mod that goes by the name of “Team Fortress Classic”.\n\n“Team Fortress Classic” has one of the most versatile first-person-shooter gameplay back then when compared to contenders such as “Counter-Strike”. Although the original concept of Team Fortress is based upon the battle between two teams with nine different classes, I am more personally attached to the party-style gameplay which its custom maps have to offer. With over a thousand of maps to choose from, it is possible for me to find myself in the most peculiar yet fascinating maps and situations. I could be playing volleyball or basketball using rockets, or partying in a pub while trying to sneak pass a Heavy-Weapon-Dude-Bouncer; I could be roaming around Osaka or Sahara; I could be defending or capturing a point, massacring or being massacred by a heavy, or even laughing my butt off. Yes, it was fun, and it was hell of an epic party each night.\n\nThat was more than a decade ago, and then came “Team Fortress 2”, sitting with its peers in an orange package. The question is not whether the game is good or not, but whether can it continue its predecessor’s legacy. It has been 7 years since its release and time did tell that Team Fortress 2 is more than competent in continuing its predecessor’s legacy, though the effect was not immediate.\n\nAs with most online multiplayer server-based First Person Shooters, Team Fortress 2 started off as something that is quite weak and linear. The community for Team Fortress 2 was still building up back then and there isn’t much community-made customizations back then, something that is very important in laying a foundation of a multiplayer game so that its longevity can be sustained. The only major improvements between Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2 is that the later has an improved cartoon-like skin, which is more suiting for its party-like gameplay nature, and an item system which was pretty weak back then. The rest are pretty much the same.\n\nTime pass and the community grew as the old source engine becomes outdated. A larger variety of weapons begin to appear, and the community start coming up with a variety of mods. From Saxton Hale campaigns (boss fights) to Prop Hunts (Hide and Seek), and then to the official Mann VS Machine mods (Coop game-play), the legacy of Team Fortress Classic begins to take form within Team Fortress 2 at a foundation which is even more solid than its predecessor. Team Fortress 2 stood the testament of time and the size of the community surged. This is even truer when the game went free. I’ve had my share of fun, laughter and tears (due to laughter), and I have met my clique of friends where whom I have remained intimate as we journeyed through different games while transcending beyond the boundary of Steam. Team Fortress 2 has came a long way, and, although the results might not be immediate, it sure is worth your investment of time.\n\nOh and if you are wondering, hats are never my interest.","June 10, 2014","true","680.5"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","5"

Everyone can play it, from kids, teens to parents, everyone can play. The game is very well balanced, each class has more than one unique abilities you can explore. You can get item drops as you play, and the more play, the more you can get. Items can be crafted for another better items too, or trade them for other items. And the best thing about his game is hats! Yes, hats. Most every damn people here on Steam loves them. You can show off your hats, craft it or even sell them! Many people make profit from it, many people collect it.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 graphics is 3D but with cartoon style. Even though the graphics is cartoon, Team Fortress 2 still feature blood and gore effects.

In other words, I will be individually reviewing the following three separate games:\n\nTeam Fortress 2 (2007-2010)\nHat Fortress 2 (2010-2012)\nDressup Fortress 2 (2012-present)\n\nBut first,\nGeneral:\n-You can regularly defy the laws of physics in too many ways to be listed.\n-Scouts can fly by flapping their legs.\n-A can of soda turns you into the Super-Matrix; you can make bullets dodge you.\n-Some pistols can make you jump higher or fully absorb the impact of falling at any velocity.\n-Coating someone in milk and then beating them up will cure your cancer.\n-Steel-toed boots make shooting rockets at your feet less unhealthy.\n-Whipping people makes them run faster.\n-A big Russian guy can survive as many direct hits from an anti-tank missile as a Russian T-72 tank can.\n-Blowing into a seashell can patch the gunshot wounds of everyone around you.\n-Flamethrowers can also shoot a powerful blast of air that can send people flying or rockets back to their maker.\n-You can beat people to death with a bottle of whiskey.\n-You can decapitate people with a golf club.\n-Harmless explosives.\n-Eating a sandvich will cure AIDS, mend katana wounds, and treat your erectile dysfunction.\n-Hitting a machine with a wrench will fix it, upgrade it, and resupply it.\n-Dispensers generate ammo for your weapon and pills for your back pain.\n-A remote control with one big red button can be used to destroy one of any four buildings of your choosing.\n-You can shoot up morphine with a crossbow.\n-You can use a beam of light to turn someone’s exterior skin and clothing into pure titanium armor.\n-Pretending to play the violin with a bonesaw used for amputation will cure the common cold.\n-Urine is more effective than a fire extinguisher.\n-Frenchmen with ski masks are incapable of stabbing their victims in the neck. When they encounter Australians with shields on their backs, they’ll stab the shield first… Making the shield disintegrate.\n-A pocket watch can partially absorb the damage caused by a rocket, create a deceased doppelganger of you, all while you become invisible and walk away.\n-If you backstab someone with an icicle, they’ll instantly transform into a highly-durable ice sculpture.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 (2007-2010)\nThis was a team-based first person shooter involving two identical teams, differing only in color and artistic design, vying for control of various strategic locales around the world. You could play as one of nine cripplingly overspecialized classes. The various classes would have to pool their strengths together and cooperate in order to prevail over the opposing team. However, this was easier said than done as communication and teamwork were (and still are) generally foreign concepts. Teams would have to beat each other up and steal their briefcases, beat each other up and steal their stage lighting platforms, and beat each other up to push a high explosive bomb cart into a pit. Hats were just a cool side thing. Many people would stand around and do nothing on dedicated idle servers so that they could amass the metal necessary to craft themselves a new hat.\nOverall, Team Fortress 2 was a fun and highly addictive game whether or not there was a team or no team involved.\n\nOver 9 out of 9, worth the weight.\n\nHat Fortress 2 (2010-2012)\nThe Mann-Conomy Update, released on September 30, 2010, marked the end of Team Fortress 2 and the birth of Hat Fortress 2. Players no longer needed to idle to get hats. They could also buy them, trade for them, and even sell them for other hats. In addition, keys were also introduced, giving players the ability to throw away their parent’s or their own hard-earned money on opening virtual crates in the hopes of getting virtual hats. More often than not, they ended up getting worthless virtual guns. The Mann-Conomy fever quickly swept over Team Fortress 2, reducing it to a side game. Hat Fortress 2 was about accumulating as many hats as possible by any means necessary and then using the Team Fortress 2 mini-game to show them off to others. The free-to-play update in 2011 further enlarged the player base, increasing the popularity of Hat Fortress 2, its modes, and related fun mini-games. As Hat Fortress 2 was further refined and developed, new elements were added, including unusuals and non-hat cosmetic items. Eventually, so many new cosmetics came in that Hat Fortress 2 gradually evolved into another game.\n\n11 hats out of 10.\n\nDressup Fortress 2 (2012-Present)\nThis is the current and ultimate form of Team Fortress 2. The game is centered on assembling a complete outfit for each of the classes that you play. You can acquire the components for your dream outfit by unboxing crates of all shapes and sizes and/or by implementing any one of the many trading strategies out there. You can show off your outfits, topped off with exorbitant unusual hats, in a multitude of ways. You can do the conga, hi-five other folks adorned with fancy and quirky outfits, play intense games of rock, paper, scissors, or play Jack Black’s guitar. You can also play whatever vestiges remain of the old Team Fortress 2. You could also play Mann vs. Machine and acquire stock weapons with robotic skulls hanging from them or perhaps even become The Man with the Golden Gun. If neither of those are satisfactory, there are a wide range of other mini-games to play, some of which have been around since the days of old Team Fortress 2. They include, but are not limited to: Versus Saxton Hale, Freak Fortress 2, Jailbreak, Balloon Race, TF2 Kart, magic spells in Halloween event maps, Slender Fortress, Surf maps, Jump maps, and TF2Ware.\nIn conclusion, Dressup Fortress 2 does provide something for everyone, so I guess it’s alright.\n\n11/10 iterations of Gaben. And my favorite class is the Spy.

Oh please, are you breathing? The answer is that obvious! Yes! I love it! Almost every aspect of it is perfect. What more can I ask for?\n\n- Free To Play\n> I don't have to add on, do I? It's wonderful. It creates the rainbows in the skies. It makes my unicorn fly. BAM!\n\n- Noob-Friendly\n> I started out as a gaming noob, barely knowing anything about Steam, or Team Fortress. My friend recommended Team Fortress 2 as my first tryout and I got hooked not long after.\n> They have a training mode to shape you up in and out, even an option to request a coach. 100% human plox. They offer amazing training grounds, offline practices... If you can't get a hang of Team Fortress 2 after playing it for a week, I'm judging you. Jokes! But it's really noob-friendly and I recommend this for first-time FPS players.\n> "You'll get tired of your first ever game easily."? False! I still play Team Fortress 2 and I'm loving it even more than when I just started out!\n\n- Sweet Graphics & Animation\n> Got a thing for realistic, not-too-gorey, and somewhat-cute graphics? Yo! This' the thing for you, bro!\n> As a first-time FPS player, promoting myself from Maplestory and being a scaredy-girl, I'm scared of extreme gore and blood. Team Fortress 2's graphics are awesome to me as there's just enough gore and blood, pretty much tolerable, and sometimes even funny! Also, if you're finding a FPS game with 100% no gore and blood... First off, I don't even think there's such a game. Secondly, you're not gonna have as much fun! *sad face* Lastly, it's an experience!\n\n- Various Types of Gameplay Plots (Maps)\n> From Payload Races to Capture The Flag, from Control Points to Mann VS Machine, there's probably as many plots as, or more than, the fingers on your hands!\n> Every plot has a different style of playing, strategies and players! If you're good at finding something, and probably have a good way of running away, Capture The Flag is for you! Hate computers and how smart they are? Or if you just want to rage at multiple objects which are stupider than you, Mann VS Machine is there for you to cast all your sorrows!\n> Team Fortress 2 gives us so many choices, it's hard to stick to one. It's like reading a book, you'll get bored if you keep reading the same story over and over again, but you still love the writing style of the writer. Thus, you read the other books by the same writer! Same logic!\n\n- Various Classes\n> As someone who just popped in and promoted from Maplestory, I like the idea of having my character suited for different situations. For example, although the Heavy is great at clearing maps, it gets annoying when a Sniper from the other team takes advantage of your slow movements and spam kills you. What do you do? Change to a Scout and crash that Sniper's brains!\n> Different classes are great at different maps, it complements the gameplay to the max!\n\n- Multiplayer Features\n> There's a chat system for you to communicate with your teammates -- by typing or speaking.\n> "But people are so annoying!" No worries, you can vote to mute, kick, and ban players on Team Fortress 2! Thank God for this.\n\n- Character Customization\n> The Mann Co. Catalog. Fanciful, huh?\n> You can get different hats and weapons to customize your characters, and make them the way you want them to be! Recommended for hipsters who are trying to escape the mainstream. To be honest, I feel more encouraged after I get a new look... Is it just me?\n\n- Market\n> You can buy, sell and trade for hats and weapons to customize your character. It gets irritating when you see someone having this awesome weapon you want, and yet you can't get the drop. There's the market for you -- buy it from the Mann Co. or the Steam Community Market. It isn't very expensive either, considering most of the items are roughly $0.99.\n> When you have no idea where the spend your Steam Wallet and want to train your business skills.\n\n- Teamwork\n> Let's get to the social part, shall we? Team Fortress, like its name, strengthens players' sense of teamwork. I'm pretty sure your parents or teachers screwed into your brain how important teamwork is, so I wouldn't get on that.\n> Example time! You're playing Control Points and there's an Engineer from your opponent's team that has been building sentry guns for forever. He's wiping out anyone who steps near the control point so you can't capture it. What do you do? Conspire with a Spy to sap the Engineer's sentry and have everyone else rush forward to capture the control point! Teamwork at it's best.\n\n- Community\n> The community is fun to be in, and I'll just say the developer has a great sense of humour. Just take a look at their YouTube channel! I've never laughed so hard at characters from an online game. If you've ever watched "Meet The _____", you'll realize that the classes have their own personalities and their own backgrounds! It's very entertaining to watch and laugh at.\n> Team Fortress 2 has a wonderful amount of artists, take a look at the fan art! Some are cute, some are gorey... All just plain Amazing with a capital A.\n> Don't know how to play? Good heavens, there are so many guides written by the professional players!\n> ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nI may have missed out one or two points, but you get my point. Team Fortress 2 is far more than amazing for a Free-To-Play game. So I'll say, "9/10 will get it."\n\n*gives developer a hug and kiss*","February 4, 2014","true","229.6"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","3"

Instead, here's the wikipedia entry for Ducks:\n\nDuck is the common name for a large number of species in the Anatidae family of birds, which also includes swans and geese. The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the Anatidae family; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water.\n\nDucks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules, and coots.\n\n\n\nThe word duck comes from Old English *dūce "diver", a derivative of the verb *dūcan "to duck, bend down low as if to get under something, or dive", because of the way many species in the dabbling duck group feed by upending; compare with Dutch duiken and German tauchen "to dive".\n\nThis word replaced Old English ened/ænid "duck", possibly to avoid confusion with other Old English words, like ende "end" with similar forms. Other Germanic languages still have similar words for "duck", for example, Dutch eend "duck" and German Ente "duck". The word ened/ænid was inherited from Proto-Indo-European; compare: Latin anas "duck", Lithuanian ántis "duck", Ancient Greek nēssa/nētta (νῆσσα, νῆττα) "duck", and Sanskrit ātí "water bird", among others.\n\nA duckling is a young duck in downy plumage[1] or baby duck;[2] but in the food trade young adult ducks ready for roasting are sometimes labelled "duckling".[citation needed]\n\nA male duck is called a drake and the female duck is called a duck, or in ornithology a hen.\n\n\nThe overall body plan of ducks is elongated and broad, and the ducks are also relatively long-necked, albeit not as long-necked as the geese and swans. The body shape of diving ducks varies somewhat from this in being more rounded. The bill is usually broad and contains serrated lamellae, which are particularly well defined in the filter-feeding species. In the case of some fishing species the bill is long and strongly serrated. The scaled legs are strong and well developed, and generally set far back on the body, more so in the highly aquatic species. The wings are very strong and are generally short and pointed, and the flight of ducks requires fast continuous strokes, requiring in turn strong wing muscles. Three species of steamer duck are almost flightless, however. Many species of duck are temporarily flightless while moulting; they seek out protected habitat with good food supplies during this period. This moult typically precedes migration.\n\nThe drakes of northern species often have extravagant plumage, but that is moulted in summer to give a more female-like appearance, the "eclipse" plumage. Southern resident species typically show less sexual dimorphism, although there are exceptions like the Paradise Shelduck of New Zealand which is both strikingly sexually dimorphic and where the female's plumage is brighter than that of the male. The plumage of juvenile birds generally resembles that of the female.\n\nYou must pay $5 USD to continue reading","December 31, 2014","true","143.4"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","22","25","6","3"

It was the first game I had ever bought on Steam, and around that time in fall of 2008 there were only three characters updated with achievement weapons. Trading and hats weren't in existence yet, and the game truly was a "teamwork required" type of game. Every class felt balanced and fair, with each one having their own respective strengths and weaknesses. Even the achievement weapons brought a nice change of pace from the normal minigun and bonesaw. You actually felt accomplished when you did the achievements because you were rewarded. The community was surprisingly welcoming, and a majority of my Steam friends came from TF2. At the time, we had thought that Valve was going to update the rest of the characters with their own achievements and that would be all; and for awhile, we were right. One by one the rest of the classes got their own weapons and achievements, and by July 8th 2010 (Happy Birthday to me!), the Engineer was the last character updated. The game felt complete, three years in the making. Now... I think everyone knows what's coming next. Before I get into detail on the update that changed (or in my opinion, ruined) everything, let me just say that Valve had already put hats into the game months before, way back in August 2009. I was perfectly fine with the hats, they added a sense of personality to your classes and all you had to do in order to get them was play the game (a novel concept, I know). Hats were the only thing given to you as a random drop back then. I should probably point out that I took about a year break away from gaming at this point in time due to "real life." While I was away, the Mann-Conomy update happened. This update wasn't like any of the others, this update added tons of brand new weapons and hats, along with the addition of an in-game store and trading system to get them. When I eventually returned to TF2, the game wasn't about the objectives, or teamwork, or even being the best player anymore. All the game was about now was collecting the most hats and weapons you could get your hands on. The achievements didn't matter anymore because you could just buy whatever you wanted, or just find it as a random drop (since they updated it to more than just hats). The game that I fell in love with, spending sleepless nights for years, was all for nothing at the drop of a hat (quite literally). I'm not mad at Valve for what they did, from a business standpoint this is the smartest thing they've ever done. But whenever I see the game in my Steam library, I just get a deep feeling of nostalgia and longing for something that could have been. I hope that one day, I'll be able to relive those fond memories I have with Team Fortress 2.","September 6, 2014","false","636.8"," 261 of 441 people (59%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","59","261","441","19","34"

Ever since a friend got me into this game, I've been playing it non-stop for more than 200 play hours in total, and I would like to take the time to give my own thoughts on the game as a whole and some tips for newcomers to help them on their way to enjoy the game and not ragequit within the first 20 minutes of jumping right into it.\n\nFirst off, gameplay-wise the game is a typical multiplayer-based FPS game where the core goal is very simplistic: Hop on either the red or blue team and kill the opposing team and secure victory, however, the methods of accomplishing this range per match type, and usually good teamwork and class diversity are required to win the match.\n\nAs for said class diversity, the game offers you 9 different playable class characters to choose from, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it's a key requirement for any player to learn the limits and strengths of those classes in order to play the class effectively and to be of benefit to your team as a whole. Thankfully the game has a alright tutorial on a few classes, specifically the Demoman, Spy, Engineer and Soldier, but there are many tricks for a class that the game doesn't often directly tell you, but rather clues you in through the in-game loading screen tips section when you go to a match.\n\nPicking a class that suits your playstyle is often the first thing many new players struggle with, but the classes all range from fairly easy to pick up and play decently with, to far more tricky and fragile ones that require the player to be familiar with the mechanics and overall gameplay before they can effectively use them in combat. Such examples are the Heavy, Soldier and Pyro which in my opinion are some of the more easily accessable classes for new players to experiment around with, and Engineer, Sniper and Spy for the more experienced players when they feel confident enough. It has something for every kind of FPS gamer regardless of skill level, which is what I really like about this game.\n\nAtmosphere-wise, the game is very visually pleasing with alot of intricate map design accomodating the various matchtypes, and is designed so that players who are unfamiliar with the map and it's pathways are given visual cues on where to go, like if they're on the red team, a red arrow sign will point in the general direction where they need to head to, as well as various signs detailing a mission's objective and locations, like 'Intelligence' for the intel briefcase on capture the flag, 'Battlements' for the general middle area where most of the combat will take place, etc.\n\nThe classes all have dynamic personalities that make them a blast to play as and you'll often chuckle at their lines regarding the situation, which really gives this game alot of personality. I personally really enjoy the Pyro because the character itself wears a gas mask which makes most of his lines almost inaudiable, but if you listen carefully you can make out a few key lines that he screams out.\n\nBesides the game's addictive core gameplay, there's alot of side content to it like customizable loadouts to your class' arsenal, cosmetic clothing and different taunts which you usually have to acquire through specific unlocking methods, crafting from metal which you get from turning additional weapons into metal which you obtain from random weapon drops during gameplay or trading with other players.\n\nTrading is one of the key mechanics of interacting with other players, and interacting with other players is oftentimes a good way of getting to meet a nice friend on Steam wether it's someone on your team, or someone you encounter while on a specific trade server, and who might be able to trade or even gift you some stuff if you're friendly to the player and and he/she is friendly to you in return. Just be careful of annoying or pushy players who are out for your items and will offer either nothing or nearly worthless items in return, though, if you happen to encounter those, just ignore them.\n\nThere is also a Mann vs. Machine co-op game mode in where you get to work together with 5 other players being the limit against a horde of powerful robots trying to defend your area from a bomb they will attempt to deliver at all costs. This game mode is much more intense than regular multiplayer TF2 and you can earn nice cosmetic item rewards for your weapons in the Mann Up mode, but the Bootcamp mode is free to play and a good way for practice, but Mann vs. Machine is very tough and is not recommended for newcomers of TF2 to try out immediately.\n\nWith that all out of the way, here are a few tips I would recommend everybody who's going to try this game out to follow if they want to have a pleasant experience playing this game in the long run:\n\n- Always stay friendly to other players and don't act obnoxious or self-righteous to others.  The name of the game is TEAM Fortress 2, meaning that in order to win, you need to work together as a team, and not go out there, thinking you can take the entire team on yourself, which will oftentimes lead to you getting killed over and over again. Communicate with your fellow team members over the situation and what you're planning to do, or regarding  plans or tactics that the enemy team is using through the default Y normal in-game chat and U team members-only chat window buttons. Your team members will appreciate it if you're friendly, and will be much more likely to co-operate alongside with you towards completing the objective if you do so. Sure the game can get very hectic and is easy to get annoyed over a supposed 'cheap kill' from a enemy player, but overall try to maintain a friendly atmosphere in the game.\n\n- If nessecary, do offline training on maps that you're unfamiliar with, and explore the maps so you'll know the shortcuts and side routes into enemy territory. This is a key factor into becoming a more skilled player over time, as there are many side routes that are often easy to miss or not pay attention to that the developers of the maps implemented in order to balance the game and make it possible for a team to overcome the other if they're being pressured or having difficulty breaking through chokepoints. If the enemy team is spawncamping, try to take a different spawn exit and flank them from behind. If the main route into their base is heavily guarded, look for a alternate pathway to take and inform your teammates about it.\n\n- Play classes that suit the current situation. This is a common mistake that I see occuring alot on many servers I play on, as quite alot of players seem to not grasp the limits of a class and oftentimes like to stick to one class only just because they like playing as that certain class and refuse to play anything else that the team might benefit more at that specific point during the match. Players need to observe the situation and pick classes whose advantages are required at the time. To give a good example, payload is a match type in where the red team needs to defend the bomb from being delivered by the blue team, and as such will be spawn-camping right off the bat during the start of the match. Yet alot of times there tend to be about 2 or 3 Spy and/or Sniper players in a team of roughly 9 to 12 players on blue. Those 2 classes can only take out 1 enemy at a time normally, and will be killed easily. You'll need a strong offensive class like Heavy or Soldier to pressure and kill the enemy team, and if your team doesn't have a Medic, be one. Medic isn't a easy class, but your team members will benefit from the healing so they won't have to retreat to the supply closet often. Class diversity and good communication about class choices mid-game can go a long way in winning the match.\n\nThanks for reading this, and hope it was insightful. I definetely recommend this game!","September 23, 2014","true","973.7"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","3"

It's because............. My dad touched me.\n\nI haven't told many people this because my dad said if I did he would kill my dog, Phallus. Me and Phallus were best buds. We did everything together. And even the thought of having his throat cut made my eyes water. So I kept silent. But when my dad was drafted into Nam, it was my chance to get help. But my uncle (dads brother) started touching me and threatened to kill my cat, Clitoris. I didn't really care for my cat, but Phallus was always inside Clitoris making them inseparable. And I loved Phallus to much to do that.\n\nThen my as savior came, Bush. I met him at a seven eleven where I was trying to by a league of legends gift card. (I'm a South Korean and my mom wants me to be a professional e-sports player). We I told him about my dad and what he does, and how he was in Nam at that moment. Bush gave it some thought, and came up with a brilliant idea. He told me it would be a win win: he stops my dad from touching me, and he gets himself a guaranteed second term. I agreed and gave him all the info he asked.\n\nOn my dad's plane trip home, it got hijacked, and, well you know. I felt terrible. I wanted to die. I tied a noose around my neck and was about to kick the chair from under my feet when TF2 caught my eye. It wasn't really that fun, but I could see how people would like it. By the time you read this I will be hanging from my ceiling fan, having rope choke the life out of me.\n\nDeath isn't so bad though. They are saving a seat for me in hell, it's called the throne.","March 19","true","0.7"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","76","31","41","26","14"

However, I believe that to fully enjoy this game, you cannot play for a short period of time. My reason for this belief is that when I first started playing TF2, I played for around an hour and didn't really like it. However, I decided to try playing again around a month after my first try, and I slowly began to enjoy it. Over time, I began to understand how to play as each of the characters, and unlocked many game-changing items.\nTF2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, it's like entering a whole new world. TF2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game.","July 11, 2014","true","346.3"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","40","57","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jillybean/recommended/440/","jillybean","JillyBean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jillybean/","90 products in account","I don't really feel it is necessary to talk about what's good about TF2 on a wide basis, because we all know what is good about it. It's updated from time to time, it doesn't feel abandoned like most multiplayers and it has a large pool of creative fans. Plus custom game mods like Slender Fortress, Freak Fortress and Death Run make the game twice as better. So I'll just point out the negatives.\n\nExplosive spam. It is understood in a 30 player server that spam is existant and will forever stay that way. Kudos Short Circuit. It was fun while it lasted.\n\nCrutch weapons/shields and overall annoyance. Black Box/Concheror. Darwin's Shield. Reserve Shooter. Beggar's Bazooka. Vaccinator pairs. Degreaser combos. Despite naming these, I bet all of us use them anyway. So I guess you should all feel horrible about yourselves.\n\nMini-sentries. It sets up in less than 3 seconds. The engineer has the ability to pick up his gear; why not force him to ulitize a push with his teammates instead? It's a server killer. When you're on a team that doesn't feel like destroying them constantly, it's dead.\n\nMelee system. You may run into some issues with hit registration not going your way, like hearing your melee weapon make it's hit sound, but no actual registration.\n\nPocket medics. This can go both ways and it's understandable to heal just that one power class that's getting most of the dirty work done. We get it. But what you don't get is that you're gaining much assistance as well from the rest of your teammates that is providing much said and needed push. Do the team a favour. Heal everyone (at least those who respect you).\n\nPeople not understanding the difference between Boot Camp and Mann Up mode.The essence of Mann Up mode is to use the most effective loadouts, have a organized team of each class and to get through wave by wave. If you want to mess around, there is Boot Camp.\n\nLag compensation. This takes the cake. Shots will seem off and you'll most definitely have those moments where you either got sniped through a wall or railed through the wall by the Heavy's curving mini-gun bullets. You thought you got past that wall, but you didn't on their screen. Seeing as I play Scout, it's something I notice on a daily basis, specifically against heavies. It's just all lag compensation. Curious to know more about it, I recommend googling it.\n\nCritical hits. It's either you get lucky or outlucked. If it's a issue for players, you'll have to search for those servers that host non-crit settings as the known popular public servers don't. There can be humor in it, but not when it's so frequent. Either way, critical hits are random pokes of not fun and it ruin the results of good matches.\n\nServers not tolerating class balance. Not everyone wants to play in a server infested with engineers and mini-sentries/sentries all over the place. Or more than 2-3 demomen spamming stickies everywhere. Whatever the scenario is, this slides right into lack of teamwork and coordination. Things may never get done the right way, so your best bet is to probably just find another server.\n\nTry to get a fair team scramble going and all of the average to good players may quickly go to spectator mode to restack again. We are no angels to that. Who doesn't want to be on the better team?\n\nClosing comments...\nAlthough all of that is what's to dislike about TF2, you'll somehow just find a way to see pass through it all and enjoy the game for what it is. Make some friends, find a favorite server and avoid the awful memes if you can.","January 4, 2014","true","478.7"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","5"

Yearly Christmas & Halloween updates, large to medium content updates throughout the year, bugs crushed within weeks, and smaller updates sprinkled in. This game's longevity is certainly one of it's many strengths.\n\nAs an FPS with so many weapons and features, it remains extremely comprehensive and balanced (Regardless of what most players say). Weapons are added every now and then, and current weapons' stats are always under inspection for balance issues. The control is extremely tight as all source games are, movement always seems fluent and never clunky. The skill ceiling for movement/mobility is extremely high and allows for lots of very tricky moves (eg. Rocket/sticky jumping, sentry jumping, strafing, etc..) Generally the skill ceiling for TF2 is very, very high; with almost 3,000 hours at the time of posting this i am nowhere near the skill level of more experianced players.\n\nThe community is still strong and persistant as the game ages and brings in new players. An overall friendly and welcoming community awaits new players, as well as a thriving competitive scene in both Europe and the States. Not to mention the incredible fan-created artwork and short films on youtube and other sites. TF2 has an incredibly involved trading scene which was born from the staggering amount of hats and cosmetic items that you can get. The trading scene can be brutal at times, but nothing quite stands up to the feeling of getting a sweet new item after spending time trading up for it. (Oh and did i mention you can sell TF2 items for PayPal cash if you're advanced enough?)\n\nIn summation, Team Fortress 2 is a game for the ages. This game has something for everyone if you look for it, and you'll undoubtedly meet some amazing people and make new friends.","May 10, 2015","true","975.4"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

Not much different from other Valve games, to be honest.\n\nDo you just looooove hats? Do you spend money like a gambling addict? Are you an impulsive buyer? Do you like crates? Do you like keys for crates? Do you like buying keys and hats? Well guess what?! You can do all of these things AS LONG AS YOU HAVE MONEY TO PAY.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's just say this is an incredibly chaotic, team-based fps with the most bizarre community you will ever meet. But it's not just like any fps, it's an fps that has specific characters designed for specific roles! Here are the following characters you can play as:\n\n1) The scout. Basically a short, skinny, big-mouthed guy with a New York/Boston/New Jersey accent who's always the first to die. Nevermind the shotguns and baseball bats he uses for combat, he'll just end up running around like a spazz and die afterwards, most likely not even knowing where he's going. Kind of similar to mellings jumping off a cliff. If you're a spazz, this class is for you.\n\n2) Heavy. This guy is about 7 feet tall, probably 400+ pounds, has an obsession for sandwhiches, and speaks with a Russian accent. He's got a minigun but he's very slow, and so is his brain. If you're a complete lazy ♥♥♥ who doesn't like to do anything else besides holding the left mouse button and shooting bullets like a complete idiot, this class is for you. Just watch out for snipers.\n\n3) Soldier. This guy is a true 'Merican hero. He runs around with a rocket launcher, endlessly firing explosive projectiles at the enemy in the hopes of intimidating them with his truely awesome firepower of 'Merican freedom. However, the downside of this strategy is that his rockets are slow moving and always end up arriving late at their destination. However, that doesn't matter, because that downside is the expression of a true 'Merican. If you just want to run around like a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ and randomly fire explosive rockets because you don't what the hell you should be doing on this game, this class is for you.\n\n4) Sniper. This man is an expert at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the enemy team. If you're a lazy ♥♥♥ but prefer to take out your enemies in style, the sniper is for you. Just camp in a highly secluded spot, wait for your target, and boom! Headshot! If that doesn't happen (which it most likely won't unless you're a pro), you'll just end up staring at the scenery, waiting for an enemy that won't show up in your sights, being a completely useless asset to your team. Chances are that if you've been distracted enough, you'll get killed by a spy or another sniper.\n\n5) Spy. This man is ANOTHER expert at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the enemy team. Great for players who are trolls at heart. However, if you're not good at stealth, you'll just look like a complete idiot playing as this class. Just run around with a knife and backstab anybody and enjoy the angry expressions of players who were outsmarted by you. Great class for sociopaths!\n\n6) Pyro. Yet again, another ideal class for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the enemy team. Also ideal for players who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn, because this guy has a flamethrower. Just run around like an idiot, wave those flames around, and hope somebody dies. Great for players who really don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ to do, similar to the soldier.\n\n7) Engineer. Once again, another ideal class for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the enemy team! Plus, if you're a real lazy ♥♥♥, this class is the laziest of asses! You don't even have to fight anyone! Just build a dispenser, teleporter, or turret for your team! The enemy team will utterly hate you for having been killed by your own self-crafted turrets. Your own team will also ♥♥♥♥♥ at you constantly because you didn't put a nice teleporter near their spawn because they're lazy asses like you.\n\n8) The demo man. He's a black guy with a Scottish accent. He's basically the politically correct class. You can enjoy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the enemy team by positioning mines that explode at the push of a button in strategic areas. You can also hit people with a broken bottle that previously was used to hold alcohol! Because Scottish/Irish stereotypes are absolutely non-racist if the character isn't white.

What's not to like? Granted, the game has become overtaken with hats. But I'd say that's one of the reasons Valve decided to make the game free-to-play. They've received enough money from it thus far, and they don't need to rely on the money from every purchase to keep the game going.\n\nUnlike most MMS games, this one isn't re-released every single year with 1 or 2 minor changes and with a new name slapped on it. This game undergoes, just like other Valve games (and a lot of other Steam games for that matter), perpetual evolution without the need to be re-released.\n\nSure, it has no single-player campaign. But there's the Portal and Half-Life series of games for that. It's a varied game with plenty of game modes that all run on the same sort of infrastructure but are different in varying ways. It's a good game. I'd recommend it.\n","April 18, 2014","true","706.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","9"

The 80% are the absolute ♥♥♥♥ing worst though. They single you out by only killing you and calling you names. You don't even have to do anything to get singled out. They are too aggressive and they ruin the game. Countless times now I've been forced out of servers by these kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and why I say 80% is because 75% of the server joins in with them to upset you. You could be the MvP for 5 rounds straight and STILL get no respect from anyone. It's odd behaviour, like a dog who just doesn't like a certain mailman for some completley unknown reason. They just hate your guts.\n\nBecause of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community, I can't play online anymore. It's not fun, and it ruins my day when I get bombarded by all sorts of uncalled ♥♥♥♥♥♥ names. All I wanted to do was just run around and kill people, not get called every name under the sun. So now I only play Offline Practice, and even that gets boring after a while. I've been playing Offline Practice for years, and Valve has hardly updated it. The bots are braindead sometimes, they don't use any weapons except vanilla, and the amount of maps is laughable. Players like me have been let down by Valve because of their neglect of the Offline Practice mode.\n\nI find the game very fun, but I'm only playing around a quater of it. The rest of the game lies with the Online aspects, which I can no longer play because of TF2's disgustingly offensive community.

But I’m glad someone converted me. It’s a game that's filled with humor and will not get you bored easily. But more importantly, it’s free, why shouldn’t you give it a try at least?\n\nBut the biggest advantage of all is that this is a very social game which you can play with friends. And for the people who don't have any friends: with this game you'll sure get some!\n\nEven if this game has been out there for a while, it’s still being updated on a regular basis. New game modes and hats created by the developers and community are regularly being pushed forward and major events are happening at Halloween, Christmas and Easter.\n\nThere is only one downside I can think of: it’s quite large in size.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brawlbarian/recommended/440/","Brawlbarian","PorkOnRye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brawlbarian/","143 products in account","Team Fortress 2, a game long joked about being a war-themed hat simulator should be praised, and here is why.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is a game I believe can really fit with all kinds of gamers, from all kinds of scenes. Whether you're into MOBAs, already into FPS's, or just a general player of games, TF2 can find some way to work itself into your heart.\n\nPart 1: The Classes\n\nThe classes in Team Fortress 2 are all well-balanced characters that fit into a special role of a team, their well-craftedness leaves the real struggle to the player to make the class shine above all others. The roles of each class don't even stop at what  the class could really do. There are so many sub-classes and builds and weapons that change how the entire game functions, it's versatility expands far beyond just what it's labelled as. The classes and their wonderfully fleshed-out personalities with different backgrounds helps you to invest in them and really become a part of them, and possibly have them become a part of you.\n\nPart 2: The Weapons\n\nWeapons in TF2 aren't really improvements to the stock, which makes it different than alot of other games. They're another type of playstyle, another way to play the game. Want the Heavy to be even more of a damage dealer? Use the Brass Beast. Want a reward for all those headshots you're getting as Sniper? Use the Bazaar Bargain. The weapons help broaden the possibilities and types of play of the game, chances are you won't meet players with the same loadout, and even better chances you won't find them using the same kind of playstyle. All in all, I know there might be some sour apples in the bunch, but the range of weapons and the manners in which you can use them is spectacular, and helps others find classes they like.\n\nPart 3: The Hats\n\nYou knew this was coming, admit it. The game's cosmetic system isn't all that there is, but it's one hell of a huge chunk. Ever since the first few hats were added, it changed the game. From the beginning, it was one for one, a hat for a hat, but soon, the seed of economy was planted. The economy grew and flourished, values were established. currencies were made, and the true spirit of the war-themed hat simulator came to fruition. The economy is a real shining gem in this game, while prices may seem absurd, it really is astonishing how a video game managed to grow an economy that easily translates virtual goods into monetary value with the unboxing of a crate. The community lives around this creation, molds it, creates it, they coexist peacefully and abide by one another's rules. Not only does the market shine, but the cosmetics themselves, too. Each piece can be equipped together in no specific order (aside from some restrictions with clipping, of course), meaning a bunch of combinations for your signature, unique look. This furthers the customization from weapons, and really helps to make you, you.\n\nOverall\n\nIn the end, TF2's a flexible game. No matter what genre of game you're most accustomed to, TF2 will have a place in your heart. Interesting, quirky characters set in the middle of nowhere, fighting over who-knows-what. Plenty of methods of customization to make it fit you. A community that's pretty darn great, and a good bunch of pretty-looking hats. This game more than earns my 10/10, for as much as it counts.\n(P.S. It's flippin' free!)","August 11, 2014","true","352.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicOfGilga/recommended/440/","EpicOfGilga","Gilgamesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EpicOfGilga/","122 products in account","Oh TF2, oh TF2..\nWe've come a long way, but everything will end eventually, no matter how fun it was.\nIf you are looking for the game's details, read the positive reviews, I will have a little rant here.\nA few years ago I found this game through the famous "meet the series", after I started playing I was instantly hooked by the amazing variety of gameplay, even though I do not play anymore do to the reason I will give below I am still active in the community, some of you might know as Gilgamesh from OpenGriefing.\n\nThe game:\nWith the nine classes and huge amount of weapons that come with it TF2 is a game which you can play for days, even months! Each class has their own individual role which is completely unique to it, you can play in all sort of ways, and there is so much to do it rarely feels repeditive. The community is nice, and although most do not appreciate the sight of a new player, there is still a huge amount of nice people. I my self have taught 4 players on how to play TF2 whom I personally don't even know, and I had great fun in doing so, and there more people out there that do the same.\nThe game has a series of cosmedic items which add a lot of life and color into it. You can dress the big muscle guy called the heavy with his huge machine gun up with a fairy custom, or you can turn the German doctor called the Medic into a WW2 German infantryman of the battle of Stalingrad, these are two examples of thousands of possibilities.\nThere are many game modes and dozens of maps for each, which let you play the game for an unbelievable amount of time with out getting bored once. These are just the official maps. There are tens-of-thousands of community maps which also enhance the gaming experience.\n\nThe community:\nTF2 is a very old game, yet it is one of the most played multiplayer games even today. The community is very committed and it was the community that made the game what it is today. Valve kept the game fresh by releasing updates that always added more content with which you could play with your friends and have loads of fun.\n\nWith that being said, here comes the problem:\nAs I said, TF2 has a very committed and loyal community even though the game is from today's standards as old as the bread crumbs that are left in a toaster that one day have the fortune of being vaporized, leaving the toaster as dust.\nNow, valve always showed their appreciation for this through out the year by adding fresh content.\nThis however, has changed.\n\nValve, like other companies, has noticed the potential of modern competitive games, one genre of which is MOBAs. It is also very obvious that they have grown old of TF2 and want to work on different things. Their plan to keep the game alive, while slowly leaving it was to let their loyal community take over, which I have to say is quite an honorable thing to do.\nHowever, they have completely failed at it.\nThe problem is, the community may be able to handle parts of the game, but not the entire game it self. It is impossible do to many factors. By this I mean, the community might be able to add content like hats and taunts to the game, but they can not expand the gaming experience, the expanding the gaming experience is exactly what made TF2 a special game, every year there was always something new to try out and after doing that, the normal game was appealing again, and the loop continued. But instead of fixing the issue, they just want to pull it through till the end, like dragging a bleeding body to the hospital but knowing that it won't make it.\n\nWarning Rant:\nThey also treat the community wrong, they have gotten to used to the community of TF2 treating them like some kind of divine council. They think anything will satisfy it. An example of this is the ♥♥♥♥ing ducks. Some people complained that the "End of the Line" not including snowplow, with Valves' response being 'It is too complicated for new players", from what I have heard though, the did not include the map due to it not reaching their standards, which is fine by me. Also the lack of weapons that were promised by the creator of the animation did not appear, which was upsetting, but still bearable.\nWhat really shoved the middle finger up my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ though, was the ducks. The ♥♥♥♥ing ducks that cost 5 ♥♥♥♥ING EUROS. FOR ♥♥♥♥ING DUCKS! Is this some sort of joke? Was Valve thinking,"Ayy Lmao, ducks are funny right?" from\nValve and the End of the Line team. Without the ducks, I would have nothing to complain about, but if they seriously think that DUCKS will satisfy their loyal community after they miss out on the promised weapons and a new game mode, then must have ♥♥♥♥ing plumbum in their water supply,\nThey tried making up to it by rushing 3 new weapons which are all useless and uncreative. The creativity is what counts, not the effectiveness of the weapon.\n\nPre-access, now for TF2 also!\nAnother issue is BETA maps, they adapted the method of their platform into TF2. They release unfinished ♥♥♥♥, act like it is finished but still needs "fixing" and let the community do all the work, instead of actually using already made maps by the community OR getting of their asses and finishing them. The beta map Cactus has a ♥♥♥♥ing holes everywhere! It is also so monotone, I cringe when thinking valve could even put it in the game.\n\nWhat they appear to think of the community:\nThey take us for a bunch of clowns, juggling around in the circus with a red nose and wacky hair, riding on a one-wheel making "toot toot sounds". They put disclaimers on their ♥♥♥♥! "For expert players only" they write in captions under their new Pre-Access game mode. Who ever complained to them, that some game modes for too complicated? Someone with 0 neurons in their skull, succeeding at surpassing the stupidity of a pigeon?!? The game mode is just as "complicated" as the other game modes, there is nothing that could irritate new players, if you exclude all the unnecessary glitches.\n\nHats:\nAs it worked in the past, adding more cosmetic items usually was endorsed with a lot of positive responses from the community, this was because they added fun cosmetics, while adding more content for gameplay. It was a balance of a innovation and fun, always the right mix. But now, they just try to make us suffocated in cosmetics.\nThis can be do to 2 reasons:\n1. They just want to add more cosmetics to.. recreate Barbie simulator.\n2. They realized that the game is dying and wana milk as much ♥♥♥♥ out of it as they can before it goes downhill (same thing goes for ducks)\n\nServers:\nI will try to keep this short.\nMost Valve servers, the servers I personally enjoy playing on the most. Have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BETA maps on them. Most TF2 servers went from TF2 to DOTA 2 and CS:GO.\nI remember always finding at least 3 full servers of a single map, for each map a year or two ago. Now I have luck if I find a single full server of a map.\n\nTo end this:\nAs I mentioned before; "They realized that the game is dying and wanna milk as much ♥♥♥♥ out of it as they can before it goes downhill", the game IS in fact actually going down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Look at all the TF2 youtubers! STAR_ and Jerma have stopped playing the game! Why? Because there is nothing new, and they have a bitter taste because of the recent decisions of Valve regarding TF2. "So what if two youtubers quit playing the game, it happens all the time." When a pretty much TF2 only channel with at least 90% of its subscribers being TF2 related, quits the game because the company is ♥♥♥♥ing up, then it is very obvious that there is something wrong!\nThis is not just YouTube, it is also on my steam friends list, I used to see at least 10 people playing the game at any given time. Now it is rare to see anyone at all play it, and look at the size of that list! With the majority being hardcore TF2 Players.\n\nThis game is dying and Valve needs to seriously step in before it bleeds out for good.","March 19, 2015","false","757.2"," 510 of 900 people (57%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","57","510","900","72","239"

Do you even know what we're talking bout? Do-do you have any idea... any idea what it is? Basically, kind of a big dea. You listening? Okay. Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and brother, Gaben hurts people. He's a force a' nature. If you were from where Gabe was from, you'd be ♥♥♥♥in' fat. WOOOOO!\n\nTeam Fortress 2, originally derived from years of development along with orange box, from a modification to quake multiplayer (now known as Team Fortress Classic) is a whacky, fast-paced, intelligently balanced, and high-learning-curve first person shooter multiplayer game.\n\nIt features 9 unique and complex "classes" from which to choose, each with specific talents for various situations depending on map, gameplay position, and class selections on the other team. There is scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. If you learn how to play every one of these and learn what weapons and loadouts are, you will be only marginally good at the game.\n\nTo be good at this game requires something called TEAMWORK. It's a frustrating, addictive, cartoonishly funny, skillful masterpiece, which is constantly in development by its lazy developers who leave bugs all around. This game is free to play, but I would recommend paying a small amount for a cool taunt or hat, and you're on your way to becoming the mediocre slime everybody knows and loves, setting things on fire, headshotting, gibbing people, healing patients from afar, and blasting hoardes of enemies with stationary turrets. This game is your own, and there's no right or wrong way to play it. But there are MANY wrong ways if you want to win. None of the right ways don't involve teamwork and using your head. Have fun. Random critical hits are fair and balanced.","September 28, 2015","true","579.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","16","18","11","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kurakao/recommended/440/","Kurakao","sth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kurakao/","158 products in account","Review made by Kurakao, who had 2,566 hours of Team Fortress 2 while writing this review on 5.10.2014 (DD/MM/YYYY)\n\nIncludes:\n1. TF2 from my PoV (Point of View)\n2. About Team Fortress 2\n3. Experiences & details\n4.1-3. About game-modes\n5. Competitive in a nutshell\n6. Recommendations from it\n7. My own experiences and why\n8. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read aka this whole thing nutshelled in a sentence.)\n9. My rating\n\n1. What can I say? This is the reason I downloaded Steam. Because I wanted so hard to test this game out. I saw this game everywhere and I was always wondering like: "Hmm.. What kind of a game this might be? Like Counter Strike mixed with it's own weirdness." And I was half-true.\n\n2. Team Fortress 2 is like mixing the Quake games, Counter-Strike, and a bit of fashion and hats all the way. This is the reason TF2 is so fun; You get to do any kind of hat/misc combinations (cosmetics these days) and you can create your own individual looks how people recognize you from others. I remember using funny combinations, so people recognized me easily and were like: "Oh hey Kurakao! I just noticed you came in because I saw that awesome set of yours."\n\n3. Team Fortress 2 is extremely fun, team-based (depends what style you play. I play DM (DeathMatch) alot, which is basically just killing with no point), somehow restricted with the 9 classes, but doesn't restrict enough to not be individually weird-styled, and it's extremely addictive.\n\n4.1. I have never played anything as addictive as Team Fortress 2. This is extremely fun to play, and you can play any kind of gameplay you like: You can go either Saxton Hale (vsh_) maps to run away from the evil boss monsters that is controlled by a single player and he chases trying to kill you.\n\n4.2. Then there's my favourite customs: PropHunt, which is the same as in GMOD; you disguise as an object and the enemies are trying to catch you. Firing your weapon decreases your hp so you need to be careful not to spam.\n\n4.3. Then there are normal based maps; PayLoad, Capture Point, King of The Hill, etc. etc. which is hardly-based on teamwork and who plays what. It usually costs the team a victory if they are full-team Snipers or Spies or whatsoever, unless they are pro-tier players. But usually it ends up the team who has a better class-support, wins.\n\n----You can stop reading here and scroll down if you don't want to know anything about competitive---\n\n5. Then there was competitive where I played some of my time. I was only Division 6 and I played as a Roamer. I had alot of friends who were either Division 6, or they were Division 5 or better, and some of them were as good as low-Division 2-1. Competitive is extremely fun, but it can be stressful sometimes if you take it too seriously.\n\n6. I recommend taking it easy and having fun while having the pressure at the same time. This part requires great communication skills, and you need to have atleast a bit of social skills to learn to handle this. It's a great advantage if you play with your team other than in just scrims or officials. Play with them normally and chat often with them to link up a true friendship and that is what makes you indestructible.\n\n7. I quitted competitive myself, because it was too hard for me, and I couldn't handle the "tryhard" you have to do in competitive. It also might take a long time to find a true team you want to play in, and NEVER underrestimate being a substitute spot, because that might be extremely crucial in some moments.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8. TL;DR: Team Fortress 2 is extremely addictive and gives tons of good memories. Best game I've ever played myself.\n\n9. 10/10","May 24, 2014","true","076.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","6"

It's pure free-to-play, which means that everything is available at the beginning. You don't have to spend money on this game, except when you want to trade or buy cosmetic items.\nSo what is this game all about? Well, you play in team of 1 to 12 (or even more) players and you try to beat the other team. TF2 features several gamemodes, Capture Point and Payload for example, and 9 'classes'. Each class has it's own pros and cons, and can be used for specific tasks. For example, the Engineer is a great defender and the Scout is very effective in capture-based gamemodes.\nTF2 is very n00b-friendly, since the game features Offline Training against bots and tutorials, as well as the coöp tower-defense gamemode Mann vs. Machine. TF2 is a relatively simple game, you don't require a lot of knowledge to be good at it. The game also has a large economy of items, which you get by playing or trading. These are pure cosmetic, except most weapons, and don't give you an advantage towards other players.\n\nVerdict\n--------\nThis game is very enjoyable and funny, it's very different compared to other FPS games. It features several awesome gamemodes and funny classes. Some of the cosmetics are really funny, you can hit people with a mackerel and candy for example. An awesome free-to-play shooter you should play today.\n\nYour friends will not see you outside for at least 100 hours. If you become a "TF2 Trader" you will spend at least 400 hours on this game.\n\nScore: 89/100","November 26, 2013","true","528.8"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","3"

This is only an FPS by definition as it stands out from all the rest.\n\nAfter thousands of hours of playing this game, I can't praise it enough. The game play is fun, the characters are likeable, most maps are well-designed and enjoyable to play on, the game can be modded serverside (either minor tweaks or major game-changing overhauls) or played vanilla (which is amazing in its own right), and there's many class/weapon combinations to keep things interesting.\n\nThe game is entirely free but you may want to buy one item from the store to get premium so you can trade items (which you get randomly anyway), but it's only a dollar or something for the least expensive item. A small matter of convenience and cosmetic, really.\n\nThere are only two significant problems: most servers have random critical hits enabled (it's by default) that basically means you're screwed or dead simply because by random chance, you're gonna take 3x damage from a hit; the other major problem is that some weapons are unbalanced or unfun to play against, but it's not a huge problem in this game.\n\nIf you got a free night, check the game out. You may just be hooked for a long time. Easily the best game I've ever played and the one I've played most by far.

I love all the friends I made along the way aswell, but something changed in tf2. The community has nearly been abandoned by all the "old" players leaving behind a community that comes off as toxic. TF2 used to be my favorite game while update and update have many asking what's the deal with all these let downs, VALVe has started giving TF2 the short end of the stick as CS:GO and DOTA 2 take the spotlight. As TF2 and the community is right now I don't recommend getting into it anymore, both the game and the community are now a drag.","March 18, 2015","false","505.9"," 157 of 273 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","157","273","12","18"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uncle_Gubsy/recommended/440/","Uncle_Gubsy","Lucas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uncle_Gubsy/","39 products in account","Team Fortress 2 is a fun game. Well, fun GAME. Not a fun hat simulator.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is a team-based first person shooter developed by Valve. It has nine classes, all with their own weapons, stats and all. The Scout runs very fast, can double jump, and captures control points and payload carts twice as fast as other classes. The Soldier is slow, but has a rocket launcher (which you can rocket jump with). The Pyro, well, hence the name, is a pyromaniac, who burns his opponents with a flamethrower. He is also immune to afterburn damage caused by other Pyros. The Demoman is a drunk Scotsman with a passion for blowing things up. The Heavy is slow, but he makes up for it with his minigun and high health. The Engineer can build sentries, dispensers, and teleporters. The Medic... An obvious one, right? He heals his team. He also heals his own health over time, and can use Ubercharge to make both him and the teammate he's healing invulnerable for a short period of time. The Sniper can use his sniper rifle to take out faraway opponents. He can also get headshots, which do extra damage. The Spy can turn invisible, sap and destroy the Engineer's buildings, disguise as enemy teammates, and instant kill people by stabbing them in the back.\n\nThere's several different gamemodes, including payload (where one team attempts to push a bomb to the other team's base, there's another less common variant where both teams have the payload), capture the flag (both teams have a briefcase in their base, the first team to capture the enemy briefcase a certain number of times wins), control points (one team attempts to capture all control points and the other defends them, there is another variant where both teams have to capture and defend at the same time), arena (respawns disabled and the team still standing wins), and many more, including the community-made gamemodes like Prop Hunt (If any of you have played GMod you will recognize this), Freak Fortress 2, and Balloon Race, just to name a few.\n\nWith the memorable classes, diverse gameplay, and unique weapons... (Well, most of the time. I'm looking at you, melee reskins.) "What's not to like?" as Gabe Newell said.\n\nWell, there's a lot not to like.\n\nWhen I first got into the game back in 2009, the rage wasn't as huge about hats. But I look nowadays and that's all people care about. That's also probably why Valve seems to get away with all these CSGO skins, since people only care about looking flashy. PAYDAY 2's developer, Overkill, attempted a similar system, but failed to do so, as they gained extreme backlash from the community, and they still do to this day. I haven't seen that backlash happen yet in TF2's community, and if it has happened, I missed it because I quit about 6 months ago.\n\nIn PAYDAY 2, people didn't really care as much about looking flashy or cool. They weren't ones to put up with the bull ♥♥♥♥.  Granted, you can customize and use different masks to your leisure, but it isn't the main premise of the game. And it SHOULDN'T be for TF2... Except, that it is.\n\nAn F2P with only a gibus and is actually good and skilled at the game VS a P2P player who has no skill but has a scout covered in unusual cosmetics painted lime green. Who gets more hate? The skilled F2P or the unskilled P2P? The skilled F2P, just because he's got a gibus. The gibus is a nooby hat sure, but do we really have to determine one's skill off of it? What if I like the gibus and want to wear it? I'm decent at the game when it comes down to skill, yet I'm judged for wearing a hat that I think is cool, and now I'm apparently unskilled? ...Then again, this is the internet. And on the internet you either like what's "cool" or you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who should kill himself.\n\nMaybe I'd be a little more lenient about the skins if it weren't for the blatantly obvious money-making scheme. First you have to spend money on a ticket to even start finding skins or crates. You then use the ticket, and you unlock contracts to complete. So what do you get for completing them? Either a skin that's almost always Civilian Grade (the worst tier you can get for a skin), or a crate which you have to unlock with a key, which costs $2.49. Spending $2.49 for just a small chance to make your find worthwhile, not even mentioning the $6 you used to buy the ticket (That's what I had to spend in Gun Mettle.)\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is how the most cancerous skins, hats, and unusuals end up costing the most amount of money, metal, buds, bills, whatever the ♥♥♥♥ currency in TF2 is anymore. Most of the unusual effects aren't even that good anyways. The worst paints (pink paint and lime green paint) also cost the most, last I checked each costed 2 keys. I'm not even kidding, my eyes may have actually been hurting IRL the first time I saw a limegreen/pink scout ingame. Call me some prick with terrible eyes, but no other paint has done that.\n\nValve has also been noticeably lazy the last several updates. The majority of content nowadays is made by people on workshop. Valve gets money for snagging an item off workshop and slapping it onto TF2. I'm pretty sure the people who made the hats do get a bit of money, but think about who's doing more of the work here.\n\nAnd, instead of weapon originality, they're making reskins of weapons. Excluding Australiums, Festives, and Botkillers, there's a total of 2 Scout reskins, no Soldier reskins which is surprising (the Original functions slightly differently from the default Rocket Launcher), 4 Pyro reskins, 4 Demoman reskins, 5 Heavy reskins, 1 Engineer reskin, again no Medic reskins, 4 Sniper reskins, and 8 Spy reskins. The Scout and Engineer both share 2 reskins for Pistol, there's 10 ALL CLASS MELEE RESKINS. And nowadays, there's ENTIRE UPDATES revolved around skins. And I get it, coming up with unique weapons can be hard. But I'm hardly seeing any attempts to at least TRY. Instead we just get skins... You guys realize that someone could've gone and bought some $10 game with the $11 they used on keys and tickets for the campaign, right?\n\nThe community is a bunch of ♥♥♥ wipes, as I mentioned earlier. Your skill is determined by a hat. A lot of people are elitist tryhards. You'd think this would be better in TF2's 6-player co-op gamemode, Mann VS Machine. Nope. If anything it's worse.\n\nAre you a spy, sniper, or pyro? Yes? *KICKED*\nAre you using bonk atomic punch instead of mad milk? Bat instead of Sandman/Fan O War? Yes? *KICKED*\nIs this your first tour? Yes? *KICKED*\nNeed to know what upgrades to get? How the hell do you not know already, you dumbass noob? *KICKED*\n\nI'm not one of those nuts who are like "♥♥♥♥ THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE FUN OF F2PS, F2PS AND NOOBS ARE LIFE" and all that. I mean, I used to mock them myself back in the day. But looking back, isn't it kind of stupid?\n\nTrading could probably be a whole other review on its own. It's awful in my opinion. Some of its problems have already been discussed above.\n\nPeople complain about Overkill being greedy, but Overkill's got nothing on Valve. What happened, Gabe?\n\nGameplay: 5/10 (Well, what's left of it, at least)\nCharacters: 10/10\nSoundtrack: 6/10 (There isn't really much of a soundtrack in the first place)\nCommunity: 0/10\n\nFinal Score: 5.2/10 (It's a game, not a dressup sim)","April 9","false","551.5"," 127 of 219 people (58%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","58","127","219","21","113"

Every update no matter how big or small breaks the game in a unrelated way, usually to a point where it doesn't even want to run probably. There's a huge pile of weapons that are so horrible to play with it's not even funny any more. The most recent big update (Smissmass 2015 at the time of writing) basically made Pyro go from a class that takes some skill to a complete braindead W+M1 class. Demoknighting, the most fun thing to do in the entire game is now also dead and on anything but Windows this game doesn't run. At all. It just crashes instantly as soon as you go on a full server due to the horrendous coding job Valve has done (and they state performance is massively improved, yeah right, joke of the century). And all of this is packed in a 1:1 copy of the Gun Mettle update with even more ugly weapon skins that add no value to the game with the same boring and easy-as-crap contracts. Valve lost every single bit of sense on this game over the course of one update and there's no sign of that ever resolving itself. Oh and you wanted any of the cosmetics or weapons? Yeah you have to spend $6 on a campaign pass and then even more on a key to open the crate with the chance of you getting anything worth more than the combined cost of getting a crate and opening it are basically zero. Any future update will be a 1:1 copy of Gun Mettle since it's Valve's easiest way to make a ton of money without doing anything useful.\n\ntl:dr this game would be much better if it was developed by anybody other than Valve.\n\nDo yourself a favor and stay away from this steaming pile of garbage. Honestly. Go play Overwatch or something.","December 18, 2015","false","938.1"," 128 of 223 people (57%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","57","128","223","17","42"

This is pay for style. Even then, you don't even need to pay, just stock up tons of weapons or whatever and sell them metal. But that's not what I'm here to talk about. This game takes your regular console fps shooter sensibilites and throws it out of a two-story window into an oncoming semi-truck. There's nothing normal about this game, nearly every class has a counter, and some are harder to play than others. Sure, picking up a class and playing is really easy, but playing them right is where the challenge comes in. Watching the pros play is one of the greatest sights as they destroy servers and players with ease, and then being put head-to-head in tournaments is even better as you watch a non-stop highlight reel of fantastically displayed gameplay and style.

Originally a pay-to-play game, Tf2 became free! Upon so the number of players skyrocketed.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is a game where Reliable Excavation Demolitions (RED) usually defends from onslaughts of Builders Leauge United (BLU). You, the player, are given the choice of 9 merchanaries. The fast, cocky and furious scout, the patriotic brawler soldier, the mysterious hellborn that is the pyro, the scumpy-drinking, one-eyed black cyclops demoman, the comical and brutually large heavy, the whimsical engineer, the funny german medic, the cool, calm and collected sniper and lastly the man who perfers brains over brawn, the spy.\n\nWhat makes this game so entertaining is that each of the 9 mercanaries that you can play as all have such a distinct personality, looks and playstyle. If you're a player who likes run-and-gun, Scout is for you. If you like big guns, Heavy calls your name. Stealth? Spy is already right behind you, waiting for you to play as him. Who can forget the loveable pyro who sets everything ablaze.\n\nThis game is also very rewarding to both new and experienced player alike, as item drops are given not for getting a certain amount of kills, but for just playing the game!\n\nHowever if you want to truely experience the full greatness that is Tf2 I reccomend paying anywhere from 50 cents to $90 in the Mann Co. Store to get prenium so you can truely have a great feel for the game. However if money is tight or if you're not sure you'll enjoy this amazing game, you are not truely penalized for being a Free-to-Play, unlike most other games of this kind.\n\nOverall Team Fortress 2 is a great game that doesn't require a supercomputer, and I'd honestly reccomend this game to anybody who asks so.","January 11, 2014","true","558.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrostyHoneyJuicy/recommended/440/","FrostyHoneyJuicy","❄ FrostyHoneyJuicy ❄","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FrostyHoneyJuicy/","127 products in account","Team Fortress 2 aka TF2 is a "Free to Play", Multiplayer, First Person Shooter (FPS), and a Hat (Cosmetic) Simulator.\nA very fun game. Especially, very addictive and good for relaxation, but it depends how good you are at the game or on your picked class.\n\nClasses & Teams:\nThere're about 9 classes in the TF2: [Offensive Classes:] Scout, Soldier, Pyro, [Defensive Classes:] Demoman, Heavy (Weapons Guy), Engineer, [Support Classes:] Medic, Sniper and Spy.\nEach class has it's own strength and weakness. For example, Spy has a low health, but he can kill can instantly by backstabbing you.\nTF2 has 2 teams: BLU and RED. They hate each other, and they attack each other. Nothing interesting.\n\nMaps (Levels) & Gamemodes:\nMaps can be different (pretty obvious). But unfortunately, maps can affect the gameplay, because like I said before, each class has it's own weakness. For example, Sniper can kill you pretty easily in a very wide map, and you can get annoyed.\nEach map has it's own gamemode. Here is a list of all official gamemodes:Capture the Flag (ctf)\nControl Points (cp)\nTerritorial Control (tc)\nPayload (pl)\nPayload Race (plr)\nKing of the Hill (koth)\nMedieval Mode\nSpecial Delivery (sd)\nMann vs Machine (mvm)\nRobot Destruction (rd)\nArena (arena)\nMannpower\nAnd here is a list of unofficial gamemodes:Highlander (TF2Center.com)\n6v6 (TF2Center.com)\nSaxton Hale Mode OR Freak Fortress (vsh)\nRandomizer\nSlender Fortress (sl)\nProp Hunt (ph)\nDodgeball\nZombie Fortress\nSurfing (surf)\nJail Break\nFortWars\nAnd many more.\nHats/Cosmetics:\nYou don't need them to play a game. Players usually care so much about cosmetics, because they want to look good and feel good, while they play a game. Most of them, spend about $500 on the game, only because of the hats. Players also care about the "qualities" of the items. Some qualities can be very expensive, so I don't suggest to spend money on crap. However, hats are not the only ones. Players also waste money on weapons, due different qualities or reskins.\n\nIF you really want to get hats, then I suggest you to read this guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=248435114&searchtext=Free+Hats\nIF you want more hats, then I suggest you to understand, and learn some basics about the TF2 Trading Community, and about trading itself. Here is a guide:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=158754458\n\nMajor Updates:\nThere are 2 different kinds of TF2 updates: Official Updates and Community Created Updates (they're official, too). What's the difference, you ask? Well, it's pretty simple:\n\nOfficial Updates - Are created by the main creator/company called VALVe. In their updates, you can find new gamemodes, new weapons (which are usually made in the summer or in the winter), new maps, bug fixes and especially there is a 90% chance that VALVe is going to add new hats, made by the community from the Steam's workshop.\n\nCommunity Created Updates - VALVe usually cares what community makes, but they don't allow community mess with the balance of the game, meaning VALVe doesn't allow us to create new weapons, which can have different stats, and especially add new maps. (However, VALVe added community maps only in the beginning, when TF2 was still new and fresh. But now everything is different, because in nowadays TF2 became as a very popular game.)\nSo like I said before, VALVe actually cares what community creates. So VALVe likes to add new hats and new weapons (just models) created by some talented people from the community. But majority of the community hates to see, that every new update has a new hat. And to be honest: It's normal.\nIf you didn't know, there was a big over hyped update called "End of the Line", and it was actually the most useless update in the TF2. It had tons of cosmetics, a new taunt, a new weapon, which is a actually a reskin with no stats.\nBefore an update arrived, the community really hoped to see a map called "Snowplow" with the new gamemode, but when the update arrived, the map was canceled by VALVe. VALVe said, that the map is too confusing for new players. Later, that sentence became as a meme, because other maps made by VALVe are more confusing, than a "Snowplow".\n\nAnyways, let's move on:\n\nUnbalanced Gameplay & Weapons:\nTF2 has 2 kinds of players: F2P (Free to Play) players (aka noobs) and P2P (Premium to Play) players (aka experienced players). Imagine BLU team full of noobs, and RED team full of experienced players. Is this a balanced match? Heck no. REDs would win every bloody match.\nHowever, in VALVe servers you may find a voting system, which allows any player to vote something. Here is a list current voting types:Kick Player\nRestart the Match\nChange Level/Next Level\nScramble Teams\nDisable Team Autobalance\nEternaween (Allow Halloween-restricted items for two hours. Player must have an item to enable this voting choice.) So imagine again those 2 teams again: Imagine, that you joined the BLU team, and you see that the teams are not balanced at all, and whenever you come out of your base - you always die. So you decide to vote to "Scramble Teams". So what do you think what's going to happen? The voting will fail, because your enemies are having fun AND because your teammates (noobs) doesn't know how to vote at all, or just completely ignores the voting.\n\nNow let's talk about weapons, shall we?\nNah, let's not, because VALVe finally fixed all those unbalanced weapons. I could mention them like a long time ago, but now it's not worth it. I will still save this title, just in case.\n\nThe Story:\nWell there is a story in the TF2, but unfortunately you can't find it in-game. You can only find it in the official TF2 comics. You can find comics in the Official TF2 Website, right here.[www.teamfortress.com]\n\nThe Community:\nThe community was great, until TF2 became for free. Right now, if you go to any official VALVe server, then you may hear some screaming or crying children with microphones. I hope your ears doesn't explode.\nTo be honest, TF2 community is still great. It depends where you live. Usually, I really love to play with Americans. I never loved to play with Europeans, because they love judge each other, and sometimes they're so speechless. How cruel!\n\nWhat is a Premium Account?\nPremium account means an Upgraded account. In the beginning you can only have 1 backpack slot. If you buy something from the Mann. Co Store (in-game store), then your account will be upgraded and you will have 6 slots in your backpack. It's very important to have a Premium account, because 1 backpack slot if not enough for you.\nI suggest you to buy a Mann Co. Supply Crate Key. Once you bought something from the Mann Co. Store - don't use it again. Use it only to buy keys. Once you understand all basics about trading - you will know what to do with your bought key(s). (Just trade your key for the metal, and then buy tons of hats and weapons, as much as you want!)\n\nOverall, my rating is 7 out of 10.\n\nRemember: Once you start to love this game, then there is a small chance, that you will leave it.\nEverything depends, what you like or love, or how (quickly) do you understand things.\n\nAlso, I am very sorry if I was very rude or mad in this review. It's because sometimes, TF2 can make your feelings hurt, especially your sanity. If you don't want to risk your life, then simply don't play this god damm game.\n\nHave Fun! ^.^","February 19, 2015","true","202.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","6"

Looking for a game that's free to play, a first person shooter, and down right fun as hell? Well, you've come to the right game! All 9 classes add for a diverse choice of playing styles, but that's only part of it. Weapons, lots of extra weapons. The large universe of weapons can assist you in your play style or just change it completely (I'm looking at you, gunslinger). The large selection of weapons allow for a diverse and quite unique experience for the first person shooter genre, and there's still not something that can match up to this game. But, the main reason most people play Team Fortress 2 is for it's 1 of a kind trading system. While is is sometimes unrelliable, trade servers and all, Team Fortress's 2 trading system is a game changer. You can trade hats, miscs, and weapons, and trust me, you're better off having hats, because in this game, your generally considered "a better player" for having loads of hats and unusuals. Ah! Unusuals, almost forgot about those things. Unusuals are basically hats with special effects like flames or a snow cloud over your head or on your head. They are obtained through purchasing Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys (and many more types of keys) from the Mann. Co Store or the Steam Market or other sources, and using them to unbox a crate that corresponds with that specific key, generally reffered to unboxing or un-crating. Players have a very rare chance to unbox these "Unusuals", but when you do, consider yourself "Done with trading" (unless you unbox a less valuable unusual). That's Team Fortress 2 in a LONG Nutshell. I'm SuperOnlineGamer, and I approve of this game!","July 4, 2015","true","889.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","16","21","3","3"

Team Fortress 2 used to have the friendliest community, where people would help eachother learn how to rocket jump and give an Engineer tips on Sentry placement. Now its got hordes of lime green and pink Scouts running in, killing everything that moves, and putting "git gud scrub" in chat with a keybind.\n\nThis game used to be fun. For some it may still be fun to play, for others its a way to pass the time, and some people only still play because it has become routine to do so. And for many the in-game economy has actually become a job, a business, even if they don't work for Valve or any other software developer. If Valve were to remove metal and cosmetics entirely, many people would lose hundreds or thousands of dollars. This isn't even a game anymore.\n\nPeople who play TF2 say that many aspects of this game need fixing. "Why would you nerf the Heavy and not the Demman?" I would say that the whole thing needs fixing. Specifically the community.\n\nThis game used to be fun. The community used to be fun to be a part of. A few months ago it has become just as bad as the Call of Duty fanbase and community.\n\nYou may still find it fun to play this game. You may somehow find the patience to deal with another toxic community. My patience is shot, I can deal with no more.\n\nIf any of you need me, I'll be playing a single player game. I can actually play those without being told "git gud, noob" or "get rekt, scrub" after every death. The NPCs of a Singleplayer game like Fallout or Metro are certainly friendlier than the real people who play Team Fortress 2.","November 16, 2014","false","773.5"," 178 of 318 people (56%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","56","178","318","13","26"

Each class uses a primary, secondary and melee weapon.\n\nThe Heavy has the most health, takes a while to fire, but can do the most damage per second with no reloading, but he moves slowly. The soldier shoots rockets, has the 2nd most health and and is the 2nd slowest, but experienced players can rocket jump. The demoman is a defender, using stickybombs to lay traps and grenades to roll forward, he can sticky jump with some practice and can also be a proficient melee class. The Pyro is a defender, lighting enemies on fire, causing damage for an amount of time, air blasting projectiles away and bringing good cheer and derpiness to any team. Engineers build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers to defend the team and keep them healthy and supplied with ammo. The spy is elusive and backstabs people while invisible cloaking or disguising himself. His sapper can also disable and destroy the engineer's buildings. The scout runs fast with a double jump and shotguns people, he also captures at twice the speed of anyone else. Snipers snipe from far away. Medics heal and make people invincible at times.\n\nAs for the modes, there are traditional capture the flag, king of the hill and less traditional payload, where blue team will push a moving cart, while red team defends it. The more blue players next to the cart, the faster it will go. If a red player is next to the cart, it stops moving. It is a great dynamic that makes the game really stand out above the rest. There is also payload race, where two teams push their carts, and control points where the goal is to capture all of the points (3 or 5 points instead of just 1 like King of the Hill). Teams for both modes are mostly 12 vs 12. Each mode has quite a few maps and maps are continually added over time.\n\nThe newest mode is Mann vs Machine, where six players take on wave after wave of robots. There is a free version of Mann vs Machine called Boot Camp and a non free version called Mann Up that costs a Tour of Duty Ticket ($1 in the store). The ticket gets used if you complete a MVM mission. If you don't complete a mission, or if you complete a mission you've already completed, then you keep the ticket. A Mann vs Machine tour is composed of several missions across a few maps. What do you get for completing a tour? A random strange weapon and a notch in your belt!\n\nThe maps in Team Fortress 2 stand out for their paths, there isn't just one path through each map, but there are usually several routes to get around a herd of foes.  There is a lot of joy and satisfaction flanking opponents and killing an entire team from behind.\n\nSure this game is free to play, but there are a lot of things to buy for real money! Hats for $5, keys for $2.50. Keys are like legalized gambling, you buy a key to open a crate, if you don't get what you want, you can always use Steam trade to trade the item for something you do want or just use another key! There is a whole micro economy in the game with trading. The game will drop you weapons as you play, then you can craft two weapons together to make metal. 18 weapons will make you a refined metal. That's the basic free currency of the game. When you have three refine, you can craft them together for a random hat. Most people prefer to trade their refined for keys, but well refined metal will always generate from dropped weapons, keys will always cost $2.50. You can also buy and sell keys in the Steam market for Steam wallet money to buy Steam games.\n\nThe items you pay for are cosmetic if not strange weapons that count your kills. So it is not pay to win, even though you can buy in game weapons, but every weapon is a side-grade, not an upgrade, with pros and cons to each weapon. Since this is a multi-player game, nothing will overpower you. It is all rock-paper-scissors. Heavy can kill anything, but a spy or sniper can take out a heavy. A pyro can easily take out a spy. Stuff like that.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 is updated regularly and has implemented a lot of community created items, maps and Halloween events. The Halloween events feel pretty special, but for the most part, they're just Halloween versions of normal maps. The community items, while cool, seem to be mostly cosmetic items with a few new weapons. There have been community maps made and maps are always free to play on.\n\nIt is an exceptional game. Diverse weapons, maps and it is buckets of fun and free to play!!!! FREE!!! You get weapons dropped to you over time or you can trade them. It is such a good game even if you're like me and hate multiplayer this is fun multiplayer! Or single player against bots! It is a must play for any fan of first person shooters. The game is smooth, the 9 characters and weapons are very balanced and very different. There is a diverse array of modes.","August 12, 2012","true","276.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

I met my first friend on steam while playing TF2, we've built a beautiful friendship: I consider him as my brother and he considers me as his sister. We live kinda far from each other, but we've already met in real life.\n2. I got closer to a friend of mine that loves TF2. We had some problems in the past, then someday we started to play together and it feels like, nothing has ever happened.\n3. It opened my eyes about a plenty of things on internet. I got scammed many times, people stole from me when I was noob, which made me learn more about trust.\n\nThose and more facts made me love this game completely, and now, I'm not recommending it. Valve stopped making people happy, by "people" I mean those who had even better moments while playing it. You see an update: hats/miscs/bugs/lag and that's it... OF COURSE I also wasted money there, I used to get so attracted by "beautiful stuff" 'till I realize what I was doing.\nYOU GOTTA BUY SOMETHING THOUGH! If you're F2P you don't know how to play, you suck! AND WOOOW they're putting more guns in the store: all banned from competitive for being too OP (or they're really bad anyway). I seriously would like to join a server now and have fun! Ah... Yeah, they're empty because people are in trade servers just to show how much "rich" they actually are.\n"The worst kind of blind, is the one that doesn't want to see". Why Valve? Why are you letting this happen to your game?! I wanna die from laughing with my friends again, I wanna recommend this game again and tell people how much it's worth! It's NOT a goodbye, I'll go back sometimes to see if I can have at least more 5 minutes of fun. In the same way TF2's marked my life, I hope it does for other people.","April 19, 2015","false","242.7"," 337 of 613 people (55%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","55","337","613","60","90"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The-Real-Prince/recommended/440/","The-Real-Prince","Angel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The-Real-Prince/","44 products in account","This is a well made, stylized, team based first person shooter. Teamwork is needed to win at higher levels of play, though lone wolfing is fine on lower skill levels such as on most public servers. There are 9 classes to choose from. Each class has unique weapons and abilities that allow each to fulfill a unique roll as part of a larger team. This provides for a challenging and rewarding experience when faced against opponents of similar or better skill levels. The game has an active dev team that continues to release updates to the game that add new content such as weapons or game modes.\n\nAt the time of this review, there are two official modes of play: player versus player and 'Mann Versus Machine'.\n\nPlayer versus player is a mode where one team of players battles against another team of players. Within this mode, there are different types of maps. Each type of map has it's own objective or objectives for each team to achieve.\n\n'Mann Versus Machine' is a mode where a team of up to 6 players battles against waves of bots. Players collect money from destroyed bots. The money is divided equally among players in the team and can be used to purchase upgrades and abilities for the next wave of bots. The pay to play sub-mode, "Mann Up", gives rewards upon completing a "tour".\n\nIn addition to the official modes of play, there are several player made mods that introduce other modes of play such as 'Versus Saxton Hale', where a team of players battles against a player playing as a character named Saxton Hale; 'Dodge Ball', where two teams of players playing as Pyros must airblast rockets and other projectiles back and forth in order to stay alive; 'Zombie Mod', where a team of players must make it to the end of the map without dying to zombies that are played by other players; to name just a few of the many player made mods available.\n\nIn addition to game play, players will randomly receive free items from the game. Some of the free items given out are weapons, hats and crates. Hats can be worn by a class to change the appearance of that class. Crates can be opened with a key. Keys can be purchased from the Mann Co Store or from the Steam Community Market or traded for from another player. Most crates will list which items can be found within them.\n\nThe game has several communities for a player to choose from if a community is what you are looking for. The game is easy to pick up and play, either alone or with friends, yet has a depth of play that will keep you from becoming bored too quickly. The dynamics between the different classes, weapons, play styles, skill levels, modes and maps provides content for many hours of play. I have been playing since January 2015 and I still return to the game on a regular basis.","May 22, 2015","true","217.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/asylummarionette/recommended/440/","asylummarionette","(HR) BoundJackalope","http://steamcommunity.com/id/asylummarionette/","106 products in account","TF2 is a casual free to play first person shooter. On its own, that doesn't really translate to much, but with a wide variety of game modes, incredibly high skill-cap, and diverse classes with a variety of weapons to cater to a large amount of playstyles, TF2 does stand out as being a cut above the rest.\n\nBalancing unfortunately, isn't as strong as it could be and there are a few legitimately overpowered weapons, and not all classes are equal in usefulness. However, with the lack of cash shop based game stats, and the default weapons generally being the most versatile and reliable in the game, on top of the skill-caps of the classes; Keeping in mind the casual nature of the game, any issue with balance is minor enough that it can be worked around through player skill and team-coordination.\n\nTheir business model only requires a single item to be purchased from the in-game store--or to be gifted a premium upgrade package--at which point, any cosmetic weapon, or upgrade can be found through playing the game, crafted, or purchased through in-game resources. It's a very fair game, with one of the best free to play models in the market.\n\nThe primary difficulty you'll find with the game is starting it. With a lackluster tutorial, un-cordinated public games, and little assistance in the relatively deep tactics and game mechanics for the various classes, it can be hard to become skilled enough to coordinate in solo-play. Playing with friends, and doing some research into the game is highly recommended, as TF2 won't do it for you.\n\nTF2, on it's own is highly mod-friendly, and has a variety of community made servers running custom game modes. With a bit of searching, you can find hangouts, mini-games, training servers, custom maps, unofficial weapons, and the like. On top of the official game, and fairly friendly community, it's not especially difficult to get hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game without any issues, or requirements to invest money.\n\nIt has its problems, but ultimately they are minor. What TF2 offers is a rich FPS experience, with enough community support to satisfy a variety of tastes. So I have no issues recommending this game to any FPS fan looking for a team-focused, objective based shooter.","June 20, 2014","true","719.1"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","1"

TF2 gives players the choice to play with friends and have a good laugh, or even take it to the next level with competitive gaming. One thing which I love about team fortress 2 is that almost everyone is happy to play with you and that some items in the game are created by our online community. This gives people the chance to display their own creations and hopefully bring them to life in game.\n\nTF2 is more of a relaxed game and does not require you to be good at first person shooters. This is because there is a class suited to every style of play. If you prefer to stealth and be hidden, then the spy is for you. However, if you having a bad day and you cant concentrate, why not throw out some flames with the pyro's flamethrower which requires no  practice to use.\n\nThere is also a large amount of different gamemodes on TF2 such as pushing a large bomb into the enemys base or even sending a rocket into space. If your a relaxed person looking for a bit of fun with a game that is not full of try harding people... then tf2 is definatly for you!\n\nI highly recomend it :) Happy gaming","January 8, 2015","true","844.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FalcomGamer/recommended/440/","FalcomGamer","Falcom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FalcomGamer/","2 products in account","Product received for free\n\nTeam Fortress 2 (TF2) is a shooting game where your objective depends on the mode you choose to play. For instance, you could be pushing a bomb cart to detonate at your team's base or seize control points or carry a briefcase to your game. My point is, there are a bunch of modes you can play all right off the bat. There's even a football-based mode that's in beta right now.\n\nTF2 offers the player 9 different classes to play as. All with their own style of playing. We have the offensive (Scout who's quick at picking off targets, Soldier who deals major damage and has great mobility if used correctly, and Pyro who well... just runs in a straight path while holding W+M1.... and reflects about every projectile) the defensive which is really just more of the offensive if you asked me (Demoman who lays down sticky traps and has good mobility, Heavy who might have poor mobility but really packs a punch and the engineer who just sits in his rancho relaxo and hopes his sentry does something for once), and last but not least the support (Medic, the guy everyone loves but doesn't play. Sniper, every COD player's first choice, and spy, trickstabber along with his meme, surprise ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nNow you might think 9 classes is very boring compared to say Overwatch's 21 classes (not that I hate that game). But in all honesty, this game offers a lot of diversity. Weapons that can be earned through playing offer a complete different way of playing the class and game. It's one of the sole reasons why TF2 still exists today. This game is also Free 2 Play AND Win. Just because you're a gibus, don't just let the P2P step all over you. You just need to learn to play better. I learned the hard way that you can't just be good if you just get premium hats or unusuals or australium guns. It takes practice and effort. Do that and you'll be respected. Hopefully.\n\nBut that's also why many people don't like the game. Bullying F2P's remain a huge issue with this game. You're guarenteed to see one within say 1-2 hours of playing the game. And steam support ain't gonna help that much, just stand up to them and if you don't, well just ignore them. At least don't make yourself look like a fool on youtube.\n\nAnd that's about it for my review, the diversity really helps keep this community alive and it'll only gets better from there (assuming Valve can still add more weapons).

They all have a variety of ways to either kill you easily, nearly kill you, or just annoy you to death.\n\nThe Scout is the fastest class, with his Scatterguns, Pistols, and his Bats, and he is also able to double-jump in the air.\nThe Soldier wields a Rocket Launcher, a Shotgun, and a Shovel, and is the second-slowest class.\nThe Pyro wields a Flamethrower, a Shotgun, and a Fire Axe, and is a mysterious person, whose gender is still unknown.\nThe Demoman wields a Grenade Launcher, Stickybomb Launcher, and a Bottle, and is a man whose liver should have shriveled up and died years ago from his drinking.\nThe Heavy wields a Minigun, a Shotgun, and since he is oh so manly, his bare Fists, and he is also the slowest class.\nThe Engineer has a Shotgun, a Pistol, and a Wrench. He is able to build Sentry Guns, Dispensers, and Teleporters, to help attack the enemy team and support his team.\nThe Medic wields a Syringe Gun, a Medigun, and a Bonesaw. He's a medical "expert", and his Mediguns can heal the team and Ubercharge them, which can make them invulnerable for a short period of time.\nThe Sniper wields a Sniper Rifle (no surprise there), an SMG (submachine gun), and a Kukri (a big knife thingy). He's Australian, he's got his sights on you, and you're his next target.\nFinally, we have The Spy. French. Elegant. Sneaky. A lady-killer metaphorically and a literal man-killer. He has his Revolver, his Knife, and his Sapper, which he can use to destroy the Engineer's buildings. His Knife can kill any enemy in the game with a Backstab (do I need to explain what a BACK-STAB is?), unless they are Ubercharged or if a Sniper is wearing the Razorback.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\n----------------------------------------------------\nTeam Fortress 2 is often times a very fun, competitive game where you can snipe, stab, shoot, or stun, through different weapons and different classes (talked about above). There are often "two groups" of TF2, the P2Ps (Pay to Plays) and F2Ps (Free to Plays). P2Ps are often known for having many cosmetics, valuable weapons, and skill, while F2Ps are often dismissed as terrible players who understand nothing and just happen to chase you around the map thinking you're a Spy. (My personal experience is that most F2Ps I meet are actually quite good players.) With many maps, many gamemodes, and many players, you're bound to have a good time. Why not try some cp_powerhouse, or maybe ctf_doublecross? And with the newest rumors of Competitive Matchmaking, we're bound to see some more fun.\n\n-What is Competitive Matchmaking?-\nCompetitive Matchmaking means that you're put in a server with other players as good as you, like in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. This is much requested by the Community as many players end up being the only good player in a server filled with terrible players, or players much much better than you.\n\nUPDATES\n----------------------------------------------------\nTeam Fortress 2 is often chock full of updates, commonly referred to as events, with some of the more recent ones as of November 15th, 2015, being the Invasion Update, Halloween 2015 Update and Gun Mettle update. There are also other major game updates from the past, especially the Uber Update, Love and War update and the Mann vs. Machine update. Many of these updates often have a Source Filmmaker (SFM) video to introduce these updates and their features, such as the Meet the Medic video for the Uber Update, the Expiration Date video for the Love and War update, and the leaked Invasion video for the Invasion Update. Some updates instead get a comic, such as the Gun Mettle update.

It's fun, it's free, it's got cool stuff that is seriously underplayed, and the classes and asthetic are nearly timeless. But, you've heard that a thousand times. What of the meat and bones? The mechanics that everything is built on? Gotta say, hella good. The interplay of a lot of slightly different weapons and the drastically different classes combines well with the objective focus, but more importantly it makes you ask yourself silly questions. Like, "what if I ran a melee medic?" "or a melee heavy?" "What could make this more fun to play?" It is a great game, with great appeal, but most importantly the mechanics are fun. Plus who could argue with the price?\n\nNow if they would just do more with the magic spells, and medieval mode, and the bosses, then I would have no complaints.","May 25, 2014","true","728.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Or Cast spells and run from giant abominations like Monoculos! And skeletons or take to the moon or stop a raging train for destroying your base! in csgo\nAnyways! The big fat PLUS whit TF2 is that its open for every bloody one!

You do not find another croc that looks like a gharial thats because its unqiue! (Get out false gahrail!)\nIts weapon variation is also quit big csgo only have 3 diffrent snipers for example! But looks like tf2 got 6 diffrent snipers beat that!\nAlso the classes personality is awesome and they got load of voicelines wich is great! theyr not like the mindless carachacters from other FPS games wich doesn't have depth into their personality!\nAnd the teamwork in the game is awesome so it realy lives up to the title "Team fortress 2" Fx pyros can extinguish team mates and airblast projectiles like rocket and stickies wich is only one off the many choices\nI could go one forever talking about how fantastic this game is but i'll end it by saying yes this game is totaly worth it!","August 26, 2015","true","530.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vandal19/recommended/440/","Vandal19","Vandal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vandal19/","130 products in account","I like this game. Honestly, for all my complaints about it, I really and truly love this game. But, it's a sinking ship. Now, don't get me wrong, there's a lot good with it. Tons of ways to play, loads of weapons, hundreds of maps, and it's easy enough to learn. On the other hand though, it has it's fair share of issues.\n\nThe community is pretty much the number 1 problem. Ever since Valve made it F2P, hordes of idiots no longer hindered by the issue of paying for it joined the bandwagon, meaning that even people who shouldn't be able to contribute to the experience now can. Through this, any potential good people see the way that the masses play, and adopt the 'strategies' {W+M1ing, 'nade spamming, healing only heavies, etc.} for their own, leading to an endless spiral of stupidity. Additionally, every single time SPUF throws a temper tantrum over something being 'op' {OMG vlve git rd of sandman!}, Valve caves in and nerfs the offending material, so expect to have to relearn to use your favorite weapons every other month or so. As a final aside, apart from a few servers here and there, rest assured that almost every server you visit will be a mish mash of people who should still be training on bot servers {and should probably never leave them}, people who are leagues better than you and only there to grind stranges and spam memey nonsense, traders who are only there to idle/spam trade requests,  and the occasional troll. Very rarely will you find a server where everyone is polite, actively playing, halfway decent, and more or less on your skill level. The same issues also plauge co-op mode {Mann vs Machine, or MvM}. You'd expect to see the usual pub filth in Boot Camp {and you do}, but not in Tour of Duty mode, which is pay to play. Nope. You'll still see the normal assortment of trade spammers, caber demoknights, gunslinger engis, people that call for kicks over any and everything, and really just a general lack of common sense.\n\nAfter the community, I'd say Valve themselves are the next biggest problem. Everytime you turn around, there's a new hat, a new misc item, a new kit to make your weapon fire glowy pumpkins and set your head on fire after a few kills, and so on and so forth. New weapons though? Been almost 2 years if I'm remembering correctly {EDIT: Finally Valve. Although even this update only gave us 4 new weapons, with the others being reskins, and the rest of the content being, guess what, misc items. And taunts.}. Tons of reskins though, including the stupidly rare golden ones, and that stupid frying pan that goes for over $4k {in a f2p game, no less}. Although to be fair, weapon stats are changed so much that we technically get new weapons every now and then. This game has gone from "Capture the point and kill all enemies in your way" to "holy wow guise stout shako 3 ref trade me up!". It's no longer an fps, it's a dress up game with murder as an optional sidequest. Valve sadly seems to longer care about making the game fun as much as they do fattening their wallets. EDIT: The Halloween events of the last 2 years are all but proof positive of this, where the new gameplay elements more or less amounted to "pick up this item and mindlessly spam instant death beams" and dozens {yes, dozens} of misc items being released, the majority of which can't even been worn once the event ends or outside of a full moon.\n\nTruly, the golden age of this game is over, with any competent players bound to permanently rage-quit sooner or later.","January 17, 2015","true","959.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

It is very important to distinguish between these two because they are really two different games.\n\nPre-F2P TF2  (10/10) - For the first few years of TF2's existence, the game managed to have an absolute killer dynamic with a great playerbase that relied heavily on teamwork and a great community fostered by Valve's friendliness to the modding community.  Valve really worked with the community to create new scenarios, maps, and weapons these first few years that helped vastly improve the game.\n\nPost-F2P TF2 (5/10) - The easiest way to describe the state of the game today would be a male dress-up Barbie simulator.  I don't fault Valve for trying to capitalize on a game that is at the time of this writing over 7 years old, but the best times for this game are now well past.  There's just too many new hats and new weapons to choose from, from which the majority are useless.  Sure there are still plenty of servers to play in, but the majority of the servers are devoid of players with skill, microphones, and teamwork.  There's still a few fun servers (see the No-Heroes servers) but donating is about the only way you will be able to see the inside of one of these servers when its full.  The only bright side is that Valve is still adding new content with multiple updates a year.","December 3, 2014","true","027.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/centrict/recommended/440/","centrict","Jay.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/centrict/","85 products in account","You'll think this game doesn't look appealing because of it's graphics and gameplay?\nWell i'd tell you this; you've got to give it a chance by playing it for like 5 hours, try out all the game modes\nand try out all the custom modes made by the community.\n\nAfter 4 years of playing this game is absolutely amazing. Not only because of it's high amount of comic and hilarious\nscenes, but also for it's original graphics, gamemodes, characters and much more.\n\nThe 9 different characters in this game makes Team Fortress 2 so unique.\nFor instance, it's tons of fun playing as the Spy character. This very unique character can go completely invisible against other online players. This one of the reasons I liked this game so much when I was 14. The ability to go invisible is one of Team Fortress 2's many appealing reasons to play it.\nBy going invisible you can have tons of fun by playing around with it and using clever tactics with it.\n\nAre you bored after a few hours? No problem, you just switch to another character within a split second!\nLet's take the Soldier character, it's equipped with a huge rocket launcher on his shoulder which can obviously fire rockets. Something also very unique and great scripting is that you can 'rocketjump' with the rockets you fire. You shoot them at your feet, and you'll get launched away! This is just also very great and really amuzing!\nYou'll spend hours and hours mastering those 'rocketjumps'. And is also a great reason to keep on playing Team Fortress 2.\n\nThese were just 2 of Team Fortress 2's unique characters. These are all characters other First person shooter games don't have. This is one of the biggest reasons to try out this incredible game.\n\nAlso something every First person shooter doesn't have, is that all the weapons are completely free! Reason why is that you 'find' them all eventually! You just play with your stock weapon at first until a screen pops up and says 'You have found a new weapon!' And poof, you've got one of TF2's 1000 weapons in your inventory, all shiny and ready to get played with. All weapons have their unique ability which can be great fun and tactical.\n\nBesides shooting rockets, grenades, blasting out fire and shooting a billion bullets a minute, there is also a whole different part of Team Fortress 2. And that's trading your items. Team Fortress 2 comes with a very unique trading system. You can trade your weapon you just found for something else via another online player. Beside weapons there are also a thousand hats for all your TF2 characters. So you can enjoy TF2 even more by dressing your characters either very fancy, scary, classy, funny or whatever you want!\n\nFor anyone who wants a unique game, this is it.\nFree to play for everyone, so get it now i'd say!","November 13, 2014","true","165.6"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nfty/recommended/440/","nfty","pi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nfty/","253 products in account","Ever since I bought this game, I have never put thought into doing a completly honest review. If you want to take a few minutes from your time, you can listen to my storyThe first time I played this, was around late december 2007 on my brothers old windows vista computer. It didnt have much on it; weapons, hats, unusauls, etc...I'd played it a few times over at friend's houses and watched it change. New gamemodes, servers, weapons, etc...and how that all Changed the gameplay balance. I didn't get my own steam till about 3 years ago, and I was only going to use it for garry's mod. Then I decided oh what the hell, I guess I'll download tf2 since it's free. I'd been playing it on the xbox 360 for about a year then (by the way it sucks on that.) And I remember my first game, feeling sweetness as I got an insane killstreak on 2fort...like 50 something kills in less than 7 minutes. I hadn't been using steam much at the time, but around late August 2012, I'd really started to get into things. I found out about trading, and the tf2 economy, and getting cool hats for your characters, and the new mvm update which I mainly play right now.  Then, when my friend told me about unusuals in tf2, everything ♥♥♥♥ing changed. In late december 2012, i was doing everything I could to get one of these so claimed unusuals. They had these like cool particle effect thingys coming out of them. Finally, from the help of a steam buddy of mine, I was able to get one. The very first unusual I owned was a steaming handyman's handle. Now I know you're thinking, "haha a 10 key hat? So what?" But at the time, I didn't care if it was worth jack squat. It just felt so good to have that thingy with steam emmitting out of it. Then soon after that I got earbuds, and a bills hat, and some strange festives. And then, around my sprnig break in 2013, I got scammed out of my unusual. My only unusual...And the guy who did it, I wanted to ♥♥♥♥ing rip his head off I hated him so much. I will give his name out: balestorm1, although he's been offline for over a year now. He's a really interesting guy, Did a scamming spree of like 6 unusual hats. Back to my story now. After that I traded my earbuds for a second unusual hat. A stormy pith helm for solly. It looked pretty cool as well, I then started trading up to make profit, and by early summer 2013, I already had about $1000 worth of items. A whole summer went by dedicated towards making profit and spending more of my money on unusuals/stranges, etc...but after reaching what seemed like my full mental capacity for trading, I started to feel sad, and lonely, and withdrawn from the everthing else (I'm not kidding.) I decided I should probably cash out of tf2 to get money and such for it all. I did end up getting around 500 u.s. dollars via paypal, but I still had a whole bunch of ♥♥♥♥. After doing that...I traded towards an awesome burning Dapper's for soldier of which i favorited, then i traded and traded till in finally decided to spycrab what was primarily left of my backpack. Not alot, but something. ~4 buds worth of ♥♥♥♥ I lost in multiple spycrabs on the MCT/Pink Taco's trading server. During all that, I was also taking a long break from tf2 as well going into several gmod communities, I even made my own server with a buddy of mine. That is a different story though. All the trading has put aside a focus for the core gameplay. I feel like this is how it is for many others who play this game as well. Several updates ago, I was getting really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the game, and with this new Love and War, or Bread and Conga (lol not) update, It really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off for multiple reasons. And for like the 6th time, I said "I'M DONE WITH TF2. I'M NEVER PLAYING THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OF A GAME AGAIN." But here I am, amidst all this chaos...Standing strong I prevail through all of this. I know, no matter what, this game, with it's mystery will be my all time favorite video game.","June 20, 2014","true","818.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","11"

With over 250+ free unlockable weapons and 1000+ Cosmetic items this game always offers something diffrent in case you get bored. The game tended to update regularly however as years passed Valve has taken it slow with updating the game. In the few recent Months however Valve seems to be returning to TF2, updating it more often with unexpected changes and with Competitive Matchmaking on the corner even trys to balance the game more for both Public and Competitive game mode.\nBeing a Free to Play game that Valve has to make money with somehow this Game obviously features microtransactions, however everything (Aside from Keys for Crates) that is in the Shop can be found during normal gameplay eliminating Pay to Win. (Crates and Keys are used to get Strange Quallity items and Unusual items that fuction identically to their Unique counterpart. Just with a side effect such as Counting the Kills you make with that weapon (Strange) or adding a cool effect to you Cosmetics and even Weapons (Unusual))\n\nThis game is a lot of fun Playing alone. However it's even more fun Playing it with friends.\nEven though I've stopped playing the game at this point because I think its time for me to move on. I can still highly recommend this game to anyone. It's was fun while it lasted, thanks to everyone who played this game with me, I'll never forget the time I put into this game.\n\nPeace, may the Phlog Pyro be with you.","June 4","true","256.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","8","8","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrAntagonist/recommended/440/","DrAntagonist","Dr. Antagonist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrAntagonist/","205 products in account","Summary: an ugly, buggy, imbalanced mess Valve has abandoned complete with the worst community of any multiplayer game.\nUpdate: Airblasting, something that nobody complained about ever and has remained unchanged since it's addition in 2008 has been nerfed to the point of being useless against players, and the Phlog, which many players complained about and only has the downside of "can't airblast", has been buffed. This, along with many previous changes, has convinced me Valve is just doing the worst, most hilarious changes they can to see how bad they can make the game and still make money off of it.\nThis game was great in 2009 and such, but has been going downhill ever since 2010. Most old players have left, leaving behind 2013+ players, mostly children, making an incredibly toxic community because the game's free. The new updates don't feel like the old updates, they feel like 5 hats and nothing else, created by the community. When I first got this game, I got 4,000 something hours in the first two years from how great it was, I couldn't stop myself from playing.\n\nBut now I haven't played the game since, what, 2014 now?\nThe top rated negative reviews are very well written large reviews detailing the game's flaws and how it was once great, and the top rated positive reviews are "8/8 it's a gr8 game m8 xD!", and that just speaks for itself.\n\nAfter a year or so of not playing, no matter what match I joined it wasn't talking, just lennyface spam and memes. Without playing in that year, I still got 30 something points when everyone else had 2-3. It's not fun if everyone's a kid, and there's no challenge.\n\nValve doesn't even care about the balance anymore. Changing and removing mechanics that've been in the game for years, sometimes even being in for 9 years. Many things get nerf after nerf when they were fine to start with, and others that start out stronger get continuous buffs.\n\nThe economy is just awful. To anyone unfamiliar with the basics, there's three things commonly sought after: metal, keys, and Unusuals. Metal used to stay constant because keys were constant, at 2.33 - 2.55 metal, but then the keys kept rising in price. Because the keys rise, everything else falls. Unusuals that were $500 - $2,000 are now $2 - $50, Stranges that were 5 keys are now 5 refined, and the only thing of worth is keys. Valve doesn't fix this or step in at all, because they get more key sales, and the players don't fix it because then their precious keys would lose value.\n\n\nI really just want to play Team Fortress 2, but this isn't Team Fortress 2 anymore.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: That's two updates in a row (update: it's like three or four now) now that mean nothing unless you buy a coin pass for like $6. The first halloween update since the game came out is worthless unless you buy a cs:go style pass to get crates you need to buy keys for. In addition to the extremely horrible community voice acting where it sounds like he has the world's stuffiest nose, there's a reference pose Demoman who is completely stiff and immobile, who talks without having any animations, and they didn't even allign his eyeball so he has a pupil. He just half floats rigidly. This is a quality update. All updates should be as horrible as this one. This feels like an alpha to the map, and nothing is explained. But yeah this map and Robot Destruction are OBVIOUSLY easy, but Snowplow would've been impossible to learn and needed to be pulled.\nEven with the community voice acting, of two lines, they still reuse the Admin's "Here they come" mvm line when a single spaceship appears.\n\nValve stopped caring at all, and just lets a random group of people update their game.\nUpdates used to be updates, with new weapons and mechanics, and not just a single community map, when there's already thousands for free.\n\nUpdate: Another halloween update that's also community. I had to disable my custom hud and it turns out they've added an ad on the main menu you can't get rid of, and have added an always visible unremovable "1 inactive contract" blocking your sight.\nI also keep connecting to servers that are listed as Valve, but then it says I can't do my contract because I'm not on a Valve server.\n\n\nOh yeah also they added votekicking so that players will constantly kick people for whatever arbritrary reason, I've seen people get kicked for their voice, not being a certian class, not doing a certain thing etc, and you've got insecure kids who get a few friends together and kick literally everyone on the server saying they're 'the admins'. Votekicking is the literal worst idea Valve has done for this game, even worse than "muting voice chat also mutes text" which introduces so many problems. They couldn't just add a mute text feature?\n\nMicspam was rather prevalent and hilarious pre-2012, but now you'll nearly never find it. Because back then the players could think and hit the 'mute' button, but now they usually just kick micspammers, or anyone else, immediately. And even if they do hit the mute button, unless they've put in a console command (cl_mute_all_comms 0) they can't read that person's text anymore.\n\nUpdate: Merry Christmas everyone! Do you like presents and updates?! We do too! Buy a contract from us for real money and we'll give you crates you need to open with real money to get weapon skins that take no time to make! Just like the previous updates! We don't care here at Valve! And who cares about balance? Just move things around randomly making everything horrible!\n\nI legitimately think they're seeing how much they can do while still having people play the game, because they're nerfing everything, except buffing a few already really good weapons.\nFor example:\nSplendid Screen has 20%/20% resistance, increases charge rate by 50%, and does more damage.\nChargin Targe has 50%/30% resistance and no afterburn immunity\n\nWhy would you use the Chargin Targe anymore? They're also encouraging to not learn to play the game by increasing the effectiveness of horrible things you stop doing after you've played the game for more than 10 minutes.\n\nI also like how they listed Demoman as Demoman / Demoknight in the patch notes, and that the swords deploying and holstering slower isn't even listed as a negative, and doesn't even tell you how much slower.\n\nThey know the community is children who can't think, and they're pandering to children who can't think. Weapons now have descriptions like "Alt-Fire: Detonate all Stickybombs" or "Alt-Fire: Release a blast of air that pushes enemies and projectiles and extinguish allies that are on fire. Extinguishing an ally on fire gives you 20 health." (Great grammar, and I love the fact that it only says that on the stock flamethrower and not the others. If we're this stupid, we don't be able to figure out you can do it on the others!) in addition to everything else, like Pyros healing when they extinguish teammates. You also very annoyingly see every teammate for 10 seconds when you spawn, because the behaviour I've never seen of "not knowing where to go" is apparently very popular\n\nFor such a "friendly" update, giving every weapon a college essay description, they don't list the fact that the regenerating things regen slower when you've recently taken damage. They added that this update, but don't say ingame. They also stopped using red and blue text for negatives and positives for some reason and are just using the neutral white text. The scoreboard is so ugly now, too, they even messed that up.\n\nBy mid 2016 the only class that will be worth playing is Spy.\n\n"Here at Valve we like to ruin every game we make except for Dota 2 because we like mobas more than fps games. We don't even care about this newest update, -50% holster rate is instead +50%, and 0.5 second disable is instead 5 seconds, that you can do while cloaked.

But lately I've been feeling unsatisfied with how Team Fortress 2 felt like a chore too me, yes it maybe because I have 5202 hours or 217 days on Team Fortress 2. But mainly it's because, it's lost it's touch for me. I've played competive Team Fortress 2 for about 3-2 years, I enjoyed the fact that there was a competitive Team Fortress 2, with all 9 classes which is named Highlander, and 6v6 or 6s for short. I always quite fond of that, I recommend any Team Fortress 2 player who has over 100 hours to try it out, and if they like it get devoted to the game, because one day, maybe you'll be in ESports. I was quite hyped for the competitive mode they were going too add to this game, and still am but honestly I'm not going to install the game, to play it once or twice and be bored of this game again and uninstall. But I'll always remember this game, I'll always recommend this game to someone who is looking for a 1st person shotter, that has the quality of Wind Waker, but the stupidity of a comic. Still and will always be my favourite shooter in the whole wide world.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrAntagonist/recommended/440/","DrAntagonist","Dr. Antagonist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrAntagonist/","205 products in account","Summary: an ugly, buggy, imbalanced mess Valve has abandoned complete with the worst community of any multiplayer game.\nUpdate: Airblasting, something that nobody complained about ever and has remained unchanged since it's addition in 2008 has been nerfed to the point of being useless against players, and the Phlog, which many players complained about and only has the downside of "can't airblast", has been buffed. This, along with many previous changes, has convinced me Valve is just doing the worst, most hilarious changes they can to see how bad they can make the game and still make money off of it.\nThis game was great in 2009 and such, but has been going downhill ever since 2010. Most old players have left, leaving behind 2013+ players, mostly children, making an incredibly toxic community because the game's free. The new updates don't feel like the old updates, they feel like 5 hats and nothing else, created by the community. When I first got this game, I got 4,000 something hours in the first two years from how great it was, I couldn't stop myself from playing.\n\nBut now I haven't played the game since, what, 2014 now?\nThe top rated negative reviews are very well written large reviews detailing the game's flaws and how it was once great, and the top rated positive reviews are "8/8 it's a gr8 game m8 xD!", and that just speaks for itself.\n\nAfter a year or so of not playing, no matter what match I joined it wasn't talking, just lennyface spam and memes. Without playing in that year, I still got 30 something points when everyone else had 2-3. It's not fun if everyone's a kid, and there's no challenge.\n\nValve doesn't even care about the balance anymore. Changing and removing mechanics that've been in the game for years, sometimes even being in for 9 years. Many things get nerf after nerf when they were fine to start with, and others that start out stronger get continuous buffs.\n\nThe economy is just awful. To anyone unfamiliar with the basics, there's three things commonly sought after: metal, keys, and Unusuals. Metal used to stay constant because keys were constant, at 2.33 - 2.55 metal, but then the keys kept rising in price. Because the keys rise, everything else falls. Unusuals that were $500 - $2,000 are now $2 - $50, Stranges that were 5 keys are now 5 refined, and the only thing of worth is keys. Valve doesn't fix this or step in at all, because they get more key sales, and the players don't fix it because then their precious keys would lose value.\n\n\nI really just want to play Team Fortress 2, but this isn't Team Fortress 2 anymore.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: That's two updates in a row (update: it's like three or four now) now that mean nothing unless you buy a coin pass for like $6. The first halloween update since the game came out is worthless unless you buy a cs:go style pass to get crates you need to buy keys for. In addition to the extremely horrible community voice acting where it sounds like he has the world's stuffiest nose, there's a reference pose Demoman who is completely stiff and immobile, who talks without having any animations, and they didn't even allign his eyeball so he has a pupil. He just half floats rigidly. This is a quality update. All updates should be as horrible as this one. This feels like an alpha to the map, and nothing is explained. But yeah this map and Robot Destruction are OBVIOUSLY easy, but Snowplow would've been impossible to learn and needed to be pulled.\nEven with the community voice acting, of two lines, they still reuse the Admin's "Here they come" mvm line when a single spaceship appears.\n\nValve stopped caring at all, and just lets a random group of people update their game.\nUpdates used to be updates, with new weapons and mechanics, and not just a single community map, when there's already thousands for free.\n\nUpdate: Another halloween update that's also community. I had to disable my custom hud and it turns out they've added an ad on the main menu you can't get rid of, and have added an always visible unremovable "1 inactive contract" blocking your sight.\nI also keep connecting to servers that are listed as Valve, but then it says I can't do my contract because I'm not on a Valve server.\n\n\nOh yeah also they added votekicking so that players will constantly kick people for whatever arbritrary reason, I've seen people get kicked for their voice, not being a certian class, not doing a certain thing etc, and you've got insecure kids who get a few friends together and kick literally everyone on the server saying they're 'the admins'. Votekicking is the literal worst idea Valve has done for this game, even worse than "muting voice chat also mutes text" which introduces so many problems. They couldn't just add a mute text feature?\n\nMicspam was rather prevalent and hilarious pre-2012, but now you'll nearly never find it. Because back then the players could think and hit the 'mute' button, but now they usually just kick micspammers, or anyone else, immediately. And even if they do hit the mute button, unless they've put in a console command (cl_mute_all_comms 0) they can't read that person's text anymore.\n\nUpdate: Merry Christmas everyone! Do you like presents and updates?! We do too! Buy a contract from us for real money and we'll give you crates you need to open with real money to get weapon skins that take no time to make! Just like the previous updates! We don't care here at Valve! And who cares about balance? Just move things around randomly making everything horrible!\n\nI legitimately think they're seeing how much they can do while still having people play the game, because they're nerfing everything, except buffing a few already really good weapons.\nFor example:\nSplendid Screen has 20%/20% resistance, increases charge rate by 50%, and does more damage.\nChargin Targe has 50%/30% resistance and no afterburn immunity\n\nWhy would you use the Chargin Targe anymore? They're also encouraging to not learn to play the game by increasing the effectiveness of horrible things you stop doing after you've played the game for more than 10 minutes.\n\nI also like how they listed Demoman as Demoman / Demoknight in the patch notes, and that the swords deploying and holstering slower isn't even listed as a negative, and doesn't even tell you how much slower.\n\nThey know the community is children who can't think, and they're pandering to children who can't think. Weapons now have descriptions like "Alt-Fire: Detonate all Stickybombs" or "Alt-Fire: Release a blast of air that pushes enemies and projectiles and extinguish allies that are on fire. Extinguishing an ally on fire gives you 20 health." (Great grammar, and I love the fact that it only says that on the stock flamethrower and not the others. If we're this stupid, we don't be able to figure out you can do it on the others!) in addition to everything else, like Pyros healing when they extinguish teammates. You also very annoyingly see every teammate for 10 seconds when you spawn, because the behaviour I've never seen of "not knowing where to go" is apparently very popular\n\nFor such a "friendly" update, giving every weapon a college essay description, they don't list the fact that the regenerating things regen slower when you've recently taken damage. They added that this update, but don't say ingame. They also stopped using red and blue text for negatives and positives for some reason and are just using the neutral white text. The scoreboard is so ugly now, too, they even messed that up.\n\nBy mid 2016 the only class that will be worth playing is Spy.\n\n"Here at Valve we like to ruin every game we make except for Dota 2 because we like mobas more than fps games. We don't even care about this newest update, -50% holster rate is instead +50%, and 0.5 second disable is instead 5 seconds, that you can do while cloaked. We messed everything that we possibly could up."","June 19, 2014","false","968.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

And it's also relatively bug free by now, compare this to other AAA titles nowadays, there's nothing like this, that'S why I find myself always getting back to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CJWong34/recommended/440/","CJWong34","The Great and Powerful Octie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CJWong34/","29 products in account","I take it all back. This game is seriously just too overrated as heck. Originally this game was supposed to be fun, engaging to players (both new, experienced and old) and was meant to appeal to the gaming community, but ever since the recent major updates, this game has been making players give in to purchase various items, and has only let most of the community down with unexpected results, as these are mainly "stolen" or even "borrowed" ideas from other Valve-related games, such as the popular FPS, Counter Strike: Global Offensive.\n\nThis game hardly, if ever, lets the community have their own way with custom community-created content, be it weapons, taunts, or even cosmetics. Valve ALWAYS implements their own attributes, soundtrack, and even appearances to simply "balance" gameplay, when in fact, the results are honestly not worth the wait, and are not what the community is expecting to see, use or even, hear.\n\nTo those thinking this is a great game: in my opinion, it's no longer attractive to play this game anymore. TF2's simply a giant money vacuum, "sucking" in your wallets and “baiting" unexpected players into purchasing mainly unused items that are simply just for show, and not for actual use, unless you aren't easily appealed into buying these "excess" items.\n\nValve, please, at the very most, whenever an update’s in the works, ALWAYS have the community in mind. Your actions may bring about unforeseen circumstances, which only spread outcry over the whole community, be it the inclusion of a new weapon, changing the statistics of a weapon, or even changing the gameplay of various classes. With your recent update, this even brings in unpopularity among players who have played this game throughout the past few years, with unnecessary or unpopular content that is simply redundant, and only brings in unexpected responses or reactions from the community.\n","December 18, 2015","false","201.3"," 50 of 87 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","50","87","3","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/void_dweller/recommended/440/","void_dweller","Void Dweller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/void_dweller/","160 products in account","I'm playing TF2 since 2010 and still enjoy it. First of all one most important thing about it: it's 10x more fun when you play with friends. Here's my top 10 reasons why I love that game:\n\n1 You don't need to be great at multiplayer FPS games (CS, Quake 3, UT etc.) to be good at TF2, of course skill, reaction and good aim helps, but as long as you know your role and if you're playing it smart you're gonna be just fine and there's always something you can figure out or learn to turn things to your advantage.\n\n2 It has one of the best and most hilarious characters with hundreds of lines and a lot of space for random accidents that make me lol really hard even after playing it for three years. The humor in this game is great and it never gets old.\n\n3 A well crafted balance between teams and classes and really great maps. Unlike most games with good balance this one doesn't make you feel underpowered and pressured to be a real pro or die as a noob in shame (I'm looking at you Starcraft), when you start to do things right you start to feel how powerful your class is, that feel that by doing simple things you're supposed to do is bringing the glorious victory of your team closer every passing second is priceless.\n\n4 Complexity in simplicity: each class has a simple purpose and just few simple tools to accomplish it. The complex gameplay of TF2 is made of very simple concepts, like "rocket launchers hurt people", "if you get an ubercharge you can use it and make yourself and the guy you're healing invulnerable and push through heavy resistance", "airblast - alternate fire of your flame thrower, is pushing things away, players, rockets and even arrows, also it extinguishes allies and saves them from burning to death", "spies may look like one of your teammates, but act suspiciously, smack their face with your wrench" and one more simple thing most new players are having a hard time to figur out for some reason: "engies can actually help other engies to build and defend!"\n\n5 there are no weak or powerful weapons, most weapons are the same as your default weapons except they are slightly better in something and a bit worse in other thing. You don't need to know the entire arsenal of the game, you just need to find the weapons that are most appealing to your playstile. Also there are a few weapons change the way you play, like engie's gunslinger, you can't build big fat and mean sentries, you build a small mini-sentry, however equipping that thing gives you HP boost, and makes you a mobile obnoxious prick who runs around and builds and instantly deploys those annoying mini sentries whenever he feels like.\n\n6 Most items are cosmetic, that means you don't need to have any hats, high level or money spent in game's store to be effective, some weapons that will amplify your strong traits would be a good addition though and those are very easy to get. Also despite those cosmetic items thanks to the good character design all classes are very distinguishable, you always know what to expect from a fat guy with a minigun and you always know you should kill the dude in white coat because he heals others. Still you can get some cosmetic items and look badass or funny.\n\n7 The game is constantly updated, every now and then you get new maps, modes, bug fixes, balance fixes, weapons and cosmetics. Sadly Valve gets more lazy and greedy with each new major update and makes more hats rather than real content.\n\n8 They got it right with graphics. I remember playing other modern FPS games and that was terrible! All those "eye candy" effects, strong contrasts, "cinematic" camera movement, "realistic shaders/lighting/effects, poor character design and "spectacular" explosions were very distracting and were making it really hard to tell what's going on before it would be too late.\n\n9 It's all about teamplay and mission goal rather than killcount and skill. A team of average players who help each other will always be stronger than a team of disorganized show-offs with mad skillz who play their favorite class even when the team needs a medic and engie and don't care about anything but their killcount.\n\n10 Valve puts a lot of effort each year to make the Haloween event in TF2 very VERY awesome.\n\nHowever there are things I don't like in TF2:\n\n1 Community. LOTS of obnoxious kids, trolls, pretentious jerks and total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\n2 Trading. I hate it, I really-really hate it.\n\n3 Painfully stupid people. This game introduced me levels of stupidity I couldn't even imagine.\n\n4 Bugs. There are some really annoying gameplay and performance issues with the game and Valve pretends really hard that everything is cool.\n\n5 Cheaters. Sometimes there will be some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will ruin everyone's game by flying through walls and spawncamping with 100% accuracy and 100% crits. However there are some guys who use not so obvious hacks and claim they knew where you were and hit you from an impossible angle and distance for ten times in a row just because they are so good at this game and you're a stupid butthurt noob.\n\n6 Server customization. Finding a server that has good ping, vote menu enabled, good map list and doesn't have custom music, idiotic settings like instant respawn, ads or other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t are very hard to come by.\n\nHope this was helpful.","February 13, 2014","true","546.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","5"

They basically make you pay 5$ to enter the update which gives you quests at the end, and after that you have this chance to get you pay 2.49$ to open a case which basically gives you some random skin that no one cared to buy it, I am not saying I have bad luck or they force you, it is just where is the fun getting these weapons skin when it is all about paying a 2.5$, which these you can buy many different games in Steam.\n\nSecondly the community,\n\nGo to YouTube or somewhere else you have this stupid thing they are fighting about, the irony of the quote: "Hats make you better" is a complete BS, and believe me how many idiots believe this quote is true, I had an account back in 2009 when I actually bought the game (the account was hacked and then terminated by Valve) the community was amazingly helpful and supportive, now it is basically like I said 13 - 15 years old people spamming lenny and worshipping high tier players, the game no longer itself have this quest which is basically to stop RED or BLU, now it is all about the hats, the community cares about the hats than the game itself, they should seriously add an roleplaying tag to the game, despite most of them dislike RolePlaying.\n\nBehind the scene of the Free 2 Play tag:\n\nthat Free 2 Play is a giant illusion, you join a game, play normally however you find yourself being left alone, medics never heal you, pyros doesn't help you taking out the fire, enemies taunt you and laugh at you like some kind of a joke, and how all this happens? Because of a single hat known the Gibus, TF2 is like power, starts from a farmer to a king, from good to bad, you have this Gibus you realize you are nothing, pile of garbage, people mock you for being that farmer, you realize the only way to stop it is by buying something, changing your job to a merchant, you buy your first hat, you feel better for a second, you feel nothing changed in your feelings for a single hat, after that you start feeling you want to buy and sell like a merchant, so you get more and sell more until you have money like the king, you join a server where all the people who mocked you before for being poor little man wearing a Gibus, you killed them with all your money you made and the skill you created, you proved yourself you are worthy, however you met this guy who started TF2 that day, you killed him, mocked him, he changed Teams, yet you still mock him but you don't feel you are doing something wrong, you didn't helped him, you didn't healed him when you were a medic, you didn't save him from the fire when you were a pyro, you didn't do anything, that gibus person that you were exactly like him, is gonna go exactly like you went when they mocked for having a Gibus and a f2p tag next to him, this Gibus will go with the same cycle you went, and he will make the other gibus go in the cycle again, and a again, and again...\n\nIt never ends...\n\nIn short, you get envied from all the hats, you get mocked, you buy a hat, you feel better and everything changed, you start trading, you get better hats, you become on of them, you make another person envied from you and other people hats, goes in the same cycle as yours.\nRinse and repeat.\n\nMy last words:\n\nI had the greatest fun in this game, it didn't last sadly, and all the people I met there would agree the same of where this game is turning to.\nAs I said, the community is more of a major problem than the game itself, people says that the community can't affect the game to be play or not to be played, which is complete BS, because the game is actually the community, the community is the reason that keeps the game alive, for more time...","April 15","false","822.5"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","30","50","8","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eefra/recommended/440/","eefra","eeIV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eefra/","167 products in account","First off, I want to start by saying that I have had quite a lot of experience with this game, and all the different mechanics in it, which make it very interesting. TF2 really isn't just your ordinary shoot-and-run game, it has much more to it than just aiming a gun and pressing M1. The classes are what really make the game stand out of the crowd, they are the main focus of the game, so I'll cover that!\n\nClasses are divided in to three different types, offensive classes, defensive classes and support classes. I'm going to go through all of the different classes and their purposes in the game.\n\nOFFENSIVE CLASSES:\nThe Scout: He's fast and effective at doing objectives. Double jumps and speed make him move quite unexpectedly. He might be fast and do good damage, but he is quite weak. Equipped with a scattergun, a pistol, and a baseball bat.\n\nThe Soldier: He's slow, but deals quite a big splash damage with his rockets. He has quite a lot of health so he can take quite big hits as well. Equipped with a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel.\n\nThe Pyro: It's quite self explanatory with the name. Pyro does a lot of damage with it's close range flame thrower, and can also airblast enemy projectiles (rockets, grenades, sticky bombs).\nEquipped with a flame thrower, a shotgun and a fire axe (ironically)\n\nDEFENSIVE CLASSES:\nThe Demoman: He is a drunk black scottish man with one eye. Demoman is the class who uses explosives, much like the Soldier. He can also take a big hit, but not as well as the Soldier. Equipped with a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher (the bombs stick to walls, and are detonatable) and a bottle.\n\nThe Heavy: A big man, with a big gun and a big Russian accent. He's the most tanky class in the game, and has a freaking minigun. Be wary though, he is very slow, and usually depends on having a Medic. Equipped with a freakin' minigun, a shotgun and his bare freakin' fists. You really wouldn't want to mess with him.\n\nThe Engineer: He's one of the more unique classes in the game, he can build an automatic sentry gun that shoots at enemies, a dispenser which gives him and teammates health and ammo and a teleporter to get your comrades faster to the frontlines. When an engineer is good, it is a game changer definitely. Equipped with a shotgun, a pistol, a wrench and a construction- and destruction PDA.\n\nSUPPORT CLASSES:\nThe Medic: He's the one who is responsible of keeping the whole team alive, and you should definitely protect him. He's a german doctor, who might be a bit on the crazy side...\nEquipped with syringe gun (ouch), a medi gun (a gun that is used to put a healing beam on your teammates) and a bonesaw.\n\nThe Sniper: He can quite easily pin down key enemy targets like heavies from a long distance, but is also quite weak, and vulnerable to Spies. This Australian man is effective in long range, but starts to get less effective when in close range combat, since the Sniper doesn't have much health. Equipped with a sniper rifle, an SMG, and a kukri.\n\nThe Spy: A lady killer (figuratively) and a man killer (literally). The spy is a stealth class who can get behind enemies, turn invisible, disguise as other players, disable and destroy Engineer buildings and effectively kill unaware enemies with one stab in the back. Definitely one of the more interesting classes. Equipped with a revolver, a butterfly knife, a disguise kit, an invisibility watch and a sapper.\n\n\nI would also like to point out that this game has had an unusually long lifespan! It's been over 7 years since the release of the game, and people still play this actively! A̶l̶t̶h̶o̶u̶g̶h̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶c̶o̶n̶o̶m̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶s̶ ̶w̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶d̶o̶w̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶h̶i̶t̶t̶e̶r̶.\n\nI was thinking of typing about the different types of unlockable weapons in the game, but this is already a really long review in itself, so I'll let you guys look into them yourselves.\n\nIf you want to play an FPS-shooter that's out of the norm, TF2 would definitely be something I would recommend. It's free and fun.\n\nPhewh. It's been quite a job writing all this. Lastly I would like to state that this is my favourite game of all time, and I hope you guys found this review interesting and or helpful! Go out and play this awesome game (for free).

Then this is a game for you. For real this game is so fun and awesome to play, this game has taught me how to play as a team and that is why I'm giving thumbs up for this game. Negative: Trading community is horrible nowadays (my opinion) Key price's so high that no one as poor as I am can afford a single key trough trading (unless they'll go for long run). all tho you can buy keys from steam community market place and inside the game itself.\nYou can also challenge your friends to duel which are hecka fun :3 and you also see that which one is better you or your friend and on which class. There are 9 different classes (Scout, Soldier, Pyro, Demoman, Engineer, Heavy, Medic, Sniper and Spy.) every class has their strenghts and weakness.\nThis game is so well balanced between every class that even I can't find any class "op" most of the times people say that pyro is "op" but no. Pyro is actually pretty easy class to defeat you just have to know how.\nI do recommend this game for those who really want to enjoy and have fun inside game with their friends.\n","September 21, 2015","true","848.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

This game will make you angry if you go in hopefull that all of your hours of COD will pay off. They wont.\nThis game is for the adventurous people who enjoy a community based game.\n\nWhat I enjoy about this game is the fact that you can find weapons from enough gameplay time, the fact you can craft weapons, the achievements, the taunts, how you can install huds and change in game visuals, the range of characters and of course, the taunt kills.\nThe taunt kills give you a sense of achievement when done on an opposing player because they are very hard to do (apart from against lazy snipers).\n\nOverall this game is highly recommended by me and others that I know. I would encourage you to download this game.\n\n- [YT] Zyaxitron Ed","March 19, 2014","true","867.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eefra/recommended/440/","eefra","eeIV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eefra/","167 products in account","First off, I want to start by saying that I have had quite a lot of experience with this game, and all the different mechanics in it, which make it very interesting. TF2 really isn't just your ordinary shoot-and-run game, it has much more to it than just aiming a gun and pressing M1. The classes are what really make the game stand out of the crowd, they are the main focus of the game, so I'll cover that!\n\nClasses are divided in to three different types, offensive classes, defensive classes and support classes. I'm going to go through all of the different classes and their purposes in the game.\n\nOFFENSIVE CLASSES:\nThe Scout: He's fast and effective at doing objectives. Double jumps and speed make him move quite unexpectedly. He might be fast and do good damage, but he is quite weak. Equipped with a scattergun, a pistol, and a baseball bat.\n\nThe Soldier: He's slow, but deals quite a big splash damage with his rockets. He has quite a lot of health so he can take quite big hits as well. Equipped with a rocket launcher, a shotgun, and a shovel.\n\nThe Pyro: It's quite self explanatory with the name. Pyro does a lot of damage with it's close range flame thrower, and can also airblast enemy projectiles (rockets, grenades, sticky bombs).\nEquipped with a flame thrower, a shotgun and a fire axe (ironically)\n\nDEFENSIVE CLASSES:\nThe Demoman: He is a drunk black scottish man with one eye. Demoman is the class who uses explosives, much like the Soldier. He can also take a big hit, but not as well as the Soldier. Equipped with a grenade launcher, a stickybomb launcher (the bombs stick to walls, and are detonatable) and a bottle.\n\nThe Heavy: A big man, with a big gun and a big Russian accent. He's the most tanky class in the game, and has a freaking minigun. Be wary though, he is very slow, and usually depends on having a Medic. Equipped with a freakin' minigun, a shotgun and his bare freakin' fists. You really wouldn't want to mess with him.\n\nThe Engineer: He's one of the more unique classes in the game, he can build an automatic sentry gun that shoots at enemies, a dispenser which gives him and teammates health and ammo and a teleporter to get your comrades faster to the frontlines. When an engineer is good, it is a game changer definitely. Equipped with a shotgun, a pistol, a wrench and a construction- and destruction PDA.\n\nSUPPORT CLASSES:\nThe Medic: He's the one who is responsible of keeping the whole team alive, and you should definitely protect him. He's a german doctor, who might be a bit on the crazy side...\nEquipped with syringe gun (ouch), a medi gun (a gun that is used to put a healing beam on your teammates) and a bonesaw.\n\nThe Sniper: He can quite easily pin down key enemy targets like heavies from a long distance, but is also quite weak, and vulnerable to Spies. This Australian man is effective in long range, but starts to get less effective when in close range combat, since the Sniper doesn't have much health. Equipped with a sniper rifle, an SMG, and a kukri.\n\nThe Spy: A lady killer (figuratively) and a man killer (literally). The spy is a stealth class who can get behind enemies, turn invisible, disguise as other players, disable and destroy Engineer buildings and effectively kill unaware enemies with one stab in the back. Definitely one of the more interesting classes. Equipped with a revolver, a butterfly knife, a disguise kit, an invisibility watch and a sapper.\n\n\nI would also like to point out that this game has had an unusually long lifespan! It's been over 7 years since the release of the game, and people still play this actively! A̶l̶t̶h̶o̶u̶g̶h̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶c̶o̶n̶o̶m̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶s̶ ̶w̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶d̶o̶w̶n̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶h̶i̶t̶t̶e̶r̶.\n\nI was thinking of typing about the different types of unlockable weapons in the game, but this is already a really long review in itself, so I'll let you guys look into them yourselves.\n\nIf you want to play an FPS-shooter that's out of the norm, TF2 would definitely be something I would recommend. It's free and fun.\n\nPhewh. It's been quite a job writing all this. Lastly I would like to state that this is my favourite game of all time, and I hope you guys found this review interesting and or helpful! Go out and play this awesome game (for free). Peace.","December 14, 2013","true","846.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","4"

If you're a person who likes team-based multiplayer first-person-shooter video games, I think this game is for you. The sound in the game is exciting overall together with the visuals.  It's a perfect game. You are always updated with new incredible releases. Last but not very least, a very fun and unique shooter with cool mechanics and great teamplay is totally free to play.\n\nTHE GREAT\nThe game can be addictive and challenging if you let it. The game is very fun, with different characters and balanced. One of the best Games of all time for sure. People who call this game or boring don't know much about shooters to be honest. Each class is a really funny, cool and interesting character with an unique and awesome personality. You're not running around with an AK47 or M16, but with Syringe Guns and Sticky Bombs, it's quite hilarious. Not to mention its great item-drop system, an amazing fanbase and the community, they are the perks which keep the players from all over the world to play this game.\n\nTHE UGLY\nThere is no serious gameplay whatsoever. If the developers wanted players to have a real serious gameplay, they would have made an in-game system where players get penalized for quitting the game before the match ends. Face the facts: You can disconnect the current game any time you like even in MVM matches. Perhaps for dynamic joining and disconnecting of players of the current match, but it can be frustrating when you spend the whole damn match without stable players.\n\nGameplay\nMost Team Fortress 2 game modes have 2 opposing teams, the Reliable Excavation & Demolition (RED) and the Builders League United (BLU), that compete against each other in various maps to complete certain objectives. Some game modes include:\nCapture the Flag: Each team attempts to steal the opposing team’s intelligence briefcase from their headquarters and secure it back at their own base.\nKing of the Hill: A central point must be captured and defended for a set amount of time to win the round.\nPayload: One team attempts to escort a rail cart filled with explosives to the enemies base.\nTeam Deathmatch: A team is able to win a round by killing off the members of the opposing team.\nCharacters\nThe players on each team must choose a class to play, each with their own set of abilities and special weapons.\nMedic: Heals fellow teammates with a Medigun that can ÜberCharged to make other players temporarily invincible.\nScout: Runs very fast and is able to double jump. The Scout default weapons are a shotgun and baseball bat.\nHeavy Weapons Guy: Also known as just “Heavy”, this is the largest and slowest moving of the classes. He wields a minigun and boxing gloves, and can recover health by eating sandwiches.\nPyro: Wears a gas mask and fireproof suit while wielding a flamethrower and fire axe and is best at killing enemies up close.\nEngineer: Can build teleporters, sentry guns and dispensers that aid other teammates in battle.\nSniper: Can kill enemies from far away with his sniper rifle. Enemies can be killed with one shot if they are hit in the head.\nDemoman: Wields a grenade launcher and sticky bomb launcher that can be used to kill enemies around corners, or lay traps for enemies to run into.\nSoldier: A rocket launcher equipped brute that is capable of reaching great height by jumping while firing a rocket at the ground.\nSpy: Can disguise themselves as members of the other team, and can kill enemies with one hit if they manage to sneak behind them and stab them in the back. Can “sap” Engineer’s buildings to quickly destroy them.","May 5, 2014","true","105.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

There are 9 classes and all of them have balance, like heavy has a lot of health but he is really slow and really big target on the battlefield, sniper is verry good at long range but he is verry weak in close range, pyro is verry good at close range but weak at long range, ect. In tf2 there are weapons that you can get by random drop, buy them from mann co. store, craft them or trade them. All weapons have balance, no weapons are OP,if there is a op weapon it's going to get a nerf, they have good sides and bad sides, like frontier justice: you gain revenge crits but you have no random critical hits and smaller clip size, tomislav (minigun) has faster spin up time but has slower fireing speed. In tf2 there is so mutch teamwork, one team is probably going to lose if they have only one class on a team or if they don't have a medic or if they have 6 snipers and no engineers to defend. Overall this game is great and it's free, so if you are reading this on computer that you own, why don't you download the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonym0/recommended/440/","anonym0","anonym0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/anonym0/","961 products in account","Hat fortress 2, oh sorry Team Fortress 2, is a multiplayer fps focusing on cooperating with your allies to complete objectives or stop the other team from completing theirs. At your arsenal you have 9 unique classes with hundreds of weapons of your choosing. You find "random drops" in form of weapons as you play, allowing you to try out new weapons and eventually finding your favourite combos.\n\nUnlike other popular fps games, TF2 focus on advancing with your team and fill in for your allied classes weaknesses. While a heavy class have great damage output, his slowness makes him a sitting duck. A medic class can keep him alive and together advance into enemy territory to do damage. In another example, an engineer class can setup a small base for allies to heal, refill ammo and have a few seconds of not being fired upon. Against a demolition class like soldier or demoman, he can just watch as his buildings are wrecked, however with the support of a pyro, their explosives can be turned against them. Some weapons are even specifically made to support another class in battle.\n\nThe real gem of TF2 is however it's crazy customization. You can equip all kinds of hats, clothes and other miscs, making your classes stand out.\n\nAnd not only that, TF2 even got a huge economy, with thousands of other players involved into. Trade a weapon or a hat with a friend, profit on selling your rare misc or simply hoard it all! It's all up to you\n\nPros: Crazy fun gameplay, badass costimization, hilarious voice acting, huge economy and one of the longest surviving fpses on the market. oh and FREE\n\nCons: To avoid having to play for tons of hours to try out all weapons, the in-game store sells extremly overpriced items. Trading however enables you to get everything cheaper but new players will have trouble with this. To make your items tradable, you are required to buy a  premium upgrade (which you can by buying the cheapest item in the store so not too expensive)","May 14, 2014","true","118.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fudlacker/recommended/440/","Fudlacker","Bud Fudlacker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fudlacker/","409 products in account","Reasons why TF2 is bad:\nBugs: 9 years after release, the game has more bugs than ever. Taunt glitches, spazzing ragdolls, symbols over player's heads that will get you killed (mini crit vulnerability symbol staying over player's heads is an example), buildings that are infinitely sapped, sappers remaining on unsapped buildings, players glitching outside of the map, the list goes on and on.\n\nPerformance: Got that expensive rig with i5 processor and GTX970? Well, too bad, because this game runs like the average modern console port (while looking bad). Framerates surf between 40 and 150 with a period of 1-2 seconds. An enemy player that's on fire? Good luck hitting him. He'll lag your game so hard that your damage output for weapons like the minigun is halved.\n\nBad design:\n- Directx 8 was obsolete 5 years before the game was even released, but yet it's still included out of sheer laziness.\n-The server browser is equally lazy and is completely obnoxious to use.\n-Want to use the custom server browser? Good, you only see ping, mapname and the number of people on the server. Valve never figured out that they can put "maptime left" on the list.\n-And of course the best part about the game: the hitboxes and the "lag compensation". If you played sniper for a period of time, you'll notice that you don't LEAD the target, but shoot somewhere random behind it.\n-Want to play pyro? Good luck with that. They managed to ♥♥♥♥ that up too. The phlog only hits the player from certain angles, even when he's engulfed in flames.\n-Want to play heavy? Pray that there's never an enemy hugging you. You literally can't hit him if he's inside of your minigun.\n-See that enemy running up the stairs? Don't shoot rockets at him, because they will be absorbed by random clutter, dealing no damage to enemies.\n-Want to play demoknight? Good luck with that. You can't damage enemies that are in each other and "ghost hits" (hits where you get the sound of meat getting hit, but do no damage) are everywhere. I even get ghost hits on heavies that are standing perfectly still.\n-Communities are free to spam ads or even inject malicious code through people running the game and connecting to their servers.\n-The most recent fad: engineers going outside of the map and building sentries that can shoot people, while being protected by the invisible walls around the map. Jolly good fun and still not fixed after more than a month.\n-Want to call a vote on that cheater? Enjoy the coinflip, because your team clearly doesn't care enough to press F1 or F2. That is, if the vote window actually shows up of course! Want to know the result? Too bad, you only occasionally get the "yes" or "no" displayed, and you most certainly won't see the actual number of votes for each choice. Excellent design!\n-Is there a team that's clearly much worse than the other one? Too bad. Only the players with few points get "funbalanced" to that team. The actual players causing the imbalance stay on the other team.\n\n\nRampant cheaters: GET GOOD GET MEMEBOX (yes they censored the actual word, probably afraid of bad reviews) spam, coming from heavies hitting every bullet while jumping in the air. This is still a thing. A sniper doing 5 headshot kills in 5 seconds. This is also a thing. These are the obvious ones that VAC can't even detect. Then there's the pyros with auto deflect scripts, aim assist snipers, aim assist spies, etc. Of course these are way harder to spot, but they exist. Valve never figured out that they can check Heavy accuracy and flag suspicious players, or snipers by monitoring damage output.\n\n\nBad management and support from Valve: The recent past has shown several weapon stat changes that are utterly dumb. The phlog user was made invincible, the babyface blaster was rendered worthless, afterburn immunity of the demoknight shields completely void, ... The priorities are clearly on minimum effort and maximum profit. While this is a noble corporate strategy, it is, again, utterly dumb on the long run. Want to make or edit a map? Too bad, only an ancient version of Hammer still "works", the rest has been completely broken since the Steam Pipeline update from a couple years ago. This is particularly funny because Valve completely relies on community items and maps nowadays. Want to trade items? Too bad, you have to install bloatware on your phone, otherwise you get to wait 7 days. Thank you children who can't tell that www.totallynotakeylogger.♥♥♥/♥♥♥♥♥softcummunity isn't a legit link and that nobody is ever going to give you free items if you click that URL.\n\nCancerous community: Memeface spammers, micspammers, cheaters, children who can't read the age restrictions and insist on using their mic, rich upper middle class kids looking down on new "F2P" players and downright bullying them, tryhards ruining everybody's fun by playing with a permanent medic in their pooper, a lot of people valuing collecting hats higher than playing the actual game, ...\n\n\nSummary: Not recommended for anyone. The game is beyond broken with an increasingly bad community and no improvements in sight.","February 20","false","756.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","9","11","3","0"

TF2 is no longer the unique, team-based game it used to be. It has been narrowed down to an unfair, unbalanced mess of "who has the shiniest pink hats on trade_minecraft," "how fast can you get kicked from every valve server because some stupid kids think it's their private achievement server." and "how to get outskilled by someone using a more broken, overpowered weapon/class." Team Fortress 2 also hosts one of the nastiest communities to date, right below Garry's Mod and DayZ. I guarentee you, every server you join, you will be greeted by several bronies and furries spamming lenny faces, stupid Shrek memes, and pootis. If you like getting penalized for simply playing the game, this is the one for you. If you're 10 and still think memes are funny, this is the one for you. If you like having an overall bad time, this is the one for you. Team Fortress 2 also suffers from a severe lack of content updates. Every few months that go by, they will add more cosmetics and taunts to ruin the game and community even further. They DO NOT add balanced maps or weapons. They DO NOT balance the current game mechanics such as pellet/damage spread and random crits. They DO NOT Penalize those who are literally unable to play the game at an acceptable level. For example, if you get a team full of idiots who installed Steam the previous day, they get to stay with their 300-700 ping, slimeball community avatars, and inability to speak English in English servers. They will also vote kick you. Usually selecting the "No reason given" option, for they cannot speak English. Overall, if you are really looking forward to making your day a bad one, play the steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥ that is Team Fortress 2.","February 13, 2015","false","593.7"," 136 of 250 people (54%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","54","136","250","20","39"

Valve has worked on this game with additions and fixes since its launch, so it has undergone a lot of changes, and it barely resembles what it was when it first launched.\n\nIf you get into it now, sadly you're probably going to have a hard time understanding what's going on under all that cluster♥♥♥♥ of weapons, hats and whatnot, but even though it became such a chaotic mess, Team Fortress 2 remains my favorite Team-based FPS of all time.\n\nYou have lots of options with every class thanks to the sheer number of weapons available to them. Each one is balanced and focused on a specific role, so you're bound to find one that fits your gameplay preferences like a glove.\n\nDon't like being an useless sniper who stands way back, away from the action? Fine, get up close and go with a bow.\n\nYour team needs a strong offense in order to fend off enemy attacks, and you're playing as a Medic? Switch from the normal Medigun which confers limited invincibility to a Kritzkrieg for guaranteed crits, no problem.\n\nAre you so pro with your aim that you feel disgusted using the stock Rocket Launcher as a Soldier or Grenade Launcher as a Demoman? No problemo, use the Direct Hit or Loch'n'Load to show off your mad skillz and deal more damage as a result of your prowess.\n\nDo you love being a soldier, but feel a glorious desire to help your team with temporary buffs? Okay, give up your shotgun and go with a Buff Banner, Concheror or Battalion's Backup so you can help everyone push with increased damage, increased speed or increased defense, depending on your equipment of choice.\n\nThere are a lot of options available to you. It's simply amazing what this game offers. Plus, since it became F2P, there is no reason not to try it. Get it now!","November 29, 2013","true","303.7"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","3"

The hats are actually great to use.\n\n\n\nBlame the people who don't recommend the game. I recommend it because it's useful for everything. and it's like Worms, (because in worms, you wear hats too) That's why.\n\n\n\nIt's also amazing how much the Game got popular.\n\n\nObviously. It's the most amazing game in the world. You now shoot babies and show them, who is crying.","June 5, 2014","true","261.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onyxxgaming/recommended/440/","onyxxgaming","Raiden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onyxxgaming/","18 products in account","The fact that this game has completely been overrun by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hats and other pointless cosmetic items is the main reason I stopped playing this game and switched over to CS:GO, I plan on listing the big reasons why this game has gone to complete and utter ♥♥♥♥,\n\nReason 1: Too many cosmetics, not enough weapons\nThis is pretty self explanatory, The fact that the amount of cosmetics compared to weapons is too damn high, 220 weapons compared to 1209 "according to sources on Reddit, dear god no", Therefore, if we do some handy dandy math from the ♥♥♥♥ing fourth grade, we can discover with a calculator *because who the ♥♥♥♥ does long division anymore?* that the ratio between the hats and the weapons are 5 hats per 1 weapon, Maybe even more,\n\nReason 2: Laziness\nI say this due to the fact that Valve seems to have a hard time coming up with new weapons for the game, but they have an AMAZING time coming up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics that no one likes anymore at this point *Unless your a trading scumbag that sits on the BG servers,* If they would simply look at the Community Workshop, they would have so many new weapons, it would be insane, The ratio I mentioned above would turn to 30 weapons for every 5 hats. I mean, seriously valve, We have ALL OF THIS CONTENT right here, so why not ♥♥♥♥ing make use of it?\n\nReason 3: Cancerous Community\nThe TF2 Community is like 9gag and Reddit had a baby, They use overused memes, etc etc, Also, The big reason that 65% of all players spam the Lenny Face, and other variants is simply another reason to hate the game, The people are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I'm completely fine with F2P's As I think they are good traffic for the game, so long as the Sniper Mains dont come and ruin their fun\n\nReason 4: Certain Weapons.\nThis one is a simple one, Some weapons/Classes need a big nerf, Some weapons/classes need a big buff, Some classes like Scout, Sniper, Spy, And even the Medic need a nerf. With the Medic, he only needs a slight nerf to his crit chance on his melee, Sniper's need to get the Huntsman nerfed, and need to get all of their melees nerfed to the point where you cant run around and get 18 crits in a row "Yes, I have gotten 18 crits in a row with the Tribalmans Shiv". Scouts need a nerf to their double jumping, as I see Scouts abusing the Double-Jump using the terrain or other forms to constantly be jumping around their target to the point where they are untouchable. This issue is enormous, and if it isnt dealt with, It may just break this game permanently, Next I move onto the Spy, The Spy's backstab hitboxes need a GIANT ♥♥♥ NERF, If they dont get that kind of nerf, cancerous Trickstabbers will come from the depths of Hell*Tower* and proceed to ruin the game for everyone\n\nReason 5:Traders and Overpay\nTraders and Overpay are a simple *lolno* trading tactic used by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who want to ♥♥♥♥ing get more then what they deserve, If you still dont get it, heres an example\n\nOne hat for Two hats and an additional Refined Metal,\nThe person is getting a large amount of profit from that trade. As even including the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "One weapon for two weapons," method, used by the BG Moderator Combustible Lemon, and probably many more traders that are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s\n\nReason 5: Budget Gaming servers,\n\nI'd probably say something, but I'm slightly afraid that Jamesderf is gonna come along and try to report me for putting constructive criticism on his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers and trying to get me VAC Banned.\n\nHope you had a fun ride, you fantastic little ♥♥♥♥♥icles","January 14","false","545.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","11"
