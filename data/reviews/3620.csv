I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes puzzle games or anyone who likes casual games; because Zuma is one of those games that you play in order to relax after work or school.\n\nIf there were any complaints that I have about the game it would have to be the bosses. The problem with the bosses is the fact that you can't lose any lives when fighting them so, because of that; there really is no fear in losing all your lives and starting from your last check point. In turn this is also be a good thing so, that you really don't need to stress when fighting them.\n\nBut other than that, it's a great game and for the price, it's entirely worth it! Many diffrent levels to play, cool powerups, and relaxing gameplay, makes this a good buy!","December 7, 2014","true","17.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

On one hand, you could get lucky with Plants Vs. Zombies or Peggle. But, on the other, you could be playing Zuma's Revenge. Before continuing, I would like to note that this review is coming from solely playing the adventure mode. Zuma's Revenge's adventure mode has you playing as a frog on an island, making your way through on your adventure.\n\nThe gameplay seems to be simple, Zuma having a color ball and having to match three or more of the same color of ball on the track before the balls reach a certain point to which you have to restart the round. On paper, this seems quite simple but the game needs polish as it becomes frustrating when the game solely relies on luck to win the round. The music to the game is simple but, unfortunately, lacking. The same song always plays, allowing for no diversity and not giving the player any reason to keep listening.\n\nIn adventure mode, the frog most fight bosses but it doesn't feel like there are any at all. For the most part, the bosses are simple, the only boss which is noticable is the last one because of it's three-stage gauntlet.\n\nTo wrap up, Zuma's Revenge seems to be attempting to ride on the success of Peggle, a game which came out two years prior. However, where Peggle is both skill intensive and luck intensive, Zuma's Revenge simply relies on luck to get through. I did put in almost eight hours playing this game but that wasn't because I was having fun, that's because luck wasn't on my side. When the right set-up and power-ups came up, I was able to finally get past a stage that troubled me, no skill involved. If you have the money and would like to play a mindless game, buy Peggle instead.","July 9, 2015","false","7.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","1"

It's quite obvious that chance alone can't explain why it leans so heavily toward feeding you balls that will do nothing but force you to push the line closer to the failure point. Skilled "twitch" gamers can probably get around it pretty easily, but later levels are going to be pretty much impossible for a fairly large segment of the population. I'm not opposed to "twitch" games in general, but this is marketed as "casual".

The game is brightly colored, easy to learn, but occasionally quite challenging.  The sound design and tropical theme work very well together and none of the effects used become to grating or repetitious.  There is a main puzzle campaign as well as other challenge modes that can be unlocked, as well as a final boss for each stage of the story mode.  Altogether I would recommend this game to any of my friends who like casual puzzle games, as this title has both the gameplay and polish necessary to deliver hours of entertainment.","July 18, 2012","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The premise has a line of multi-colored marbles inching their way along a pre-defined path towards an ultimate drop-dead point and you have to shoot similar colored marbles at the line in order to create matches of at least three marbles.  Different bonuses will allow greater control over the advancing line, but the real progress comes from simply being dextrous enough to notice the matches and quickly fire accurately.  The game is relatively stress free until the final levels when the game starts throwing interlocking looped paths which block your ability to manipulate the entire line and forcing you to act quick and precise to keep things managable.  At certain points the game changes and you face off against different "boss" characters which employ subtle variations to the game techniques.  The experience prooves to be very satisfying and quite rewarding.","September 12, 2011","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very tough to do... I've still only gotten up to level 5.\n\nFinally , "Challenge mode" has you try and complete several series of levels in different difficulty levels. It's fun until you reach the last and hardest level of difficulty, because you have to have unlocked them in "Iron Frog" before you can play it here.
