Yes its in the title. Yes the character models and things are there and people are getting annoyed because its missing some key aspects of the series.\n\nBut im going to cut that out and focus on the gameplay, mechanics and the pros and cons of it being currently in its Early Access state. Ive played going on 5 hours straight of matches while taking in the things I saw to help clear up any uncertainties people may have. (Be gentle its my first review and it's long)\n\nLets begin with the PROS that I found were good.\n\n+Movement. It responds well. Decent running and movement animation. Even the action animations are solid. No bugs personally seen yet there\n\n+Firefights are tricky in a good way since you cannot shoot through your own teammates and friendly grenades can kill you\n\n+The look and feel of the game is pleasant and easy on the eyes. Yes people complain about the engine its on but its really quite decent.\n\n+There is a market where you can spend in game currency (not NXcoins) to buy attachments, guns and other things. But so far, the things I can unlock through play are equal if not better than the things I can buy. Not to mention a laser accessory that I could unlock is 9900 GP to buy compared to a 44000 market one.\n\n+As for weapons, each one has its prime situation. Yes the sniper is OP in damage. Yes the AR is better at medium range. Yes the SMG is lighter and allows you to be more agile. Every weapon has a field it excels in and overall its balanced decently well. "Oh man this is so stupid. To get a better weapon I need to spend 200k GP. What a piece of BS". Again, no you dont. You -can- buy it if you want to but the first weapon you unlock is a MP5 or whatever and its pretty decent boosting pretty much all stats less some damage(barely) and effective range from the starter. Pfff, who needs range on a high ROF close range SMG.\n\n+Community. So far every room I have had the pleasure of joining has been nice, friendly and all around enjoyable. Well except for the one guy who apparently was getting away with his bad internet and one guy always seemed to be on the receiving end aha.\n\n+Leveling and Currency. Now I'm not sure if it will stay like this but currently, as you level you get 50k GP to spend on things. "Wow! Thats a lot!” Why yes little Timmy it is. Seeing as you can get 500GP per loss up to 1000 on a win. Not that slow I'll say that much. You can level pretty fast as well. Of course getting more wins than losses speeds it up but I like to think with my current play time and level, I managed to average a little over a level in about an hour\n\nPRO/CON\n\n+-I personally like the skill system. But I’ll put this as a PRO/CON since it comes up a lot in other discussions. At the beginning of a match you automatically start with your tier 1 skill (200points). As you get kills/assists/do game mode objectives, you get points that refill that gauge to a max of 400 points for the tier 2 level of the skill\n\nThere are added benefits to saving up to tier 2 and not using your skill every time you can. FYI your skill has a cooldown meter to limit fast consecutive uses if you are on a bloody, messy, mass murdering killing spree. But during that time you may obtain points towards your next skill use. So its not all that bad. Even more reason to save up those precious points\n\nI can see how people dislike it if your team is getting completely steam rolled and its hard to fill. But you automatically regen skill points until your skill bar reaches tier 1. Albeit slow, but its something.\n\n+-Hitboxes. Ah yes, the double edged sword. I like to think that its both, in its current state, helpful and frustrating. I also believe its not just the hitbox but the weapon firing as well that is also a contributing factor. More so the former though. Many times have I tried to gun down someone running up some stairs at me to have him take 25%-50% damage to only knife me in the animated melee kill. But also to run down a hallway away from 3 enemies firing auto weapons at me to get away and lead them unsuspectingly into a pod of my own team for the assists. As I said, it works both ways. Hoping it will get tweaked soon\n\n+-Mobile Agility AKA "Parkour". A little rough around the edges. You cant jump very high so you cant climb on top to many things to either get a vantage spot or cut corners. Granted at this stage its both good and bad. It currently in a way levels the field so everyone is even. There are prompts to press W+Space to "vault" over/up small ledges but some things I hoped were climbable were unfortunately not\n\n+- Healing. Now some people are unhappy that you can't regenerate or heal completely. Cough Cough CoD Players Cough Cough. Well they are right up to a certain point. Now this game is listed as a Tactical Shooter if im not mistaken. So if you were able to just wait for your wounds to heal (looks at certain types of players) then get right back at it, where's the tactics? The stress of not taking damage? The thrill when you kill 3 people alone and survive with 3 hp left to only to feel useless afterwards because you will die to a flesh wound or graze of a bullet. Well fear not.\n\nRemember how earlier above I mentioned Tier 2 abilities? Well some of those are shareable. "Shareable? How does that work?' Play the game yourself and figure it out. KIDDING. Some abilities once you reach tier 2 are able to be "Downloaded" by up to 3 other operatives. But how does this relate to healing you ask? Well one operatives has Nano Armor I believe its called or whatever. In short, it allows the user and 3 other operatives to gain increased armor and health regen during its duration at tier 2 or just the user at tier 1. I like to think of these operative as either support or tactical roles. Look, there's that word again, tactical. Tactics. Strategy.\n\nNow for the more unhappy part\n\nCONS\n\n- Matchmaking Balancing. I have gone into a match or two where it started as 5v2 and was really one sided. Granted players were matched onto the other team to balance it out, but not until the game was half over with a 20 kill lead. Thats something else I would hope gets fixed pretty soon.\n\n- Glitches(not in game). Some people, myself including, who got one of the early access packs with a character unlock have not/ did not get our free character unlocks at lvl 3 and lvl 5. Currently I have a ticket with this problem sent and am waiting for a response, but will update this if possible with an answer to it. (Edit - Recieved)\n\n-Only a few map types. In Team Deathmatch at least, there are only 3 maps. With the right strategy and team cooperation, either side of a maps starting point can be a winner. Some are less advantaged as others but can be sorted out if you push far enough to rotate the respawn points of the enemy team around. Which also brings me to another CON\n\n-Spawning. I wont lie, I have taken advantage of this. Every once and a while ill go off out of a firefight to flank in from behind the enemy to only end up at their current respawn spot to get a few easy respawn kills before they realize it. Im not proud of it, just extorting this unfortunate algorithm of respawning in an area with enemies around. As I mentioned above the respawn point will move once too many get too close. But one, maybe even two people get there, then they get a few free kills before it realizes and moves.\n\nHonestly, I really do enjoy playing this game and I really like the concept, structure and form this game has. Sure its still a bit bare bones and what not. Its early access, give it a bit of a break. Things will be worked on, added, fixed, adjusted and tinkered with as it grows.\n\nBut if you read all of this or even just took the time to skim it and pick out the certain things you wanted to know, thank you for your time.\n\nOverall Score - 8/10","December 19, 2015","true","11.9"," 502 of 533 people (94%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","94","502","533","36","30"

Sure.\nWill I still be playing it six months from now? Maybe.\nAs with any game on the market, do your own research before dropping any serious money on it.\n\nPros:\n-Ability System - I like the character abilities and the focus on team-play that results from having a good spread of abilities on the team.\n-Original English VAs - Might seem like something minor in most games, but it shows dedication to be true to the source material to get the voice actors from the series to work on lines for the game.\n-Teamplay Oriented - Not much to say here. If you pick your characters to have a balanced spread of abilities and play to their advantage, then you'll be much more successful.\n-Interesting Approach to Advancement - Unlocking more mod slots as you play and having post-game drops that degrade over time but allow you to enhance your characters.\n\nCons:\n-Therm-optic stealth isn't a blanket ability that everyone can use. - It would be much more interesting if the Major could hack -and- control enemy Think Tanks instead of being the only character able to cloak.\n- Can't Cook Grenades - You can pull the pin and hold it forever, it still won't effect how long it takes to explode after tossing it.\n-Character Stacking - Anyone who has ever played TF2 can attest, having a team full of snipers is never a good sign. Having a team of eight people all playing the same character with the same ability isn't any better.\n-Map Size - Not all of the maps suffer from this, but TDM levels are especially cramped.\n-Useable Space - Some of the maps are of a decent size, however the usable area is very -very- flat. Sure there are sniper rifles in the game but good luck finding a decent vantage point to make good use of them.\n-Spawn Protection - TDM is the main culplrit here, if you have enough people with cybersentries on your team you can lockdown a spawnroom and turn it into free kills until the game is over.\n-Freedom of Movement - The contextual movement system is alright, but when you can't go up a ladder because you were jumping and have to land then look up before climbing the ladder it just slows everything down.\n-Togusa doesn't have a Mateba.","December 14, 2015","true","2.8"," 342 of 387 people (88%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","88","342","387","45","30"

I'm going to tell you exactly why you should do so.\n\nFirst Assault Online is mediocre at best, as an FPS.\nSOME CONS:-Small maps\n-Spawnpoints that will drive you absolutely insane with frustration\n-Weapons are all boring and feel the same as in any other FPS shooter\n-Starting pistol is basically useless\n-Melee is borderline broken at the moment\n-Teamwork unfortunately doesn't come into play as much as it should\n-In a desperate need for autobalance\n-Visually doesn't look that great either\n-Menu is as big of a mess as it was in "Counter-Strike: Nexon" but you get used to it so I'm pretty much nitpicking\n- You start with 3 primary weapons, THREE! and unlocking more takes a lot of time. 1 secondary pistol\n- Controls are clunky, aiming and moving around can be pretty painful\n\nPersonal suggestion to the Developers: Maps all look and feel quite the same, would be nice to see some diversity like the Yakuza hideout from "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence" bringing some different colour and feel to it\n\nI'm not going to entirely bash the game though, there are some pros to it.- You pick one character you play with from a pretty decent roster of characters and each character has unique abilities\n- Original english voice actors for characters\n- Huge variety of different weapon customizations\n- Game stays true to the franchise\n- You can switch servers whenever you want and however many times you want, you're not charged for doing so either. Which cannot be taken for granted within videogames these days.\n- I know I previously bashed Teamplay for not really coming into play but if the devs polish it a little, it can be great\n\nIf you're a fan of Ghost in the Shell series you might enjoy this,\nor a casual gamer who enjoys playing FPS games such as Call of Duty.\n\nIf you're not really into either of those, I recommend you wait it out until the game is in a better condition or until it gets out of Early Access and becomes completely free.\n\nThis makes me really, REALLY sad because I wanted to recommend this. It has a lot of potential so please don't give up on it, I'm sure the developers will fix some issues and it will become worth that five dollars it costs.","December 14, 2015","false","6.7"," 392 of 500 people (78%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","78","392","500","13","46"

There's tons of other cyberpunk games with more in depth single player gameplay, try Deus Ex or System Shock if you want something like that. I'm just happy Ghost in the Shell finally got a good game, and it's pretty addicting to go with it. They really went all out with the weapon customization, and it is the best I've seen in a game since MGS4. Everything you pay for with in game currency or real money has a trade off, a straight stat nerf and buff that you can instantly feel and see. Nothing is a straight upgrade, this is such a fair system and I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ people are calling it pay to win when its not. $3 is a fair price for an early access game and I really hope people dive in and give this a chance. My main complaint so far is the matchamking, and apparently the newest patch has reworked it to be faster with less players, I'll try to play more to keep you guys updated eventually.","December 14, 2015","true","18.8"," 246 of 309 people (80%) found this review helpful 220 people found this review funny","80","246","309","220","11"

I've not been a fan of most modern shooters with their abundance of guns, and toxic communities, as well as long respawns (in the games I've played at least).  This has been a nice breath of fresh air, for me at least.\n\nIf you have $5, pick this up and have some fun, or wait until it's F2P and join us then, it's well worth your time and 45 minutes worth of work*  (assuming you make minimum wage in the US?).\n\n\nEDIT:  There is a CS style AWP type weapon - It's the .50 cal with the damage enhancing barrel.  It only has 4 mags though, and with such a low TTK, it's easy to get killed with, a skilled sniper can still make use of it though.  I think It should be made bolt-action for fairness, however it should not be nerfed damage wise.  It wouldn't make sense for a .50 cal round to only wound someone.","December 27, 2015","true","24.3"," 114 of 138 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","114","138","7","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinfulfayt/recommended/369200/","sinfulfayt","Berkano","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinfulfayt/","769 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game at the moment isn't the best, but it also isn't the worst, like some other games I've seen on Steam.\n\nThe current state of the game right now is pretty lackluster, seeing as how there are only 3-4 game modes available. There doesn't seem to be a story as far as I'm aware, but the recent patch notes are saying that they will implement them, so that's something to look forward to!\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, it's pretty fun! It's a bunch of mindless shooting in some areas, but it seems that as you start playing the objective-based game modes, there would be a lot of strategy involved. Some characters seem to work better in capturing objectives, some better at defending, and some doing their best in Deathmatch.\n\nOne thing I'm not enjoying however, is the character skill and weapons. The weapons are incredibly bland, and it takes a godly amount of effort in order to unlock newer equipment, not to mention that you get roughly ~700 GP per game, and unlocking a character costs a whopping 50,000 GP. But that's not my main issue; my main issue here is that some characters are almost broken compared to others. For example, look at Maven. She's pretty useless right now, sure you could say she's great at defense, but there's no denying that she's pretty garbage compared to other characters. That cyber sentry is disgusting, it almost instantaneously kills enemies, and takes 20 years to take down.\n\nBut that's not to say the gameplay elements are bad! This game includes something called Skill Syncing, if you get your character's skill to level 2 in the middle of the game, activating it will allow you to share it with your teammates! Granting them the skills that their character otherwise wouldn't be able to use. From sharing sprinting, to invisibility, this is a very unique aspect of the game, that can win fights, or lose them depending on how you use it!\n\nGraphic wise, it's pretty great! There's a bunch of detail added in the game that makes it look amazing, and it runs very smoothly on my average PC. Although sometimes the environments may look pretty similar, making it hard to navigate around early on.\n\nMoving on to the game modes,\n\nDEATHMATCH:\nThis is your generic "kill everybody as fast as you can" game mode, with the goal of having 100 kills before the enemy. Not much to say here other than it gets boring quickly if you'd rather play the objective based missions.\n\nDEMOLITION:\nYour basic plant the C4 at the bomb site, defend it, defuse it, or wipe out the enemy team before they can even try. Obviously since this game has multiple game modes, it won't be the most refined game mode. I'd play CS:GO over this game mode anyday, but having this here doesn't hurt. I find that I play this game mode the least, but I still have fun regardless.\n\nTERMINAL CONQUEST:\nNow this is where the real fun starts. This game mode is basically King of the Hill, except the hill keeps moving, and every time you capture it, you get a Think Tank on your side, which is pretty much invulnerable until somebody on the enemy team hacks it and takes it down. This game mode is great in my opinion, because you can easily come back from a losing side if you don't blindly run into the fight. However, an issue that I have here is that the cyber sentries are especially broken in this game mode. Plant one down right beside the terminal, and guess what? Nobody can kill you, get a full team of them? You've just won the game.\n\nNow obviously this is an early access game, so I appreciate the game a bit more for what it is right now. But there are a lot of places to improve on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/luyao795/recommended/369200/","luyao795","CycloneInAmes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/luyao795/","1090 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOverview:A very interesting and addictive shooter. This ain't CS:GO, this ain't CoD, this is Ghost in the Shell. Probably you can feel the game better if you have watched the related anime. I haven't, but that does not affect me to enjoy the game. One thing I would like to point out is that the recoil pattern (if ever existed) is not as regular as CS:GO or CoD so spray and pray is not the right way to fire unless the enemy is 3 meters away from you. Snipers are weird mainly because the sensitivity for zooming in and zooming out are different, which may take some time to familiarize.\nPayment System:So far as Early Access, NOT P2W AT ALL. All weapons, attachments and characters can be and can ONLY be obtained by spending non-cash in game points which you can earn by simply playing games. What can be purchased using cash? I don't know, because it is totally unnecessary.\nMatchmaking System:Despite that there are not a huge amount of players playing this game, you can still find a lobby in 4 seconds, whenever and wherever. Sometimes teams are not balanced, but as game goes on, more players will fill in.\nGame Modes:Lacks a lot. So far there are only 3 game modes. TDM, which we all know how it works; Demolition, which refers to Search & Destroy in CoD and CrossFire which is also the most classic mode in CS; Terminal Conquest, which is a variant of Domination from CoD. Differently, there are 5 terminals linearly on the map. The game begins with the third which is the middle terminal and whichever team has 3 more points than the other team or has 5 points wins.\nWeapons:Not so many. I'd say there are about 15-20 weapons in total. HOWEVER, you have to use the certain weapon if you want to unlock attachments for that weapon. And to be honest, there are a LOT OF attachments for weapons. Some of them can be purchased directly from in game shop, others you have to unlock them first by using the weapon and then purchase the unlocked attachment from your inventory. The order of attachment unlocking is fixed, meaning that you have to unlock the first attachment before unlocking the next. This is also the main reason why I'm still using my default MP5 after playing this game for 10 hours. THERE ARE STILL LOCKED ATTACHMENTS FOR MY MP5!\nCharacters:Like I said before, you need to unlock them using licenses purchased from in game shop using non-cash points. But if you are lucky enough, you can earn that license from daily login reward. There are several different characters, every single one of which has unique abilities, so pick the one you feel the most comfortable with. By using one character over time, you can progress the slot unlocking for that character and thus equip more chips onto that character.\nRewards:This would be a F2P game eventually so they did use some rewards to hook people up. Daily login reward is the most common one, whch does appear in this game. You can get different things in daily login reward, from GP (in game non-cash points), to EXP boosts, to GP boosts, and some other stuff. Don't look down upon those rewards. Yes I admit that most of time you will only get small bonuses from those rewards like 500GP or 10% EXP boost or 10% GP boost. But believe it or not, I used to get a 500% EXP boost for once and that thing helped me level up 3 times in 1 hour. All boost rewards from daily login reward last for 1 hour once you use it, so if you just want to play for 5 minutes and take a nap, don't use it until you have enough time to play the game.\nAfter each match you will be asked to pick one reward out of three. Totally random. It could be GP boost or EXP boost which applies to the current match, but the thing probably you really want the most is chips. So far chips can only be obtained from after match rewards. Another thing worth noting is that those chips are not "usable permanent". Of course if you earn one and don't use it then it will be permanent, but there is a duration for each chip, as long as you bind one chip to a character, you cannot take it out until the duration reaches 0 and it would be destroyed automatically. I didn't really calculate the wearing speed of chips but I would say that each chip can last for about 3 matches. And yes if you have multiple chips equipped, they will wear at the same time.\nCommunity:So far I have played this game for 10 hours and I didn't see many salty/toxic players in game. There are b**ches, but not so many. So if you want to enjoy the game, you can.\nFlaw:Optimization is always the big problem for F2P games, no exception for this one. This, of course, is not a problem at all if you are using a high-ended computer or laptop. But when you know that your laptop can run Black Ops 3 on 100FPS but only 50FPS for this game, you will sure know that there is something wrong.\nHint:Watch where your bullets go. Headshots do a ridiculous amount of damage. If you put an entire magazine into an enemy and he still killed you using one bullet, that's why. Aim for head, ALWAYS.\nConclusion:Like I said, overall a very interesting and addictive game. This may not be those games that you can play non-stop for several hours, but you just have to play it every day once you started. If you do not feel spending too much money for video games, check out this one and maybe Dirty Bomb (which already became semi-P2W since cases with better chance to get more powerful stuff can only be purchased with real money). You won't regret.\nUpdate [01/14/2016]:Finally, they added NX Points, a.k.a. cash currency. Yeehoo, P2W garbage! No, not really, look at what you can purchase with NX Points. Weapon skins, purely cosmetic; character skins, purely cosmetic; operative (just to say character in a fancy way) licenses, not cosmetic. Well, you don't really know which operative is the best, do ya?\nAlso, you can now obtain "super rare" after-match rewards. If you happen to get one, the capsule (or whatever you want to call those three things that contain after-metch rewards) will show in the middle of the screen and you need to click on it one more time. The one I got was a 500% EXP boost. Result? Levelled up after that game.\nAuto-balance system is now fully functional. Before each match this system will rearrange players in the lobby so that both teams have similar competence.\nBut also, the update screwed my graphic resolution up. I had to change the resolution to the native resolution of my screen, but then the game just crashed. But after restarting the game, resolution just showed correctly.\nAnother flaw? Oh yeah yeah, optimization. This update also made the optimization much worse. Severe frame drops happen every single minute. Maybe you think that I'm being picky, but I'm really not. My laptop can run Black Ops 3 much smoother (like, 100-120FPS) on highest graphic settings, but after I changed all graphic settings of this game to highest, I can only get like 40-70FPS. That does not mean that this game is unplayable, but think about severe frame drops when you are shooting an enemy, yeah, it's THAT annoying.\nLet's talk about something good. 3 new weapons has been added into in game shop. Again, GP purchase only. 1 new map has been added. Also, a new operative has been added into the game, with defense shield equipped.\nOverall, a pretty solid update.\nMysterious Update:Ping number was added into game, really nice. Also, the optimization is worse. I wonder how they made that.","January 4","true","20.4"," 60 of 68 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","60","68","8","1"

It contains many of the main characters from the Ghost in the Shell series. Your team is played by those characthers and the enemy team is called "The Enemy" and is a bunch of generic looking future soldiers. But thats just how you see the enemy team. For the enemy team its reversed and they are the characters from the Ghost in the Shell series and they see your team as "The Enemy". (3Sp00ky5Me but still pretty cool).\n\nThe game contains some deep weapon customisation thingy that is not fully avalible yet. (Looks promising tho)\n\nThere is also some leveling system and ingame points that you get for playing. Those points are used to buy stuff that you unlock. (You need to unlock the different characters too)\n\nAll characters have different skillz that they can use and even share with their teammates which is pretty neat ^^\n\nMy very first impression is that it seems to be fairly balanced for most part. (Sometimes I kick *** and other times im getting my *** kicked) Usually there is some kiddo that rages like "WTF!" or "OMG!" <-(Watch out for him)\n\nThe game is good tho and I hereby make a positive review for it.","December 14, 2015","true","9.0"," 80 of 111 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","80","111","7","14"

Sprinting, iron sights, class powers, with no health regen and no respawns (at least in some modes).\nGameplay wise it is very fun, its fast paced but still requires you to think about your actions. You cant just run around shooting like in CoD, you have to aim properly and use your powers effectively. Teamwork is also useful, although I dont believe there is mic support yet. A little odd since its a multiplayer FPS.\nGraphics aren't amazing, and yet it seem to have framerate issues. I'm playing on a GTX980 and I suffer from some frame drops now and then, even on medium. When you melee kill someone the frames plummet. Although this could be issues with their servers.\nThe market system seems pretty decent, you can unlock guns by playing or you can unlock guns by buying them with points. The point system actually works pretty well as getting points isnt all that difficult, so it doesn't feel like pay to win (at least not yet). You get 50k points a level, and about 1000 or so points per game,  and guns usually cost about 200k.\nSo far the only things you  have to pay money to unlock are skins, and if they keep it like that then this should prove to be a great game.\n\nPros:\n+Fun gameplay\n+Great price\n+Doesnt seem Pay to Win\n+Large number of classes to play as\n+Finding a game is quick, servers seem populated.\n+Gunplay is fun\nCons:\n-Servers seem a little laggy at times\n-Frame rate drops, especially with melee kills.\n-The menu UI isnt great, can be a little confusing\n-Cant set FOV\n-You cant test guns before you buy them. This is annoying since getting a new gun takes about an hour or 2 and buying one then finding out you dont like it really sucks.\n-I don't really like the pistols, not sure what it is but they just seem clunky compared to the other weapons.\n\nOther notes:\nSo far there isn't a lot of variety in terms of weapons, theres about 10 I think. Obviously I expect this to change over time.\nOnly 3 maps, maybe more that I havent seen yet, but as with the guns I expect this to change over time\nI don't know anything about ghost in the shell and after playing this I still don't know anything, very little ghost in the shell related content (At least as far as I can tell).\n\nOverall I'd say its definitely a fun game, especially for the $3 I paid for it. Once it becomes F2P I'd definitely recommend downloading it. For $5 its still really good.

Pay model is what we all feared. Nexon junk as usual. Nothing to see here people. Move along. This is a cash grab for fanboys. No one even remotely involved with nexon should ever have acquired a license for GITS. Gameplay has not been polished even after months. Feels clunkier than the original Counter Strike. Hackers are now starting to make the scene and it has effectively made the clunky feel even more frustrating from the unstoppable onslaught of aimbots. Nexon has its own anti-cheat system that was designed by script kiddies. So they are also to blame for the cheaters. I feel bad for the developers themselves. I'm sure some of them geniunely wanted to create a good game. But it just isnt. The maps are too small. The weapons feel so unpolished it ruins the game. They are like air pistols they have no weight. Nothing to seperate them from any other gun in the game. The textures need some work. The models are okay. The atmosphere is interesting. But the game itself is just boring. It needs more work for it to be notable.\n\n\nOld stuff:\n\n\nUPDATED: Devs sent a message and asked me to look into "Dirty Bomb" as an example. Which I'm assuming means this is the model they want to implement. Unfortunately, that's close to what I'm afraid of. It's a grind, that gets boring after a short time. But it's a step in the right direction from what I've seen in the past. And because they were nice enough to be doing damage control with their ratings I figured I'll be fair and put out ALL of my thoughts and see what their response is. Besides I ENJOY THE GAME, even as it stands, barebones and all. But I have fears that I do not want to see come to fruition.\n\nLet's be real. Everyone is worried about what the pay model will turn out to be in GitSFA. I feel Nexon's pressure on it and their ability to ruin it at any moment is a possibility. We've seen the greed before and the moment Nexon was announced to be on board I'm sure fans of GitS winced just a little bit and cried themselves to sleep that night while listening to Inner Universe.\n\nI believe the best policy at this point is transparency. They've had what looks to be solid sales as of 12/15/2015. But I'm not fully onboard. That 30 buck package is gnawing at me. 1 character skin, a few weapon skins for the base guns, some in game currency and 'licenses' for the character unlocks. If that is how high they are going to price this stuff when its released. I'm out. And will leave this review up for good. That pricing is what I call a cash grab. Lower quantity of sales, high priced, Grab'n'Go, screw the players. We've all seen it. A potential game turned to crap because they focused more on gain than building a stable paying community through a good polished game.\n\nMost people (kids, I'm not talking to you) are willing to spend money on a F2P game they enjoy. There is money to be made here for sure. This game feels like a heavily unpolished Counter Strike and Call of Duty 4 hybrid at the moment, which is a good thing, its got loads of potential. There is plenty that needs to be worked on. I find I'm leading my bullets at a target 2 meters away. Movement feels sluggish, probably to compensate for map size. Various bugs. More variety of weapons will be needed. More variety of game modes will be needed. Mary McGlynn will probably need to be called to do a few more vocals for the in-game commands. Which we're gunna need more of by the way!\n\nDespite all of this, I find myself enjoying the game. Its fun. Teamplay is there waiting to be polished and put to use in bigger maps and more game modes. Progression isnt too slow and doesnt feel like a massive grind, yet. But for the life of me I can't recommend it. There's too little information of what the plans are for the game. As new information becomes available I'll change this I'm sure.","December 14, 2015","false","6.8"," 67 of 96 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","67","96","2","10"

Depending on what you chose you get diffrent extra bonuses.\n\nTeam buffers.\nThere is camouflage, Health regen, Wallhack vision (not that op as it sounds) and super sprint.\nFirst step on the meter only buffs yourself, but if you fill it 3 team mates can tune in on your skill.\n\nThe self buffers.\nSeeker drones, Point defense drone, Invisibility wall (when you stand behind it) and Missile launcher.\nFirst stage for Seeker drones just send out one drone, when its fully filled you get 2 drones.\nPoint defense drone just gets stronger when it hits the 2nd stage, but its really tanky.\nThe Invis wall can be placed almost anywhere, and is up for a couple of minutes and it slows down bullets, when its filled it just lasts longer.\nThe missile launcher shoots 1 missile, 2nd stage shoots 2.\n\n\nall good so far, but the game has some minor and bugs, it is early access afterall.\nBut its still pretty a solid game.

It's pretty cheap ($5), so give it a try if you're curious.\n\nFirst of all, if you're looking at this and expecting something like Deus Ex, steer clear. This is a lobby-based multiplayer FPS with a Ghost in the Shell theme.\n\nGunplay is pretty simplistic and while I feel that the overall game balance is still on the fence, it's still easy enough if you've had any experience with modern online shooters at all. You can play as different members of Section 9, but playstyles don't differ too drastically amongst them, as the only differentiating factor are their skills, from cloaking to arm rocket launchers and everything in between.\n\nOn to the business model. This game will be free-to-play once it's out of Early Access. In-game GP is used to buy weapons and attachments for permanent durations, and are only obtainable with in-game currency. Real-life currency only gets you cosmetic skins and operative licenses, which are used to obtain additional operatives; the licenses can also be purchased with in-game currency, and you can get up to three free licenses in the early levels. The starting equipment you get are very competitive and are on par with GP-purchaseable weapons.\n\nAt this point in time, game performance isn't the best for everyone. Personally, the game runs fine for me; for reference, I'm running an i7-4790k, 16GB RAM, and a GTX 770 2GB with the game installed on an SSD, and I'm getting 90-150+ frames per second at 1080p. Netcode can also use some improvements as well. In general, performance has been a mixed bag for some people, so your mileage may vary.\n\nUpdates are fairly frequent and I personally feel that development's been going at a decent pace. The CMs/GMs do engage the community often, and do weekly livestreams and events as well. As for the community, it's overall not too shabby. Time will tell how things go once the game is received by a wider audience, though.\n\nGive it a shot and see if you like it.","April 28","true","172.9"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","37","47","2","0"

Skills also seem to be quite balanced for an early access, excepting Borma's nanogel, which, in fact, has been proven to greatly boost the k/d ratio of most players, compared other Operatives/Skills.\n\nNegative aspects are, in a themed game like this, things like little outdated graphics/dx9, dull maps and map objects, which grant the feeling we are fighting in a simulated environment (aka lack of immersion), plus:\n- Guns and mods are very generic and barely related to the series. Poor gun customization via mods: For each gun there is basically only one way you should be taking\n- Explosion sound effects could be -way- better (nades+arm launcher)\n- Game mods (TD, Capture Terminal, Demolition) don't add any originality to the gameplay itself. Taking into account how many attractive game mods you could have figured out by watching GitS SaC series, you are missing an great opportunity to give this game its own -very strong- identity\n- Operative modifications break so fast, I don't even bother with them anymore\n- Netcode rewards higher pings a lot\n- Server triggered stutters might occur when a player gets killed, leaves or joins mid game\n- Proprotionally big amount of whiteknights and pubbie's testosterone spread within the (very small) community might lead to frustration when trying to constructively criticize, which further shows us how prevalent the generic FPS part of the game is against the the very little portion of GitS we get. See the first sentence of this review\n- Last but not least: Nexon has a working shop in the early access stage, which in my book is and will always be a shameless move\n\n\nThings I would consider if I was in charge:\n\n- Giving the game environment the cyberpunk touch it deserves\n- Adding and reworking map objects in order to deliver the feeling we are actually in a damn postwar,  yet still overpopulated scenario (ideas like some random, but somehow still related events within the battle come to my mind, which may or may not influence the encounters; destroyable objects which might cause harm to players or even serve them as improvised cover; random civs spawns; more+better background sounds and so on)\n- Bigger maps with different ways to sucessfully accomplshing the goals by having one or several strategy options in order for the game to become a little more tactical, without throwing the fast pace style through the window (GitS combat is extremely tactical)\n- Option to play matches which include friendly fire for tactical reasons. See above\n- GitS Serie Guns\n- Enemy visuals in some cases could get a touch. There are many neat looking elite units in the series, which would be great to look at while shooting them down; a cyborg wearing shorts on the other hand, leaves something to be desired\n- A suited mod for this game, which should have been in here since day 1, would be CTF in form of capure the intelligence/plutonium/uranium/prosthetic parts/etc. Either 2 teams 1 objective (neutral flag) or 2 teams and two objectives (red + blue flag)\n- In-door/out-door (dynamic) fights\n- Future low-priority PvE patch for die-hard GitS fans willing to see a bit more than some random black/red cyborgs\n\nedit: corrected some stuff\nedit2: corrected more stuff and added one more point\nedit3: one more point","February 14","true","134.9"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","25","29","0","4"

There are very few guns, few customization options, and few maps. But hey, it's an early access game; it's probably going to get a lot better. In any case, it's totally worth $4.99, or $6.99, or $8.99. I went for the $8.99 option because why not? (Crashes every once in a while, but that isn't really a big deal. A lot of games crash every once in a while.)\n\nBy the way, most players still don't know how to aim. If you can aim in this game, you're going to do very well. (Edit: They're learning, but it's slow. A lot of players don't even have a 1.00 KDR.)\n\nTips: If your opponent is far away, click fire. Don't hold down left mouse. If you find that a Seeker Drone is chasing you, run until an ally kills it. If you run out of ammo during an intense 1 on 1 firefight, switch to pistol. Don't use the M249 unless you're a masochist. Don't unlock anything until you find out which guns you prefer. (I made the mistake of unlocking everything for M249, and now I'm very broke.)\n\nIf you enjoy FPS games or Ghost in the Shell, you should get this. If you don't enjoy FPS games or Ghost in the Shell, don't get it. It's really that simple. (There's no story. If you play games for the story, don't bother with First Assault.)\n\nUpdate: I'm honestly kind of burned out after playing 80ish hours. The firing patterns used to be amusing, now they're just annoying. Guns and good attachments are absurdly expensive. Takes literally eternity to level up, and the 100k might as well be 1k. This game has serious balancing issues, as well as arbitrary team shuffling.","December 15, 2015","true","82.0"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","2"

Bear in mind that I'll change the review as the game changes.\nIt's a fun game that's worth $5. There are some issues that need to be addressed though.\n\nLikes Atmospheric\nSort-of Decent Shooter* (Elaborated further)\nBest girl Major Kusanagi\nCheap $5 game (and later free)\nPurchased in-game currency only unlocks skins, not upgrades.\n\nDislikes Movement has "wind-up" time*\nShotguns/SMGs a bit too dominant.\nPossibly bad netcode*\nBest girl Major Kusanagi is useless\nCertain maps with certain gamemodes (mainly TDM)\n\nShooting MechanicsThis game is a hero shooter with a splash of Counter Strike mechanics. It's an FPS that has a higher than average skill ceiling with abilities that focuses on the strength of the characters within the show to drive the background, flow, and flavor of the game. It's atmospheric, and I think there's a good ambiance to it.\n\nNow let's talk about the way it plays. Most headshots are 1 shot kills at all (if not most) ranges with most guns, and accuracy goes down the drain if you move while shooting, which encourages you to take your time and aim. Coordination with teammates' movements is vital to maximize FTW skill-syncs. Moving from a stationary position has an annoying wind-up time.\n\nHowever, because of the 1 shot head shot mechanic, and the fact that most maps can be narrowed into certain choke points with close quarters, SMGs (or high fire rate guns like SR-25) and shotguns dominate the game. Dojima and PSS9 have good flow that supersede the CQC focal point issue, but other maps do not, especially in game modes with respawns.\n\nI'm not going to berate the game for the fact that there are 2 good maps in 1 game mode (it's early access after all). I like the game, if not ambivalently. I'm having to down-vote because of the deeper contradicting mechanics that inherently clash with each other. At least, at the time of the review.\n\nThe Bad BitsYou can feel that the game WANTS to you be slow and methodical, but there are a few kinks in the game which makes being slow sub-optimal when faced with good players.\n\nSnipers are situational if not useless due to map design. And they're not 1 shot kills, which eliminates them as a weapon to threaten certain alleyways. A lack of the usefulness of a certain weapon doesn't necessarily detract from the game, but it does eliminate interesting inter-play dynamics for map control.\nShotguns and SMGs are murder in certain focal points of each map, which makes it disadvantageous to adopt a more precise play style. There are no solutions other than to grenade spam the locations in order to dislodge the advantageous camping points or to just rush in and hope for the best, both of which are very anemic in its effectiveness. Just like micromachine therapy.\nJust as how there's an annoying wind-up time for movement, there's also a wind-down time for movement, meaning that you can't immediately stop to aim and expect to hit your target. Hence, if you're moving it's incredibly RNG whether you hit your target.\nThis last point is more of a feeling rather than one based on play, so this one is possibly not true. I get the feeling that the lag compensation or possibly a lack of lag compensation makes hitting people feel "off". I've encountered this problem before with Counter Strike: Source back in its hayday. Essentially, it feels like people's hit boxes are slightly behind their avatar, which can lead them (and you) to be killed behind walls and missing your shots (especially if they have the sprint ability on). It also feels like my gun is trailing behind sometimes when I side strafe, but these problems are hard to address considering that there's a lot of variability when it comes to shooting.\n\nConclusion (TL;DR)It's a game that has good aspects and is dripping with atmosphere. It's very fair, but it feels confused on how they want you to actually play. It feels like a tactical shooter that wants to place you into the role of a member of Section 9, but in actuality it's not optimal to play that way. Not that a fast-paced shooter is a bad thing, but it doesn't do fast-paced shooting action well because lag compensation and controls aren't as tight as they should be along side of the flow of each map design. I want to like it, and on the surface it's pretty fun for the first 10 hours or if I play Demolition (which no one plays). However, there are some pretty big flaws, at least to me, that make it to where I can't enjoy the game as either a tactical shooter or a fast-paced shooter.","May 5","false","48.6"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","34","47","2","1"

With your host Fyrop. (This is the longest review I've written so far so here we GoOoOooo~ God have mercy).\n\nLet me start by saying the game itself runs really well even on my (to put it kindly) toaster of a computer. I’ve actually had very few issues with things like the framerate, stuttering, or lag. (I put this here because I forgot to mention it earlier and figured this would be a fine spot… Listen I put a decent amount of effort into this review just let it go).\n\nGhost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is a decent FPS, there isn't much for me to say here since it's so early in its development... I'm recommending it in this review because I have mutual feelings over it at the moment, and as usual somewhat skeptical of the game's future. Though I wouldn’t mark my feelings towards it as negative either simply because of the nature of early access games. (That being they can go either way and this games still right there in the middle). I have enjoyed what’s here quite a bit. This game at it’s core has a lot of potential, what’s here is fun; but there isn’t much of anything new and it definitely needs a lot of work before I say whether it’s worth your hard earned money or not. For this "Early-Access Review" Instead of just stating the pros and cons I'll state what it does differently from other FPS’s and what it’s lacking in.\n\nGhost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex has a somewhat unique system in which each character has their own special ability that has two tiers for different types of use (These varying from Invisibility; Player Detection, Sentry’s, and a few others (At the time of this review there are about six different characters with six (or maybe seven) different abilities to chose from). Essentially, there is a gage that fills up slowly over the course of a match, when it hits a certain point you may use your ability at tier 1. Tier 1 is a simple way of saying shorter use that’s only effective on oneself. If you wait long enough for the gage to fill most of the way up you’ll hit tier 2, which will be distributed to 3 nearby players. This gives you and your allies a tactical advantage if you decide to mix abilities, or simply overwhelm the enemy. The game sort of centers around these, and at the moment it's, the game’s most unique mechanic that seems to hold it together.\n\nThe game also has a perk system, three perk slots are available that allow you to equip bonuses to  a character to give them different advantages in the game, like faster reload time, more stamina, etc… There are also a few different types of game modes, I played team deathmatch the most and found the other (2 or 3) somewhat unbalanced and in need of tweaking...\n\nNow that, that’s been covered  this is where the game begins to run dry. The game has a fair amount of guns and gun customisation but it’s nothing new, it’s all pretty standard stuff we’ve seen in the FPS genre… This game is basically a re-skin of other FPS’s and though this isn’t bad it isn’t really good either and can do a lot more, though I won’t fault it yet because like I said… It’s early access. Hopefully the developers have a decent vision for this game…\n\nMy biggest fears for this game are as follow. Obviously I don’t want this to be another cash grab/pay to win… So far, all of it’s dlc are entirely cosmetic/earnable items in the game… There are no microtransactions… yet... I understand it’s necessary for a free game’s business model, I just want all of it’s dlc to remain nothing more than cosmetic. My other fear is that this game’s potential is not met. If this game were to become an ambitionless (pwn intended) shell of the FPS genre I’d be… well… VERY DISAPPOINTED. I have yet to see the Ghost in a Shell anime, but I do know a little bit of it’s story, and I know that there’s plenty of inspiration to be drawn from it. The creators have a very cool universe to work with, it would be a shame if this turned out to be a very bland FPS. (DEVELOPERS PLEASE WORK WITH YOUR SOURCE MATERIALS, USE YOUR BRAINS DAMMIT). But seriously this game should have story elements interwoven in its gameplay… The story is simply another easy piece of content that the creators should utilise. That’s all I have to say on that.\n\nThere are only... (At the time of writing this review) A small handful of maps. The game itself is definitely in need of polishing, many of the guns need further balancing, there should be more maps and game modes (And dear God please give it some story)… Overall this game is like a nearly blank canvas, it needs a lot more content before I can recognise it as a licensed game… So if you’re interested but hesitant, I don’t blame you, that’s a good way to approach early access games. Fortunately it’s a pretty inexpensive game to jump into the Beta and it’s definitely worth the base asking price of $5… but it will probably hit a free open beta so that’s also a valid option.\n\nAlright, that’s it guys, this is my review… or rather overview with opinions in the mix, hope this helps definitely check it out when it goes free to play if you have no intention of supporting it before checking it out, please keep in mind that this is probably not my best work as I was feeling ill at the time of writing it,  and thanks for reading.","December 16, 2015","true","22.3"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","31","43","0","0"

The only thing left that seems to need work is balancing. But even that is really sort of nit picky and only matters for a very small few.\n\nListen, I'm going to blunt because I don't see any way around it. This is a very standard Call of Duty styled and paced competitive shooter. Its exactly what you expect. It feels good. The guns kill people, different guns feel different, the maps have nice choke points that form organically through play. It works; You level up in overall level as well as for usage of specific weapons.\n\nAll the modes you've come to enjoy are present from your shoot all the things type deals to the objective based defend and attack modes. A sort of 1 death per round affair.\n\nThe community that has bought into early access is small but VERY active. After full release the company plans to make the game free-to-play.\n\nYou choose a class which has a specific skill attached to them. An odd but helpful thing is you are the only one to see your own avatar in game. The enemy team are all painted with the same skin however the players retain their specific loadout and ability.\n\nTHE GIST\nIf you want a free, well done relatively traditional competitive shooter. This is it. Its very comparable to a Blacklight Retribution but in all honestly this seems a bit more polished and the developers seem dedicated to this project. Obviously, upon full release or even a borked update that could all change but for the time being, this is a very inexpensive buy in for a decent shooter.

Definitely worth the $5 for early access.\nIt definitely needs some work, though.\n\nPros\nGunplay is solid - Guns have weight behind them, and the sound packs a punch.\nGuns are fairly balanced - Nothing jumps out as overpowered.\nInteresting skill system has some nice teamwork options - You can share your unique skill with your teammates, and combinations can turn the tide of a match.\nGameplay has a solid foundation - It's good. With more modes and variety, it can be great)\nGraphics are decent - Nothing to write home about. They do their job.\nOptimization seems alright. No frame drops for me so far.\nAussie servers!\n\nCons\nWeapon and map variety is low. (for now. Early access and all) - A few maps, and a few weapons. I like how there aren't 50 weapons of each type that fill the exact same role, though.\nSome inconsistency with damage - Sometimes I seem to die in 2 hits, while others I am hit with 10 rounds and am still standing.\nGame modes are unoriginal - TDM, DOM, DEM. Nothing unique at all. I hope some different modes are added in the future.\nEarly access - Personally, I dislike early access, and there are very few times I will purchase one. Exceptions are GiTS and Toxikk, because they are both games I think can be genuinely great, and will actually get content. Unlike most devs who put their game on early access, get a bunch of cash, then stop development.\n\nNeutral\nHardcore GiTS fans might not enjoy how it plays.\nAssault Rifles have seemingly 1HKO headshots from any range. Leading to very frustrating situations where an AR can outplay a sniper rifle across the map (with some luck)\nNo music - Sound plays an important part in the game, so this might not be a con for some people. But, when there's a gap in action, with no ambient music playing, it becomes really dull.\n\nAll in all, GiTS is an enjoyable game.\nI haven't been interested in many shooters for a while now, and Ghost in the Shell can fill that gap.\n\nIt has a solid gameplay and mechanic foundation (with its clever skill system), and if the game is continuously supported with new game modes, weapons and maps, it can become an excellent shooter.\n\nIf you're a hardcore Ghost in the Shell fan. Don't go into this expecting GiTS in video game form, just play it to have fun with a solid FPS.\n\nSpend $5 on this, or go and spend $60 on a Call of Duty game, and $15 on each ♥♥♥♥♥♥ map pack.\nPretty easy choice, in my opinion.\n","December 17, 2015","true","58.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","2"

Now allow me to explain why.\n\nIts already painfully obvious that the game will be taking a pay 2 win route. To start with, its a free to play shooter by Nexon, secondly, the starting weapons are already horrible, with accuracy so poor most firefights feel like a game of chance over actual skill, given the weaponry provided rarely hits where you're aiming, even when aiming down the sights...\n\nThe game also requires painfully long experience and money grinds to get your next weapons, you'll earn around 2000 credits per usual deathmatch, and even the next level of equipment requires somewhere around 60000 to purchase, ignoring the fact you also need to by attachments, some you're unable to buy until you've grinded enough matches to unlock 1 of the many weapons you're not allowed to use yet... if you've just started, and have bought the most basic of the starter packs, you'll be looking at the back of your first assault rifle for a -long- time.\n\nNext up, gameplay! The game is supposed to be a team-based shooter, gives you 1 of about 8 characters, each with their own unique power, such as being barely able to see enemies through walls, being able to run faster and jump higher so you can stab 1 guy while the rest of his team guns you down mid animation, a sentry that serves more as a bullet sponge than actual damage, and the list goes on. The shooting itself is fairly poor, with little to no recoil and the previously mentioned poor accuracy, where even aiming down the sights can't get your bullets to hit their target reliably...all you can do is point it at them and hope chance favours you.\n\nSo to sum up:\nIts a painfully grindy game that starts you off with weak weaponry, has a giant wall of xp/money to reach the next weapons, is by Nexon, a company notorious for its pay 2 win games, and with bog standard combat...yeah its not horrible, but it does nothing to stand out.\n\nIf you're interested in this game, save up and get CoD Black Ops 3, there is nothing this game does, that it hasn't already done better.","December 18, 2015","false","2.5"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","22","33","0","10"

This balance of open and closed spaces gives a dynamic sense of immersion into the world of Ghost in the Shell, and by the sounds of it, they actually managed to get the voice actors for the stand alone english dub, or at least very good impersonators.\n\nLike many other team based deathboxes, this game features a variety of weapons (albeit, only primary weapons can be purchased as of alpha) and also features unlockable mods.\n\nUnlike other games of this style, once you buy the weapons or mods, they are yours to keep and weapon mods are not set in stone.\n\nFor those looking to buy the early access booster packs, they do give you extra credits, but for those who don't: do not let this economic imbalance deter you. Upgrades and weapons have to be unlocked through grinding. Yes, even if you have the money, you have to earn the weapons. Adding to that, every level increase gives you a healthy sum of bonus credits (alpha: 50,000), so you can be sure to be able to afford weapons and mods as they become available (I haven't even used my booster credits and I have all but one weapon available to me, and a bunch of upgrades).\n\nWhether you win or lose a match, you get credits and xp, although more if you win; and at the end of each match, you get a luck draw for a booster item. Xp, credits or even character buffs.\n\nOn that note, character buffs. These are expendable and have a number of uses before they are depleted and can include things like faster strafing, faster reload, quicker sighting.","February 13","true","139.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

Smith","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978584835/","135 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSporting a rather oddball, yet intriguing combination of multiple shooters.\n\nPrimarily incporporating the nature from Counter-Strike, it does not forgive missed shots, it does not forgive getting shot at, and it most definetly does not forgive not handling your weapon build correct. TTK is generally slow, and headshots are very, very dangerous here too, but there is no HP regen.\n\nYet, ADS mechanics are brought in from the likes of Battlefield and Call Of Duty; Raycasting with spread and recoil values, but are much more violent by default, you cannot do more than 2-shot bursts outside ten-ish ingame meters or so, and tapfiring is absolutely necessiated if you wish to find yourself a succesful session.\n\nInfinite stamina, barely any flinch, base movement speed affected by the equipped weapon build and pulling out a knife or a grenade, yet feels somewhat sluggish at times. I'd say this translates to catiousness. Game wants you to think ahead and being prepared at all times.\n\nAnd this itself brings me to my last take on the core gameplay; Where as in classic arena shooters the difficulty comes in the form of predicting your enemies and calculating trajectories, and map knowledge - this game draws it's challenge in weapon handling. I cannot stress this enough, the weapons are violent and aggressive if left uncontrolled, the spread and recoil build up enormously with anything more than 2-3 shot bursts.\n\nNoteworthy, despite not directly gameplay, there are no scavenging ammo itself in this game whatsoever, none, nada. Only way to get a fresh load is to pick up left behind weapons and hope it has enough pewpew for another +9 streak. The game is technically in good state, and runs stable on all 3 builds of mine. Workarounds exist and manually tailoring your system does sport that extra boost.\n\nThis concludes my opinion of the game and its state so far. It is a shooter for a very specific taste and liking, but by no means a bad one.","January 15","true","93.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

This is going to be awesome.\n\nOther than that...\nCurrently it's good game IMO could and will probably get more things comming in. Although I recommend comming back after a while because right now there is not a lot of maps, servers are not super populated, and some control options seem missing or a little lacking if you were planning to play a finished FPS. The slowish movement speed with no health regen makes the game lean towards a slower paced tactical shooter. The random spread is unique feature that really makes you control your shots carefully. The current characters/classes available give very unique abilities although some of them aren't used team based unfortunately, the other abilities are quite fun to use when combined with the other abilities of your team members. As of right now there is nothing pay to win except for the usual complaint about ingame currency gained by playing. The game features weapon customization from the muzzle of the gun to the stock in back, well for the rifles (shotguns and pistols are out of luck right now).  An interesting unlock/shop is used, featuring two places to buy perms of things via ingame currency. The unlock style shop is similar to leveling up the gun you are using and unlocking things to purchase for that specific gun, the other shop contains things that don't have locks on anything except things are more pricier. If your a death match style person there is Team Death match. If your a plant bomb at target person there is Demolition. If your a capture this point get killy spider tanky thingy but dies in 2 minutes of it seeing daylight then capture more points, then Terminal Conquest is there.

Every character has an ability unique to them that charges over time or as you rack up points that you optain by defeating enemies, assisting a teammate, etc. These abilities have two tiers each, you can use it immediately at tier 1 when the cooldown ends, or you can wait a bit longer and rank it up to tier 2. Motoko has her Therm-Optic Camo which makes you more difficult to spot by enemies. Rank it up to tier 2, and it can be used by 3 other teammates in an interesting mechanic called SkillSync. Batou has his arm launcher which can fire a rocket and fires two rockets at tier 2, but cannot be used in SkillSync at either tier.\n\nIf you manage to layer the right skills, you can put your team at quite the advantage and pull of some awesome plays. I've noticed that Therm-optic Camo and Super Sprint, which increases your movement speed, is especially deadly.\n\nUnlike most FPS out there, one player is less likely to carry the game, as the outcome of the match depends heavily on how well the team works together. If you're into that kind of thing, this game is for you. However, First Assault has only three gamemodes currently and some features are unfinished, and will be Free to Play at a later date, so it may be wise to wait until release.\n\nI'm having fun with First Assault, but I can understand the gripes others are having with it. In it's current state, this game recieves a 7/10 for me. This score will most likely rise upon release as we see bug fixes, new gamemodes, new maps, and new features (hopefully.)","December 14, 2015","true","6.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

There's no crazy OP killstreaks, there's no BS aerobatics, just you, a gun with attachments, and an ability that recharges over time and with kills. Other than the scifi and anime trappings, you'd be forgiven for thinking this is a calmed-down COD more in line with what COD4 was.\n\nWhile not the more technically impressive, the game's visuals very much have an anime sort of flair to them, despite not being cell-shaded. Enemies and friendlies are easy to pick out against the background, and all of the HUD elements are cleanly presented and easy to read, while maintaining the cyberpunk feel of the source material.\n\nGunplay is solid, with netcode that performs better than most. Recoil is very much in play here, and managing it is key to all engagements, even those at fairly close ranges. All of the sounds in the game are similarly fantastic, from the gunfire, music, and seemingly-authentic voice acting.\n\nMy issues with the game are very few, and one of the few actually comes down to the playerbase, and not the game itself. For whatever reason, 80% of players seem to have all picked the main character. This means you will almost never see any abilities other than cloaking, and you'll also rarely get the opportunity to SkillSync anything other than cloaking. This is disappointing because I would much rather SkillSync the arguably more useful wall hack-like ability, or the other sharable abilities. Perhaps this will change later in the game's lifespan, but for now, you'll be playing with a flood of clones.\n\nTher are also a few menus that are conspicuously devoid of anything on them, but these are sure to be populated throughout the game's development.\n\nOverall, this is a great shooter, and it's damn near impossible to find this kind of quality for the asking price of $5. This is a game that I can really see myself putting a lot of time into.","December 14, 2015","true","5.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

All the mechanics feel in place, aside from strange occasional bugginess in the forms of disputed hit-boxes (or fire patterns, uncertain), a melee strike that doesn't seem to go off when it should (right-clicking when the symbol pops up for an insta-kill is supposed to work, right?), and other oddities that don't always happen but when they do it's right when you needed them not to.  The game does lack content, and according to the way it was advertised it should have pure co-op scenarios and more but doesn't.  However, it is early access, and UI elements appear to be in place to facilitate the missing content.\n\nThe gameplay certainly is unique and seems to fit together well.  Each character has a different ability that, when used well, can really benefit your playstyle as well as the team through sharing the ability's effects.  Nothing feels really overpowered, and it doesn't feel like rock-paper-scissors unless you aren't aware of your surroundings (which would be your own fault).  Also, it's Ghost in the Shell, with great voice acting.\n\nSpend a little (no more than $10) on an intro pack and see where it goes (kinda wary of Nexon, which has a money-grabbing history).  If the game shapes up to something nice come launch, spend a little more to give the developers support.","December 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

I really liked the customization options you can have for weapon attachments, as well as chipsets that act as temporary perks for your characters. The Skillsync system is interesting, with some skills being more beneficial than others, but I like how the abilities can affect ones playstyle or the flow of battle during a match. The gunplay can be best described as clunky and random at times. There seems to be some aspect of random spread or recoil present when firing a weapon and sometimes hits dont register. Overall, since the developers are continously trying to improve the game and listen to community feedback, I think that some of these issues can be remedied in time for official launch but as it stands now, it is a fun and fully functional early access game that I can recommend.\n\nI've also written a more in depth review and overview at the website below:\nhttp://freetoplayreview.com/ghost-in-the-shell-stand-alone-complex-first-assault-online-early-access-review","May 2","true","14.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

Kind of wish they'd leave it like that forever). It will however go F2P, presumably during open beta. No idea when that will be.\n\nI'll probably play this on and off, but it just feels like wasted potential. There's room for so much more in the source material than what this game will ever offer that dumbing it down to a simple team-based shooter in small levels is almost insulting.\n\nI guess if you're looking for a generic F2P shooter with an anime tie-in, there's not much else out there (Feel free to let me know of them). If you're looking for a game that does something new, unique or does everything in it very well... You probably won't find it here.\n\nDespite being highly trained, cybernetically augmented professionals, weapon accuracy is anywhere from "okay" to "how did I shoot THE CEILING?". The Vector in particular is one of my biggest annoyances as it should be a highly accurate, low recoil .45ACP SMG... And this is presumably a future version of the gun.\n\nI also find it hilarious that the ONE game where a quick melee hotkey would actually make sense is the ONE game that forces you to switch to it before swinging. I hate quick grenade and melee hotkeys, but at the same time... It makes so much sense in this setting. I have never felt so torn about a feature I never liked NOT being present.\n\nUltimately I say give it a shot, but only if you aren't already hooked on another game. You probably won't find much new or unique here aside from the optic camo sharing because Motoko is apparently the only character in the game. It's also doubtful GitS fans will find anything to like about it if they aren't into FPS games.","December 17, 2015","true","0.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","14","22","2","1"

(eg, accuracy improvement, character speed reduction) Preventing people that pay tons from having a lead over their peers.\n- Plenty of different maps and style of games, different character's skills work much better in certain maps and certain game types, so make a party and set up plans and strategies.\n- 8 characters, each with their own unique skills.\n- Skills are not overpowered, nor underpowered.\n- The game is in Beta stage and I'm lovin' it. (Mcdonald's Pun not intended). ;3\n---------Cons\n- The opening is unskippable, loud, and takes more seconds to finish than it should.\n- No microphone support yet.\n- Missing weapons from the anime, but honestly, they'll be added eventually, duh.\n- A drop in FPS and a small delay here and there, but not often enough to rage over.\n- Lag Spike will occur maybe once or twice within 1-2 hours I've noticed.\n- Hitbox issues every now and then, but that's to be expected from Early Access.\n- Shotguns do not spread their fire either when aiming down the sights or when hip fired. No idea why this is...  Also, because of this, when aiming down the sights, you can effectively melt through enemies at mid range with incredible accuracy. But when shooting someone in closer proximity, since the shot isn't sprayed like a normal shotgun, if the shot misses the exact mark on an enemy, the entire spray misses and not a single pellet hits. It seems very strange, but maybe I'm just not used to it.\n- You cannot see the costumes or other characters on the enemy team. All enemies look the same. (hopefully that will change)\n- Invisible "enemy's" names will still pop up over their heads when you aim even remotely at them. That NEEDS to change.\n-I've seen 2 people assassinate each other at the exact same time, it was quite a hilarious sight.\n-------conclusion\nall in all, for the price paid, I love it. I have never paid for a cheaper game and had as much fun than I have with this.\nSome of the "Cons" are a personal dislike such as the unskippable opening.\nBut like I said, that's personal prefference.\nThe game runs fine, a few stutters here and there, some hitbox issues here and there, but loving the gameplay, maps, skills, customizing the guns and so on.\nYou actually get rewarded for your time, and work towards purchasing new things rather than RNG related crap these days lol!\nI do hope this game holds well in the future, and has a lot of potential.\nEarly Access review 9/10\n\nP.S.- Message to the community: invite your friends to play. The game is only $5, send it as a gift if possible. :) Gaming with friends is always better than gaming alone.","May 14","true","46.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The idea is good. But the backend is bad. very bad.\n\nI'm currently running a rig with 750gb ssd storage, 16gb memory, i7 3770k CPU and nVidia GeForce GTX 670 GPU.  I'm running on 60mbps down / 4.5mbps up connection with tested 0 packet loss and approx 2-5ms jitter. The game registers me anywhere from 20-30ms average on the servers I play (US ones). Safe to conclude no hardware issues, yeah?\n\nThen, lets also get out of the way crouching/tap-firing. I do both. Stationary crouched tap-fire shots for maximum accuracy. Then the following things happen:\n\nIf you aim at someone, say, someone stationary 5 feet from you and you put the targeting reticle directly centered in their chest and fire... you may or may not hit them. Some matches you'll hit. Other matches the game will completely ignore the fact you're aiming down sights and not one bullet will touch your target. Then he turns around and kills you because you've expended your ammo clip. Thus aiming is pointless.\n\nThen there's the times where it bugs and irregularly registers hit damage... this happens randomly, but I'd estimate approximately 40-50% of time. When this happens, body shots that normally would do 10-30% of your health instantly kill you.\n\nThen there's the deal with shotguns. Occasionally they do the same thing when distanced so you can 1-hit kill a target completely across the map with a SHOTGUN. Because you can snipe with shotguns. Logic.\n\nAaand there's the glorious moments where you're taking fire and get behind cover... and the cover does not save you. You die anyway. Out of their line of sight & out of their line of fire.\n\nAnyway, hopefully the devs can fix this in the future, but as of right now, if you play this game and enter a match there's a 50-50 chance it will be broken and unplayable.\n\nUpdate: Logged in again for the last time tonight. I logged in and played for about an hour or so and the game was 100% unplayable. Nothing would hit where the targetting reticle was placed, was being shot through walls, just entirely bogus.\n\nGame's just not worth the bother, it's clearly broken and with limited time right now to enjoy myself in games, it's not worth the strain of gambling on a 50-50 chance the game will be playable and not just downright frustrating.\n\nFor now, this is uninstalled & removed from my games list. Really bugs me though that it's been a waste of money for now, but I will come back to this maybe 6 months to a year from now and see if it's progressed any by then.","May 7","false","116.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","3"

All the glorious bits and bobs from the series in a neat shooter package, all while being a free to play game [at some point in the future].\n\nPros:\n-GitS:SAC universe in a game!\n-All the original (English) voice actors from the series voicing their character.\n-Practically F2P already with the minor buy-in price.\n-Skillsync system is fun and original.\n-Unique method to identifying enemies.\n\nCons:\n-Steam packages aren't very worthwhile\n-Almost no skins whatsoever in the entire game\n-Each character has 1 skill, and that is the only reason for their existence.\n-Only one original gun in the entire game: the Seburo pistol you may see in some preview images\n-Incredibly boring weapon selection overall.\n-Maps are not dynamic enough, far too simplistic layouts.\n-Maps are fairly small; you often respawn right next to enemies\n-Updates are infrequent.\n-Too few game modes and maps.\n\nReview:\nI came in not really expecting much, but it does have a lot of charm and a great original concept so far. The Skillsync feature is fun and original. The concept of adding little enhancers to your character gives you little additional bonuses to your gameplay (i.e. faster reload, weapon swap, sprint speed, deployables health/time, etc). The abilities themselves per character are useful all around, albeit rarely teamplay oriented in a game that is always team vs team.\n\nThe first thing that really got to me, however, is the weapon selection. The images you see on the store page show a really cool, futuristic looking bullpup; not in the game. The images show Togusa's Mateba; not in the game. Besides the one Seburo pistol, literally nothing from the GitS universe carries over into this game. Almost as if they failed to hire someone to do any concept work at all. The images in the store to appear to be, at the very least, staged images involving assets that exist, rather than some sort of paintover by another artist, yet we are lacking some essential weapons here.\n\nNow that's not to say the weapons are bad, they are just the most boring list of CoD/Battlefield weapons you could possibly imagine. Only one of which even has hardware on it that makes it look different; the M4A1 which has a different handguard and stock. Absolutely everything else is the exact assortment you would see from a modern shooter 5 years ago. The modding system seems nice too, however they artifically restricted optics so that guns only had 2-3 options maximum even if they are all essentially the same size, use the same magnification, and are for the same obvious rail system that all modern firearms use. All other attachments are essentially identical for all weapons (front angledgrip, bipod, laser, barrel, and magazines), and for most of those categories, there is only one unlockable option, and one purchase option in total.\n\nSure, maybe some of these weapons do show up at some point in the series or movies, as it takes place in a variety of locations against a myriad of worldwide organizations, but that does not excuse the lack of originality, especially when they've already added a non-canon character. It just tells me they have no interest in making this any more than a generic shooter in every regard.\n\nMap design and sizes could definitely use some expansion. That's not to say it is easy to camp or use cheap tactics, but there are too few options overall to reach objectives or the enemy team. So while I don't advocate any sort of MLG involvement here, it took me a matter of hours to master the layout of every single available map in every single game mode because they are just that simplistic. Maps that are small are one thing, but the number of obvious chokepoints and general lack of enough alternate routes make it far too easy to not get flanked or countered.\n\nCharacter design is actually quite good, and identifying enemies is fun and easy because enemies have a completely different model. The caveat? This means your custom skin is rarely seen if only your own team can see it. Customization also boils down to alt textures, and currently there are only 2 in existence. Each character is specifically tied to one ability, which sounds fine, as someone can identify your ability by what character you are playing, but that is also sort of pointless if the other team can't tell the difference. Because we are not lacking in screen real estate, the ability could have been tied to some other identifying icon and let everyone use whatever player model they wanted. More importantly, the ability has literally nothing to do with most of the characters that have them. For example, Matoko has thermoptic camoflage, which is fine to be known for, but everyone at some point uses it in the GitS universe. Generally all the abilities are made to be different enough, regardless of how they interact, but there  is no direct link between their usage and the character using it.\n\nSkillsync, while fun, is generally worthless because either the maps are not dynamic enough for it to matter. You could get an entire team to skillsync each o f the abilities and steamroll a team, but it would only last for a short period of time before another long recharge/cooldown to use any ability again.\n\nThe real issue, however is that there have been barely any updates. You may say "Well it only released in December, roughly two months ago." But you'd be wrong, because this has been in beta long before it ever arrived on Steam. And as far as I'm aware, an overseas release long before Neople (the current dev) added localization. This is entirely why everyone already knew about Maven coming out, because she has existed for quite some time now in another release.\n\nThat's not to say it isn't fun, I just hope this is more of an actual game by next December, instead of some random F2P failure like every other Early Access title; failing to completely launch and grasp an audience for more than a couple hours.","February 7","false","12.1"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","15","25","0","0"

There is not much more than faithful aesthetics and sounds and even then that is only a thin veneer on a game that very clearly seems to lack any style of its own. There is a deficit of substance and depth that will deter some fans of the series as I know it is doing so to me because this is something integral to the GITS franchise, story.\n\nTo address the game itself I find myself struggling for words but the ones I pick are picked carefully.\nI still think the franchise would be best suited to a FPS but as a shoddy, clunky FPS that doesn't flow smoothly it made my skin crawl, seriously, the controls and handling are in dire need of speeding up and streamlining (Ctrl for crouch but Caps Lock for Sneak??? Pick one, make it do both and stick with it.)\nthe combat in the GITS films and series is cool and slick, featuring acrobatics and feats of strength, this is important to be reflected in the gameplay, you should "feel" like you're a cyborg agent who can moonsault a gun out of an opponent's hands.\nIt may come to stick that this title plays like Deus Ex meets COD and roughly looks like the offspring of such a union but that is only indicative of the niche this game is trying to fill and how poorly it will succeed at filling either better than they have themselves already.\nNothing offered isn’t already on offer anywhere else save for the IP but you’ve already heard my thoughts on that.\nCompared to other gameplay types from popular shooters this feels like a poor job, none of the nuances that make other titles fun or exciting to play but just a dull, repetitive drudge.\n\nSeriously consider the development of this game as yet another FPS online multiplayer game in a veritable ocean of similar titles, nothing is new or brilliant.\n\nI will continue to play this game in the coming days and will update, amend and edit this review according as I see fit.","April 28","false","0.5"," 32 of 58 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","32","58","0","6"

I know I was.  Ignoring all the bugs complaints (true or otherwise), or the poor animation/physics quality, or everything else related to gameplay, this game fails on it's most important selling point.  The theme.  Instead it concentrates on everything that doesn't matter to the franchise like out of place character and weapon schemes.\n\nApart from the characters, nothing fits.  The enemies are ripped straight out of Killzone instead of your run of the mill, poorly equipped guerilla insurgents and ghost-hacked civilians.  Even the weapons are all wrong, with the arsenal containing mostly 21st century weapons instead of the hallmark Seburo-type weapons we've seen in the GitS and even Appleseed series.  And don't even get me started on the Halo-esq gauntlet knife.  Bottom line it's all wrong.\n\nLastly, the game is pure deathmatch.  It's like calling Rainbow Six: Siege a Rainbow Six game.  It really isnt if you know anything about the series.  This game is sorely lacking singleplayer/coop operations.  They have three seasons, plus the Arise series, and three movies to go off of.  No excuses.\n\nBottom line, if this game even hopes to be worthy of the title Ghost in the Shell, it has a lot of work to do before it's projected 2016 release.  So get on it.  I'd really love to turn this review from a "Stay away" to a "Pick it up now".","February 24","false","1.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's clear the developers focused on the stability of the game at launch rather than content, and while I'd prefer both, that's unresonable and I'm glad they went the way they did instead of launching an unfunctional unbalanced mess. Business model is currently fair, it will be a F2P game and you need to pay now, but it is a mere $5 and you are given early access goodies to make up for this. The chances of a game launching with fair business models and turning to the dark side is very common though, so I hope this doesn't happen, but I'm not going to rule out that possibility. The developers seem friendly and outspoken with the community and I hope this continues. Nexon and western markets is usually a battlefield, so I hope we don't see naive development decisions based on what works in asian markets that kill these sorts of games, in the west, we don't stand for unapologetic P2W tripe. But as I said the business model is fine right now, but this could change and the developers should be careful.\n\nThe game reminds me a lot of blacklight actually, it doesn't feel as satisfying as Blacklight and the customisation is less, but the gameplay is generally smarter, more polished and more importantly balanced compared to blacklight. Also as I said the maps are incredibly well designed, they may not be perfect but as someone who really looks at map designs, I can tell that the devs are educated on what makes a good map. Simple, uncluttered and balanced is the way to do maps and they have succeeded there. The guns last I played were balanced with the exception of the semi auto sniper rifle which was broken as ♥♥♥♥. But I'll update weapon balance later.\n\nYou may be lucky to get 20 hours out of this game right now, but if you are a fan of fast pace FPS games you will enjoy that time. It's solid, the maps are well designed and the balance is passable for a release title, as I said the reason this is very early access is the clear lack of content.\n\n\nP.S Oh completely forgot, I played 14ish hours of this game when it launched and have no opinion on the state of hackers. By now the game could very much be ruined by hackers and I can almost guarentee this will happen. I haven't played this game in a while but I wrote the review recently. Before buying check to see if the game has been ruined by cheaters or not. I'll update the review next time I play and theres some more content.","February 16","true","14.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The gunplay feels a bit clunky and honestly if you're going to make a fast paced shooter like this you have to make sure that the movement feels fluid and smooth which it doesn't, however it is still playable once you get use to it.\n\nThere isn't a lot of content yet, but I'm assuming that will come in later updates. I'm also kind of dissapointed that they haven't added any lore based weapons from the anime into the game. Idk if these weapons are just placeholders, but all the weapons are just slightly futuristic versions of the modern weapons that we have today.\n\nAll in all, I can see this becoming a solid game and I will continue to support it. The only reason my review for this is positive is because as a huge fan of the GITS series I like it because it's GITS and I'm only recommending this game to fans of the series. If you're just a normal FPS player who knows nothing about the series and want to try this game, I wouldn't recommend it as you'd probably find nothing special about it, but to fans like me it is.\n\nFinal Verdict: Wait for future updates, there's not a lot of content in the game with a limited amount of weapons, customization, maps, and gamemodes.\n\nAlso biggest plus: NO MICROTRANSACTIONS!!!!(yet at least) YAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!\n\n","December 14, 2015","true","15.7"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","2"

THIS GAME IS NOT REVOLUTIONARY not in the slightest and I think that's why I love it. I came into it wanting an old experience a basic, nice and simple first person shooter like the good old days of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and that's exactly what I got. Just so it's clear I have not watched the anime so my review is based fully on the game itself!\n\nFirst off there is a average amount of options enough to get a good pass for early access just don't go into it thinking ♥♥♥♥ yeah triple a quality options. To me I personally think the gameplay is great but I think that just boils down to personal preference to be completely honest. The sounds design apart from the generic gun sounds and grenades sound so damn good and the hud in game looks nice and is easy to use. So much games lately have been out going crazy with this hero system in first person shooters... but I can safely say they do a good enough job about it. Weapon customization is also great its just like any other shooter it's got the basics skins, a good amount of attachments etc like I said before you know the game isn't revolutionary. The leveling I think is quite balanced it's not slow but neither is it fast, it's a good place for it to be same with weapon unlocks etc. There's also 3 game modes Team Deathmatch, Demolition and Terminal Conquest. Team Deathmatch is well you know a deathmatch between teams, Demolition is place the bomb or defuse it like in Counter-Strike and Terminal Conquest is capture point by point a tug of war kinda like rush from Battlefield but back and forth it's good fun. The game of course has a marketplace and boom red lights just went up but right now it's actually very very very good everything is obtainable just by playing the game which is always a good thing. I was pleasantly surprised by the servers and community for any Australian players out there you're pretty much covered in this game there's an average amount of lobbies going plus everyone seems very friendly. My favorite option has to be custom matches with friends you also get xp it's just so socially friendly it's nice.\n\nNow as much as I like the game it does need improvements obviously first off straight away is keybinds it works at the moment just fine but it does need tweaks and improvements why is interact and pick up two different keys? Things like that. The main menu works as it is but also does need tweaking its not obvious what is what from the get go I mean I actually had to look up a guide to claim my items. Also ONE HUGE THING the game needs is an fov slider for real everything feels zoomed in, fullscreen mode needs to be renamed to fullscreen windowed because that's what it is, I'm not complaining about it being an option cause I love borderless just calling it fullscreen is misleading to most people. As much as I said I do love the gameplay it still does need tweaks especially melee, the tutorial was rather long and useless BUT COOL AS ♥♥♥♥ then again that does fall under personal preference. The game does have performance issues too like when I first launch the game for at least the next 10-20 mins it stutters in game then smooths out, also why does the Nexon launcher have to stay open it has no value since its there for like under 10 seconds honestly just make it auto close after the games up. Lobby wait times are pretty ridiculous 90 second countdowns it seriously needs to go down to like 30 seconds. Last thing is Nexon and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ god damn anti-cheat there is like so many ways to go about it but nope you have to keep making a new Nexon anti-cheat that does jack ♥♥♥♥ for the rest of the games life span... honestly just use something else for once!\n\nI love the game and I don't mind dumping $5 USD on it though as it stands I wouldn't recommend it to everyone as it will be free to play at some point but for those dying like I did for some simple basic first person shooter fun just dive right in!","December 17, 2015","true","21.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Now is the time to get it. The game is really enjoyable at the moment. Everything runs off the in game cash right now. It has its glitches here and there, but it's to be expected. We all know nexon may turn this into another P2W, so jump on the ball before it starts rolling downhill.\n\nEdit: Came back to it and so far its still enjoyable and here's my overall review.\nPros:\n- For being early access it plays very well. it's well polished.\n\n-They are updating it and listening to the community thats always a +.\n\n- Every gun and upgrade is atainable via in-game currency and you get 50k GP every lvl up. They also just increased gp gain every match last update by community request. Only thing that requires actual money is cosmetics.\n\n- If you've played CS or Cod, than you'll drop a lot of kills. I average 20-40 kills a game. Very easy to get into and familiar with.\n\n-Very enjoyable if you can get a party going with your friends.\n\nCons:\n-You better get some friends if you wanna play during the week. Servers are very dead sometimes. I've had people go from east to west servers just to return to our game cause it's the only one going on both servers. On weekends you probably can find a server on your designated coast.\n\n-Hit Reg is meh. It's usually accurate, but could use some finer tuning.\n\n-No mic support. I know mics usually bring toxicity with it, but in this game I feel it would encourage more players to stick around in the lobby and do callouts during the matches.\n\n-Some maps need some work. Especially "port" it's such a small map and only based on spawn trapping the other team. It would work with a smaller amount of players maybee 5v5 not with 10 on each team.\n\n\nOverall: I would recommend it if your looking for another shooter to play around with from time to time. I would wait a bit more for more updates or a boost in players, before buying it. If you got 5 bucks and money to throw around, then go for it. I know once it goes free to play it'll attract a larger base of players, so if your not that enticed to buy this then definitly wait for it to go F2P.\n\nGot any questions, then just ask and I'll answer. :D","December 19, 2015","true","24.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

It's like those Korean Counter-strike clones that focus on grinding "unlocks" and have psuedo-RPG mechanics: at the end of the match you're given small token "exp boosts" while you work to unlock extra weapon attachments or skins. All of the maps that I played had were Arena-like, encouraging either COD-style "run around in a circle and shoot the respawners in the back" or highly linear maps that encourage camping chokepoints.

I can imagine gamers with lower end machines enjoying this as a game that has pretty decent mechanics. It feels like a decent call of duty clone and I actually enjoyed my short time with the game...\n\nHowever, you are unable to use any contoller options INCLUDING the Steam Controller. It's worth a try if you are a fan of the anime, but you are not a hardcore FPS fan. Me being a Big Halo guy, I couldn't see myself buying this for anything higher than $12 for what it is currently.

Since this week was Free Weekend, I decided to finally give it a play. I wasn't Disapointed but this game (of course, for obvious reason) still needs work!!\n\nVery fun FPS based on the historicly iconic Anime title "Ghost in the Shell". This game "GitS: SAC-FAO" is solid. It is kinda tame compared to other FPS's but what makes this game so fun is the ability to customize your character with different abilities - these abilities, such as cloaking, hijacking, etc, allow you the oppourtunity to 1up your opponent if used correctly.\n\nThis game does have the usual "upgrade your armor/weaponry" type of setup and the layout format would be similar to games like "Counter Strike-Nexon Zombies" where you choose your character, then acrew your upgrades and powerups thru what looks to be a messaging system. All in all, there's not really much to say here at this time --  this IS still in Early Access...  I didn't play alot - but I've played my fair share of FPS's and i've played enough of this game to deem it as a solid release (so far).\n\nI would recommend this game for FPS enthusiasts looking for something new to try and enjoy. For $5 (or less) this game is a worthy buy and the online players will give you a run for your money when it comes to difficulty and replay value... but that's it.. it's Online Only with no Single Player mode.\n\n| The Controls still need working on by the DEV's themselves (I spend the first 15 to 20 minutes  just calibrating my 360 Controller correctly....) - The Graphics are DECENT -- they definently kept the spirit of the Anime's style and feel .... Nothing too extravagant, Nothing too lavish (even with the setting turned all the way up to the highest settings), but if your looking for cheap thrills based on Anime Worlds  (the main character is sexy as hell)  - then this would be the game for you. |\n\n7.5/10 (will probably be a 8 after the DEV team updates the built in controller schematics)","April 30","true","20.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

This is not that!! I mean obviously if you bothered to watched the gameplay trailer?\n\nIf you are a fan of FPS, love the typical game modes that CS:GO and COD offer this game is for you. The best way I can explain it is its like CS:GO with a Ghost in the Shell theme. A CoD progression kind of system when it comes to unlocking weapons and mods and the gameplay is pretty much the same as all multiplayer shooters.. with a little twist :)\n\nEach character has certain skills, like the skills they had in the show! From going stealth mode to gaining a barrier of extra armor, setting up turrets and more. Although the game is still in Early Access, I can't see much changing other than little tweaks here and there. With whats out now we have more than a basic idea of what to expect when the final version releases.\n\nMaybe in the future there will be some kind of story mode but for now it's pretty much your usual team death match/demolition shooter. Thats not a bad thing though. If I had to choose between this and other multiplayer FPS I would choose Ghost in the Shell. The unique skills and characters make it interesting.\n\nI like everything about it, the only problem I have are the frame drops. When in combat for a split second things can get a bit choppy.. this is a huge deal when it comes to competitive gameplay. If they fix that they are golden!\nSo the optomization is pretty good but could be better.","December 28, 2015","true","7.4"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaoticproductions/recommended/369200/","kaoticproductions","Drunk on Chaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaoticproductions/","114 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'll keep this simple. It's great, really it is, I'm not often a fan of shooters but this one is neet.  (Ignore my low playtime, I've got a boatload of coursework to do atm and can't play this too much, but I can tell I'm going to sink quite a few hours into it over the holidays.)\n\nPros\n-gameplay feels solid and authentic\n-it's snappy and fast paced without every weapon being a one shot kill, meaning that there's an element of picking a gun to meet your play style.\n-character unique skills are a fairly original thing in the shooter genre, especially the skill sharing which adds a surprising amount of strategy to the game.\n-The game feels very GitS. Nice and gritty with an air of shiny and futuristic.\n-The above feature is in no small part helped by the voice actors, who have mostly returned from the anime.\n-Microtransactions don't unbalance gameplay or make it remotely pay to win. I haven't done any microtransactions and I didn't feel at a disadvantage.\n\nCons\n-You can only jump like 1 foot off the ground. You think I'm exaggerating? I'm not. I could seriously jump twice as high in real life. I hope this gets tweaked, because it's really the only thing about the game that doesn't feel very GitS. I mean you're a damn cyborg/augmented human. Let's see characters that can jump a story high like they can in the anime, then I'll be happy. But this is legitimately my only complaint, I won't touch anything about the optimisation, this an alpha, and a really good one at that.\n\nFeatures I'd like to see\n-Character specific agility stats/health. I've always wanted a shooter that does this. Even if only slightly. We already pick characters based on their skills, but I think certain characters should be slightly more resilient than others, and certain characters should be faster/be able to jump higher than others. If done properly I think this could be an amazing mechanic.\n-graphically, I'd like to see slight improvements to the lighting/contrast of the game areas to really flush it out and cement that GitS atmosphere.\n-I know that this is a planned feature, but I'm really itching to play the PvE in this game, I feel like the story mode is what is going to really kill it. I just didn't think I could review this without mentioning it. Obviously GitS has a phenominal story line, and I can't wait to see how they implement that in this game. They've got the voice actors for it so I feel like the devs will really be missing a trick if they don't do something with the talent.\n\nThis is well worth a 'buy.' seriously, it's like £4 (what is that, $5.50?) You can't really go wrong for that price. I genuinely think that once this gets into a full release it'll give counterstrike a run for its money.","December 16, 2015","true","49.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Sniping in this game is not that great, you would have to stand still until the bullet impacted something, that mean you can't move right after you pull the trigger, or else your shot would be off.\n\nWeapon customization is pretty cool, lots of options, most guns are based of modern stuff, but some of them are outfitted with futuristic furnitures, pretty creative.\n\nTo conclude this review, yes, I would recommend this game if you're into modern military fps, and are ok with some of the futuristic elements.\n\n(And no, the map is not "too small", but spawn trapping is kinda an issue right now.)","December 15, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You'll need a decent amount of gametime to get attachments for the gun you want to use.\n\nIt's not as laggy as I first thought it was, since they apparently messed up the east and west servers, meaning I was playing with the wrong side of the Country. Now it's pretty smooth minus actual people with bad connections.\n\nThere's not that many weapons out right now, which is fine since this is going to be F2P and it's only in early access right now. Also, the slow unlocking of attachments actually pairs well with the low amount of weapons to stop people from unlocking everything to quickly.\n\nThere's a couple of other issues I have with the game like headshots being instakills, no health regen (even after over a minute of being out of fighting), not being able to pick up someone's primary to replace your pistol, an over the top interface that takes a good while to get used to and just comepletely awful team balancing; however, since it's F2P and the dev's seem to be listening to the community to better the game and there's no pay-to-win aspects in the game, it's already better than most games out there.\n\nGive it a shot, disappointed or not it's free to play so you don't really lose anything except maybe an hour of your time.","December 19, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neenerweener/recommended/369200/","neenerweener","Nina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neenerweener/","231 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst things first; I'm pretty adamant about not playing Early Access games. This was gifted to me.\n\nThat said, I actually think this game is pretty polished as it is. These kinds of games are (and should be) very welcome to the Early Access program.\n\nMy main points will be marked with ">>"\n\nThe game is obviously based on the Ghost In the Shell: Standalone Complex anime, and with that in mind, the game does a very good job of honoring its roots. The game has the right look and feel to it and has the original (English) voice actors for every character. The game also shows clips from the anime in some places, like for character background and game mode previews.\n\n\n>> If you like the anime and FPS games, this game is already worth $5.\n\n\nWhen it comes to FPS mechanics, there are some familiar weapons already in the game and they all have great visuals and sound very satisfying to use. The gunplay so far seemed very arcadey at first due to low recoil, but no matter how hard you pray, spraying does very little -- WHICH IS A GREAT THING -- as the bullet spread can be challenging to control.\n\n\n>> The gunplay is challenging enough, and the weapons look good and sound good.\n>> There is a minor mouse sensitivity issue with sniper rifles, however.\n\n\nThere is a decent amount of maps for an Early Access game, with 3 game modes available; Team Deathmatch, Terminal Conquest, and Demolition. The environments are simple and clean, although texture resolution could use some upscaling. You can't expect a whole lot of detail as the game is still trying to keep the less realistic anime feel.\n\n\n>> The game also features an unlock and leveling system with an attached in-game store.\n\n\nThe leveling seems fast enough, I have less than 20 matches in at the time of first writing the review, but I'm already level 5. (And each level-up grants you 50K GP, or credits.) I'm expecting a fall-off at some point, but I like the fact that after each match you can tell how much your next equipment unlocks progressed, and you can choose which weapon you wish to unlock next, while attachments unlock in order.\n\nCURRENTLY, there is no premium currency in the game. You can only buy things from the store with GP. I think this is a good decision from Nexon and/or Neople as the game is still in Early Access, and they have a pinned thread about P2W on the Discussions page. You can still see an "NX" tab in your inbox, and there is an (empty) box next to the GP price where eventually you can see the NX price of everything.\n\n\n>> I'm positive about the game not becoming P2W.\n\n\nIn the store, you can find a "weapon skins" tab, as well as "outfits" and "items." The first two are currently empty, but it gives a hint about the kind of thing that is being considered for monetization. The "items" tab only has an Operative License for now, which is used to unlock the rest of the characters/classes in the game, but can be bought for just under 250K GP. (Leveling up gives 50K, there are login rewards, etc. Relatively easy to obtain. You get 2 free unlocks by level 6.)\n\n\n>> The game is worth a try, even in Early Access.\n>> I have had no issues with the game besides getting the game to launch for the first time.\n>> Gameplay feels balanced. No one-hit-kill weapons.\n>> Reminds me of Dirty Bomb, except GITS.","December 14, 2015","true","17.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Having a game that is a First Person Shooter is definitely something that is appreciated for fans of the series. From my understanding the Early Access purchases help support the games development into an eventual Free to Play - this could either harm the game in the distant future or it could lead to a potential gem.\n\nI've chosen to purchase the alpha (early access) to support Nexon with their video game as I personally do enjoy Ghost in the Shell, along with their games. However, this is based on my own judgement of what I believe supports the games future. I'd personally would love to have more players get into this game, and can recommend this title to fans of both Ghost in the Shell and Nexon as a developer. However, there are indeed changes that can be made to make this game better, and with the game being in it's alpha state I'm not too worried.\n\nAs of right now...\nAs I continue to play this game I notice things that are off right off the bat:\nHip fire has more accuracy then aiming down sights.\nYou can assissinate through walks/doors.\nHit detection is pretty bad. Sometimes headshots aren't registered to kill right away.\nKey binding shouldn't be stressful, it should be "You want C as crouch? No problem! We'll just replace the key you have as C for something else" instead of "You can't rebind until you rebind the other key to have the key you want to be the action you desire".\nWhen you do play the game, and are thinking, "how do you get good at this game?" Don't aim down your sights yet... It'll more than likely get you killed. Also, always use your skills when you're able to use them, and make sure you sync with other teammates when you play too.\n\nThis review will change overtime as the game updates!\nJust to reiterate, yes I know, "this is in it's alpha state", and hopefully the devs read every review or bugs found by players to make this game amazing! However, if you notice I am fully 'recommending' this game despite it's flaws that can be patched out eventually.\nTo those who think this game is just another shooter? Yes, yes it is. Are there better shooters out there? Yes, yes there is. Should I wait until it goes down in price or Free to Play? Ultimately, that's your call, but I'd say get the "Recruit Early Access Pack" if you're not entirely sure, and want to support the game.","January 14","true","1.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Been playing slice Closed beta and had a blast honestly. Sure, it is a pretty generic FPS overall with Gits theme rather than a hardcore gits game. BUT....it does it RIGHT. many things i really enjoy about this FPS i actually despire in many game i played.\n\nPRO:\n\n-Run smoth and flawless as far as i experienced. I got a fairly old pc and it run like a charm, well optimized. Graphic are satisfying.\n\n-Weapon feel GREAT: they actually have RECOIL (i alway hated blacklight or COD lazer gun) and SPREAD (and not pre set one like CS:go)...so YEA, more will complain weapon are unreliable and innacurate, but that not the case...get soem tim eto get used to them and find the proper way to pace tap fire/burst. But once you get used you jsut drop dead poeple from across the map with the started m4 extremely fast.\n\n-Headshto feel like...headshot. Every AR, even SMG, in theyr eeffective range WILL OHK headshot. and i love it.\n\n-No regeneration. Exept from some specific skill, when you liek half hp...you wont magically hide around a corner and be good to go again in 3 second. no you will try your best to still do damage and get killed from a pistol round casu you had 20 hp left. Love it.\n\n-Skill sharing is fun! lot of skill can be shared with teammate once you get level 2...and that open up for some great teamplay potential.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-Not a lot of content yet. This is only early acces, have to be expected but...like 4-5 map, 3 game mode, few weapon. Enought to have LOT of fun IMO but dont expect a full agem yet.\n\n-No monetarization system yet. As it stand every weapon/mod you unlcuk with the only gainiable trought playing currency are permanent and stuff...what nice. How it will be once more proper monetarization system take place in open beta...cannot be sure. I trust they will go for the only cosmetic and faster unlock path however. Dirty bomb did it right IMO i dotn see why they would screw up this game.\n\n-Still a few bug around (again expected in early acces)\n\n\nseriously...try it out. Worth it...","December 18, 2015","true","43.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I admit I am not very good my best score was 14 kills and my deaths I have no idea as it doesn't tell you.\n\nAlso this game has controller support but don't bother using it the game play spasses out when using it. I plugged my xbox one controller in it felt fine but aiming down the sites kept sticking even with toggle aim turned off even sprinting forced my avatar to aim down the sites which is really weird.\n\nI am new to Ghost in the Shell as a whole I have not watched any of the animes but I do really hope that this game improves as it is still an early access game.","May 17","false","4.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

Personally, I love Ghost of the Shell which is the only reason I bought this but it wasn't what I expected it to be.\n\nYou begin the game with a famous soundtrack 'Making of Cyborg' introducing the whole shebang (opening.) A cut scene plays and the first thing you will do is the tutorial. After completing the tutorial, then you will actually make it to the menu. And what a surprise, you can customise your avatar, your weapons and set up your room. And in the options, not much accessibility is offered, except for the 'Left-hand enabled' option which is nice. But no subtitles. As a player who wears hearing impairs, I would appreciate some subtitles if the devs plans to add story into it.\n\nI tried Team Deathmatch, it was fun. You are given not just weapons but skills such as invisibly, 'sees-enemies-through-walls' ability etc., But again, nothing new. It does have similarities to COD Black ops with all its "cool advances technology' going on. But I would recommend it because it's much cheaper than CODs series and it's easier to play without all these kids screaming at you. Plus, the price is pretty reasonable considering what contents and quality this game has to offer.\n\nOverall: This is like Project Snowblind and CSGO mixed together.

It has an active community, active moderators and active developers. For how long?

Yes.\n\nModern coutner-strike style gunplay meets fun class based team oriented strategy.  Using skill sync to give your entire team invisibility or sight through walls and then rush the bomb site feels incredibly rewarding and allows for great comebacks and unexpected plays.  However, the gunplay is significantly hampered by the stat based gun upgrade system that makes shooting slightly random (and spray very random) unless you upgrade the relevant stats.  I kind of like this though because the game relies much more on team work and using your abilities effectively, rather than simply sniping the other guy first.  If you sit in one spot and try to snipe you are gauranteed to get picked off by the myriad of abilities available.\n\nIs a lot of the launcher infrastructure broken?  Very obviously yes.\nYou are supposed to get a free character unlock at level 3 and level 5.  I did not get an unlock at level 5.  There are various obvious spelling errors (Impact Dempener, Anti-Machin Launcher).  The cyborg upgrades that you (sometimes) get after matches are either woefully useless (reload while sprinting, wait I can already do that right?) or totally over powered (20% increased strafe speed + 10% movement speed gives you a HUGE peek advantage).  And they don't give you these random upgrades often enough, so you will run out if you try to actually use them.\n\nBeyond that the game just has general balance issues as you would expect.  The rocket launcher ability at level 2 can instantly kill the tank that spawns in the tank mode.  If someone on your team saves their rocket for this you never even have to deal with the tank...\n\nHowever, I'm going to recommend.  Because it is in fact a lot of fun when you get past the early access issues.  And if they can fix some of the launcher bugs and balance the game a bit more I can see it being a really fun game by release.","December 31, 2015","true","71.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even so, it's a solid foundation for a decent game. It's got tight controls and solid shooting mechanics, even when you first start out you never feel as if the game has you at any serious disadvantage for not having more unlocks.  All the weapons seem to play a role and have their use.\n\nAs of wiritng (Early access, Jan 2016.) what is there is good, especially for fans of the series. Skill linking and the abilities of the characters add a fun twist to the game and do not feel too unabalanced or overpowered either. Pick it up if you have a couple bucks to spare, or wait till it hits FTP.

Yes, you, the one reading this: I'm here to give you a serious review and not waste your time. Crazy right?\n\nAnyway, I'm here to answer the question on your mind: is this a good game and should I get it?\n\nSo far I'd say the answer is YES. Here's why:\n\n- For an early BETA it feels like a 1.01. There are very few glitches besides the occasional body clipping through a wall but that happens in almost every FPS.\n-Gunplay is solid, so far. You have your flavor of standard guns: developers have promised to add more later. For now you get an SMG, an assault rifle, a sniper, a pistol, an arm blade thing that acts like a knife, and a grenade to start. Unlockables include a more powerful assault rifle, another SMG, and a LMG, among other variants.\n-The three gamemodes- good old Team Deathmatch, Demolition and Point Control- provide enough variety to keep the game fresh for a while.\n-The community is mostly non-toxic. There is the occasional Stand-Alone (see what I did there?) who will disrupt the flow of things but they are ignorable.\n-Motoko has been fan-serviced.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\n-THIS GAME IS IN BETA. EVERYTHING IS CAPABLE OF CHANGE. What you see now may be worse than Battlefield 3 Beta later.\n-Please, for the love of Pete, buy the least expensive pack first, if you can't wait for the game to become a F2P later on.\n-Sadly, Togusa does not have his famous revolver.\n","December 23, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was nice and all, but not my bag. On to the game:\n\nAs far as shooters go, there's a tried and true formula and the one that everyone seems to enjoy the most is the CoD...I don't personally understand it, but that's fine.\n\nThis game has great qualities and is trying to mix it up. Unique abilities per operator that can give a strategic advantage in the game definitely adds a great element to the game play. It's not OP because both sides can have it and stronger abilities have a longer wait time to execute. Also if an entire team is using one operator...it's pretty easy to pick them apart by using a better strategy.\n\nThe guns have a pretty decent balance and the devs have done a good job with them. SMG's don't work for crap at range unless you fire slowly and the dmg is so minimal that anyone with an AR is going to pick you off pretty quickly if they can aim decently. The AR's fire slow and in CQB, the SMG will tear them apart. Of course there's your one shot sniper, but we are all used to that so it's hardly an issue. Small ammo capacity and slow reload time plus the slower ADS due to the scope is all factored in.\n\nThe match bonuses add a great little element too. I know when I was just short of hitting the next rank I was praying for an EXP +10% and pumped my fists in the air like an idiot when I rolled it.\n\nOperator customization is weak at the moment, but I'm sure there will be tons of options once it actually rolls out. We are still playing Early Access so there's a lot to come out in the near future. The little cyber implants also give a little edge too and is nice to use to help with things like quicker reloading or faster strafing. I personally use the SMG and am zipping all over the place spraying my load in everyone's face so I fancy the quick reload and strafing.\n\nCurrently I feel the level progression is a little slow for my taste, but then again if I reached the top too quickly I'd probably get bored in a way. Even though, once I've hit the maximum unlocks, I know I'll still have fun playing just to wreck other people...\n\nAll in all I'd definitely recommend this game to everyone who likes FPS. More features will roll out and Nexon has a great habit of doing lots of events to keep the community interested.

You have to burst your shots as recoil and spread will get you killed even at mid-close range.

This is going to be awful, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nFirst Assault is one of the most potentially-awesome Early Access games I've played. It's incredibly polished for a free-to-play title, it feels great to shoot stuff. Sound design is great, with a little wind-up for emphasis on kill effects. Accomplishing stuff feels really satisfying every time. Most of the special skills are really fun to use, as well. Maps look and play well, with lots of ways to flank and clear even in some of the narrow corridors.\n\nThe key to success is effective timing of the rechargeable skills, and good communication among team members. Matches are very fast, with most lasting ten minutes tops, and some very decided ones lasting under two minutes. You'll get to use Tier 1 skills maybe eight or so times a match on average, and Tier 2 skills usually won't happen more than three. Five if you're pretty much MVP. Many of them can be shared with your teammates, and planning to have an army of armored or invisible players can be a game-changer.\n\nThe game is definitely not finished at the time of writing; teams don't auto-balance and there is no way to switch teams in-game. With the smallish player pool, newbies can be placed against the best of the best, and matches are more often than not pretty one-sided due to one or two team members who are way out of everyone else's league. There's a limited selection of equipment, with only two side-arms, three throwables, and one melee weapon. Glitches do happen, though they're rarely game-breaking.\n\nIf you're not great at these kinds of games, you're going to have a bad time your first few matches, before you start to be able to coordinate. If you're good at ADS shooters already, there isn't going to be a big issue coming to this; the only things to learn are really the maps and skills, and you'll be able to pick that up pretty quickly.\n\nThere are currently no paid-for items in the market; all can be bought with time. This is definitely going to change once the game goes free-to-play, and the review will be updated when that happens.\n\nIf the problems with matchmaking and team balance aren't fixed by the time this game is released, it's going to get a negative. For now, though, this is a FPS I keep coming back to, and it deserves more testers and feedback in the forums to grow.","December 31, 2015","true","33.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very tight shooter mechanics although bullet spread, hip fire, spray and burst fire feel mildy different to other shooters and take a little getting used to.  Weapons have an effective range and using COD, Counter Strike or Battlefield style shooting felt like it was random at first who would win, me or the enemy.  But getting used to this games spray and burst fire mechanics has much improved my kills based on skill rather than RNG bullet spray.\nFantastic balance and choices for the sake of gameplay.  Grenades are much more tactical use because of good design decisions, not just throw over a wall and hope you get a kill.  The different character skills and sharing of skills add a lot of fun to the games, no abilities feel outright overpowered although 1 or 2 characters feel slightly underwhelming.\n\nThis game oozes with Ghost in the Shell atmosphere, they have everything spot on to capture the feel of the series.  Character models are reasonable respresentations of the series characters although Paz and Borma are a little different to what I would expect.  In game though the characters tend to have some form of head gear on so this becomes irrelevant.  They seem to have got the original (English) voice actors for the characters or VERY good copy cats, I can't tell you how much this adds to the atmosphere, hearing Aramaki over the radio or the team characters voice commands and info during battles is awesome for fans.\n\nProgression feels good without feeling gimped in the early game, my main concern being income later on in the game once leveling doesn't happen as fast.\n\nThere are 3 game modes, standard TDM, a counter strike Bomb/Difuse which plays well and a mode, called Terminal Conquest, involving capturing points and pushing to the victory capture.  The new mode involves Tachikoma spawning on the side that captures the points and this adds a lot of fun to the mode.  The voice of the Tachikoma as it runs in to help the team had me grinning from ear to ear.\n\nThe game needs new maps in it's future and I was dissapointed most weapons seem to be modern world weapons rather than GITS universe weapons.  That said the weapons are gorgeous and come with lots of customization options that midly affect how the weapon feels.  All the staples are in there, snipers, SMGs, ARs, and shotguns.\nSnipers don't dominate any map but I've seen them used well and most maps have certain points where snipers are ideal.  Most combat is close quarters or medium range.\nNormal progression from playing will get you a standard armoury of weapons that aren't inferior.  There are also weapons that are more expensive but can all be completely bought with in game currency that is earnt from playing.  From testing so far they are balanced with the cheaper progression weapons.\n\nFree to Play summary.  It isn't a pay 2 win format.  It's a pay to collect or for cosmetics.  Leveling up initially gets you a decent amount of currency and by level 5 you can have 3 of the characters for free.  Actually playing games gives a low amount of currency but there are bonuses from logging in which I'm not sure right now how much it will help.  This is similar to games like hearthstone where grinding by playing constantly isn't really viable but unlike HS you can quickly get a viable loadout that isn't underpowered.  Hopefully there wont be power creep with introduced weapons and characters.\nIf you want to experience all characters and weapons expect to have to sink some money in to the game as I can't see you being able to earn enough to experience everything without undying endurance and no job.  However this is a more than fair format for the company earning from their game.  Getting the most appealling characters and loadout you may want is VERY achieveable within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nI expect to be playing this game for quite some time and am extremely excited for future content unlike other recent shooters I have tried.","December 16, 2015","true","119.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If I'm not creating, then I'm PC gaming to kill off time and enjoy Quick-fun, Team-based shooters or RPG's. I'm currently waiting for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and needed a fun Cyber-punk Stylized Online-First Person Shooter to keep me entertained and up my mouse/keyboard skills. This is it, and although it's not a bad thing, the game keeps me coming back for more hours and keeps me excited to receive the content that's on the way! Despite some of the art and lore not resembling the anime, it's more than enough to keep fans of the franchise intrigued and entertained. Even for gamers who aren't fans of the franchise, the presentation and sound, along with the particular art-style surrounding the maps and character models give off a sense of originality.\n\nGameplay is fast paced and gets the adrenaline going, especially when you and your team of 7 players sync up individual Augmentations (Abilities, perks) to either push in a specific direction, or split up for flanking tactics. There is a class for every type of playstyle and they all compliment each other really well and create some very exciting scenarios that help you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ almost effortlessly.\n\nIt's still a work in progress with developers allowing feedback and responses by next month, and requires a few tweaks to the gameplay and team balancing, but for what it is at it's current state, I'd say give it a try. My fanboy furturism fanatic side would tell you to BUY IT NOW! It's well worth the $4.99 and definitely well worth the $8.99. Plenty of grinding and quick unlockables depending on your experience with the game and skill. Currently not Pay to Win and hopefully won't dive into that category too strongly.\n\nAdd xMachina if you end up purchasing the early access! My keyboard and mouse skills have gotten so much better playing this xD. Currently dominating with an SMG/Speed-Augmentation class that allows me to flank quickly whenever my team is held off or cornered.

Yes.\n\nModern coutner-strike style gunplay meets fun class based team oriented strategy.  Using skill sync to give your entire team invisibility or sight through walls and then rush the bomb site feels incredibly rewarding and allows for great comebacks and unexpected plays.  However, the gunplay is significantly hampered by the stat based gun upgrade system that makes shooting slightly random (and spray very random) unless you upgrade the relevant stats.  I kind of like this though because the game relies much more on team work and using your abilities effectively, rather than simply sniping the other guy first.  If you sit in one spot and try to snipe you are gauranteed to get picked off by the myriad of abilities available.\n\nIs a lot of the launcher infrastructure broken?  Very obviously yes.\nYou are supposed to get a free character unlock at level 3 and level 5.  I did not get an unlock at level 5.  There are various obvious spelling errors (Impact Dempener, Anti-Machin Launcher).  The cyborg upgrades that you (sometimes) get after matches are either woefully useless (reload while sprinting, wait I can already do that right?) or totally over powered (20% increased strafe speed + 10% movement speed gives you a HUGE peek advantage).  And they don't give you these random upgrades often enough, so you will run out if you try to actually use them.\n\nBeyond that the game just has general balance issues as you would expect.  The rocket launcher ability at level 2 can instantly kill the tank that spawns in the tank mode.  If someone on your team saves their rocket for this you never even have to deal with the tank...\n\nHowever, I'm going to recommend.  Because it is in fact a lot of fun when you get past the early access issues.  And if they can fix some of the launcher bugs and balance the game a bit more I can see it being a really fun game by release.","December 31, 2015","true","71.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Other then that its not much to go though. Most of the maps are very small the weapons list very small.\n\nThe actual Game play is slightly difficult once you get the hang of aiming its better. The spawn points in team death match can be "questionable" although sometimes you get a good one (like being place directly behind a team and ♥♥♥♥♥ing 5 kills of it). For the most part I have played much worse FPS and for an eary access it has so much more room to advance.\n\nIt is worth the 4$ for the start off, but if you want somthing like COD 100% from the start your not going to get it.\nGeneral action is ok few things such as abilities are a bit awkward.\n\nThe Teamwork in the Game is actually not really there is no Mic system so it leades to typeing and which leads to death and so on. With that teams mostly just go on how many "good" players are on each team.\n\nOutfits and designs for guns and characters are not there, well there is one you get from buying one of the early access packs, but other then that non have been added.\n\nGP system seems like it is going to be worse so to say once it goes free to play, because of the fact you earn maybe 700 per match but around 50k every so often when you level up. You can then use this to purchase  Equiptment to upgrade your weapons. You can buy more guns but the amount at this point is limited. ANother annoying fact is you cant buy lets say a  silencer for an M4 and use it for an AK each has its own and the average prices for this is a bout 30-54k GP.\n\n\nThe community of the game cant really say not much talk goes on inside of the match. There are no "missions" to help you level up or gain GP as of now just pure matches.\n\nMatch ques are found pretty fast but once your in a match room so to say you stay with that player base unless you leave  ( Like in CSGO)  the matches dont tend to go on for long lasting around 7-10 minutes at most so not too tiring.\n\nThe character abilities are sort of balanced a few things could be better such as grenades and the smoke nade does not offer to much coverage. regular nades needs a small fix with being able to tell how far you throw.\n\nThe teamwork needs a lot a work a start would not be spawning one team on the others flank in certain matches like deathmatchg.\nNeed more maps and more comprehensive ones that actually force or try to get team work, and mic.\n\n\n\n\nWith that being said I still think its worth a try at least still a great play for only 4$.","December 15, 2015","true","107.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, so far it seems that the game is taking a more CS:GO like approach in that your money is more apt to be spent on cosemtic features, such as skins. Thus, the equipment is earned via in-game currency given out after matches and when you level up, which appears, so far, to even things out. In a way, this system is resemblent of a Call of Duty progression system.\n\nA team based shooter, it offers several team-play modes and a more basic Team Deathmatch mode. Players can choose to play as characters from the GitS:SAC series, each of which has a special ability that offers some variety in gameplay. Even in a TDM setting, some of these skills encourage players to stick together and work together to beat the enemy team. This is enforced by some abilites allowing multiple allies to "sync up" and share an ability (Such as Motoko's disguise ability), so anyone who syncs up can reap the benefits. While perhaps nothing that new, the ability systems works rather well, and a well organized ability ambush can be devastating to an ill-maintained team.\n\nObviously, the main draw of the game is its use of the GitS name and the appearance of the show's characters and iconogrophy. A mix up of several types of multiplayer shooters, the game is certainly mneant to appeal to fans of the show. However, those looking for a solid shooter shouldn't be dissapointed either, although they may find a better game elsewhere that does everything this game does even better. It might not be an anime-styled cyberpunk shooter, but that is more or less this title's draw.\n\nAs the game stands, it has most of what I imagine the finished product will have. Movement is rather janky at times, and certain actions can restrict movement. Although it's not impossible to use melee attacks, in fact they can be effective, they are nonetheless difficult to pull off to the point where it seems that the system isn't entirely perfected.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend trying the game on a free weekend or picking it up on a sale. I've had fun with the game so far. I'm interested in the final version.","April 30","true","10.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/recommended/369200/","ximenes","Naked Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/","220 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn interesting game. Feels a bit like CS:GO, but with more focus on teamplay. Quick matches, no health regen, no shields.\n\nCharacters ("Operatives") aren't really unique and all play the same save for their skill, so customization is down to weapons, and with a system that allows for things like barrel mods, sights, grips, clips and more for each weapon, there's a lot to dig into here, even if there aren't that many weapons of each type to test [EDIT 1: There are only a few weapons you start with that unlock as you play. All others are bought with GP, which you get as you level I believe].\n\nGuns can feel a bit... floaty, but not extremely so. Recoil is present, but I haven't activly seen any bullet drop but based on weapon stats I assume there's a DMG falloff.\n\nMy only gripe is that the game throws you into the tutorial right off the bat. Now this wouldn;t be a problem, except the game, for some reason, defaults to 1600x900 and you can't change this without exiting the tutorial entierly. Bright side, you can play the tutorial whenever as it's avalibe from the main screen of the game.\n\nAnother plus here is that the game lets you pick your server region everytime you load it up. Downside is that it doesn't appear to track Steam friends, so you'll need to add people in-game to see them on your friends list.\n\nNow, even though I only picked up the Recruit ($5) access when it was 50% off, this game feel like it's worth that much to get in on the action early. Personally, I'm looking at buying the $30 pack and getting the extra characters, money and skins at some point because I actually like this game and wanna support it.\n\nEDIT 2: While I adore the customization, I feel it needs a bit of a rework, as mods aren't universal, so mods bought for say, the M4A1, only work on that weapon. Meaning that when you get a new weapon, you have to spend even more time and/or GP to get new mods for it. And given that GP takes a while to accumulate (what you get per match is score based and what you get per level takes longer and longer to gain as leverls go higher) this means there's little variation in what weapons people use, since it's easier to just save your GP for things like new operatives and use the starter SMG or AR with a ton of mods on them that you've already gotten.\n\nAnother odd thing is the mod unlocks. While it takes a while to gain the TP needed to unlock them, you also then need to spend GP on them in order to actually be able to use them, which doesn't really make much sense. You also can't chose which mod to unlock, as the game just goes down the list for each weapon.\n\nMarket weapons are also kind of on the expensive side, costing around 120k+ per (on sale, mind you), which again, doesn't really make them worth getting, even if they have better stats, since none of your previously bought/unlocked mods will work on them.\n\nSo yes, the game needs some tweaking, but again, for $5 there's some serious polish already on display here and a lot of potential, so I still beleive it's well worth the investment.","May 1","true","30.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexisplaying/recommended/369200/","alexisplaying","Shinsuke Nakamura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexisplaying/","1531 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs someone who has yet to watch Ghost in the Shell but has always been drawn into the overall aesthetic the series seems to provide, I figured I'd try this game. $5, an online FPS. Why not? To say I'm absolutely shocked with how fun this is would be an understatement.\n\nThe game itself feels like a mix of your standard MMS style shooter (CoD, Battlefield) but with a slight class based system very similar to what is seen in Dirty Bomb. In fact I'd go as far as to call this a Sci-Fi Dirty Bomb with what I'd say is a bit more weighty movement. It feels really REALLY nice. There also seems to be a big focus on going for headshots as well so it's a nice test of skill at times. Body shots kill but headshots absolutely destroy. Like we're talking 2 bullets vs 15 bullets. Getting kills feels super rewarding. It's not exactly counter-strike but it's a pretty nice change of pace compared to most shooters in this style.\n\nAs it stands right now there are only 3 modes. You have your standard TDM, a capture point mode (one point) & another mode called Demolition which I haven't played yet but it seems to be your standard team elimination/bomb defusal deal (someone correct me if I'm wrong on that). I have mainly stuck to TDM as that is what feels like the game is designed around. Everything flows quite well with it, it's a rarity that I find TDM to be the best mode in a shooter but GITS just feels good with that mode.\n\nThe games skillsets for each operative is decently varied going from camo, super armor, faster running speeds & the likes. What is really cool with it how some of these abilities have a tier system. If you build up your points enough you can use a tier 2 ability which will allow you to share your ability with other team mates which means you can potentially be invisible with super armor. It opens up quite a few possibilities with a coordinated team. I really dig that.\n\nMonetization wise there isn't much to speak of right now, the store has practically nothing in it and from what I can tell it's all in game credits. Obviously this will change once the game becomes open to everyone.\n\nMap Variety isn't great (just not enough of them, you'll see all of them within an hour) and they are plagued with some bad spawns at times. It's not game breaking but you will have a ton of "Wait...really I spawned here?" sort of moments after a few hours of play. It's not Battlefront Beta or Spawning on Nuketown with a Chopper Gunner above you bad but it can be a bit off putting at times.\n\nOne of the most welcomed features in this game is the ability to hotkey your aim sensitivity which is something I never knew I wanted until now. You can actually just changed your sensitivity as you're running around in game. Press a button and change it up. This is super useful for those who always change classes or need to make fine adjustments every game depending on how they are playing. I now wish every game has this built in, it's an awesome feature. The one big glaring omission is a field of view slider. Thankfully the default seems to be pretty good (around 80 or 90 if I had to guess) and as someone who typically gets motion sickness in most first person games from low FoV this one has yet to bother me. It's still inexcusable that this is missing.\n\nOh, and performance is great. Maxed out on a GTX970/4790k I'm pushing just over 150FPS without an issue. There is seemingly no lag in game either. This game just performs fantastic. I can see this scaling on lower end machines quite well.\n\nOverall, even for those not familiar with the series this is just a nice fun shooter. For those who are in the market for something casual that takes just a bit more skill than your average shooter or the person that wants a less objective focused Dirty Bomb this if for you.

So lets Start with the good.\n\nPRO's:\n\n- Good options of custimization of what guns/attachments you want, while also delivering on the character front as well.\n- As stated its a Fast actioned FPS (given the severs are balanced/enough players) and can be very fun to play\n- Theres No true overpowerful gear, all players are on a fairly equal battleground\n- Quick time getting into games\n- In game layout is very Nice to look at, not very cluttered at all\n- It could go far in terms of F2P Shooters\n\nSo now the\n\nCON's: (first off tho, these are mild cons, and tbh its like nit-picking)\n\n- Hit registration and Spread\n\nHmm I've seen a lot of people bring this up, so here's my 2 pence (yes I'm British ;)) . First off, when ADS the bullets need to go where the iron sight/red dot is going, it can just fling off in a random direction. yes if the weapon has recoils the bullet indication should go where the red dot goes. so lets say the M4A1 has kicks to the upper right, the red dot sight in screen goes to the upper right, rather than staying still and having your gun spraying in ADS.\n\n- Nano Gel - Broma (A Operator you can chose)\n\nOkay, now before I start, I've used it, and man its....unbalancing to say the least. Yes you can aim for head shots, but like pointed out above, unless you are within a certain rage, that's incredibly hard. and the regen on teir 2, is a little insane. You can also try to outnumber him, that works too, but when this buff is shared with the enemy team, its kinda, just a way to make the game incredibly frustrating. Unlike other skills Like the Hyper-sprint, or Cloak, its not good, it doesn't make you so Over powerful, it just give you a little bonus.\n\n- Terminal Conquest. (like Domination, except one point atcive at a time, and you fight for that node)\n\nFirst off I love this mode...when its balanced, and there's no broma's (look above for Borma/Steam rolling). So whats wrong with this mode, well for every game ive been in, its hard to gain back a point/lead, once the first terminal is taken. So what causes this? For me its the points given for securing a node/bits of teir XP gained from either ally kills/capping Not sure what it is, but I get little bits of teir for doing F**k all) and this really encourages steam rolling. The think tank however is fine, nice mechanic, but I don't like the "here's the hacker mechainc" just make the hacker immobile while hacking.\n\n- GP/XP (money and in game experince)\n\nNow while XP should be harder to get when you level, I think GP needs to go up when you level, as it takes longer to reach your next increment of 50k GP, and just in turn makes you really poor when you reach a certain point, and makes it incredibly hard to to reach a goal of a weapon/attachment. For example I'm A Gold 3 Chevrons (^), and getting GP for me to buy a gun, is just silly. Also I have yet to notice an In game way to buy GP? I would be more than willing to do so.\n\n- Snipers\n\nSo Far with a certain barrel, both guns can oneshot to the body(SA50 and the L188) which is Annoying as its basically an auto snipers. (also I know the L118 only reaches 99 dmg, but trust me it can still oneshot on 100 health to the body)\n\n- Autobalance/Change team option on Pub games\n\nNot much to say, atm its so unbalanced every game, unless you play with mates, and make it balanced yourself which we shouldn't have to do. And no change teams...sometimes I wanna make public games balanced too o/\n\n- Map Size\n\nlast but not least, map size, its so small, and for snipers...they just equip a ACOG sight, its much easier for the map size we have at the moment, and to add to that, its so easy to trap the enemy in their spawn, especially in TDM.\n\ntl;dr Its a good game, with some really big/small things that make it well bad, likr pointed out above. If they can approve on those things, it would make the game 10x better. As you can see, I clearly went into depth on the cons, because they are so Nit picky, and its really just trying to find fault. take hit reg. its common for somwe to like it, some to not. A few of the Con's are just opinion based. the game is £3.99 atm, this is cheap, and good, if I was you pick it up, have a go, Ive spent moneyon much more expensive things and was disapointed, but guess what, I still find myself coming back to this bundle of joy ;)\n","December 21, 2015","true","152.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I love GITS - and I really expected the game to be subpar. I hesitated to buy into it until today. Im glad I did - as some have said, its basically your standard fare for team based shooters - but utilizes its GITS flare very well. The voice acting, the thematic elements, sfx, Tachikoma(!!), it just all fits together well. The controls feel a little stiff at first - but you get used to it. The TTK can be fast but isnt near instant like CoD tends to be - ie: its a little more forgiving to less skilled players - and thats a good thing - because a game should be about fun right?\n\nI also like how there are traditional 'level up' unlocks, along with ingame earned currency purchases of gear. So you have two avenues to aquire new toys instead of *only* unlocking as you level. The concept of implants you earn that slowly burn out is interesting as well - make em count!\n\nOverall, I didnt think it was going to be as enjoyable as it has turned out to be. If you like GITS and you like shooters - you cant really go wrong here ;)\n\nEdits for spelling.","January 15","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I do play them from time to time, but I grow tired of them quickly.\n\nPros:\n- It's Ghost in the Shell themed.\n- There are a decent amount of weapons to choose from but I'd expect more to be added as the game goes on.\n- The Quick Match option was great.  It either put me in a game in progress or added me to a Waiting Room with others to select a Match.\n- The shareable skills were very awesome.\n- I could select from a list of weapons to work on unlocking next.\n\nCons:\n- I could not select which Mods to unlock next on my weapons.\n- Some weapons (like the 870 shotgun you can unlock) have no Mods to unlock or purchase while others have very few.  I hope that these will be added as the game goes live.\n\nIf you like Team PvP and Ghost in the Shell, then I think that this game is worth your time.\n","May 2","true","11.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsunay34/recommended/369200/","kitsunay34","Kitsunay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kitsunay34/","36 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGhost in the Shell was quite a unique IP for its time, melding elements of sci-fi with philosophical concepts and well-developed characters. In particular, it developed a gritty, almost film noir style of narrative punctuated by some very nice tactical and action sequences. This game is a callback to that world, with many of the recognizable characters, weapons, and abilities wrapped up in a counterstrike reminescent package.\n\nGitS: First Assault draws a lot of positive inspiration from counterstrike; well-balanced maps and weapons, some of the fun gamemodes, and even some of the UI. The game is a joy to play and relatively stable as far as FPS netcode goes. Like counterstrike, twitch reflexes are second to good situational awareness (I have a decided lack of both). Despite this, I really enjoyed gameplay and found that both objective control and run & gun strategies were viable.\n\nThe abilities bring a unique twist to the counterstrike formula and I was really surprised that they weren't overpowered. Somehow they're all useful in any gamemode, and there's no huge reason to choose one over the other. Matoko's tactical camouflage is true to its appearance in the anime and while noticeable, it's just transparent enough that distracted enemies don't spot you as you run to cover or past them.\n\nThere isn't solely praise to be said; the launcher began crashing when I entered my login details a few times without having registered. I had to verify/repair the game's data to fix the problem. When your client falls out of sync with the game state, hit boxes don't align properly and enemy players teleport (not by enough to be noticed while aiming). These issues are sporadic and you can learn to see when it begins happening, but it can be jarring the first time another player eats 2 full clips of ammo and doesn't take damage.\n\nThere is a very nice in-universe excuse for the tutorial, and although the tutorial is effective, I did find one glitch; the portion that had me throwing grenades was not letting me pass. It turns out the grenades were not doing any damage to the NPCs that spawned; I had to kill them with the pistol before they began to take grenade damage properly.\n\nThink tanks are a little bit too resilient, but Batou has a skill that makes short work of them. I think they rightfully have a lot of health, but I feel that hacking them to weaken their armour takes a very long time. Perhaps it would be good to see if hacking them twice as fast will help with this?\n\nThere also seem to be a few players capable of actually hacking the game. In one round, a player equipped with the melee weapon seemed to be jumping a distance of 20 ft. There was also a player getting constant one-hit kill headshots with a silenced weapon near spawn, but that could very well have been skill. Hacking seems uncommon, thankfully. In this game, good use of abilities can really help to catch opponents off-guard, so there's a viable answer that more or less equalizes the playing field.\n\nThe interface and audio were fairly good, and despite using dialogue by characters, it isn't done to the point of being annoying. The jumping and climbing animations feel clunky, but perhaps that's the intention. Melee is fairly hard to do because a player's instinct is to click it within arm's reach of the opponent. Instead, it activates when you are practically hugging them, so it's remarkably difficult to get melee. One of my opponents tried for a minute while I simply walked out of the petit range. I then mercilessly shot him down.\n\nAlthough it isn't without criticism, First Assault is very fun and integrates many elements of GitS story well. I'm looking forward to playing this one more. Nexon has some bugs to crush and one or two things to balance, but I definitely recommend the game.","April 30","true","44.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

If you love CoD like gameplay, you may like this.\n- 3 typical I've-seen-it-all modes, though more may come in future.\n- Guns sound and feel solid.\n- 2-tier level abilities for each class. Batou has more armor, Motoko has cloaking, Maven has a placeable shield, and so on.\n- Small but existing reward system that gives bonus xp or items after each map.\n- Weapons unlock as you play more. Though you can purchase them directly using in-game virtual currency or of course, the mandetory currency gained from real money. The in-game currency is given after every level up. So far I've seen it giving me 50k/level up.\n- Explosion causes damage to the body and you will find severed heads and limbs after an explosive encounter.\n- Augmentation system for physical enhancements (i.e. Faster side-stepping). This allows for slight adjustment to your movements, reload speed, etc for combat advantage.\n\nBad:\n- NO support class to provide ammo. Though this may change if the game mode dictates in future.\n- All guns can pretty much one shot you from any distance if you manage to land a headshot. Kind ruins the purpose of PDW and long-range weapons.\n- Dying behind wall...is back. Though to some extent, far less evident compared to BF4's nightmarish issue.\n- No environmental effects. It feels dead and boring.\n- Only 7v7 match so far. Does 16 sound ominous, let alone 32?\n\nFood for thought:\n- This is year 2029 (if you take the anime timeline) and technologically humans have gone so far ahead, still we are using AK and M4? Where is the creativity with guns and concepts? They already veered off significantly in terms of gameplay mechanics, why not go with guns as well? They do use some real-world guns in the anime, but why stick with that, when you could tweak the design and add more fictional components to the weapons?\n- All except Togusa are cyborgs. You should be able to jump high, land from great height, do feats that are otherwise not feasible for humans, yet most of those are not present.\n- As a cyborg, you have extra strength, yet you don't carry extra ammo or more than two weapons (excluding melee). GITS is famous for hacking and diving into networks, but you don't get to dive into network or hack modules/turrets.\n\nOverall I think it's a good FPS game, but certainly no where near what GITS stands for. They just took the rights to use the setting/characters to make an FPS where the gist of the game got lost. If you are a serious fan of GITS, you will be disappointed, as I am. Just treat the game as if it's not GITS, but another generic shoot-and-level-up FPS, and perhaps you may enjoy it a bit more. Combat is solid but without fully utilizing the tech from the related universe, this feels bland.\n\nNow let's hope they make an RPG GITS. Finger crossed.\n","May 2","true","10.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

Actually all animations were great and all, HUD was looking pretty nice as well. In short it could be a pretty solid shooter. Also the game is quite small, well at least at the moment, so it's a pretty much 1-2 minute download and play, of course depending on the internet speed the person has.\n\nNow on to the part I didn't like that much:\n\nSpecifications needed to run this game, are you sure you are right on with those? I don't see this game requiring much above an i3 if even that, yet an i5 2500 is in the recommended list, might want to lower that a little, the graphics aren't bad but they don't look THAT demanding, neither is it open world what would require a lot of processing power.\nSecondly, framerate - While I myself have a pretty high-tier computer, I would expect the game to run very fast but for some reason it feels like it's under a framerate lock even with vsync off, does not matter if it's on low, medium or high, not saying it's unplayable but the trailers you guys do run a lot faster with 60 frames while I myself don't get that feeling exactly or maybe it's just me.\nAlso, moving feels a bit clunky somehow, it does not really bother me, but it could be a bit polished.\nOther than that I don't have much to complain about on this first look.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nThis is a class based game, class based games work well in CO-OP, would love to see CO-OP here, not a generic stale zombie survival (of course it can be there still as an extra), but actual CO-OP missions, if a team executes it well on a hard settings they could be rewarded their own way, also while doing CO-OP they could familiarize with their classes more and use them more effectively in Player versus Player rooms.\nBigger maps would be a lot nicer, also if you do plan on CO-OP you could make tactical insertion points, like how to breach some place to keep the mission interesting. Right now the maps feel a bit Call of Duty like, I got all these fun gadgets to use, yet I get mowed down in a choke point.\nLastly, indeed some classes could use a fix, for example Motoko's cloak or what you call it, could have less visibility when you execute the cloak, when you skill sync the cloak with someone else it could remain at the same visibility level.\nAlso one big suggestion would be leaning, so many times I see good cover with little use, I don't know how others would react to this but I would like leaning for more tactical viewpoints and firefights.\n\nThis is pretty much it at this first look, would be nice to play more and experience more, but free weekends don't last forever. Overall this game has potential and I am interested to see what it becomes into.\n\nIf you read all this text until this part, you deserve a reward.

Early access with lots to come in the future hopefully! Make your team stealthed, give everyone super sprint speed, and then wreck the enemy team. Lots of fun!\n\n\nStill early access so don't go into this game thinking you are going to get a full game. Only 3 game modes at the moment, Team Deathmatch, a capture the position type of match, and plant the bomb/defend from bomb type of match. Some different maps available to play on. 8ish different "classes" you can play as each with a unique ability. Differernt guns available and eventually will have gun skins you will be able to purchase. Able to have a party with 5 people.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty awesome overall. Guns and stuff are expensive to buy new ones. But buying the $9 early access pack gave me 100,000 credits and hitting level 2 gave me 50,000.

In order to enjoy this game, it ultimately depends on the type of gamer you are.\nIf you're a player of Counter Strike, Call of Duty, or the up-and-comers like Dirty Bomb (Also in Early Access) and Blizzard's own Overwatch, then you will certainly feel at home here.\n\nHowever it is clearly not a complete game.\n\n-I will fire an entire clip only to be double-shot into the afterlife by the enemy I was just unloading into.\n-Matchmaking is broken as I just got off a lobby where I won two matches in Demolition because it was my Seven versus their... two. Two people. Team Deathmatch seems to be the only one that has a stable team balance. However the game could use a shuffle mechanic after every match, otherwise lobbies seem to remain the same so it's just asking for a curbstomp if your enemies are superior players. (Dirty Bomb has this).\n-It feels as if there's basically only two guns with just a few mods per. Matches are dominated by the MP5.\n-The servers are fickle and will kick me off the game after every complete match.\n-The P2W element is small, for now. I've purchased the elite pack and all it really did for me was give me 500,000 in-game "credits", wherein you get 50,000 every time you level up. This allowed me to get the better SMG and some mods but not much else. My KDR remains at a solid .80 regardless of my 'better equipment'.\n-It's possible to spawn camp. Being on the recieving end of this is maddening. This can be fixed with some kind of spawn protection mechanic, wherein the campers would be deterred from this strategy as they'd get wiped out by temporarily "invincible" players. (Dirty Bomb also has something like this and it works).\n\nAnd yes. It's early access. As long as the devs stay on top of things, some of this might be remedied in the coming months.","December 15, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soupy_scoopy/recommended/369200/","soupy_scoopy","LordScoobert","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soupy_scoopy/","35 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMind you this is review was based on the early access game as it was available on a F2P weekend.\n\nI loved the movies, series and everything to do with the entire universe of Ghost in the Shell, I decided to give the game a go during its free to play weekend deal. It has a lot of call outs to the anime series, using the same voice actors for the Major, Batou etc. However thats where anything to do with the universe ends. I played it for awhile and genuinely had fun and enjoyed running and gunning, but there were little things that I noticed that I wasn't to fond of.\n\nThe quick and dirty:\nThe game feels a little clunky in the controls, looks and sounds great. Provides a cheap run and gun experience however the damage system is basically aim for the head as you won't do damage elsewhere. Its entertaining but don't expect more than that.\n\nGameplay:\nIts by and far a standard FPS with a couple of other elements. Its fun and engaging, punishing and fast paced. Bullet damage seems to be way underpowered to anywhere that isn't the head. Any shot to the head is a garunteed one hit kill. Moving on from that, the skills used by the individual 'classes' or in this case characters, are recharged over time and gained by getting kills. They're all pretty basic; theres invisibility, increased damage resistance, super sprint, an invisibility sheath. Some of these can be shared with up to three teammates, and some just get powered up when they reach tier 2. This was pretty cool I thought and really encourages team play or at least being near your teammates. The leveling system seems sluggish, you unlock equipment for your gear buy using it but it comes slow, I didn't unlock anything for any of the weapons I was using while playing. I had to buy stuff to get optics or silencers. You also get in game currency which allows you to buy them from the marketplace; this includes new weapons. The currency you win from matches comes slow, so you can't run one match and then buy one of the better guns in the game. Another thing with the guns is oh my god the recoil. Aiming down the sights is a nightmare and really teaches you to burst fire instead of going full auto. Not necessarily a negative point, but it does take some getting used to. Theres a limited number of maps and with the map voting system it just seems like I was playing the same ones over and over. Some maps have fixed spawn points for each team, some maps have moving spawn points. One final thing to mention is that shotguns are horrendously overpowered in this game.\nWhen I was starting up the game I was hoping for a small team based co-op game involving AI and stealth missions rather than this run and gun FPS.\n\nUniverse:\nSure its called Ghost in the Shell, sure it has the characters and voice actors, but beyond that it doesn't feel like the universe at all. Theres no futuristic weaponry; all the weapons in game are just modified modern weapons to look futuristic. The maps and settings have no GITS feel to them, you could copy and paste them into any other sci-fi shooter and it wouldn't make a difference. So far theres nothing with the tachikomas other than you see them in one map being worked on. The only thing this game holds onto in the universe is the characters.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see where they go with the game. Again this is early access but who knows what the final product would be. I'd recommend it for a cheap FPS shooter game, but don't expect the world of it.","April 30","true","24.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So, i won't be able to compare this game with its anime.\n\nPros :+ Classes with unique skills.\n+ Customizable weapons.\n+ Fast paced combat.\n+ Good looking UI.\n+ Skill-Sync\n+ Cheap.\n+ Cyberpunk themed.\n+ Competitive.\n\nCons :- Classes are unbalanced.\n- Bad spawn locations.\n- No spawn protection, spawnkilling.\n- Pay to win.\n- Spraying is all about RNG, hope you are lucky.\n- Small maps.\n- Bad graphics.\n- Hard aiming and movement.\n- Weapons do almost no damage. (Except HS)\n- Low player count.\n- No ragdolls.\n- There are better F2P games on internet.\n\nConclusion :Not bad for a cheap, early access game. There are lots of bugs and annoying features or lack of good features. But still, i am having fun and raging at the same time.\n\nI really don't know why but i'm enjoying this. Even though this game still needs lots of features, i recommend it.","December 15, 2015","true","25.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I especially love how they are useing the voices from the actual show! This makes the game feel more supported and accepted by the creators of the show and all around keeping the love of so many Anime Players/Watchers/Supporters out there!!! They understand that many are out there so keeping them on board is a great way to keep a game talked about and alive. I would have to say also that this game shows a lot of potential, totally worth $5. If you want to spend more to get some neat things, then go ahead it is still worth if you want to invest as long as they keep going down the road that they are heading. the game still needs to be a bit optimized cause fps drop some times but I am sure they will be addressing this (crosses fingers) Many times the game feels like Call of duty: ANIME EDITION, but that being said its not in a bad way, but that being said I would reccomend it to people who like running and gunning hands down for sure this plays kinda like COD(nuketownish at times) and battlefield. I hope they will bring out bigger and over all more things to do in maps so not to be small like mentioned nuketown. One thing I don't 100% like is Its primarally PVP atm though hoping it gets PVE and story content with some co-op to go though not just fight teams in small maps. I would say with the lack of PVE type stuff that even with the characters however it still doesnt have the feel of the series. I really am hoping with later patches and as the game grows they will include much more, but we will have to wait and see on that I guess.\n\nI do wonder about Why is there no controller support, but a part of me is kinda glad because with controllers they need to add AIM Assist and as players who play COD games and other stuff know how broken they are and screwed up. I think it would create a unwanted and not needed problem while they make and add more to the game. so over all I am glad it is not being used.\n\n\nI will have to say that the guns are all decent and that I have found a few guns I enjoy but will be unlocking more as I play to really see how that goes. Many of the guns feel they are from other common games like Modern Warfare and games like that, this does make them familer but kinda feels odd because the game is so much in the Future that simple weapons weird, but the show kinda does that too so its "ya ok cool"  but I do hope they add a few "lazered" type weapons without making Overpowerd of make skins that have the guns look different tottaly! now that would be really cool. Skins that make a MP5 look like a Halo style gun or something crazy lol.\n\nWell this is all I will be putting down so far, as the game progresses I will be adding more things I see that I like and dislike. Below are some pros and cons I have seen so far and I know many other people have seen some too that are like it. I read in game chat and see lots of it being screamed out good and bad hahahah.\n\nPro's -\n\n-Fast paced fps action\n-So far no screaming little children you have to mute :D\n-Skill's and Skill sync (Skill sync shares your skill with other players so they can use it also and that makes the game REALLY neat)\n-For the weapons they do have, neat mods and graphics but need more and I am sure that will happen.\n-Teamates are not the smartest but its a new game and to be expected (Similar to Call of Duty Feel with less intent to squeeze tons of real $$ like CoD lol)\n-only 5 bucks to get in, soon to be free to play\n-???? Original english voice actors ????\n-i like the sounds, shooting, deaths, hits sounds etc...\n-Get lots of money for leveling up every other level it seems maybe more. Like 50k, a brand new wep costs 150k - 200k so if you save you can buy a new wep I wouldn't say its to expensive decent enough.\n-Weapons seem balanced for the most part, some weapons could be Overpowered but waiting to see what happens as game devlops\n- Good options of custimization of what guns/attachments you want, while also delivering on the character front as well. but need lots more to make making your opertive more personalized with out REAL $$$ what I am scared might happen.\n- As stated its a Fast actioned FPS (given the severs "players internet" are balanced/enough players but needs some work) and can be very fun to play\n- Theres No true overpowerful gear, all players are on a fairly equal battleground\n- Quick time getting into games\n- In game layout is very Nice to look at, not very cluttered at all\n- It could go far in terms of F2P Shooters\n-graphic are ok, hope they add HD ones but without scrippling the game without rubber band and also making it punish you by slowing game down for wanthing to see a better game but making you a easier target that some games do. FPS boosting by lowering and getting unfair advantage.\n-sound is great so far, needs more adjusting ablity to fine tune some sounds you want and sounds you don't want to hear.\n\n\nCon's -\n\n-Auto-balance seems a bit broken some times.\n-Spawn camping when autobalance doesnt work its broken right now.\n-Small Maps (in DM and Demo) Larger maps and more of them are NEEDED.\n-right now not much of content but its still early acess so we will see.\n-Would like somthing more to do in "Pre-Game" matrix type mode\n-Would like the ability to take off scope and have things like iron sights (but I they may add more stuff later so need to wait and see.\n-only 2 pistols/secondary? I hope they add more later.\n-only one kind of knife (they will adds skins and such I am sure, but seems kinda eeh)\n-At the moment, can only party up with 2 other people at a time to join games.\n-server could be a bit better (Oh WAIT, that is right, it does the call of duty thing and uses players games as the servers.....and uses the worst connected player most times)\n-technical issues sometimes (wait for patch)","December 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Spawn killing may become a problem, though I have never witnessed anything like that during my playthrough.\n-No health regeneration. That's fine, but there needs to be an ammo drop or a medpack when you kill an enemy.\n\nConclusionThe gameplay isn't groundbreaking, but it's nice to find a F2P FPS game that feels similar to COD. IMO, don't buy into Early Access, just wait until the free launch.","December 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To explain it simply, each character has a special skill they can use, and by racking up kills you can go up to "tier 2 skill" which is the same skill, but every teamates near you will have the option to use it if they are close enough to you. So instead of boosting a player who's already doing well, it actually boosts his teamates, sharing his skill with them.\n\nThe interface is a bit confusing at first, and I have yet to find a way to invite a friend while in-game (not in lobby).\nThe unlocks seem a bit lacking, but it's a bit early for me to judge.\nThe maps are also a bit too small for demolition.\nI paid 2$ for this game, and for what I expected to be a weeaboo cashgrab, Im really enjoying myself more than I should.\n\nIt is very accessible to anyone, and the matches dont take long so you can just jump in for a few frags if you dont have that much time on your hands.\nThe game is still in early access has I am writing this.\nLooking forward for more updates, new maps, etc.\n\nit deserves a solid 8/10\n\nEdit : On a side note, I think the sensitivity on the sniper rifle while zoomed in is way too high. Ther is a way to lower it in the settings, but if you do, all the other guns are too slow. I hope the devs will balance the ironsight sensitivity with the sniper rifle scope sensitivity so you dont have to mess with the settings everytime you change gun.","May 2","true","14.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sometimes I find myself feeling like the kill I got or was on the recieving end of wasn't fair, and not just in a regular "oh come on I got them" way.\n\nBut all those are things I expect in an unfinished version of a game.\n\nOverall it feels good to play, which if you are like me, is what you want in a shooter. Movement feels fluid, guns have a solid thump to them, music is pretty much what you could hope for, non-obtrusive, but adding some tenseness and excitement of the game. The community seems friendly enough so far. Characters and the world will be familar to Ghost in the Shell fans, but being a movie/anime game doesn't stop it from being perfectly enjoyable by people who don't know the original movie or The Stand Alone Complex series.\n\nIt feels like a more casual and more varied CS:GO. I genuinely think this game has the potential to be a really great game from what I've played so far, and it's already fun although a bit wonky with balance issues.\n\nPeople concerned about pay to win fear not, so far so good.

But the need to check out new FPS games gave me the courage to do it. I jumped into the game with the Elite Early Access Pack and I am rather impressed. I fully understand the game is still in early access so I wasn't expecting much. What I saw was a really polished game with awesome graphics and animation.\nPro:\nF2P on launch, Pay for skins only.\nGood Graphics\nPolished gameplay (did not experience crashes, stutters etc)\nLike the characters, abilities and the gunplay (did not watch anime so I cannot say if the game missed anime potential)\nRealistic Movements (running, switching weapons, recoil of the weapons, passing obstacles all have immersive animations and reasonable execution time)\nEvery match gives you random boost, unlockables for you to try\nCon:\nPlayer base isn't large possibily due to 5 dollar barrier to access, not sure about the game due to reviews etc\n\nOverall, I really enjoy this game. I am glad I gave this game a chance and I hope those of you who read this review can give this game a chance.

Team based shooter, class based abilities, and a well planned cash shop to enhance cosmetics (and experience/currency boosters).\n\nAs an all around player the game modes are fun and enticing as you first dive in, but can leave some players bored quickly. But as a fan of both the show and fps games, I find no lack of amusing references along side the somewhat balanced gameplay.\n\nStats do make a difference and as you gain currency, I encourage you to plan out what guns/attachments you believe you'd enjoy playing with before you can afford them. But as long as you play accurately and as a team, gun choice won't make or break the game as a whole for you.\n\nAdmittedly (as of the time of this writing) the hitboxes are a little broken and can leave one confused on wether or not their smg is really hitting more often at point blank than the assault rifle from 50 feet further away, but given due consideration for early access, I expect it to improve with time.\n\nOverall I love the game for the based lore and expect great things from the vast potential the IP possesses, but in time I hope to see a co-op campaign along side the PvP it's currently strictly aiming for.\n\n(I thought what I'd do was, I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes ...

It feels like they tried to make a generic shooter with special skills, and they just failed. The skills feel underpowered and are given to you too easily. I would not reccomend every buying this if it doesn't make some drastic changes from the early acces.\n\nOkay, at first glance I didn't really want to play this game, it didn't look very appealing to me. After talking to a friend we decided to play a little together to see if it was actually any good. Frankly, it was not.\n\nThe graphics aren't very good, but that's not really the problem here. All enemies look the same, and this is a problem when you can choose classes, since you can't actually see what skills your opponent has. On top of that, the skills you can choose just don't feel very rewarding anyway. You start the game off with your skill charged, yet it feels like it should be a reward for killing enemies. The skills feel very underpowered as well. The sentry does basically nothing, I have legitimately seen enemies just stand in front of it and shoot it without dying.\n\nMoving on from the skills, the weapons feel clunky. They feel too inaccurate, the guns have some sort of recoil, which feels like it should be controllable by moving your mouse in the opposite direction, but you can't. They're just too random for it to work. Apart from this the senitivity feels klunky and awkward although this may just be me. I feel the same about the zoom sensitivity, I just couldný get it to feel comfortable.\n\nWhen you just ignore the gameplay itself, the game doesn't run very well at all. It doesn't look very good and runs terribly. I managed 60 fps while playing on medium settings, but this feels way too low as I can easily run Battlefield 4 on ultra at 60 fps.\n\nOverall I just wouldn't reccomend actually buying this. If you do decide to try it out, make sure to try it within the refund period so you don't waste money on a generic shooter that doesn't work very well.","April 28","false","0.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

(edit: review created after the first hour the game came out)\n\nI didn't buy it at first, because of the bad reviews. I saw people complaining about:\n- a virus\n- graphics\n- simplicity\n\nFirst off, I ran 2 virus scans after playing an online match and my software didn't pick up anything.\n\nSecond, the graphics suck at launch, but after proper adjustment they're pretty good for a game that just came out in early acess.\n\nThird, yes, the game is simple. Gun wise and gameplay, but it works. Think COD 4 with abilities, and cyber stuff :-D\n\nOverall, if you're a fan of the series I highly recommend this game.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUpdate:\n\nWould still recommend this game. Here's some pros and cons I found:\n\nPros:\n- Weapon customization\n- Operative customization (almost like perks in COD)\n- Slots open for more weapons in the future\n- Rare items available after matches such as exp 500%\n- They weave the anime in here nicely. For example when you click on "dive in" or want to look at an operative's info/background\n- Original voices from the series\n- Low quality game so even a non-gaming computer can run it (my MSI Dominator can run it maxed out without the power cord in on balanced mode, and my fans don't even turn on)\n- Can unlock certain weapons just by playing online\n- Snipers feel like COD 4 snipers (could be good or bad, depends on you)\n- Apparently shotguns are in the game, have yet to see one in action, but I give the devs credit for including all weapon classes (or almost all)\n- Body destruction when dead is pretty cool. Ex. head gets blown off when someone gets a headshot on you, legs, and arms can get blown off too depending on what happened to you.\n- How you see your avatar vs. what the enemy sees. This was a genius move. So you see your teamates like their usual operative self, but the enemy sees them as mean red guys :O\n\nCons:\n- Not all hits register\n- Matchmaking doesn't make sense (high levels vs. low levels)\n- Seems like it takes forever to get in-game currency\n- ALMOST a run and gun game (which defeats the purpose of having different operatives, and the ability to share abilities)\n- Snipers are only 1 shot 1 kill if headshot (unless that's a good thing for you, otherwise I'd prefer chest-up)\n- SMGs seem to do little damage (even though I've seen people go on kill streaks with them)\n- Assault rifles could use a boost on the stability (SMG recoil and Rifle recoil are slightly different)\n- It feels like people get headshots fairly easy\n- Teamwork is somewhat essential. Like I said, someone running around with an SMG who can get heashots with no problem, and sprays can take out a few newbie operatives with no problem. (once again this can be good or bad based on your view)\n\nWhat I'd like to see:\n- More in-game currency gain from completing a match\n- More of a difference between rifle and SMG\n- Controller support","December 14, 2015","true","4.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

For fans of Stand Alone Complex, the characters are fully realized and voice-acted, which is very nice.\n\nThe game is not pay-to-win, but it is pay-to-progress faster. Take that as you will, although unlockable weapons lean more towards being sidegrades than superior choices.\n\nThe two objective-based game modes are intense and exhilarating as team members share their unique skills with eachother to gain an advantage over the enemy team. Optic camo on, shields up, thermal vision activated - this is awesome, and very rewarding.\n\nFinal words: The game is still in a beta of sorts, but it responsive, action-packed, and has a good gameplay loop that puts rewards within your grasp and does not feel too grindy.

I only played for one hour during the free weekend, but I don't think I'll be returning.\n\nThe shooting is competent, the node-capture mode and team deathmatch work well enough. There's guns, sights and stat bonuses to grind or pay for. Characters (classes) have activated abilities that allow for some diversity; there's cloaking, deploying turrets or drones, seeing enemies through walls, super speed, that kind of thing. 2 other teammates can use the ability you have active too, which is a neat idea. You spawn with a gun, a pistol, 1 grenade, and a knife that will one-hit-kill, so be ready to encounter the sprint+knife build.\n\nFor me, the thing that makes me not recommend it to most people is that it's just such a waste of a license. You've got a series built on political intrigue and musings on what human digitalization will mean for the world, punctuated with action scenes. How is a multiplayer FPS a good match for that at all? There's recognizable stuff from Ghost in the Shell all over the game, but it feels shoehorned into a game template. Teammates will look like Section 9 characters, but they're just skins with distinct activated abilities. When you capture a node, a tachikoma will show up to blast some enemies for a while, but you can't enter it and it's not very agile. It looks like a think-tank when it's on the opposing side, just as the enemy characters will look like generic baddies.\nIt's just meaningless shootybangs in a setting that is so much richer than this.\n\nIf you're into multiplayer FPS, there's nothing really wrong here, and there's a few cool twists. If you want a Ghost in the Shell game, look elsewhere, like the PS2 third person shooter Stand Alone Complex game (I guess the PSP FPS sequel is where it all started to go wrong).","May 3","false","1.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","4"

I can't really explain it, but they just feel really "stiff", you don't seem to be the one in control as to where the bullets will go. Just pick a direction and hope for the best. I tried a few matches, came first somehow and had no desire to play it ever again.\n\nI played this game like Call of Duty and came first on my team and we won (played a few more matches in different modes just now with similar results). So yeah, it plays like CoD. No matter what the other people say.\n\nThe main difference between Black Ops 3, Blacklight Retribution and FA is that the gunplay doesn't feel clunky as hell in the first two mentioned games. The weapons are also more satisfying.\n\nThe shooting does feel like it's just luck based unless you are at a super close range, then it doesn't matter where you aim because the person who sprays better with an SMG will win. If you are engaging from a longer distance, then there is no telling as to who will win an engagement, the recoil pattern makes little sense. After figuring that out I just stayed away from long range engagements and focused on getting kills at super close range with an SMG, worked out quite well.\n\nFA feels like something out of 2007 when you play it, both graphically and gameplay wise. The textures look dated (Saito's hair is hideous!), the maps are rather bland and the UI is a complete mess.\n\nBasically it's a generic F2P FPS that got slapped with the Ghost in the Shell license to attract the fans of the series.\n\n\nOh and you can't access the options until you finish/skip the tutorial.\n\nAll in all you can give it a go if you like, but personally I wouldn't waste my time on it and just play Black Ops 3 or Blacklight Retribution.","April 28","false","1.1"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","4"

As soon as you fire 2 or more shots from your assault rifle it flies out of control. ADS with an assault rifle or smg is too slow to aim, even with the settings set to 100. ADS with a sniper rifle is way too fast. So there is no settings that is perfect for all guns. Meleeing is just terrible, even when up in the enemy's face.\n\nThe business practices is not P2W, just grindy if you want to get everything from ingame currency (they do give generious amount of credits. Only reached lvl 7 so I don't know how far till it stops). Operator Licences you can unlock with ingame currency/NX points (real money). So it's pretty much the same business as to in Dirty Bomb (or some would cry DB is P2W and GitS isn't just baffles me)\n\nSo for me it's just another generic shooter with a GitS skin on top.","April 30","false","2.6"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","5"

But, for what it has to offer, First Assault is an enjoyable game. People were afraid it would be P2W (pay-to-win) since it's being released by Nexon, a company well known for their implementation of micro-transactions. But as of right now, the weapons seem to be balanced and gameplay is fair. This could change in the future of course, but right now First Assault has proven to be a good online FPS. The gameplay might be reminiscent to that of Call of Duty, which may be a bad thing for some people, since it would be seen as generic, there are some differences however. First Assault tries to put more emphasis on teamwork in the demolition and terminal conquest modes, what I've also noticed is that there is no regenerative health unlike Call of Duty. Some have made the argument that it's a CoD reskin, but First Assault tries it's best to maintain the aspects of the GITS universe. Like I've said, this is an enjoyable game. My only gripes are that the textures seem a bit unpolished, and the maps are relatively small.\n\nIn conclusion, definitely give it a chance if you're considering. Since it's in early access currently, there's a small fee to get in ($4.99). However, sometime in early 2016 the game will be free to play, and would most likely be fixed of any technical bugs found with possibly some new content added.","December 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though the pay model isn't really finalized, it sounds like it might be as accessible as old timer Blacklight Retribution, which is a huge plus.

That being said, I'm happy. I'm a hardcore GiTS fan and this game makes me smile when I start it up. The usage of the original english voice cast (except Crispin Freeman, unless I miss my mark) really got the fan boner going.

(say what you will for realism, but I'd rather hit my targets)\n-Attachment costs for weapons are just a tad exhorbitant.\n-Spawnkilling is a major issue as there's no form of spawn protection or penalty for the other team being in your spawn.\n-Placement of spawns in relation to objectives (I'm looking at you, Tachikoma Conquest).\n- No Co-op or other PvE mode.\n-Stealth seems to be pretty ineffective unless you're braindead.\n\nThe Ugly:\n-Not enough Tachikoma.\n-SMG and AK-47's dominate everything.\n-Sniper is useless given current map selection (as well as toggle scope being the only option)\n-Not enough Tachikoma.\n-No method to regain health unless you or a teammate run nano-gel armor.

Everyone seems to say the maps are tiny but they're filled with opportunities for creating chokepoints and flanking manouvers. At this stage you will probably get more out of CS or CoD but what do you want for $5? As for me, I'm not and FPS um... MLG gamer? Ghost in the Shell, particularly SAC is a cultural touchstone for me so the asthetics play a big part in my enjoyment. Saying that there is not much for a hard core Ghost in the Shell fan as of yet aside from asthetics, but that's enough for me. The makers seem to have a good handle on the themes and characters but have simply had to prioritise gameplay so we might get a little more development in the future.","December 15, 2015","true","27.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

DONT LET IT SCARE YOU!\n\nAfter 9 hours of game play i can say this game is fun as hell, game play may feel weird at first and put some poeple off but as you play it. You'll  will get more into it as you play the skills in this game are a big deal be wise when using them becouse timing is everything between killing one person or clearing an entire objective you pick.\n\nPos-Cyberpunk! Gun fights are thrilling and dont even get me started on the knifing in this game you will have to feel it for your self just saying assassinations are done well. Love the end of game rewards picked one of 3 hacks to get a end of game bonus. Also the shop is great no pay-to-win customizations are another great part on your guns and youre char them self.  As you level you will unlock phiycal, agility and cyberbrains that you can apply to give you an edge in battle. Example Seeker drones go out and hunt targets you can get an agility add on that puts a camera on it so you can see what it see's.\n\nNeg-Couple negatives are the lack of a kick function so far and no ingame voice chat.\nProblem with spawning on game modes mostly only notice  it on TDM with people spawning behind you or there is also the simular proplem with the capture game mode being pind at your spawn but tbh it has made for some really funny moments.\n\nAnti camp-On the other hand this game is really fast pasted and for the campers out there try and play this game and see what happens one of the most anti camp games i have played in a long time keep your head on a swivel at all time.\n\nAnime fans-When it comes to the anime in the game its a nice bonus if your a fan voices and char models are done vary well your going to wan to play the game just for the experance.\n\nIf youre on the fence dont be anymore pick her up!

This game has potential, I just hope that it attempts to avoid the P2W route like most F2P FPS games end up doing (aka VERY BADLY).\n\nPros:\n+++ All the Section 9 characters are there! Even a Tachikoma (on KOTH mode), with original voice lines.\n+ Influences team based play.\n+ Easy to understand Tutorial\n+ Most weapons are pretty balanced\n+ Nice concept and Interface\n+ Fast and clean when in combat\n+ Leveling up rewards you with more goodies.\n\nCons:\n- Very iffy matchmaking\n- Auguments are ok... Its that they have a durability.\n- Hit boxes\n- Microtransactions\n-\n\nGITS: First Assault - SAC (Full Review)\n\nI first got the Early Access to play something else besides CS:GO, with that I also wanted to help the Dev’s out with the game as a beta tester that could find game breaking glitches or issues. Yes, the weapons and items do not look like the ones directly from the anime/manga series. Please be aware that the devs are working (hopefully) on something that ties those weapons in.\n\nWhen first launched I was automatically thrown into the tutorial level. The one thing that tutorial levels lack in the F2P category is the aggressiveness of the average player and how to combat that. This is good, but I believe that it should be tweaked to understand how the community would play the game (more aggressive) than how the dev’s would see us play the game.\n\nPower Sync - Sharing your powers with everyone in your squad (doesn’t apply for Rocket Launch and Drones). Sharing is caring.\n\nWhen entering my first multiplayer match, the set up is similar to most FPS games. These are the game current modes: TDM, S&D, KOTH. The one that stands out the most from all of these is KOTH, this version relays a direct award whenever you capture a point. You are rewarded with a Tachikoma/ThinkTank that fights for or against you.\n\nBesides the modes, the game is indefinitely directed for you to be a team with your squad members, without them you’re good as dead each round.\n\nI'd like to see this game go into the more leveling up route than the pay 2 win route, it entices players to keep playing and doesn't deter newer players from buying up.\n\nThe best thing about this so far is that you are forced to play to unlock certain weapons in the game (example OP shotgun), I like this idea the best because it prevents people from buying all of the weapons all at once.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game because of its aspects and playstyles, it has good potential.","December 15, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Verneo/recommended/369200/","Verneo","Warden Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Verneo/","170 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've come to this game as someone who is more a fan of Ghost in the Shell than modern FPS games so please bare this in mind.\n\n1. Games Mechanics & Theme\n2. Issues\n3. Final Thoughts\n-----------------------\n\n1 Game Mechanics and Theme\nThe game goes above and beyond to make the gunfire feel realistic.  The animations are well beyond the level I would expect from a smaller Studio (E.g. a non-triple-A studio), the feel, hip-fire / aiming down sights and scoped all seem very complete.  The recoil is something you will hear a lot about this game, it's insane.  It favours a style of play that makes me think of Rainbow 6 meets TF2.  As you start to level you start to naturally form squad tactics because if you don't and run in guns blazing you can kiss your ♥♥♥ goodbye.  Any headshot will stop you in your tracks really, regardless of calabre. Squad tactics are also reinforced by a localised special ability buff that can be shared by a few of the playable characters.  These vary in usefulness - from a small speed boost with the ability to wall run / double jump to invisibility & shield armor.  The initial modes are well executed - my personal favourites being a nod to TF2 Payload, though bomb defusal is very enjoyable too, alongside standard deathmatch etc.  These all have a nod to the Stand Alone Complex series; in fact while waiting they show clips of the show - In my opinion they need to do more of this.\n\n2 Issues\nThe recoil is going to be the thing that many folks will try and shaft this game with - but honestly thats a red herring.  The game has a COD style progression system that includes character upgrades that work with the theme of the title more so than any other game due to the cybernetic nature of the world universe and these upgrades will effect end game recoil with varying degree's of negative pay offs for doing so.  Honestly the recoil works how guns work.  You can spray and prey but someone who knows the game will shut you down so fast it's really not worth the bullets.  Best to work in groups and take the time to aim.\n\nThat aside - the game is Early Access - so content is somewhat lacking.  (I write this review as Open BETA early access has gone live 48 hours ago or less).  I'm actually writing this as the servers are down for bug fixing and content additions.\n\nI also do not know how much they are planning to charge for character skins.\n\nHonestly, the only real gripe I have is the time it takes to start a match.  Usually its around 40 seconds, which after playing for 10 hours straight seems like an eternity.\n\n3 Final Thoughts\nI imagine 'end game' being a very focused style of old era Tom Clancy style tactics.  It's a market that is in my eyes untapped outside of the aformentioned titles.  I strongly recommend for FPS fans and Ghost in the Shell fans alike.  If you want to have a match, my ingame name is Zhoutai :)","December 16, 2015","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I never expected there to be a "Ghost In The Shell" F2P FPS. That anime/manga WAS frikkin good, especially Motoko xD\n\nGameplay:\nThis is of course, an FPS which is quite fast paced, but what I have noticed is its kind of like an anime version of the Call of Duty which isn't necessarily a bad thing; as matter of fact I prefer this over Call of Duty. The shooting mechanics of this game, are similar to Call of Duty is what I mean ~ well it feels that way. Aiming in this game isn't too shabby, especially for a game that's in early access, but the aim down sight kind of acts a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Also what I've noticed is the jumping, which I pretty much didn't like. It made me feel like I was limited to movement, because when you jump, you don't really jump that high, in affect this means you can't really jump onto objects such as a box or a crate . Gameplay: 8/10\n\nGraphics:\nI think the graphics are extremely good, and the amount of RAM usage is frikkin good. Because my PC isn't really much of a gaming PC ; *well it's a hybrid sort, if ya know what I mean*, but even if it's not a gaming PC it still runs buttery smooth, even whilst I was running Fraps, whilst recording this it was pretty butter smooth. Graphics: 8/10\n\nOverall Impression:\nNot too shabby, not too ♥♥♥♥ing shabby.

I really didn't expect anything from an Early Access game but after these few hours I just can't stop playing! I only stopped to write this review because the servers are going down for maintenance. It's clearly well polished and while there are some functionalities missing I don't think it will ruin the gameplay experience. The classes are well balanced, the syncing mechanic is also really nice and the gun play feels so good! The art is also fantastic, it's not mind blowingly awesome but it fits the theme and the characters in it well. As a fan of the anime I can;t wait to see the finished product.\n\nJust as a side note: To anyone claiming this is a P2W game. I don't feel it. You need to level up your guns before you can even buy the enhancements and a lot of the enchancements has negative trade offs for each stat boosted. I've never played a match where I felt like I;ve been cheated because some schmup is using a better gun. A lot of times it's usually the guy who's using the knife who's wrecking everyone else. So as far as P2W? I don't think so. But maybe I'm not that far into the game yet to feel it's effects.

Once you buy an item you own it forever, furthermore in-game currency is at least for right now very generous. Match-to-match wont give you too much reward but every level-up rewards you with 50,000 GP. Weapon prices are in the range of about 150,000 to 250,000 gp, but by playing you can essentially unlock many weapons around ~20,000 gp.\n\nWeapon balance is mostly acceptable. Nothing too obviously egregious. Most weapons will instantly kill a target with a headshot which currently gives SMGs too much power on DM. Additionally it appears (though I could be mistaken) that headshots are at least partially random.\n\nOtherwise the gameplay feels pretty good and mostly rewards skilled players. There's not much ham either with bunny hopping being punished and grenade spam being used mostly for softening up targets rather than killing people. Server performance has been fairly stable and only a few instances of "laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t".\n\nIt's hard to say what the future for this game will be, if previous Nexon titles are any indication hackers and microtransaction hell might be right around the corner.\n\nBut for now, if you want an unsophisticated shooter to just mess about with some friends then you'll have a pretty decent time with First Assault. Hell, it's current state is more engaging and content-rich than Star Wars Battlefront at $60.","December 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's balanced but i get a feeling that the moment the cash shop is introduced the game will become broken. Although they could just sell skins who knows. They got all the original voice actors and the sound and interface design makes the game feel like your playing an action sequence from ghost in the shell. At its core its still call of duty though with the main feature being that the character you select has a special ability that charges over time. Some are better than others but none fo them are bad. Togusa is the only one thats arguably op but i think it would be balanced with better hit detection. I think this is a fun ghost in the shell themed call of duty game but I can see it getting old 10 or 20 hours in when the weapon and character unlocks start slowing down.\n\nI can't wait for nexon to ruin this game with a cash shop and force me to change this review.

As of now it's nothing over the top as far as fps, but they do their best to integrate elements from ghost in the shell.  The on main concern I have is of weapons doing damage when they please.  There's time I've lit up the back of an enemy and he'll turn around and 1-shot me.  I've heard that's because of lag compensation and if that's the case I hope they fix it in the near future.  Other than that I really have no other complaints.  Voice chat would of course be a nice touch to it, but tbh i think it can go without it if need be or at least have the option to not hear the other players if they do decide to implement that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Verneo/recommended/369200/","Verneo","Warden Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Verneo/","170 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've come to this game as someone who is more a fan of Ghost in the Shell than modern FPS games so please bare this in mind.\n\n1. Games Mechanics & Theme\n2. Issues\n3. Final Thoughts\n-----------------------\n\n1 Game Mechanics and Theme\nThe game goes above and beyond to make the gunfire feel realistic.  The animations are well beyond the level I would expect from a smaller Studio (E.g. a non-triple-A studio), the feel, hip-fire / aiming down sights and scoped all seem very complete.  The recoil is something you will hear a lot about this game, it's insane.  It favours a style of play that makes me think of Rainbow 6 meets TF2.  As you start to level you start to naturally form squad tactics because if you don't and run in guns blazing you can kiss your ♥♥♥ goodbye.  Any headshot will stop you in your tracks really, regardless of calabre. Squad tactics are also reinforced by a localised special ability buff that can be shared by a few of the playable characters.  These vary in usefulness - from a small speed boost with the ability to wall run / double jump to invisibility & shield armor.  The initial modes are well executed - my personal favourites being a nod to TF2 Payload, though bomb defusal is very enjoyable too, alongside standard deathmatch etc.  These all have a nod to the Stand Alone Complex series; in fact while waiting they show clips of the show - In my opinion they need to do more of this.\n\n2 Issues\nThe recoil is going to be the thing that many folks will try and shaft this game with - but honestly thats a red herring.  The game has a COD style progression system that includes character upgrades that work with the theme of the title more so than any other game due to the cybernetic nature of the world universe and these upgrades will effect end game recoil with varying degree's of negative pay offs for doing so.  Honestly the recoil works how guns work.  You can spray and prey but someone who knows the game will shut you down so fast it's really not worth the bullets.  Best to work in groups and take the time to aim.\n\nThat aside - the game is Early Access - so content is somewhat lacking.  (I write this review as Open BETA early access has gone live 48 hours ago or less).  I'm actually writing this as the servers are down for bug fixing and content additions.\n\nI also do not know how much they are planning to charge for character skins.\n\nHonestly, the only real gripe I have is the time it takes to start a match.  Usually its around 40 seconds, which after playing for 10 hours straight seems like an eternity.\n\n3 Final Thoughts\nI imagine 'end game' being a very focused style of old era Tom Clancy style tactics.  It's a market that is in my eyes untapped outside of the aformentioned titles.  I strongly recommend for FPS fans and Ghost in the Shell fans alike.  If you want to have a match, my ingame name is Zhoutai :)","December 16, 2015","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I never expected there to be a "Ghost In The Shell" F2P FPS. That anime/manga WAS frikkin good, especially Motoko xD\n\nGameplay:\nThis is of course, an FPS which is quite fast paced, but what I have noticed is its kind of like an anime version of the Call of Duty which isn't necessarily a bad thing; as matter of fact I prefer this over Call of Duty. The shooting mechanics of this game, are similar to Call of Duty is what I mean ~ well it feels that way. Aiming in this game isn't too shabby, especially for a game that's in early access, but the aim down sight kind of acts a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes. Also what I've noticed is the jumping, which I pretty much didn't like. It made me feel like I was limited to movement, because when you jump, you don't really jump that high, in affect this means you can't really jump onto objects such as a box or a crate . Gameplay: 8/10\n\nGraphics:\nI think the graphics are extremely good, and the amount of RAM usage is frikkin good.

Even if you place it in the perfect location, unless you're terrible at pc gaming, it most likely isn't going to kill you.\n- Unlocks are based on leveling up/In-game score/weapon used (I think)\n- Guns feel "decent" for this style of shooter\n- Knife can be really Clunky. It prompts you to "assassinate" but half the time doesn't work?\n\nI've only played Team Deathmatch so far. was gonna try the domination style mode, but currently the other modes other then Team Deathmatch, aren't really populated. Obviously all of this will get better in do time. It did just release so you will experience bugs. i haven't run into any game breaking ones.\n\n- Currently in Team Deathmatch there are only 3 Maps\n- They're all fairly small\n- They do seem to be laid out pretty well\n\nAll in all though it is alot of fun. Some people compared it to a CoD style shooter. I personally don't know if i'd call it that. But it is worth the pick up. Currently though i would not spend money on the most expensive Early Access pack do to the lack of content. But it can only get better with time. I'm also pretty sure it'll be F2P at some time in the future but i'm not 100% sure seeing as i just came across it recently.\n\nOn another note, i'd love to see achievements brought into this game, being an achievement junkie and all :D","December 17, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The teams stay the same every match, with the exception of someone leaving or joining. When joining a match, you get placed in the team with the lowest number of people. I'd prefer if they balanced the teams based on most recent K/D, with an option for disabling the auto-balance for more competative teams. But that's just me.\nThere isn't really that many people playing right now, so we'll see in time, but at the moment there's only one match for whatever gametype I select: terminal defense, team deathmatch, demolition, or random.\n\nThe sniper rifles are very difficult to use. Firing from the hip without attachments, I could probably land a hit 1/100th of the time at 5m. It's even more difficult to hit while moving, hip or aiming, but that may just be me.\nOnly one melee, with an assassination that's pretty hard to land unless the enemy's standing still.\nThere are two pistols, the basic well balanced, and the magnum. The magnum has poor distance 5m or less, but can headshot in one hit, and nearly kill in one hit anywhere else on the body.\nOne shotgun, that I've seen, but you have to unlock it.\nAuto and semi-automatics are by far the greatest in number, with a decent range of variation.\nWith the exception of melee and pistols, all weapons have attachments that'll slightly alter the weapon's stats, at least 10 or more per weapon.\nAlso, you can pick up the primary weapon last equiped by downed enemies.\n\nThis game is more skill/perserverance/luck, money can only get you the early access packs, to my knowledge.\nOverall, it still needs work but I recommend it anyway.

What about Overwatch? Well this game sort of feels like a blend between Counter Strike and Overwatch with how the matches are pretty short with a very clear objective and how the character skills work.\nCombine that with a very user-friendly HUD and delicious sound design, you get a pretty darn good game, especially if you consider this is an early access.\nAlthought the variety of weapons and characters that are given to you is not that massive but all the things you do get feel really polished and comfortable to use.\n\nOf course there are a few glaring issues with this game, namely the matchmaking and bullet spread.\nWhen you first start out you will most likely get placed into unfair matches where everyone is infinitely better than you but seeing how easy it is to get used to the game, in about an hour you won't feel the matchmaking issue.\n\nOnto the big daddy of issues - the bullet spread. A lot of people seem to agree that it's really hard to understand how exactly the bullets fly from your gun but just like matchmaking you sort of get used to it.\n\nOverall I could say that the game is pretty good and it obviously has a lot of love put into it, especially if you take Nexon's not-so-great reputation into account. A few issues that might turn a lot of people away are dominant but after some time they become unnoticable.\n\nAs a side note, if you have a friend force him to buy the game with you, it becomes infinitely more fun when both of you pick the guy with super sprint ability and go into the enemy backline shaking everyone.","December 17, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazTheThriller/recommended/369200/","KazTheThriller","Kazuhira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KazTheThriller/","277 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTHIS A SOMEWHAT IN-DEPTH REVIEW AND OVERVIEW OF GHOST IN THE SHELL: STAND ALONE COMPLEX - FAO\n\nTL;DR version - The game is a cut above the rest of the F2P shooters on steam, but It needs to work on its Ghost in The Shell Identity\n\nFull Review\n\nAfter playing this game for a bit I have to say, this game has the potential to be something great, honestly. The gun play is fast paced, which is why you'll see most people compare this game to Call of Duty, but it's more along the lines of Black Light: Retribution. Currently There are three modes, Team Deathmatch, Terminal Capture (Think Control Points from TF2, or King of the Hill), and Demolitions (Think Bomb Defuse from Counter-Strike). Team Deathmatch is probably the most popular mode, it's incredibly fast and a lot of times (atleast when I played) matches can come down to the wire with teams winning by only a couple kills. In Terminal Capture, Teams will have to capture... terminals in order to score points. When a terminal is captured, it also brings the Team's Walker Tank online to assist in battle, however it is sometimes hard to tell whether or not the Tank is helpful. Demolitions (My favorite game mode) pits two small teams against each other, one defending the targets and one trying to bomb them. In this game mode, there is no respawning, which makes the mode more nerve-racking, but also more enjoyable imo.\n\nThe Goods\nAs far as Free-to-play games go, this is one of the most well put together ones i've seen. You have to understand, there are A LOT of F2P shooter on Steam, and most of them suck ♥♥♥, so this game is a sight for sore eyes in this catagory. A lot of people complain about "clunky movement" but I honestly don't know what they're talking about. Moving through the game is pretty smooth, or rather smooth enough for most people's standards. For actual GiTS fans, having the original english voice cast is also a good +1. As far as buying weapons and other things, some people may think the prices are kind of ridiculous, and they kind of are, but most of your In-game money won't earned through match rewards, but rather through leveling up. You earn 50,000 in-game credits for leveling up and the weapons in the Market will cost you anywhere between 150,000-300,000 credits, so you'll have to level up about 4-6 times to buy any weapons, but honestly, the default weapons will do you just fine (AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT BUY THE .44 MAGNUM)\n\nThe Bads\nThe biggest sin that this game commits is having that Ghost in The Shell sticker on it. I'm pretty sure Neople will fix/work on this later, but right now, there is almost nothing about this game that makes it Ghost in The Shell besides a few things. Yes there are the characters from the anime and yes they have augmentations here and there, but other than that this game is just a normal shooter with Ghost in The Shell license plate. Neople said in their Early Access description that they will be adding more modes and character, among other things, so hopefully will see more Ghost in The Shell  related things, like maybe a PvE mode where you can actually hack into enemies or something like that. Another issue with the game that I believe Neople is already working on is the Game's Buff/Upgrade system. After a match, you have the chance to earn special buffing chips that add abilities to your selected operative like faster reload times, fall damage reduction, and other things. The problem is that these buffs are expendable and run out way too quickly and a lot of times, it's hard to tell if they have any effect at all. Some other current issues are the guns (rather just one gun) and hit detection/boxes, but i'll start with the gun first. I'm not sure whether it's an Auto or Semi-Auto shotgun, but there is a shotgun in the game that needs to be seriously nerfed to hell. If it's an Auto-shotgun, just take it out of the game, I don't know what possess devs to put auto-shotguns into shooters like these, but they're almost always over powering. If it's a semi-auto shotgun, then they need to nerf it, giving it a slower rate-of-fire or less damage or something. Hit boxes are kind of a small problem. I've only had this happen to me a couple times, but depending on where I shoot someone, my bullets just go right through them and it's frustrating as hell to see that happen. Also, the melee range needs to be increased also, you think with a big ♥♥♥ blade attached to your arm you'd be able to get some distance on someone with it, but you have to get right up close to them, nearly touching them, to use it effectivly, and I'm not talking about to do an insta-kill, I mean to just hit them with it.\n\nFinal Verdict\nThe game as it is now is pretty good, atleast a cut-above most other F2P shooters on Steam. What it really needs now besides tweaking is an identity. Neople needs to make this a real Ghost in The Shell game, not a game that has Ghost in The Shell in it. If they can't make this happen, then this game will be destined to fade into the crevice with all the other generic/basic F2P shooters on steam. But, if Neople can give this game its Ghost in The Shell identity it deserves, then this game could a smash hit. Neople and Nexon claim that they want to work with the Early Access community and keep open-communications with the players to make the game better, we'll just have to wait and see if they hold true to their claim. AND FOR GOD'S SAKE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY THIS GAME, DON'T PICK MOTOKO PLEASE, EVERYONE PLAYS AS HER, PLAY AS BATOU OR TOGUSA!!!!!!","December 17, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now playing it on steam and happily got the DLC's. I've been used to Nexon's ways for many many years, so I cant really complain about the way NX works. I'll still buy as long as im playing, I came into this game knowing that. Not really P2W at this point, we will see how that goes.. Only thing that sucks right now is not keeping my levels and upgrades from previous beta, but thats not unusual for any game really.","December 16, 2015","true","268.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really didn't expect anything from an Early Access game but after these few hours I just can't stop playing! I only stopped to write this review because the servers are going down for maintenance. It's clearly well polished and while there are some functionalities missing I don't think it will ruin the gameplay experience. The classes are well balanced, the syncing mechanic is also really nice and the gun play feels so good! The art is also fantastic, it's not mind blowingly awesome but it fits the theme and the characters in it well. As a fan of the anime I can;t wait to see the finished product.\n\nJust as a side note: To anyone claiming this is a P2W game. I don't feel it. You need to level up your guns before you can even buy the enhancements and a lot of the enchancements has negative trade offs for each stat boosted. I've never played a match where I felt like I;ve been cheated because some schmup is using a better gun. A lot of times it's usually the guy who's using the knife who's wrecking everyone else. So as far as P2W? I don't think so. But maybe I'm not that far into the game yet to feel it's effects. If I do feel it I'll quickly change my review to a negative one.","December 16, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Once you buy an item you own it forever, furthermore in-game currency is at least for right now very generous. Match-to-match wont give you too much reward but every level-up rewards you with 50,000 GP. Weapon prices are in the range of about 150,000 to 250,000 gp, but by playing you can essentially unlock many weapons around ~20,000 gp.\n\nWeapon balance is mostly acceptable. Nothing too obviously egregious. Most weapons will instantly kill a target with a headshot which currently gives SMGs too much power on DM. Additionally it appears (though I could be mistaken) that headshots are at least partially random.\n\nOtherwise the gameplay feels pretty good and mostly rewards skilled players. There's not much ham either with bunny hopping being punished and grenade spam being used mostly for softening up targets rather than killing people. Server performance has been fairly stable and only a few instances of "laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t".\n\nIt's hard to say what the future for this game will be, if previous Nexon titles are any indication hackers and microtransaction hell might be right around the corner.\n\nBut for now, if you want an unsophisticated shooter to just mess about with some friends then you'll have a pretty decent time with First Assault. Hell, it's current state is more engaging and content-rich than Star Wars Battlefront at $60.","December 16, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a first personn shooter who is only based on the multiplayer.\n\nYou will embody a member of the Section 9, a strength of agents of elite cybernétiquement improved for the fight, in charge of the protection of the company and the fight against the terrorists in the streets of futuristic Japan.\nThe gameplay is rather fast and soft, weapons varied for an early access, a backward movement on weapons not too difficult to take in hand, various available agents and three different modes of game (team death match, conquest, research and destroy).\n\nThe problem of the game is the connections (more known under the name of Ping). As hanging 10 min of game, everything goes well take place, as, every 2 minutes, you go to meet players making the moonwalk, you go to shoot but in fact, they will have already died for 20 well seconds and some bugs of texture with some places of maps.\n\nLet us speak graphics:\nA game which has no very elaborate graphics but, textures remain attractive to look and generally, the game is not ugly (attention, I play in full ultra).\n\nOn the whole, it is a rather varied, more not ugly game, where the team play is often going to bear fruit but with servers who for the moment undergo lags and where we can find some have bugs of texture.\n\nOn 10, I would assign it a grade of 7.\n\n\n(Version anglais and french)\nQue dire sur ce jeu ...\n\n"Ghost in the Shell" est un jeu en cours d'éditions par Nexon, l'agence qui a fait Warrock, Combat Arms ou encore Counter strike Zombie. C'est un jeu de tir à la première personne qui est basée uniquement sur le multijoueur.\n\nVous incarnerez un membre de la Section 9, une force d'agents d'élite cybernétiquement améliorés pour le combat, en charge de la protection de la société et du combat contre les terroristes dans les rues d'un japon futuriste.\nLe gameplay est plutôt rapide et soft, les armes variées pour un early access, un recul sur les armes pas trop difficiles à prendre en main, différents agents disponibles et trois modes de jeu différents (match à mort par équipes, conquête, recherche et destruction).\n\nLe problème du jeu est les connexions (plus connu sous le nom de Ping). Autant pendant 10 min de jeu, tout va bien se passer, autant, toutes les 2 minutes, vous allez croiser des joueurs faisant du moonwalk, vous allez tirer dessus mais en fait, ils seront déjà mort depuis bien 20 secondes... et quelques bugs de texture à certains endroits des maps.\n\nParlons graphisme :\nun jeu qui n'a pas des graphismes très poussés mais, les textures restent jolie à regarder et dans l'ensemble, le jeu n'est pas moche (attention, je joue en full ultra).\n\nDonc dans l'ensemble c'est un jeu plutôt varié, pas moche, où le jeu en équipe va souvent porter ses fruits mais avec des serveurs qui pour le moment subissent des lags et où on peut retrouver quelques buggent de texture.\n\nSur 10, je lui attribuerais une note de 7.","December 16, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has gameplay akin to CoD, but is different from that game in many ways. The game's speed is a mix of Medal of Honor Warfighter and Combat Arms, which makes for an interesting take on futuristic warfare when agetns take on terrorists in a good ol' fashioned fight to the death.\n\nAs of now, there are a considerable amount of weapons, but most of them are assault rifles and one of the weapons is not even an assault rifle; that being the M4A1. But, that's just being picky. To be honest, there needs to be more pistols, more SMGs, more shotguns (even though they are very OP), more MGs, etc. There needs to be more weapons to this game mainly because this game has the potential to give players many options in firepower.\n\nThe characters all have different abilities that can be used efficiently in battle. I stuck with the stealth character mainly because a lot of players tend to pick her and it comes in handy when you have the ability to share it with a your Tier 2 ability.\n\nThe game modes are fun, but there are only three to speak of at the moment. They are fun to keep you locked in and, for the Early Access, there is no Pay-to-Win currency. You know what that means? Yup, no Pay-to-Win weapons yet. If I were you, I would pick it up now while you still can before its F2P release hits the Steam store. It really pays off in the end and you can really suit yourself up if you are interested in the game enough.\n\nIt's fun, frantic and requires some skill, speed and coordination. Think of it as Counter-Strike on drugs with gameplay elements from Halo, Combat Arms, Medal of Honor Warfighter and other modern FPS games. If you hate Call of Duty, you can still get into this game. Honestly, you can.\n\nPick it up before it becomes F2P. Starting now is key for the game to avoid the Pay-to-Win approach and, with enough input, this game can become a better model for F2P FPS games in the future. What are you waiting? Pick up the damn game! ;)\n\n9/10!","December 16, 2015","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's time I've lit up the back of an enemy and he'll turn around and 1-shot me.  I've heard that's because of lag compensation and if that's the case I hope they fix it in the near future.

For this point in its production the graphics are nice and combat is moderately fun if not repetitive. The different abilities of the characters and the fact that its gits really are what's pulling it along for me at least. I'm sure I'll continue playing it for a good while longer so it was definitely worth the $10 I paid for the specialist pack. A couple of things that do get me upset are the spawn points and how small the maps are. The spawn points are ♥♥♥♥ and if you're facing off against 2 or 3 moderately decent players who've spent a few hours on the game then you're going to lose. I do prefer the smaller maps because they're easier to memorize, but hate the smaller maps because they're easier to memorize. But after all that's said and done, I still recommend it and will be playing it probably at least an hour a day or so. Excited to see what's to come in the game's future.","December 17, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a modern shooter with a more classic feel.\n\nThe gameplay is strictly multiplayer, which hopefully they will update with a campaign of sorts, or a horde mode style mode at least.\n\nThe guns feel powerful. Never has a pistol in a standard FPS felt as heavy as a pistol would in real life. Granted, it doesn't do the damage of the rifles and SMGs, but it is a valid option if you run dry. That being said, all the guns feel heavy, as they should. I get tired in games that gear towards realism, when a heavy sniper rifle feels like it has the kick of a .22 calibur target rifle. This game breaks that, the SMG that you start with, feels powerful even.\n\nNow that I've gotten my gungasm out of the way, let's move to actual gameplay. You pick the Section 9 Operative that you prefer, all of which having different abilities, the always beautiful Motoko having her token Thermo-Optic Camo, and Batou having his arm cannon, so on and so forth. That being said, Motoko is the main character, and a great protagonist at that, in the source, so you'll be seeing plenty of her. I myself picked Motoko straight away. However, you do get an Operative Unlock every level, so you'll have plenty of chances to try out the rest of the group.\nThe gameplay itself feels like a mix between a standard arena shooter, and the small group strategy of counter-strike. It brings incredibly fast gunplay, with no over the top abilities like jump-jets, or dodging. ADS is on point, and all of the standard sights work just fine for what they're meant for.\n\nI for one, am very happy for my support and patronage for this game, and I expect to see more to come out of it. Try it out for yourself, and like me, you may be surprised in a good way. Highly recommended.","December 16, 2015","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of you should just wait until it comes out. The early access is only worth it if you -know- you'll want to spend some money on p2w bux.\nIt's exactly what you'd expect from a Nexon shooter, just with a GITS coat of paint. The game is still early access however, so hopefully they will make some tweaks to the gameplay and turn it into a more tactical experience. As it stands it's not really unique or groundbreaking.\n\nTL;DR great game if you liked combat arms, but very litle to do with GITS besides the aesthetics and charachter models.","December 16, 2015","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But system requirements to graphics quality ratio is like 9000 to 1 - you need 60 FPS Battlefield 3 machine to run this game flawlessly.\n\nFunny to see this game constantly using my CPU at 100% (atleast one of 4 cores) and stutter like hell, freezing for up to 3 seconds occasionally, even in main menu. Placing the game on RAMDISK helped a lot. Great optimization approach, you'll soon be on level with Ubisoft!\nMaybe nexon shouldn't have packed whole ui into one "ui.dat" file, just a guess.\nMaybe this game requires L3 CPU cache which my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ APU doesn't have at all. But it's mostly open world games which need L3 cache to run smoothly, while small "arena" type games shouldn't be that hard on CPUs. But we are talking about Nexon here - they can make a small game run as if it was GTA.\n\nI play Battlefield 3 with 30 FPS up, but GITS FA looks soooo 2006 but runs exactly like CoD AW on my PC. Seriously, it doesn't look nearly as good as CS:GO, it's more like CS:S, and requires an i5?\n\nThe gameplay is alright I guess. Shooting is satisfying. Abilities and stuff are fun.\nSound design is decent, on a level or above modern CoD titles, but still far below Modern Warfare 2, not to mention Battlefield. There is 7.1 sound system support which is a plus.","December 16, 2015","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After that you have to choose which cyber technics you want. Examples are that you can share your hacks or strength to a team mate and he can then use it with that character. Other examples are strength that makes you able to carry more heavy duty guns like RPG, Machine guns and etc. you have also the choise to "hack" the game so you will be able to see were other players are under a short time. Now this example was actually the best cyber technic, in my opinion, as you have a such a big advantage if you use it right, sure it´s the same for them all, use them wisely and you will have an advantage of the other players but remember that they have also cyber techs.\n\nIf I would rate this game from 1 to 10 then I would say around 7 both for that it will be improved a lot under its early access time and because it is a very good game.

Even on the lowest settings, it still chokes and has occasional FPS drops if there is a lot going on. I'm strictly speaking for people with lower end PCs. Otherwise, for the most part my FPS is very solid. Mindless run and gun arcade like FPS. Great graphics. Easily worth $5. Just keep in mind: NEXON owns this game and it's still early access.

The three types of gameplay are all pretty good. The maps aren't huge, though they are good, could maybe do with more maps or bigger ones. The adbvantage of smaller maps does mean you can get to know them easier, making each match more interesting.

The abilities in this game (other than it being freaking ghost in the shell) are what give this game such an amazing feeling in game. I mean you get to launch rockets from ur arm, turn invisible on the go, sprint like sanic himself, give urself a second layer of armor that also actively heals you, see where the enemy is with heat vision, deploy sentry turrets that defend an area or  enemy seeking drones that explode when they find someone, and thats not even all yet since the dev team said theyd be adding more to the game as it goes in terms of abilities, maps, guns, characters, etc. Not to mention that u can actively share some of those abilities with ur entire team! Anyway my point is that this game right now has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of kick ♥♥♥ stuff waiting for u to get ur grubby little hands on it..... and for 5 FREAKING DOLLARS AT THAT. take the plunge, wait for opimization fixes for more polish, whatever. this game will be amazing if nexon doesnt ♥♥♥♥ it up. enjoy it while you can, i know i am!","December 30, 2015","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And since I’ve played it, I found that it was really fun. Currently the game is a standard indie FPS but with some cool features. You can make your own classes and customize weapons (as to be expected). But the thing that makes this game different for any other is the skills\nWhen you first log in you will be asked to recruit at character from the list (these are characters from ghost in the shell). Each character has a different skill such as heat sensors or optic camo as seen through out the ghost in the shell manga and anime. I know some people will be saying that they copied this from black ops 3, and I see where you’re coming from. But the one thing that makes this different is the idea of skill syncing. If you make your ability tier 2 you can share your ability with the people around you there for giving your team an advantage. But to get to tier to means that you have to get twice the amount of kills.\nWould I recommend this game?\nIf you are a big fan and are thinking about playing it and you will play it in the future, then yes. The early access packages will give you an advantage in the future.\nIf you are looking for a cheap game that you will play for 2 weeks and never play again, then no. since the game is early access it is still quite bare and has limited maps, 3 game modes and a very limited variety of guns and attachments.\nOver all when this game comes out in beta I would highly recommend this game to everybody I know who likes fps games. The Ghost in the shell series has always been famous and this is a very nice edition and with the up and coming live action movie I believe this game will be very popular.\nThanks for reading ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n","January 1","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The system they have in place with characters possessing unique abilities as well as being able to share these abilities amongst your team definitely adds in changing up what could've been just another multiplayer FPS with a familiar title slapped on it. The only flaw I would say is rather prevelent is the pace at which the game performs. It handles a lot like Quake or Counter-Strike back in the day. Character models are moving very quick, it's pretty tough to get a bead on players, especially if you like running precision weapons. And the one hit-melee kill (you heard that right) seems to reward players for abandoning the tactical approach and just running in and trying to cause as much damage as possible. There are times when this game does perform very well, though, and that's why I'm recommending it. It harkens back to an older style of FPS that'll certainly weed out less experienced players, and will allow for more "trial by fire" style progression. Give it a looksie, if so inclined.","January 1","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love first person shooters and they are the most of the games I own, although I have watched this anime I am not a big fan of anime (espeiclly narto and other S*** like that) and although i have played CoD in the past, and being a battlefield fan, the most I have played recently has been Milsim games with a cassual Milsim group (like Arma 3 with Alive/ACE mods). So if your like me and your wanting to buy this game because your freind wants you to, and you play games like me, then read on, for all the other anime fans and weebs out there, you should probbly go somewhere else.\n\nIf you want it short, yes this games is worth $5 and the only thing that makes it related to the anime are the charecters and thier abilities. If you want more details keep going.\n\nSummery\nThis is strictly multiplayer, there is no story or offine mode, but thats expected with a $5 alpha game. In the begining you get to pick one charecter intill you get to level 5, but besides thier ability, they all play the same and they all have the same stuff. This is an extermlly close-qaurters game with guns and hit boxes that actually work so no BS on op guns or hits, but because it's all close qauters it plays like CoD (90% of the time whoever shoots first wins, but thats just how life works). Playing taticaly in this game is almost Impossible but you dont have to play like everyone else, it may not be the best but it stops you from dieing every two secends. Overal this game is pretty sound, if you have good internet it runs stable and looks good even on low graphics.\n\nPros\nGood Grahpics (cant even tell your playing an anime game intill you the Major's ♥♥♥♥, which dosnt happen often.)\nLow requirments\nStable\nNot pay to win\nGood Damage modles\nGood hit boxes\nNot hard to level up or get new equitment\nNo mics so no hot micers\nOverall decent gameplay\nThings you would expect from $40+ games\n\nNot so bad cons\nnot to many maps\nfew weapons\nrepitive gamplay\nunrealstic gun spec modles (M4 has 35 mters of range! What the hell!)\nSome abilities are beeter than others\nThere is payable content, but it's aparentlly not expensive or that much beeter than the standerd equitment.\n\nBesides from some bug fixes here and there (like the sniper rifle not shooting people and the nexon lancher not being compatible with the new windows 10 update [as of 12/29/15]) and some needed content this game this is really fun, even if your not a weeb!","January 1","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My biggest hope for this is for the developers to put a single player or co-op campaign mode. They have a number of basic issues within this version of the game that they need to work out like spawn locations, minor glitchiness, and how long it takes to unlock items and level up but it's worth a shot.\n\nOh and the game crashes pretty often... expecting that to be fixed soon...","December 21, 2015","true","38.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its Counter Strike style combat but with unique abilities and styles of gameplay that make it more accessible to have fun in. Upside is that you can easily hop in and out of matches and have a good time. It doesn't take long for most games to finish so this game requires no commitment from you as far as time goes. Gameplay is smooth and easy to learn but difficult enough to keep you learning as you play. Abilities are important, and can be shared and a good ability share can change the game immensely. Loads of fun to play with friends.\n\nDownside? Matchmaking is completely random. Yesterday I got paired with a fairly skilled team on each side. It was a blast to play, sometimes I died and sometimes I killed but overall it was challenging. Few minutes ago I got paired with MLG guys who were streaming the gameplay. Totally killed the game because they were curbstomping people. A bunch of people left, myself included, to play another time when they weren't on.\n\nSo if you are an somewhat average to high skill FPS player, this game will be fun most times. If you are anything less than that you'll probably die a lot and want to smash your keyboard. Especially if some twitch guys join your game. I only reccommend this game for people serious about the FPS genre and multiplayer in general. There's not a lot of Ghost In The Shell lore in this game, so if you are a fan of the anime you won't miss much by skipping this.\n\nOverall though, not a bad game. We'll see how it further develops.","January 25","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players can choose starting hero with his own abilities and later they can change them as they wish (Only if you buy them but you will get free hero of your choice at lvl. 3 and lvl 5 of your account). There isnt much about the weapons...because there is just few of them (but its just Early Access so its ok). You can choose from variety of weapons like assault rifles, shotguns, smgs, sniper rifles etc. and modify them..The modification part isnt as good as in other sci-fi shooters like Blacklight but it has its own charm to it....You either buy mods for ridicilous price!!! (weapons bought from market) or you will buy them cheap but you have to unlock them first (weapons you get from start or those which you unlock by playing). All weapons and mods can be bought with currency you earn by playing...And i like that...The paid currency is for skins...nuff said...devs gotta eat too you know? >.< Now lets talk about game modes...there are 3 atm (4 if you count random) Terminal conquest (Capture the Point) Demolition (Competitive mode....you will know what im talkin about) and TDM.

The way it questions what makes a human human, the detail in the characters, the wat the CGI melds with the traditional animation, it all blew my mind the first time I saw it. That being said, I did not have high hopes that this game (or any game for that matter) would be able to adapt an anime as smart and philosophical as Ghost in the Shell into a team based online multiplayer first person shooter, and in a way I was right. Instead of trying to find a way to fit a story worthy of the GitS name into a game that is, at its core, just another online fps, it focused on the action aspects of the series, specifically the TV series Stand Alone Complex. And while that was disappointing to me as a fan of the franchise, I do enjoy the game, quite a bit. Despite the issues I have with the concept of the game, it feels good as an FPS, and the inclusion of the original voice actors from the English dub of SAC was a brilliant choice, as it give the game that much more relation to the series which, in my honest opinion, it needed. The models for the characters depict them better than I had hoped (as I said though, I had a low bar), Kusanagi looks as sexy, badass, and respectable as she should. The game isn't the best F2P shooter out there, but it is definitely worth checking out despite the lack of story which I should mention I forgive somewhat as it IS a team based online FPS, so plot is not exactly important. But I would of liked maybe some solo missions like the manditory tutorial when you first boot up the game (I couldn't even change the display size). Over all it is fun, and has a lot of little bits of fan service here and there. 6.9/10","January 19","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For now, I'm very satisfied but it definitely needs (and will most likely receive) more content.","December 31, 2015","true","8.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The three types of gameplay are all pretty good. The maps aren't huge, though they are good, could maybe do with more maps or bigger ones. The adbvantage of smaller maps does mean you can get to know them easier, making each match more interesting. The way you can add cybernetic enhancements to your character is quite good, makes the game stand out a bit more. As I tend to MMORPGs, this is a big change for me, but very enjoyable.","December 30, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The abilities in this game (other than it being freaking ghost in the shell) are what give this game such an amazing feeling in game. I mean you get to launch rockets from ur arm, turn invisible on the go, sprint like sanic himself, give urself a second layer of armor that also actively heals you, see where the enemy is with heat vision, deploy sentry turrets that defend an area or  enemy seeking drones that explode when they find someone, and thats not even all yet since the dev team said theyd be adding more to the game as it goes in terms of abilities, maps, guns, characters, etc. Not to mention that u can actively share some of those abilities with ur entire team! Anyway my point is that this game right now has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of kick ♥♥♥ stuff waiting for u to get ur grubby little hands on it..... and for 5 FREAKING DOLLARS AT THAT. take the plunge, wait for opimization fixes for more polish, whatever. this game will be amazing if nexon doesnt ♥♥♥♥ it up. enjoy it while you can, i know i am!","December 30, 2015","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also the community is great, I have yet to run into any griefers, theres minor teasing between players but its all in good fun and since the community is small right now you will see a lot of these people frequently, I would even go as far to say that I have made some community friends on here already.

Then you can get another (the actual one you wanted ) operative that you want to have fun with. Now for my actual review\n\nPros:\n>The abilities are very useful for most situations\n>Gun customization that is similar to ghost recon future soldier (has cons and I will talk about them)\n>The tutorial is actualy not mandatory\n>Gaining cash is not tough (but that is only when you win ofc)\n>Weapons so far have no actual p2w system and relies solely on in-game currency\n>Combat is fast paced, Headshots are insta-kill, I would consider it on par with games like CS but it does require you to aim\n>sensitivity can be changed on the fly with [ or ]\n>Knifing is insanely fun\n>Voice work is great, they use scenes from anime to show game modes, which is very creative\n>no friendly fire\n>even though maps are pretty small snipers are still effective, esp with cloak\n>ablities have a cooldown and cooldown can be shortened with kills or augmentation chips (what i would call them)\n>shooting range to test your new toy\n> attachments for guns cvan either be bought or earned through a unlocking system\n> weapons included in game are: AR, SMG, LMG, Sniper Rifle, Secondary (pistol), and Melee\n>So far no hackers, just met players that are skilled\n> Skills are allowed to be shared amongst team members, ex: I activate tier 2 cloak then an ally who is using sprint ability activates tier 2 sprint, now whole team is able to use sprint and cloak if they press E to the people using Tier 2 abilities. This does not work with abilities such as turret or RPG arm.\n>NO RENTAL SYSTEM\n> Random Prize selection after games no matter if you lose or win\nThat is all the pro's that I can think of for now\n\nCons:\n> Ishikawa's turrets are alright, I personally think they are weak and take too long to start up. My experience with the turrets in the game mode terminal conquest is that the turrets are useless on alot of the maps.\n> The Bato RPG arm has a possibility to be spammed by players and prevent actual teamwork\n> Weapons have limited amount of attachments as of right now\n> Knifing animation prevents anyone from killing/canceling the attacker ex: If i knife a player then his friend cannot kill me by the time I have stabbed him\n> Knifing allows for an easy way to kill players 100% as long as the knifing prompt appears\n> Spawn kill exists and cannot be prevented so far\n> the Big Machines are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to destroy once spawned during Terminal Conquest (I never finished the tut so I dont know how to kill them once they are downed)\n> 1-10 sec Spawn Timer (I dont really care about the timer since it allows me to try and chat with players) allows enemies to advance on objectives if large amount of team is dead\n> Sometimes players dont know how to play objectively\n> Empty lobbies take forever to fill up and the only actual games with people in at the RANDOM section of QUICKPLAY\nAll that I can think of so far\n\nOk now people probably wonder what do they get if they get the Operative Pack? Well dont worry, all it gives players is an orange skin for the m4a1 and the mp5 along with 100k cash bonus. Note that a single attachment costs around 50k so the 100k is no big deal. I would say spend the money to just get the Recruit pack and then shoot people with rpg arm with mp5 in other hand until you are able to afford other attachments for other guns. For example, I use the mp5 since it kills enemies quick in CQB and then I got attachments for my m4a1 and now its beautiful.\n\nOverall I enjoy the game and I plan on playing it alot since I have been trying to look for a fun sci-fi FPS game lately. I have played fast paced FPS games before but I do prefer teamwork so this game is a pretty efficient mix to my liking, but I think some mechanics need to be worked on such as maybe allow players to traverse environment a bit easier, I mean the characters are augmented and work on the turrets awareness and stopping power. Also explain how to destroy the big machine in the tutorial since all it says is "Destroy the machine!". So far anything that requires real cash is going to be only cosmetic so far that is no big issue at all in my opinion.\n","January 1","true","45.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, it's actually a very enjoyable game at the moment, and at $5 for early access, it's definitely worth a try.\n\nOther than the characters and the somewhat of the map stylization, don’t expect this game to have much relation with the Ghost in the Shell series.\nOverlooking this point, it is a well-made FPS. The graphics are good, but not stellar. The gameplay is rough around the corners but perfectly reasonable and playable.\nWhat separates this game from other generic FPS titles is the "Skill Sync" ability. These abilities are unique to each character, and are fun to use with team mates in game.\n\nThere are complaints about bullet spread causing unintentional headshots or random respawns in enemy territory. I have experienced both, but honestly it is not a game breaking aspect, it really didn't bother me as a casual gamer.\n\nAlthough owned by Nexon, the in-game currency and market is quite fair. Leveling up will earn you enough to buy a few attachments and good unlockable weapons.\nHowever, I am unsure of how this will change once it is released as F2P.\n\nPros:\n- Surprisingly fun and easy to play\n- Casual and quick pace\n- Fair unlockable weapons market (For now)\n- Skill Sync abilities makes game feel more unique\n- Generally good quality game\n- Voice actors from the actual series\n- Short respawn timers\n\nCons:\n- Generic weapons\n- Small online population makes finding matches sometimes difficult\n- matchmaking isn't always fair\n- Does not relate to anime/movies at all.\n- Very limited number of maps\n- Bullet spread could need more work\n\nTL;DR\n7/10 for the game in its current state (if you can overlook Ghost in the Shell mask this FPS hides behind)\nThe game has a fair share of both pros and cons. I usually never play FPS games, nor do I find them very intriguing, but this one was nonetheless interesting. Go and give it a try.\n\n**My steam account says 3 hours of gameplay, but I've played about 20 hours already. This was due to the steam launcher always crashing for me, therefore I had to download the Nexon Launcher on their website. If anyone also has this issue, this solution worked for me.\n\n**Side note, this game is in Early Access, it is not in a perfectly polished state. There will be tons of patches and changes. The developers want feedback. Don't be that a**hole who takes the game way too seriously.","January 1","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as I can tell there seems to be a lot of customization but with the limited time that I've played it for I haven't unlocked much. In terms of gameplay, this game is definitely fun, the gameplay is pretty smooth, and it is quite fast-paced. In any case, an issue I've found to be slightly annoying is the use of hopping over objects, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Overall, I'd rate it a perfect 5/7.\nlol","December 28, 2015","true","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulfilter/recommended/369200/","soulfilter","John Wilkes Booth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soulfilter/","32 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI like it. I got this game on the Winter Sale going on. I used to be really into one of Nexons other games, Combat Arms, which was eventually riddled with hackers. So you can take a wild guess as to why I was hesitant to purchase this. But, after watching several gameplay vids online I was sold.\n\nAfter playing for a few hours I must say that this game has a ton of potential. It is very fast paced and the graphics are nice to look at. Some downsides are typical, especially when a game is basically in Alpha stage... For instance, bullet registry sometimes drops instantly and you find yourself firing blanks into an enemy. That issue tends to go away once you get used to tap firing. Also, there is some weird bug that leaves you wondering around like a ghost after you have been killed. You can still fire your weapons and attack players but they take no damage and you can't do anything that changes the outcome of the match. Another thing  since the game is in such an early stage the server options are very limited and sometimes you find that you are stuck with joining 1 or 2 rooms. I'm sure once the game grows that number will change.\n\nI still enjoyed my few hours of being a flat out noob, although I did get a bit frustrated with bullets not registering and getting me killed at times. But, all-in-all this will be a game I pay attention to for quite a bit. I hope it grows into something big because it could be a fun, competitive game.","December 28, 2015","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kimchi_Yoona/recommended/369200/","Kimchi_Yoona","Yoona","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kimchi_Yoona/","17 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGhost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online is an arcade style shooter that is reminiscent of the long-gone style of Call of Duty. It's an extremely quick paced first person shooter that is sure to satisfy fans of the genre.\n\nGitS:SAC - FA currently is in early access and is incredibly polished for a game so early in development. It has a small variety of guns but the ones currently included drastically change the gameplay. For example, the gun you're given, the M4A, is an assault rifle with decent mobility and decent fire rate. It has an odd spread but is great for mid to long range exchanges. The AK47, which can be unlocked after a few games of playing, has just about the same mobility but terrible fire rate, though it is justified with its insane damage and range; it's a guaranteed one-shot kill to the head and very hard to challenge from all ranges. Although it's only one example, the guns that are currently included in their respective category are all like this; they have a situation in which they excel in.\n\nAs much as this can remind people of CoD, it's far more team driven. One person can make a huge change in the game but will not be able to win the game by themself, due to the lack of any game-changing kill streaks. Scoring kills and playing the objective grant you ability points. Ability points are then used to activate your characters' special skill, which vary from character to the character. Each skill is unique and is, again, very situational. The great thing about this special skill mechanic is that some of these can be shared to the team; it is called Skill Link.\n\nThere are many noticeable bugs in the game, but that's going to happen with a game so early in development. There's the occasional player clipping in objects and some of the game mechanics not behaving properly, but all-in-all, it's still playable.\n\nTL;DR: I recommend getting early access if you're slightly interested in this game or the GitS universe. I recommend you check the game out when it is released, as it's going to be free to play.","December 26, 2015","true","38.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's to be expected. There are a handful of maps, a handful of weapons and a couple of game modes. Typically having played mostly Team Deathmatch and Terminal Conquest as I felt Demolition is a little bit underwhelming in this state as you only typically get to use your specials once a game.\n\nFor this price. It's worth it. Without a doubt. I got the specialist pack as it seemed the best value for money. The game balance is surprisingly on-point with the fact you have to play it to actually unlock your weapons and there's no real flat advantage to any one item. Gameplay is solid overall.\n\nIf you remember Call of Duty 4, this is probably the closest multiplayer experience that goes back to that (played it on Xbox 360 myself) so that's also good. I didn't like them much after that.\n\nIf you aren't sold on the concept by now, wait until it's out of Early Access. It'll hopefully be more polished by then.","December 26, 2015","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's still in early access beta so it has some work to do. There are times where lag create an unwinable round for me. Where I am running around shooting everyone in the head with no affect then I spawn because I wasn't really alive that whole time but my computer didn't know it. But that is small compared to how fun it is with the modes and skills. For only 8.99 I get a ton of fun and hearing the original english dub cast speaking througout the game is a blast too. Can't wait to see what this game grows into.","December 26, 2015","true","40.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly, the 0.5 hours I managed to play were really fun, but there is obvious signs this game is in Early Access and needs work. Secondly, as a Fan boy to GITS, Im still reviewing this as a game rather than it being linked to the series in anyway or form. EDIT: Go to the bottom for further info, As I have played more without it breaking, I have been able to go in more detail.\n\nSimply put, It's a fun game. Nexon have finally pulled something decent off and im proud im able to play something based of GITS. Nexon in my eyes, have been a poor game company, and the only reason I know about them is from when I tried PC gaming years a go before I even had a PC that could run anything, I lived off Free2Play games, and Nexon generally had the better games at the time (If you weren't a Club Penguin or RuneScape fan).\n\nI was going to be extremely Biased with Nexon making it, but I'm struggling to find any complaints to them as of right now, as the game is fun and they have made it clear that its in Early Access. My first 30 minutes had me watching some superb 3D cutscenes that were beautifully done, and the lip syncing and characters were spot on. you play a Tutorial that takes 10 minutes and you are thrown right into the game to start the Multiplayer side. Now, when I did the Tutorial, everything was Gravy, the game ran at 60FPS on highest no problem, no dips or nothing. the detail and smoothness was incredible, but this changes once you hit the main game. The menu's are pretty Laggy as of right now and suffer "slight" drops. none that were a problem so I took it upon myself to ignore that, However, once I tried some Team Deathmatch, improvements can be seen from a mile away.\n\nSome serious optimization needs to be done, as I was constantly dipping and freezing, to the point where my Computer had Blue Screened. I dont get this in anything else, so I'm completely sure it is due to the game being Early Access and unfinished, so I'll let it slide. Maps are Extremely Cramped, and the spawning is a little too easy to be trapped in if one team really out performs the other. I also noticed the amount of damage I was dealing to others and not getting a kill, where they would put a few shots in me and I was dead. Either the higher the rank, the better everything gets to the point of unbalanced gameplay, or I was missing something. Other than these few little complaints, this game has a lot of good.\n\nThe Detail put into making the characters and maps look as if they were straight extracting from the series, Is beyond believable. It looks nice, the characters are spot on, and all the little Cyber effects were amazing in their own way. The skills that are earned from playing are a nice addition that I actually enjoyed whilst some actually dont. the idea of Skill Sync so you share your skills around to other players was nice, but a little unresponsive in some cases. Guns are based off real weapons but then given that GITS touch to make them seem more futuristic and a lot of the equipment seemed really balanced. The only exception was a Thermo-camo Wall that makes a one way mirror for the team using it. Thought it enforces camping, Its not too bad as so much happens in the games, it really does end fast. There are plenty of Characters for you to choose as your main, all looking spot on and have a nice array of abilities for you to try. Maps need a little work on but make the game fast and fun, so a mixture needs to be added, and a possibly 2 more game modes at most. A game with too many game modes ends up being a pain when searching, as proven by the Call of duty Titles, but with plenty more to come I will keep my eye on this.\n\nAs for my own little biased opinions, I would've loved this game regardless. As an anime watcher for nearly 3 years, Ghost In The Shell is my favourite longer franchise so far, and I have seen a fair amount. I'm a complete sucker for Major, and still regard her as one of the best badass females in anime, and one of the best females all round. being able to play as Major is massive, but playing as Batou and co is just as nice. In the menu's I thought showing clips of the show was amazing, meaning I could see what made this show even better. I have high hopes for this game, unfortunately for me, I have to wait for updates so I can play without Bluescreening. I'm not complaining though, As I know once I can play properly, It will slowly rise to a top played game of mine.\n\nFor anyone who is wondering what GITS is, To be honest, take the step and watch it. Though, I love Stand Alone Complex (The TV series) I still think the movie from 1995 is the real cake taker. The visuals are much different, but the show is much nicer and better to watch. if you aren't too focused on watching it all, Episode 24 of SAC is what you need to see to truly understand this game.\n\nSpecial Thanks for Phantom for gifting me a copy whilst it was on Sale, It means I can finally shut up about acquiring this game before it was fully released.\n\nNexon, Dont fudge-pack this game up, I have high expectations from you!\n\nMajor is Hot!\n\nEDIT:\nAs I have played more recently, More has struck me than before. the forever constant FPS drops are more irritating beyond belief, and the lag seems absolutely disgusting. Not a lot while playing makes sense, and a lot needs nerfing and redoing. Shotguns are over powered like crazy, and snipers need to be less powerful. In a game where its close quarter combat, The snipers are silly, and then the shotguns ruin the fun for anyone using a rifle. Assassinations from the front need removing, and possibly add more maps that arent too cramped or too open. My last complaint is the aiming and accuracy. It is really annoying, and nothing makes sense. ADS never seems to accurate, and half of the time, hip firing is so innaccurate, luck has to be on your side to win. the Anti-cheat isn't working correctly either, as for around 3 games I was being teleported back to spawn for no reason - not just me but the entire team infact.\n\nA lot needs working, and it is the most frustrating 3 hours I have had in a long time. I had hope the first time I played, but its progressively getting worse. Nexon, Sort it out.","January 18","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

It looks very nice, plays fast and smoothly. Levels are well-planned and do a great job of approximating the pen and gouache look of the background art in the GITS anime. The character models look good and it sounds like they employed the same voice actors from the Bandai English dub of the anime, which is nice.\n\nThe character animations, however, are just so-so. Player movements sometimes appear unnnautral, and the tachikomas and tanks move about in a ridicuolusly herky-jerky fashion and clip through the environment a lot.\n\nThe team matching system seems fair enough, but the weapons are a little unbalanced and hits vs misses seem to be somewhat randomized, which is frustrating. The mechanism for switching guns leaves something to be desired within the heat of battle.\n\nThe SkillSync idea shows promise, but the way they're implemented just comes off as gimmicky. The ability to suddenly acquire an uncharacteristic new skill is kind of fun, but it's ultimately pointless from a tactical perspective. Lacking any mechanism for working out a collective strategy, you just end up with a bunch of teammates randomly employing the same ability for no coherent purpose.  It also tends to result in players of the same team ganging up together, apparently just so they can get in on the next shared skill.\n\nI'd certainly recommend this game if you're a GITS fanboy or fangirl who really loves team FPS games like Counterstrike. For $5, go ahead and knock yourself out. It's a fun way to kill a few hours, but I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it.\n\nBut to be honest I was expecting something a lot more intriguing from a GITS game. I would really like to have seen some Deus Ex-type tactical skills? Maybe something that actually requires strategy, like having some players run defense and protection while another player jacks into the network for some kind of hacking minigame that leaves them vulnerable? Instead of the hackneyed old bomb defusing plot with the countdown timer, maybe you have the team taking down a mainframe or commandeering some automated systems? Maybe some form of cyberbrain hacking to infiltrate and sabotage, like the spy in Team Fortress? I'm obviously just spitballing here...","May 4","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the original English VAs are here, the dive sequence is cool, good tutorial, "spray and pray" doesn't work, thematically appropriate abilities, grenades actually have a realistic damage radius and the sound is top-notch.\n\nHowever, it could stand to see improved level design and some balance tweaks.

Overall, its mechanics and gunplay feel very solid. There is something of a grind to obtaining new weapons and modifications for weapons, but it generally isn't so significant as to prevent an average player from obtaining them over a stretch of time.\n\nBy far the biggest issue has to be the netcode, which seems very unreliable past 70-100 ping. While I was able to maintain a good ping while on the east-coast server, when I switched to the west coast server to join some friends, the hit registration was noticeably worse, and several shots that seemed like they would hit didn't connect. Additionally, when my ping spiked to a bit over 70, I noticed similar issues on the east coast server. While this is anecdotal, it did seem to be an issue for me, but if you can keep your ping to <50 or so, I, at least, didn't notice any issues.\n\nIn summary, 7/10, a decent first-person shooter and one that is worth sinking a bit of time into, but not revolutionary, and with some netcode that (seemingly) works well only under good, but not average/slightly below average conditions.","May 1","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They never reinvited me despite all testers from that wave were reinvited so I didn't care to take it back up.\n\nAfter playing it the past 24 hours (8.2 on record at the time so I gave it a chance) I must say the changes, if any, were subtle.\n\nCons:\n*Money/exp is grindy but what game isn't? Also gives emphasis on cash shop but that isn't here (yet).\n*Only proper way to define it is 'glory kills' from Doom(4). You can mouse2 an enemy and basically execute them, however you are left standing there soaking all bullets or waiting to get chained. Think taunt kill in Team Fortress 2 but the only reason why you use melee.\n*Gun spread. Sure you heard of it but once you actually try to play with it you almost wonder what is the point in trying to scope in? If your first shot isn't a headshot (which btw any gun will 1 hit kill with a headshot) then you hold the fire button until one of you dies.\n*Abilities are extremly restricted. Each agent of Sec9 has their own perks, you unlock those perks by unlocking that character. You cannot change characters during a match and you have to buy unlock licenses in order to get more. You can pay-to-progress this with NX or grind out 100s of thousands of gp.\n*Range of Effectiveness is a lie (for the most part). I have seen the assault rifles have the range of effectiveness applied to them but it almost appears as if Shotguns / Sub-machine guns do not have them. People appear to be more accurate from mid-long range with smg than I am single / burst firing with AK-47 specd for stability/accuracy.\n\n[]Pointless Concepts found in this game (chop this up as basically 'Super Cons'):\n*AP (armor points): What is the point if only one Sec9 Agent can regenerate health but not armor? Seems like it doesn't do good since most die in 3-4 shots.\n*Grenade Warning Icon: Why have it if it phases into the UI behind you?\n*"Glory Kill" melee system: just let me humiliate someone by killing them, not make a spectical out of it\n*Agent Upgrades via Chip System: hardly any of them make a direct impact short of reload / movement / aiming\n*Respawning: classic Call of Duty: Modern Warfare+ respawning where you spawn at random places (save for 2 maps or any game mode that isnt Tdm)\n*Dead allies still talking: thats right! your fallen comrads will still talk as if they are still alive, despite missing a head.\n*Lack of voice-chat: no need for that right? only team-based shooter [no free for all]\n\nThere is a ton more, but basically I have better things to do.\n\nTLDR:\nCombat Arms with a Ghost in the Shell License. If you arn't good at aiming with scope and just hold left click then you will do well.\n\nTo Developers:\nDoing the same thing Doom Open Beta did to the public: showcasing only what the bare minimum of 'finished' content you have.

Get it if you always wanted a CS:GO and Team Fortress 2 hybrid. There are problems but couple of fixes and optimisation will make this game work like a clock. GITS lisence will atract attention but it's not neceserraly a good thing.\n\nFirst off I'd like to talk about what I feel about the anime, I liked the original movie because of it's philosopy, not neceserally because of the cyber terrorism stuff. I never had any interest to watch Stand Alone Complex because Ghost in the Shell was over for me when the original movie rolled its credits. The point was made, the story was told and trying to make anything else in the GITS universe would feel redundant for me. Imagine if the movie Her had a sequel, Ex-Machina, Interstellar, Inception, Akira had a sequel, GITS sequels feel the same for me. Just like Terminator 3 and the rest of the movies. The story was told and the point was made in T2. Conclusion; I don't really like the setting of this game that much.\n\nNow to the game; It's a great online action FPS with specialized classes and varied weapons and mods. Shooting experience is really good, music is good, atmospehere is good, maps are a little small but well designed. Game modes we have for now are TDM, Demo and Conquest. Only demo feels like GITS, other modes are just run and gun than respawn style modes, in Conquest camping will give you KDR, rushing will make your team win.\n\nAlthough variety of operatives are appreciated, some are extremely overpowered and some are reall underpowered. For example; There is a guy with litteraly "invurnerablity" skill, and compered to that dude, there is a gal with transperent wall which supposed to make you invisible if you stand behind it but your name will show up to enemies, making the skill completely useless. The idea of sharing skills is a good one, but that invurnerability armor is even more OP when it's shared. I'm sure there will be adjustments to the balance, for now there are huge power gaps between operatives.\n\nGame is poorly optimised. It has hitbox lag, mouse lag and random hitches which will ruin aiming. I'm hoping optimisation will come as the game releases.\n\nGame rewards weird behaviors with weird unbalances. For example the headshot multiplier is too great. You can overwhelm everyone in close and mid range combats with a high rate of fire SMG. Another example is in Conquest mode, camping will give you lots of kills but if you don't rush and take risks your team will most likely lose.\n\nThe GITS theme feels like a skin, a cover, a theme and nothing more. Maybe when the co-op versus bot modes implemented it'll feel more like GITS than a generic korean online FPS.","March 8","true","259.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First Assault is a fast paced FPS that features good gunplay and abilities that the player can use and share with their teammates. My review will cover the current iteration of First Assault, as it's currently still in Early Access.\n\nPROS:\n-The game is fairly easy to run and didn't cause any problems for my R9 380, it does offer a good amount of settings customization and resolutions.\nThough you can pay to advance through the ranks and get faster access to some equipment it doesn't mean that you'll be a better player, the Pay 2 Win thing isn't present here as far as I'm aware.\nGunplay isn't bad and spraying at any range isn't viable, the Mp5 is best suited to close range encounters while the M4 is better at medium to long ranges, as it should be.\nFast paced combat means that you'll be able to rack up huge kill streaks if playing correctly. I never saw any instances of "spawn trapping" either, which other shooters suffer from.\nSkillsync is fantastic concept that allows other players to use your ability as well.CONS\nThe hit registration for this game can be really bad at times, and it's made worse when it's a consistent problem. An improvement in this regard would see a major increase in the quality of the game.\nMelee kills - There's a character you can use that has a speed boost ability, which makes their sprint a lot faster. This character is used as melee only sometimes and can be more successful than someone with a weapon, the melee animation begins as long as they're close enough and with the speed boost skill they can get away quickly.\nLack of guns. You start off with an MP5, M4, and L118. There are a few more unlocks but really not that many, and there's only 1 pistol so far.\nThis game has a lot of potential to be good, and seeing the Ghost in the Shell title definitely caught my eye, as I'm sure it did others. The current state of the game isn't bad, but it needs more to really become a competive title that has players consistently coming back for more.","May 2","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm a procrastinator by nature, so you should probably know already just how much of an impact this particular game has had on me.\n\n"Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online" is a rather bright and flashy FPS that seeks to eradicate the era of "brown FPS" once and for all. The great thing is, this slid by everyone's noses. Rather than with Blizzard's "Overwatch", this game has had no discernable media coverage or hype, which sucks a little considering the smooth graphics and desolation of Australian Servers. (Seriously if you're buying this as an Australian you're in bad-luck-town). What this does mean, however, is that the game is in serious need of players and "testers".\n\nSeriously, I can't endorse this game enough.

Some of those being character related, some weapon-balancing related. I haven't played much of this game, but at first glance, I was not expecting much out of it. I watched a few episodes of the GitS series, and I rather enjoyed them, and I was honestly excited to see this game on Steam.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Great customization system\n-A variety of characters to choose from\n-Viable weapons\n\nThe Cons:\n-Small weapon variety\n-Some characters abilities do almost nothing (Motoko's Therm-Optic Camo)\n-OP weapons like the 870 ICS\n\nAll in all:\nI will say that I definately recommend picking this game up, even if you have not watched any of the show. It is a great game to just pick up and play, though some of the weapons need a little bit of a buff (Such as M4A1 or AK47). There also needs to be more weapons added, because at the moment, all anyone is using is either the 870 ICS or the AK47 with an external barrel to make it do an unbelieveable amount of damage (even with body shots). Either way, this is a great game and deserves to be treated as such.

Still a great game. Still adoring every minute of it. Community is surprisingly good, unlocks are great, skill matters more than weapons, and GP gaining is still quick enough to buy tons of great weapons, though the starting ones are still VERY viable and you can always buy with GP stuff you haven't unlocked. It's just cheaper if you do unlock it seems.\n\nI was skeptical, because Nexon Corp are involved, and I am ALWAYS, ALWAYS cautious about korean MMOs, what with their grinding, pay2win f2p models, and legions and legions of hackers that always seem to turn up just to ruin the entire game. I adored both Gunz and S4 League when they were in beta and weren't saddled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥zz p2w mechanics and hackers. The moment they actually released? That's when the p2w bs started, and also when the hackers started. It made them abysmal immediately.\n\nSo you can imagine how worried I was when I saw one of my most beloved anime franchises turn into an online game published by Nexon. At the behest of a close friend though (who shares my feelings on f2p crapstackery), I gave it a try during the recent free weekend and HOOOLY HELL I was wrong, this game is awesome.\n\nI mean it's balanced, it feels good, you can pay for in game currency (NX i think it's called) but that's purely for weapon skins and character skins by the looks of things (some of which genuinely look really cool actually), and I know this is in Early Access still, but guns and attachments you can purchase with the normal currency earned in game (GP), which you get quite a bit of with each match. Maybe ten matches will be enough to get you the cash necessary to purchase a bunch of attachments. Also levelling up at the start goes really nice and quick so you can unlock more operatives fairly quickly. Again it costs GP to unlock further operatives after that but again you'll earn a fair bit from each match.\n\nThere's three game modes: TDM, a TF2 style CP game mode, and what is effectively Counterestrike's default bomb setting game type. All three are fun and have their own unique twists, like the Tachikoma support in the CP mode upon capturing a point, and how you can hack it to lower its defences so you and your team can take it out as fast as possible, balanced by the hacker being always visible on the map so the opposing team can hutn them down to stop this from happening.\n\nEvery operative is functionally identical apart from their special skill, half of which can be shared between nearby team-mates (another great unique feature), and all of which have a higher tier mode if you let them charge enough, which buffs their abilities. You can also switch between three loadouts (which you can customise) between respawns, and each one you use earns TP at the end of the match to unlock more attachments and customisation for purchase (again with GP so far, Hope it stays that way!)\n\nGameplay wise it feels nicely balanced, fast paced, levels are nicely designed without (so far) any annoying chokepoints which favour one side more than the other, and hell it's Ghost in the Shell, what's more to love? It also has a Counterstrike style radar which functions seemingly exactly the same way, and it's a great addition. The HUD is nice, clear and easy to understand, and the contextual actions are clear and easy to understand in a blink.\n\nThere's a ton of really great decisions and right now it's free to play, and only £2 to get the basic package to gain you access forever. So why not? Best hurry though, only 10 more hours or so.","May 1","true","26.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkarolak/recommended/369200/","rkarolak","Blue Arrow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkarolak/","703 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTLDR: There are game gameplay balance issues and bugs, but it's overall good for a pre-relase game. Bugs and lack of polish is to be expected. I think it's worth the $5 to try out and see what directions the game makes as development continues.\n\n***\n\nOverall I enjoy playing this game (in it's pre-release status), but there are lots of polish that need to happen before it's released.\n\nNote: I haven't watched Ghost in the Shell yet, although I plan to now. I can't comment on how well it is in that regard.\n\nA few things I've noticed so far:\n\nThe gameplay has some unique elements, but still needs more work to stand out from other shooters out there. The hitboxes and damage needs lot of refinement. Basically, you need to pretty much always always shoot for the head. I've emptied a clip from an SMG on an enemy's torso and they managed to survive it, yet pretty much any shots to the head critically wounds them, if not killing them outright, even if you are at full health. The nano-gel ability mitagates this, but only temporarly It's finding these imbalances and learing how to take advantage of them that can make a major difference in surviving.  Until then it can be very frustrating feeling like everyone's killing you so easily and it's difficult for yourself. It took me a few hours to get a feel for the game and then I was able to improve my KDR. Once you find a gun that works well for your playstyle things will be less difficult.\n\nThe spawn locations need improvement. I've seen an enemy spawn directly behind our team while assaulting a terminal allowing him to kill several of us. There's also some spawn protection, which is in general good, but made it impossible to take him down for a few seconds. There's been a few times an enemy has spawned a few feet in-game from me or a teammate allowing them to kill us quickly (again, spawn protection).\n\nThe melee weapon can be fun to use and it should be even better with the speed and camo/cloaking abilities, but I haven't seen many people actually kill others with the standard attack, but instead always having to use the assasination ability. This ability will show up if you're next to them, even if they see you or you are in front of them. This kills people instantly, but you can't move for the few seconds that it takes to complete. That makes melee mostly useful when using on lone enemies, otherwise while you'll complete the kill all of the other team is shooting at you and you die right away. I think this needs lots of refinement, but will be really fun when it is.\n\nThere's also some ocassional bugs and oversights. The cameo power usually works fine, but sometimes you'll see the enemy's name tag near them, making the cloak a bit pointless. There were also a few times I don't think it registered a kill, even if it told me I made it.\n\nThe gameplay initally seems to play a lot like Call of Duty, but I've found that you will do best if you keep yourself moving around. Other than a few across the maps, there aren't a whole lot of good places to play as a sniper. A lot of the maps are mostly close quarters to a medium distance. Some of the maps are relatively open while some others are very linear without a lot of choice when it comes to trying to approach a target location.\n\nThe player community seems okay so far. Most players get along, but you'll occasionally get the kind of player who racks up lots of kills on a demolition or hacking map and fails to help the team then complains about how horrible the team is. Unless it's team deathmatch it's important everyone's playing ball otherwise you're team fall apart. You can get all the kills and high KDR you want, but it ultimately does nothing if you're not helping your teammates. I suppose every game has these people, but I seem to run into a small select few who keep poping up, and I'd hate to see the player atmosphere devolve into the sort of negative ones that some other FPSs have.\n\nPerformance wise it's been pretty consistant at 60fps on my hardware (i7 3770k, GTX 670, 12 GB RAM, SSD, HD). There have had been a few times where the fps will drop near 30 fps for a few seconds and then quickly recover. Fortunitely that has only been two or so times. I've also had some unexpected latency in some matches, where I'd get my usual 30-60 ping then it would jump up to 100-170 for ten minutes. However, I don't know if that's a problem with the servers or just me.\n\nOverall I'd recommend the game. It's far from perfect, but I expect things will improve. If you keep your expectations in check it's certianly worth the $5 (as of this review).","May 14","true","15.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely makes me second guess a number of things, mostly stereotypes. One, that Nexon only imports their garbage titles and they are handled terribly in the east (or buys only cheap, bad titles and publishes them here). Also, that known licenses dont make good games (with a few exceptions). Another would be that EA buy-ins (especially from sketchy publishers known for producing garbage) will not end well. The game is clearly lacking, both in content and in substance. Mostly in content.\n\nHere's hoping by full release they dont do what most companies do and buckle and make some kind of major changes that ruin the game. Not shaping up to be a cash grab either. Another barrier set by stereotypes would be foreign FPS MMO hybrids with lobbies are all the same. GITS:SAC is actually a decent game with the ability to become something truely special if they can dump enough money and time into it and speed up the rather slow development. Since it is EA As it stands:\n\nGraphics: 7\n\nLasting appeal: 4 (atm) with much promise and intuitive and creative ideas that if kept and implemented correctly will sustain the game alone for years to come. so for that i will say:  6.5\n\nControls: 7.5\n\nCommunity: 8.5\n\nHandling/Management of game: 6 atm (but because of it being Nexon and their history i bump to an 8)  8\n\nUpdates/patching/ EA development and rollouts: 5.5\n\nOverall: 6.5 as it stands, with easily the promise for an 8 to 8.5 if they do nothing but add more maps and a few promised features. If they really excell it could possibly garner a 9/9.5 even. However, i am still extremely leery with Nexon and have a 75% chance feeling that they are going to ruin the game in one way or another by release or shortly after. Especially if they dont get enough sales...Hopefully they prove me wrong. Definitely worth it if your only going to buy the 5 dollar entry or F2P full release(especially if they come through). So id say worth a play and to do so casually and occasionally and sit on it until a full east version is completed and released with contiual updates, could be a highly populated good go to FPS/MMO hybrid.","May 15","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a GiTS fan, I love the character design of Motoko et al. The music is en pointe. The graphics are great; fast and smooth thus far.\n\nOne problem: No one to play with.\n\nIf I were involved in the game design process, I would have made an argument for kicking this off with a PvE or singleplayer mode. There are a few reasons, one of which is certainly based on hindsight:\n\n1) It's a game about an Anime show. Give me half a reason to play and I will. Unlike Call of Dudeskis, I'm actually obsessed with the subject matter/ambiance so capitalize on that and create a series of PvE missions which highlight key features like the operative skills, etc.\n\n2) Way, way easier to sort out bugs when you reduce variables. With all of this netcode speculation, who really knows at this point. Now, instead of having the luxury of sorting out specific gameplay features like shooting, moving and skills, the devs also have to worry about multiplayer optimization. Seems to me that PvP would be easier to tackle after learning some lessons about the player base in PvE.\n\nSpeaking of this, I feel like the designers made just a few too many assumptions about what the player wants. For an early access/iterative release, the main advantage is making small sets of assumptions and validating them first--again in some simplified PvE that lets people fan boy out in GiTS land.\n\nAgain, I think something really solid and workable is here, but without a player base, I can't hold out much hope. On a totally random side note: Maybe I've been playing too much Xcom 2, but the awesome models in First Assault make me really, REALLY want a reskin of Xcom with Motoko and Section 9. I would love to move cyborgs and think tanks around on a map of Dejima...","May 17","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But dammit, it's fun. Taking the overly saturated multiplayer FPS genre and running with it, First Assauly Online stands above its contemporaries with great maps, developers who are willing to listen to their playerbase, somewhat realistic bullet damage, sniping that actually requires skill, and overall feels much more true and gritty than say, Call of Duty. That being said, if you only enjoy shooters akin to CoD, it'd be wise to stay far, far away from this.\n\nOf course, it's not perfect. It's still clearly early access and while you'll see a lot of reviews complaining about hit detection, in most cases it's really nothing too severe. It's certainly enjoyable, and as a Ghost in the Shell fan, unless you can dig up a copy of the PS1 game, this is undeniably the best it'll get for you.\n\nIf you enjoy a good tactical online shooter, this is a must have, especially for its price (and if $5 is still too much, the game's free if you sign up on the website. The steam version is basically just instant access plus cosmetics and in-game currency (which can be easily unlocked just by playing)). To add, despite microtransactions being in place, they are only for A. cosmetics, and B. points earned by leveling for people who don't want to wait. The game itself is not in any way pay to win.

Even Combat arms is better, and before this piece of trash, I would have called that the worst FPS ever made.\n\nOn a positive note, the character skins and abilities are neat. That doesn't help much though.","June 5","false","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But now... they got 5 Servers (2 US, 2 EU, 1 Australian). 4 of them are empty 24/7 and the only one with players (EU West), got like 2 rooms á 5 people playing at its primetime.\n\nI serioulsy wonder, this game still gets supported and not called dead finally. Well, support might be too much, as you cant call patches with new Skins and Weapons for real money, support.\n\nOthers Pros and Cons.\n\n+ if you get to play it can be pretty fun\n+ fast paced shooter with some kind of tactic\n+ each character with his own special ability\n\n- the graphic is less than decent for 2015/ 2016, just grey in grey with a low amount of polygons\n- the buyable Skins are kinda wasted, since all enemies look the same from your view (some counterstrike-like terrorist-model)\n- the spacial skills arent balanced at all, Makotos Invisibility isnt completly invisible, so its pretty useless, Arm-Rockets kill you instantly, no matter how many hp you have, in a pretty big area, seeker drones are op as ♥♥♥♥ (you send them out, they spot an enemy, follow him endless, stick to him, explode and kill you, no matter how many hp) and the hyperspeed in combination with shotgun or knife is simply gg, since you can insta-kill people with knife, if you get somehow close, without any counterchance.\n- There are 3 Diffrent Main Weapontypes (snipe, shotgun, spray). From like 30 guns, 3 are shotguns, 3 sniperrifles and 24 are smg, mg and rifle. The First guns are more or less all horrible.\n-The Starter Snipe cant hit anything further away than 5 metre, no matter if it would have been a straight hit, while the Sniperrifle for around 250k ingame money (you get like 50-200 per match, depending on the amount of kills, without real money boosts and 10k for a level up which goes quite fast at start but from around lvl 10 on takes ages).\n-Shotgun is just halfway aim, shoot, kill and there are 2-3 really op smgs, picked by pretty much all players left in the game.\n\nIll spare you any more. All in all its quite unbalanced, so all people play the same 3 chars /classes, pick the same 3 guns and play one of 3 modi with only a handful maps. So save your money and invest it in... i dont know... CS:GO i.e. I hate CS:GO but its still a thousand times more fun than this game.","June 5","false","21.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wish it had a little more of the style of the original movie, alas, but it's still fantastic. Not all the assets hardcore fans want are there, but most are. Two words: Mary McGlynn. So, yea.\n\n\nLevel Design: 9.5/10 Sooooo much better than your average modern fps, more like Sonic or Mario in terms of balance.\n\nPay Wall: Not bad at all. Noobs pay to unlock AUTO-AIM, so it's fun to pick up their guns after you ice them, and then call them out.\n\nSound: 8/10 Just a few original voice actors are missing, overall sound is CRISP and top notch quality. The weapon switch sounds need to be the same sound as moving leather armor in your inventory in any Infinity Engine game. Stand Alone Complex used that same sound effect library, check it out, not kidding.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 ABSOLUTELY STUNNING and OPTIMIZED very well so far.\n\nLag: Bad sometimes. Not a lot they can do about it, and honestly I'd rather have the honest lag than something that covers it up cuz there just isn't much they can do about lag.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 Don't. Change. A.

(Frame Rate dropping from 60 to 0)\n\nThe guns, kick, a lot... can't decide whether this is a bad thing or not neccessarily... it just seems like even when I'm on target my gun still fails to take them down. Tapping the trigger is definitely the way to play right now.\n\nThe graphics are not that great, now don't get me wrong, I don't mean this as a specifically bad thing about the game, I  just wanted to point that out in this review.\n\n\nThe good:\n\nThis game, lets you pay in game money for character slots! You heard me! No microtransactions as of yet for new characters, just 249.000 in game money, (You get 50,000 every time you level up) And you get a free character liscense at ranks 3 and 5!\n\nThe gameplay, is fantastic. It's a fast paced game with decent gun play and a lot of teamwork.\n\nEach character in the game has a different skill, and these skills can be combined in combat to make some interesting scenarios. ie: If your skill reaches rank 2, (Note: This is only applicable to certain skills) you can activate a skill link, allowing nearby friendly players to share that skill with you. I usually play as a a character that grants a speed boost. When I was playing a match of TDM earlier, our team combined a rank 2 defense boost, with my rank 2 speed boost, and that combination took us well into the lead, making us harder to kill and faster than any of the enemy team.\n\nThe progression system is on point. You spend a small amount of credits on guns/attachments to gain the ability to EARN them, not actually buying them. ie: I spent around 30,000 credits on a gun, and it was added to my unlocks, and requires 200 tp to unlock. At the end of every match, depending on how well you did, you earn a certain amount of tp, and it goes towards that unlock. Once you get the required amount of tp, that gun is now available to you in your armory.\n\nThe game's maps at the moment are not plentiful, but they do the job.\n\n\nOverall, I think this game is definitely worth the $5 to play for a bit, and it will most definitely be worth downloading at launch when the game is Free To Play.","December 15, 2015","true","11.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Cons: Few maps\nWeapons don't have that GitS theme\nSpawns are not the best(can spawn surrounded by enemies, even with the few seconds of immunity, still kinda a pain.)\nMap textures are a bit lacking compared to the character's\nMap sizes; Would be nice to have a few, larger scale maps, especially for TDM\nHit detection seems to be pretty random\nNo ammo pickups\nGuns are very innacurate, even when aiming down the scopes\nOverall, a good game if you can put up with a few issues that will hopefully be smoothed out as the game gets more feedback. Is it worth the $5? Yes. Feels like most other F2P Shooters out there, and would be nice if they added some sort of Co-op mission mode that feels like you're reinacting parts of the anime, but a good game considering it just came out today.\n\nIf you're afraid of the game just having Nexon's name on it, please just stay away and cry somewhere else. Too many reviews with under 1hr of gameplay and most just saying it's "P2W" which it is not atm. We'll see if it goes that route, but I'm hoping it doesn't.\n\nIn the end, I would rate this game a 7.5/10 and will change my review as it gets updated.","December 14, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yes.\nWould I recommend it? Hell yes!\n\nLet's all keep in mind this is an Early Access stage, and by purchasing it we accept that the game HAS flaws and is incomplete, I don't get why people should downvote it only because of this.\nFor what I see, it has such a great potential. It's fun, fast, dynamic, and as a Ghost in the Shell lover I appreciate the effort put in keeping the original voice acting and small details that make this game an average FPS with Ghost in the Shell references.\n\nThere are several features I'd like to talk about:\n\n- Weapon Customization: You begin with basic weapons that can be upgraded by changing different parts (ex. barrel, scope, magazine...). Unlockable parts take time to be available as you earn point while playing. Those parts modify the weapon stats, enhancing a value while giving a disadvantage (ex. small damage increase - huge movement speed decrease).\n\n- Shooting Range: I personally found it to be an extremely useful area to test your weapon, learn how to use it and to test some techniques to polish your gameplay.\n\n- Teamwork: Teamwork is necessary. Rambo gameplay only ends up in a very long death ratio. Teamwork is also sponsored by the devs thanks to skill sharing: when a player uses a Tier 2 skill, all the nearby teammates can use it as well. Think twice before going solo.\n\nThere are a couple of aspects I would like to point out, just minor bugs I found and advices I'd like to give the developers (which are doing such an amazing job so far) hoping they could read this review:\n\n- Matchmaking: I found that sometimes teams are not well balanced, it's easy to find teams made of a majority of operatives/classes of the same type or made of lower levels players.\n\n- Respawn: A very rare "bug", it happened that I spawned in the middle of the enemy team. It may be due to the size of the maps that at the moment is still a little bit smaller than expected.\n\n- Linear maps: So far the maps have quite a linear feel. I would like to see some open maps where the player can move with more liberty.","December 15, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sure it's an Free2Play game made by Neople and published by Nexon. I had some starter problems (cause of the Steam-Nexon Account stuff) but the gameplay itself is fun in my opinion. It doesn't achieve something thats worth calling Ghost in the Shell, but hey - right now it's early access. Not much content so far, and TDM sucks a bit hard because the Spawn System. Overall the Maps are looking good itself but it lacks something, not quite sure what it is. The main problems are : the random spray pattern - it shoots everywhere if you dont burst with your weapon. yet rookies with no aim and only hipfire kinda often give you some headshots which brings me to the second point : the hitboxes - it's not worth aiming for the head because you mostly won't hit it, until like I already said go for hipfire.\n\nTL;DR : If you want an Free to Play - First Person shooter thats seem promising and fun - buy it. It sure has its frustrating moments where you can't do everything with your Skill - but I have high hopes that they're changing it.","December 22, 2015","true","74.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A yes, because it brings a new vibe to First Person Shooter games, and it is quite fun when you can figure out the controls. There is a new era in this game with it different choices of characters and techology you can use with the different characters you wanna play with. I find that this is really fun to dink around with. If you get good at the game, you can become a very good FPS gamer in this game. So brovo to Nexon for creating a new kind of game.\n\nA no, becuase the game is utterly unfair. Pay to win. Want a better gun? Put your cash into it as fast as you can and you'll become a better player within 24 hours. This is unfair: When someone bull rushes you, you shoot them in the head twice. It doesn't kill them and they knife you to death, like in many FPS games... a head shot is suppose to do that, kill someone in one hit with 1 or 2 headshots. I feel like their are aim botters in this game and it ruins it. I hope that Nexon can find those players and ban them from the game. It would make the game so much better! I also want to say that it has a lot of whiners, and try hards in this game.\n\nJust a fair warning before starting this game: There are a lot of rude people that won't wanna play with you if you're just begining. They will bash on you and try to hurt your feelings. The tryhards are the rude ones because they will complain that you "suck" and should "quit at life." Just ignore these players and play the game as causal and for fun as you can.\n\nGlad there isn't voice chat for this game. The chat would get so salty.\n\nOverall, fun game, but needs lots of fixing.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Aim botters.\n2. Pay to win.\n3. Players are rude.\n\nPros:\n\n1. New community.\n2. New genre for FPS\n3. Cheap game to buy.\n\nThey need to add a feature where we can just play around and train against bots. Throwing us against already good players is a bad way to promote the game. Train us better or have better training features.\n\nOverall I give this a B+ and a thumbs upish.","December 23, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Average even. The mechanics show a lot of promise through. The cyborg superpowers your characters get work really well for encouraging teamwork, adding a twist to the standard F2P Shooter model, and so far the business model seems enough like Dirty Bomb to be enticing, but not as punitively ridiculous as Blacklight: Retribution.\n\nThe game uses the English VAs for Stand Alone Complex, which is ♥♥♥♥ing spectacular, and goes well with the overall attachment to the theme.\n\nFor $5 it's definitely worth it for fans of the series. If the game improves over development, I'll be back to give it an more vigorous thumbs up.","December 14, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Cons: Few maps\nWeapons don't have that GitS theme\nSpawns are not the best(can spawn surrounded by enemies, even with the few seconds of immunity, still kinda a pain.)\nMap textures are a bit lacking compared to the character's\nMap sizes; Would be nice to have a few, larger scale maps, especially for TDM\nHit detection seems to be pretty random\nNo ammo pickups\nGuns are very innacurate, even when aiming down the scopes\nOverall, a good game if you can put up with a few issues that will hopefully be smoothed out as the game gets more feedback. Is it worth the $5? Yes. Feels like most other F2P Shooters out there, and would be nice if they added some sort of Co-op mission mode that feels like you're reinacting parts of the anime, but a good game considering it just came out today.\n\nIf you're afraid of the game just having Nexon's name on it, please just stay away and cry somewhere else. Too many reviews with under 1hr of gameplay and most just saying it's "P2W" which it is not atm. We'll see if it goes that route, but I'm hoping it doesn't.\n\nIn the end, I would rate this game a 7.5/10 and will change my review as it gets updated.","December 14, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also weapons like the one lmg in the game automatically beats every single smg  with its fire rate in close quarters and it has as much range and damage as an assault rifle, clearly this needs a nerf. Shotguns have terrible hit detection, i shot someone not even 3 feet away, runs straight at me with his m4 and i hip fire a shell into his chest -> doesnt kill him but he headshots me... really?\n\nTeam Collision - Its super annoying when your teammate blocks you from going back into cover and you get shot up by the enemy or vice versa, also more so you keep getting blocked as you journey accross the map by some of your teammates or them standing in the middle of door ways trapping you in a room\n\nControls - at some essential points ive realized how stiff the aiming and movement can be while playingin an intense match\n\nFire Spread - I know that going full auto should increase the spread, but the rate of spread in this game is so severe you can be a few feet away from an enemy spray your bullets and only about 1/4 of them would hit your target unless you went to burst or semi.\n\nOther then those issues, this game is fairly good, worth the $5 early access start, and clearly one of the better games in the overall 2015 game roster.\n\nDevelopers please address these issues and fix them in the next hotfix or update, the issues are extremely annoying and are quite harmful to the game's status.","December 19, 2015","true","73.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It feels and plays very much like todays common FPS. If you are looking for something to compare it to, somewhat like Call of Duty I suppose (cannot officially say cause I do not play Call of Duty). As I continue to play it, I hope it does not feel like a skinned version of other FPS classics.\n\nThe one huge bummer that disappointed me is lack of controller support. Does not have controller support (at the moment of it's release). I really hope they add it ASAP. I am not a keyboard fan and I would love the option.\n\nI haven't played it long enough to say it is awesome or terrible.

This is an early access review, so I hope that the devs will make improvements because this is a game with potential.  But that potential is not yet realized.\n\nSummaryThe graphics and art are very good.  Controls are mostly responsive, with the only caveat being sometimes sprint doesn't work when I want it to (like trying to get clear of a grenade).  Voice acting is very good.  The sci-fi theme of Ghost in the Shell seems overwhelmed by the generic theme of "I am a shooter".  Really, this is another military-style FPS with a different coat of paint, and that is where the potential is unrealized.\n\nShooting MechanicsAs noted in some other reviews -- shooting mechanics are wonky.  I've had several instances where my taget is right in front of me, ironsights right on him, firing -- and I get greased because not one bullet I fired actually hit.  It is a source of confusion that took me a while to understand, and even then I find the design to be rather "meh."\n\nIt all revolves around gun upgrades as they focus mostly on improving stability (less recoil) and accuracy (bullets fly straight).  Without these upgrades, most guns are unreliable and bullets can do unnatural things like fly diagonally, sometimes even excessively so -- and yes, miss a target right in your face.  But once I dumped a ton of GP on a K22 assault rifle and installed a scope, laser sight, different barrel, muzzle, and grip -- it was a much more reliable weapon.  Not perfect by any means, but noticeably better.  I had a similar experience in upgrading a MP5-V5A smg.\n\nBut fully upgrading a gun has its costs.  First you play a bazillion matches to unlock certain guns and acquire GP.  Keep in mind that unlocked guns and upgrades still cost GP, although not as much as those guns/upgrades in the "market".  But the game is rather generous starting out.  You get a GP bonus at every level and the first few levels go quick.\n\nBut the costs don't end there.  Most upgrades also reduce certain combat stats, like movement speed and attack range.  Sometimes also damage and weapons swap speed.  A few upgrades run counter and actually reduce stability, which you really need more of.\n\nAnd this is why I conclude, "meh."  Upgrading guns isn't about making them interesting, but rather to make them useable -- at a sacrifice to other combat stats.\n\nCommunityMy review comes after a free Steam weekend, which would imply that there are more people playing than normal.  What chatter I saw in game seemd to indicate that impressions were it was a decent game, but perhaps not compelling enough to buy in.  Although at $5 for the recruit's package, you can do a lot worst than this.\n\nBut more important is that even during the free weekend, I am consitently playing matches with/against the same people.  Is that due to matchamaking or is that due to a limited pool of players?  I don't know.  But everytime I tried to join a Terminal Conquest match, there were not enough players around to start the game.  But I had no trouble getting going in Team Deathmatch or Demolitions.\n\nUnrealized PotentialThe Ghost in the Shell anime series and movies are action heavy, but the plot revolves around more than just greasing badguys.  And this is where the game's potential goes unrealized.  This is an FPS that does little more than just grease the badguys (the enemy team).  Sure, each operative (aka "class") has a unique power based on their role in the anime, but these don't add enough to the theme to set it apart from other military-style shooters.\n\nNotes to Devs1) Everytime someone on the enemy team uses one of their operative's powers, it's announced.  So, everytime I took a rocket to the face and been reduced to scrap, I hear, "The enemy is using an arm launcher."  Really?--You don't say.  Kinda figured that one out when it hit me in the face.  This would be more meaningful if announced when a launcher is armed, not when it's fired.\n\n2) Speaking of Batou's arm launcher.  It would be great if I could "put it away".  More than a few times, I primed it to setup a hallway multi-kill only for my team to clear the hallway before I could setup the shot.  And now I'm stuck hobbling around with this thing until I find another target -- any target.\n\n3) Awards for skills are unbalanced.  They strongly favor those operatives that can share their powers, like Motoko's thermo-camo.  Those operatives whose powers are not shareable (like Batou's arm launcher) earn substantially less rewards.  It's something I observed immediately after I started playing Motoko after I had played Batou for several hours.\n\nConclusionBeing early access, there is always hope that the game will get better.  And I have to admit that I had a lot of fun with it, despite its flaws (and getting greased more often than not).  You can do worst than this game for $5.  But at the time of this review, I find the game is still too "raw" to be able to recommend it.  But there is potential for greatness, although that is a long road from here.  Hopefully, the devs are good for the journey.\n\nEdits: Style, grammer","May 1","false","14.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you have not yet paid for early access, then don't. You are better off waiting until this game is free to play. The controls are clunky and slow. When shooting, you might as well drag the mouse across the table like you are having a seizure. If you want to use a controller, you will quickly find out that the inputs for it are bugged. As some other users have stated, you will fire your weapon continously or be unable to aim down the sights.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, you aren't missing much. It the grindy unlock system that the entire COD franchise uses. The 3 modes are TDM, Demolition, and some sort of control that I have not checked out yet. Of course, the phrase Team Death Match is used loosely. Everyone runs around in opposite directions and gets shot, much like in a certain other franchise that keeps coming out every year. This game also is succeptible to hackers, just like every other FPS on the market. For some reason we can't  just play the game and enjoy it. The hit detection is attrocious. There are times when it works ok and even when you die you know it is because your skills aren't up to others'. Then there's plenty of times when you shoot someone who is facing the other direction, emptying your entire clip into the back of their head or chest and they simply turn around and one shot you. All of this makes for a frustrating experience.\n\nStory? There is none. In fact, I would go as far as to say that this has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell. It's just a skin with some of their voices.\n\nTL;DR\n-Pros: Shooty, shooty\nCheap\n\n-Cons: Fix the controller support\nImprove slow and clunky controls\nFind some magical way for the bullets to get to where you are aiming.\n","May 1","false","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - First Assault Online is a futuristic, FPS game based on it's anime/manga counterpart.\n\nI would rate the game a solid 8/10 for a F2P game, but a 6/10 for a game in general. It's like CoDs futuristic little brother. he's a bit of an ♥♥♥, but he's fun to be around. All you can do is hope that he'll become a better person with some life experience, although somehow you doubt it.\n\nTHE STORYIf you came to this game for any sort of plot, you're better off reading or watching the source material this game is based on. Being a F2P (Atleast when it releases anyway), there isn't any campaign, but there is story there, you just have to know about Ghost In The Shell. To sum the main story up, you play as Section 9 members (cybernetically augmented Humans/Cyborgs who are pretty much like futuristic police/armed-forces), and you have to fight Terrorists throughout Japan's streets. I personally never read or watched any of the source material, so I can't really compare how true it is to the source, but I imagine this is what the show was like so...\n\nGAMEPLAY PROSThe Game itself is extremely fun for short periods of time. It looks great, plays great and feels great.\nPros:\n- The game is FUN.\n- Fast-paced matches.\n- 'Kinda(?) balanced guns.\n- Small (quick) sized maps for Deathmatch and Medium maps for the other game modes.\n- Will be F2P upon release.\n\nTHE PAYMENT MODELI had some doubts about this game, since it is made by Nexon, who are notorious for making pay to win games, but they proved me wrong this time. The game seems pretty (Not fully) balanced, so it's not exactly pay to win, but don't get me wrong, this game has micro-transactions. You can purchase currency in this game to purchase characters and weapons/attachments quicker, but they're (kind of) optional. Of course you can unlock everything everything through gameplay, but in 6 hours of game play, I've unlocked maybe 3 attachments and no guns even. The purchases are the problem, The currency isn't over-priced, its just guns and everything else is. For example a rifle is 250K credits and you earn a couple of thousand per-match. And then you have to unlock each individual attachment for that weapon, with each unlock costing around 50K credits. At the beginning of the game, you level up quickly and with each level you are given X amounts of credits (usually around 50K), but each level gets slower and slower, until it's just a painfully slow grind. It would probably take you around 8 hours of gameplay to get enough credit for 1 gun! It's pretty bad, and it encourages you to pay for credits, but hey! This is F2P so what did you expect?\nNote- Just because bying credits speeds things up, it's not necessarily P2W. See below and I'll explain.\n\n(I also wanted to note, If you buy into the E.A. you only get one of the skins that is shown in the E.A rewards picture. I got the MP5 but I'm not sure if its random for everyone else.)\n\nTHE GUNSI Really enjoy using the guns in this game. They're all fairly easy to use and none are OP. You start off with an SMG, a Rifle and a Sniper. All are fairly decent and with skill, could beat someone with one of the purchasable guns 9/10 times. I personally really like the MP5 as it makes for good stealthy and speedy play. Paired with the Stealth or Speed operatives, this thing is a beast. However, all the guns are decent in their own respects. There are around 15 available weapons, yet more are added occassionaly, though I haven't been able to play with any other weapons. Weapons themselves range between 200K-250K to purchase, so unlocking them is an exruciatingly slow process. Once you unlock a weapon, you get kills to earn towards unlocking individual attachments, each of which cost around 50K. Some people may think this is unbalanced, and it is slightly, but if you have even a little skill, you can go toe to toe with people who have purchased items, even if you have a base gun with no ATTs. Like I said, the game feels very balanced with more of a reliance on skills and a persons insticts/reactions. Sure some people buy guns but its A) Optional B) Available through unlocks C) The gun they brought is most likely the same stats as yours.  TO SUM UP: The guns are balanced enough. They're fun to play with. Even though most are based on real guns, they feel futuristic. However problems are: Slow grind to unlock. Over Priced. Get's repetitive to play with the same 3 weapons for 6 hours, But hey! F2P.\nI think a great comparison to this games guns are Call Of Duty weapons. They are all decent, some weapons are shunned and there are some slightly better weapons, but with skill, anyone can succeed.\n\n(Just as a personal note, firing the guns feels more like a POP than a BANG. You just don't get that explosive feel from firing a weapon, unlike in a game like CS:GO or Battlefield. But that's my personal feel)\n\nGAMEPLAYAgain the best thing to compare the game play to, is CoD. It's fast-paced and fun. It's fair enough to the point where you won't be raging constantly and there are several unique elements (such as the Operatives and the ThinkTank in Domination), When you launch the game, you're treated to a pretty stylish cutscene then you are dropped into a server selection screen. Currently, I play on EU West and it's DEAD. It takes 5 mins to find a half empty lobby, then another 5 mins for it to fill up. You can select the tutorial (which isn't so much about FPS controls, but about introducing you to the unique (ish) cahracters you'll be playing as and against. When you finish, you select an operative to unlock and jump into the game as, then you can start queing for a game. you can choose between Deathmatch, Domination or Search and Destroy game-modes (or a random gamemode). Deathmatch is fast-paced first to X amount of kills, Domination is first to X amount of site captures and S&D is first to X amount of Bomb plants/defuses/eliminations.\n\nOTHER FEATURESOperatives: The characters you play. Each has a 'Unique' ability (such as cloaking) which switches up your play style.\n-Fun. Makes the game interesting and can provide some gameplay changes.\n-None of the characters are unique. The only thing they change is what abilities you have.\n-Unlocked quickly initially, then slowly as the game progresses.\n-From exprience, there are only 3-4 that are actually played out of the 8 or so that exist. Of course some people play           other ones but it's less common.\n\nLoadouts: The section where you pick which guns you take into combat.\n-Fairly easy to operate.\n-Has a usefull test range, where you can train with weapons or test attachments.\n-Rather annoying that I have to go through like, 8 tabs just to acces my 1 hour 10% xp boost.\n-Unique (ish) perk system where you get temporary perks after each match which you can socket like gems into the character. (For example- 10% less fall damage for the next 5 games).\n-Went the Payday 2 route of giving you a choice of 3 reward after every match.\n\nGraphics: How the game looks.\n-Game looks amazing on high settings!\n-Not the best graphics ever, but very nice on High.\n-They nailed the futuristic feel with the polished metalic and neon textures.\n-Awesome little 'cutscenes' here and there.\n-The 'Dive' animation before every match is dope!\n\n\nSo Sorry for the short review, I had 5-6 more paragraphs to write, but the limit on written characters meant I had to condense the review to the things I considered most important.","April 7","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

We don't think is a good idea to get early access now but try playing it during free weekends or full release free. This review might change in the future.\n\nHowever, there are few matters to mention in the game. Sadly, anyone with macro (rapid single click per second) mouse have more accuracy and recoil recovery than normal full/burst firing players. This exploit is unfair, they need to change the script for the recoil system or better do something about it. In most F2P FPS games, widescreen users have lesser vertical fov so they have to becareful or everyone better off playing 4:3 resolution stretched and the graphics will be meaningless. Some thin woods wall or object are not penetrable, only a few kind of obstacles. They need to unlock monitor refresh rate rather than 60 Hz maximum, we are playing in 120 Hz in most games hardly seeing stutters and smooth video records. You cannot save your allies when they are a victim in stealth kill during their slow animation, both enemy and victim dies after the animation if you kill the enemy.\n\nOther than the issues in the game, is a good thing they apply enemy models depending on the map. Doesn't matter what 'Agents' the enemy are using, all enemy looks the same. Weapon customization variaties are good enough not too many or too little. Especially the part where you can put a single drum magazine to most weapons like our real-life guns.\n\nConclusion, early access is not a good idea for now. Let's wait until is playable stage.","May 18","false","11.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At the time of this review, its not pay to win. The game has a decent amount of attachments and a diverse community of players in terms of skill. In many of games you will have a mix of some good players with a mix of many novices, so the level of competition is balanced for most matches. The game gets better as you buy more attachments for your guns ( they will not be great at first )  which you get points for it through leveling up and in game performance. As an early access game, it shows alot of promise and has an atmosphere that is true to the original work, in terms of characters, weapons, and a clip of the anime they show before entering a lobby.\n\nCons- While this game is not pay to win at the time this review is written, it does have some gun balancing issues and other issues that can be fixed with time but should still  be addressed. The most overpowered guns in the game have to be the shotguns because not only do they have an extreme amount of range,  there  are  times when they are a one shot from a distance of 15 to 25 meters( In this game thats the range of an SMG/AR ). I personally refuse to use such weapons becuase it encourages more use of it but I do think those guns need to be nerfed at least, though if they were banned I wouldnt complain. There are also some instances of severe server issues that cause the matches to lag for the entirety of the round  and as a result diminishes the overall experience of the game. Although the server issues arent often its still an issue that ive seen a few times that  negatively impact the matches. This is an early access game so a few issues are bound to happen. But its important to point them out now so it can be fixed in the future.\n\nBut to conclude this review i'll finish it by saying that I think this game deserves a try, especially for its price of 5 dollars  (at the time of this review). If your a fan of the orginal work or a fan of fast-paced  fps  games I strongly recommend it.

I paid only $2.79 and would have gladly paid more.\nI really enjoy the game, of course being early access it is not without issues, but the devs are trying to listen to player feedback.\nIt's an interesting blend of some concepts we've seen before, and a new concept that really makes for an interesting game.\n\nThe gameplay:\nFeels like Call of Duty. It's a small to medium map twitch shooter. For me, however, I like the way they have made their maps/weapons/character abilities a bit more than any CoD I've played. In every call of duty, I find myself going for the same stuff: whatever loadout offers the best combination of firing speed, hip fire accuracy, and range. Every, god dang CoD I end up doing this. In GitS: First Assault I find myself jumping between assault rifle loadout, submachine gun, and sniper. I have literally never played a twitch shooter in which I found sniping either useful or fun - I basically only snipe in Battlefield, and vary game to game between assault rifles and submachine guns. Here, they all have their place.\n\nThe abilities:\nRemenescent of games like Crysis, but with it's own twist. Instead of having just cloaking or nano-gel (which, actually, GotS: FA does have those two), you also have the options of speedboost, a cloaking shield (a shield that can be put up and shot through which makes the user/friendlies invisible), an arm launcher (essentially a rocket/noob tube), a sentry, or a heat-seeking bomb thing. You can not spam the abilities. They take time and/or points to build up the energy to use. Where GitS: FA really differs is the ability's "Tier 2" capabilities. Tier 1 (the standard use of the ability) will gradually refill over time, even without scoring points. Once Tier 1 is ready for use, you can wait to get the energy for Tier 2. Tier 2, however, can only be achieved through scoring points (kills/assists/objective). For abilities that do not directly effect your character (shield, sentry, bomb, arm launcher) Tier 2 is much more powerful, or has a greater health, range, or damage. For the abilities in which effect your character (cloak, nano-gel armor, speedboost), the ability lasts longer, has a greater impact (more health regen, harder to see, etc...) and can be utilized by nearby team mates.\nYeah, you read that right. Tier 2 abilities can be shared. You "sync" with a team mate using a Tier 2 ability by being near them and hitting "e". You get their ability. It's really cool, and makes deciding when to pop the ability and/or when to save up the energy or pop Tier 1 actually matter.\n\nThe unlock system is remeniscent of Warframe, but much less pay2play. I've not yet encouncerred a situation in which I was dying for money or struggling for an unlock. As of the time of writing this, there appears to be no actual benefit of spending real money as opposed to using the earned in-game currency.\n\nCan't always find a game as the player base is not extremely large yet, please grab the game, sync up, and dive in!\n-Operative Praetors, out.","May 6","true","32.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

So far it's quite good but has plenty of room for improvement.\n\nPRO\n- It's a pretty solid game\n- Plenty of characters with each one having a unique skill which changes how you play\n- All characters are free (Out of a set of a few you can only choose one to begin with. Once you reach level 3, then 5, you get 'licences' which allow you to unlock another of your choosing. After that you can buy licences with in-game currency.\n- You can use other players skills in the middle of battle by using 'SkillSynth'\n- No overpowered weapons or items\n- The levels are good sizes. Not too big to get lost or not find anyone but not too small for it to be a constant slaughter.\n- Upgrades and drops are interesting to use and equip\n- Weapons are customisable (Not too many atm but expect more)\n- The game modes are pretty classic but nevertheless fun to play\n- Original voice actors are used for the voices\n- PVE has been announced to be a feature some point in the future\n\nNEUTRAL\n- Hacking the Tachikoma's are quite challenging\n- Spawns are a little messy and can be infront of or behind a single enemy sometimes\n\nCON\n- Hitboxes seem a little wrong atm but hopefully should get sorted out\n- There is no autobalancing\n\nSo far the game is well made and have promising things coming ahead. For only £4 access with a starter pack it's worth checking out.","December 14, 2015","true","6.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I was a bit worried before i bought it that it was just another p2w nexon/net marble generic fps in the style of A.V.A and Genesis A.D but after a few maps and getting the hang of it the game play is pretty nice. The gun mechanics seem pretty spot on like a good mix between BlackLight and Counter-strike, the abilites are balanced and being able to share most of them with your team makes it interesting. Map pool is small for now and map size over all is a little smaller than i'd like but i guess it keeps the fast pace up. Spawn points in DM are a little tricky at times when 3 players spawn with shields in the same room as you. Leveling up and earning game currency is quick, Each level earns you 50k so buying weapon mods is a breeze. The community is also cool, 11 hours today and not one toxic player or hacker.

I never watched any of the movies until now (I know, everybody please hate me now) but I PROMISE, I will do so after I played this game. I will solely focus on the game and the game alone.\n\nSummarized Thoughts (tl;dr Section)The game feels somewhat bland. The mapdesign is crude and simple, it feels like the game forces you to face the enemy head-on. I wished for a bit more tactical advancement with flanking maneuvers. Unfortunately, the maps won’t let me do this.\n\nPlayer movement is bearable but feels just wrong. Even after playing a long time, it still feels weird.\n\nOperatives are nicely designed and feature different abilities, yet in the end, it is just easier to point a weapon at the enemy and just kill him. Unfortunatly, some of the Skills feel more powerful than others.\n\nMost of the players said, that the game feels like a generic FPS with GITS as a theme. I approve that, it is completely right. However, I bought this game out of simple interest (since I love FPS and Sci-Fi) and grew to enjoy it to a certain degree. It is a shooter of very old times, just you, a weapon and the enemy featuring new special shareable abilities and no autoheal, a welcome change for me next to overloaded shooters like Crysis 3 and the neverending tales of Call of Doody and Rattlefield.\n\nEven in light of all these downsides, I do enjoy the game. Eventually I might grow tired of it, just to pick it up at a later date again. But if you are here for some FPS-action and don’t really care about all the ruckus of why and how this is not GITS, then I cautiously advise you to take a look. Enjoy it, while it lasts.\n\nDesign & ArtGraphics don’t shine that much. Compare these to Warframe and you’ll see what I mean. Textures seem washed out, even on maxed settings. Overall, the graphics seem to be behind the standards, yet passable enough. Characters and weapons seem more well designed than the environment.\n\nOnly three maps are available for Team Deathmatch (I will talk about gamemodes in section “Gameplay”). The design of the maps really fell short in my opinion. Very few to absolute NONE possibilities to flank or outmaneuver the enemy are possible. Fighting hotzones mostly stay the same hotzones, even over different sessions. This enforces simple “Fight-or-Flight” situations, no way to outsmart other players, you either have the better aiming skills or you die.\n\nControlsThe controls are pretty straightforward; if you played any shooter in the last century, you’ll have no problems whatsoever. You play from First-Person-perspective. A nifty tutorial at the beginning of the game teaches you all the basics you need to know.\nUnfortunately, at the current time, there is no controller support for those, who wish to play that way.\n\nSound & MusicSounddesign is okay in my opinion. Weapons sound powerful and the sounds adapt to environment. All of the sound effects feel fitting. Unfortunately sometimes, light cracking or other bugs are noticeable: Sometimes, gunfire makes my headset crack very loudly and the sprinting sound effect seems to be buggy, since it sometimes breaks up completely whilst sprinting. The music feels techy and enjoyable for my tastes.\n\nGameplay The game currently features three gamemodes: Team Deathmatch, Demolition (which I couldn’t play until now because no one wants to play it) and Terminal Conquest (Capture the objective and hold it). I will focus on TDM from now on, since I played this mode the most.\n\nAfter the tutorial you get to choose one from currently seven operatives with special abilities. Some are shareable throughout the team (meaning you can give them to a small group of three teammates if you wish to decide so). This is pretty nifty but to gain maximum effect of your skills you need to stay close to teammates and help each other to dominate the enemy.\n\nThe gameplay is only as enjoyable as the design of the maps can make me enjoy it. It is either “Going-in” or “Going-home”. No flanking possible, no outsmarting, only you, your skill and your ability (which might not even available at that time, because it has cooldown timers).\n\nNo Autoheal! Awesome! If you barely survived the last confrontation, a light bloody screen will shroud your vision, but that will fade. You will then be left with the shred of health you desperately try to still get some kills out of to increase that tasty Kill-Death-Ratio.\n\nWeapons or equipment are not tied to a certain level but do cost ingame currency. How refreshing!\nThe amount you gain from one match is really small, compared to how much a new gun actually costs (500-1.000 GP vs. 249.000 GP). Fortunately, levelups grant you 50.000 GP.\n\nYou have three different loadouts which can be changed on-the-fly before or whilst in the game! No need to hit “esc” or anything like that! Just hit F1, F2 or F3 for your respective loadout and the game will spawn you with your chosen loadout on your next spawn if you’re still alive and kicking. Very nice!\n\nWeakpointsThe design of the Menu is terrible. It really does look nice and I like the techy style to it, yet it feels really overcrowded and confusing. Simply changing a sight on a rifle needs too much unnecessary clicking and confirmation, in my opinion.\n\nAlso, until you play a game, you have to wait. ‘What’s wrong with that?’ you ask. No, no, you got me wrong, I mean you need to wait UNECESSARILY OFTEN. Once you join a session, which is currently not in play, a timer counts down until when the game starts. If that timer reaches zero, YOU HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER FIVE SECOND COUNTDOWN. Why? After that, you will spawned , BUT YOU HAVE TO WAIT AGAIN. Annoying. I just want to play. It is called “quickmatch” for a reason!\n\nMovement of your operative seems really crippled. The sprinting doesn’t really feel like sprinting, it only feels like sprinting, when one operative activates his ability for other players to let them sprint faster. ‘Why isn’t this standard movement speed then?’ you ask. Simple, that would render said operative useless. But with sprinting that slow, he has somewhat of a purpose.\n\nSpeaking of movement, the player movement overall seems really clunky. That’s not just my opinion, many players complained about it whilst ingame and I do agree. I mostly feel like a wandering block. My jumping height is really limited, yet I can grab ledges which are nearly twice as high as me through contextual movement. A normal jump in comparison doesn’t even let me jump HALF that height. That doesn’t even make any sense.","March 27","true","43.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

However this is an exeption, this game is a fun shooter for casual and competitive players. At the moment there is only 5 maps however it is in early access so that is to be expected. This game does have somewhat of a high skill ceiling due to the fact that you do need to learn recoild like in CS:S, CS:GO. Aswell as learning about accuracy and stability and how they effect the guns in the game.\n\nI will warn you that the sniping feels like more of a agressive play-style. But if you do enjoy that type of sniping there is 2 different types of sniper rifles semi auto and bolt-action. The amount of mods that yo ucan add to a weapon is great it allows you to customize to you're preferance. As for the "Classes" there are (as of now) 7 with their own unique traits.\n\nSCORE: 8.5/10\nReason for this is there are some bugs and exploits and hit boxes can be weird at times. But note that this is in early access so that is to be expected. Also the DLC's are only if you want to support the company. My best bet is do what I did, play more and more and the more you like it buy the next DLC upgrade. Note you dont NEED the dlc's they just help.\n\n\n\n~~~~~~TO CLAIME GOTO Inbox>Claim>Armory>Items tab>Use~~~~~~\n\nThank you for reading the review\nIf you want to add me in-game add Akahando","December 27, 2015","true","91.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

There aren't many maps yet and quite a few of the key elements are missing, but that's what you get with a beta. For the first ten hours or so it plays like a standard shooter with a few novel features, and then it grows on you; First Assault Online does show the potential to develop into something extraordinary.\n\nThe skill-sync teamwork feature can turn a fairly standard capture-the-flag mode into a tactical avalanche. The demolition mode is highly dependant on individual skill and a critical choice of operative to match your playstyle. It is very good to see that the performance for reward system is fair without being punishing.\n\nElements of the game that require more work are :\n1. The system of money for guns is disappointing to say the least. Players can unlock a good array of standard weapons just by playing, though all of the premium (ie fun) gear costs more than the game lets you earn in a reasonable time - it is not hard to see this turning into a real-money funding model.\n2. Some kind of story mode is almost mandatory for a game set in a well-loved anime franchise, yet there is no hint of one. Without a story mode all we have is a fan-based shooter.\n3. The augmentation feature lets you alter some of your operatives base stats, such as cyber-brain skills or physical endurance, without being seriously advantageous to the experienced player who has unlocked it all. This is all well and good, however there are not nearly enough drops, which is disappointing and again looks like turning into a real-money funding model.\nFor the time being i am having a lot of fun with GiTS:SAC-First Assault Online, and for that reason alone i have to recommend it.\n4.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theloliassassin/recommended/369200/","theloliassassin","The Loli Assassin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theloliassassin/","610 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(This review has been copied from a forum post I made earlier today on an anime-based forum that I frequent, I left it unedited becuase it flows better but some information may be extraneous here on the Steam Store page.)\n\nGhost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex First Assault Online (*gasps for breath*) is an online first person shooter set in the world of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. The game is planned to be free-to-play sometime in the future but at the moment players can buy into the current early access test for as little as $5 and as much as $30 with 4 total tiers available to buy. None of the available tiers provide any gameplay advantages beyond some non-premium, in-game currency and some extra character slots (which can be earned with in-game currency), the rest of the items are strictly cosmetic, consisting of assorted weapon skins and a character skin. The game does not currently have a premium currency, but it may once the game goes free-to-play, I am not sure of the dev's plans.\n\nWhen you first boot up the game you are taken immediately into the game's tutorial which can be skipped or replayed at any time, after this you select an operative, each of which has a unique skill with skills ranging from cloaking devices to arm-based rocket launchers. Players may only select one operative to start but as stated above, more can be purchased with in-game currency.\n\nThe actual gunplay of the title feels very solid, though I've only played a couple of matches so I have yet to see how the weapons perform over time. There is a currently broken weapon, the SA50 Sniper Rifle which is almost always a 1-shot kill and can be equipped with a short range scope allowing it to be used at most ranges quite effectively. Beyond this one weapon though, the other weapons feel very well balanced and are fun to use and shoot. Design wise the weapons seem to be inspired by modern firearms but with a visual overhaul to make them look and feel more futuristic, personally I like this design. Weapons can apparently be earned or bought, and I haven't seen any of the buyable weapons being particularly overpowered or underpowered, just situational in a couple of cases. Weapons may also be customized with some attachments being earned and others bought in a similar fashion to how guns work. Attachments can modify many aspects of a weapon and can increase or decrease stats in addition to being purely visual.\n\nAesthetically the game is hard for me to personally judge, I have never seen any of Ghost in the Shell (though I plan to remedy this) but apparently the devs have used the English VAs from Ghost in the Shell to reprise their roles, there are also little snippets of footage from the films/show when selecting match types which I thought was a neat little choice. I have enjoyed the game's visuals and I like the designs I've seen so far.\n\nIn summary, I'm cautiously optimistic about the game, as long as the weapon lists stay open to regular players without being locked behind pay-walls or premium currency I'll be happy, and once some balancing bugs are worked out I think the gameplay will be very solid. My biggest complaint so far is that the games seems like it is going to be an ungodly grind for purchased weapons and attachments, in my first couple matches I earned roughly 900 credits per match for a passable performance, cheap attachments go for 40,000 to 50,000 credits or more, guns are as little as 187,000 credits but mostly are in the 250,000 credit range. Rounding up to 1000 credits per match, it will take 40-50 matches to purchase a single attachment and hundreds of matches played to buy a single gun. The game will no-doubt have premium accounts that earn more money, but this is a tad crazy to me. But beyond this I have no major complaints and I may very well start earning more credits per game as I get better and level up, we shall see.","January 3","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Started playing the game during the closed beta and received the game for free, but as the community grew and got to know them more I found myself playing the game for 10+ hours straight at days and buying the game here on steam as well. It's not a P2W game and a new player can fight on equal grounds with a player that has been playing for months. Only difference would be the selection of mods/weapons to use, but I myself often use the weapons you start out with.\n\nAs any Early Access Game you will encounter some issues with the gameplay, but the development team are open for suggestions and listen to the community, for example: the community requested the Mateba (Togusa's handgun from the series) and now we have a Mateba. Incase you are doubting if you should purchase early access. There is an official twitch channel where you can watch one of the GM and/or the CM play the game so you can preview the gameplay itself and get a couple of laughs, or visit the official Discord server to where the community can talk or discuss the game development with the developpers.","May 6","true","313.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Meaning if this game is more giving than demanding it could work out as a decent F2P game.\n\nHowever:\n\nOverwatch is just around the corner and people will quickly forget that First Assault was even on their wishlist. Why? Having played both of them I for one would rather play Overwatch than First Assault. The Gameplay is that much for responsive, fluid and most importantly more diverse.\n\nYes, I know "both games are completely different, hurr durr". Then let's compare it to Blacklight Retribution.\n\nBlacklight Retribution > First Assault, especially in gameplay and fluidivitityitity...?\n\nThis game should really release after the people calmed down from their Overwatch high, have a reasonable F2P policy with a leash on a greedy publisher and keep those interested still on the train with whatever means necessary.\n\nAs of now, the game is still an EA game with low population, tons of bugs and various other issues.\n\nIf you are a diehard fan of the franchise itself and familiar with blacklight retribution. Go for it.\n\nEveryone else should wait or buy Overwatch for that matter. Better yet play a round or two of Blacklight Retribution just to get a feeling for First Assault.","May 11","false","1.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","13"

I just want to get in and start killing people! Stop putting things in my way of doing-that!\n\nThe interface seems WAY too busy with options.  Just let me pick a server, pick a class and start killing.  I'll figure-out the rest later.  Doesn't anybody remember how SIMPLE Counter-Strike (1.x, the original) was? Again,  I just want to get in and start killing people! Stop putting things in my way of doing-that!\n\nNo stand-alone Linux-native-binary dedicated servers (to build your own community, etc.).\n\nSince it's not Source-based, probably will be little or no 3rd-party server-side customizations/mods available for it.  Again, not community-friendly.\n\nPerhaps I am just accustomed to Source-based games (TF2, CS:S, etc.), but I found the movement a little wierd. Maybe that is something I would get accustomed to? Nah, probably just move on if it took more than a few minutes to adapt.\n\nAlso, just trying to QUIT this game was frustrating!  Hit ESC goto go though that over-blown interface and then somehow randomly found the option to quit the game.  It just be "Hit ESC or some other player-selected key WHEREVER you are in the game, get asked ONCE to confirm you really want to quit, then DONE!"\n\nThe BEST thing about this game?\nScarlett Johansson is not depicted as the Major in it.\n#HollywoodSoWhite\n\nSummary:\nHope the game develops further (dedicated server, etc.) will be keeping an eye on it.

It's a bad mix of Blackshot, Sudden Attack and Soldier Front 2, moving around feels slow.\n\nGun shots and sounds are mediocre, or as good as a game released in 2007. Maps level design is a common "left, mid and right" area where shooting at players isn't exciting because of the architecture and low details on textures.\n\nAnother bad surprise was the rewards screen that you can't skip after a game that lasts for about 10 seconds. I know rewards are a good psychological trick that keep players coming back, but the carrot and stick effect doesn't work if the game isn't enjoyable. This includes daily logins and perks after games.\n\nI appreciate that the game has to be purchased instead of being f2p but I doubt that will fix all of its flaws.

Solution: give ALL players stealth-capabilities, but only for 10 seconds, cooldown 30 seconds, and Motoko faster hacking-abilities (she is the A1-hacker of the team, ain't she????)\n- Saitos scaning ability sometimes shows no enemy at all, thought you can see the muzzle-flash/tracers of an enemy firing at a corner; and even if it does show enemies, it only shows them for 2 seconds, after that at seemingly random intervals only with a red triangle above em (if at all)\n- no reviving possible (at least not as far as I could see)\n\n- only Multiplayer - why no Singleplayer with a little story, where you could play a story for each Agent with emphasis on the special ability of the Agent? Right now it is just a Multiplayer-BF4-CS-whatever-knockoff. And also no Co-Op, that would have been fun: Solving a mystery together! But in this state: BOOOOOORING!\n\nUntil these balancing/gameplay/cheat-problems are not fixed I can't recommend this game at all... too frustrating\n\nUpdate:\nAfter last Server-"Update":\n- The Netcode got even worse: most of the time you hit ppl were they are NOT; and ppl seem to "warp" around the map, run through walls and fall into the floor\n- Graphics and Hitboxes do NOT match - Battlefield-Problem all over again\n- The information on the weapons do not represent reality: an AR is better for sniping than a sniper-rifle\n- the weapon-add-ons seem to have no effect at all, with the exeption of the silencers\n- SMGs have too high a damage and too many headshots at LONG distances even with full-auto fire\n+ At least you can throw grenades now","January 16","false","216.1"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","17","33","3","1"

Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex however is one of those FPS MMO's that is actually worth a play. If you've ever played Ghost Recon Online than you'll probably like this.\n\nWeapons that actually play quite well and recoil that is actually a thing. Different characters, each with a unique skill that you can use and share with your team. With the auto rifle for example, you can't aim down the sights and spray and expect a kill, you actually have to control your fire.\n\nThe maps are small enough that you will run into enemies but big enough to feel not too crowded. All in all, it's quite a nice game and fairly well done. It's worth a play and this is Early Access, so there's room for improvement and extra content. And for as little as $5 for Early Access that's quite a bargain, a number of MMO's usually ask for around $15+ for Early Access packs.\n\nGameplay wise its fairly straight forward and easy to understand, of course you can feel free to change keybindings if you like. I know I did with Walk, but other than that one key they're pretty nice and simple.\n\nThis definetly has potential and with some updates and tweaks it can be quite funner (yes funner) to play.\n\nMy overall score? 8/10","December 15, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I personally haven't played much Call of Duty or Destiny (because I don't like either of them, not one bit) but as far as gameplay goes, it's pretty similar to that style so if you enjoy either of the aforementioned titles then I don't think you will be disapointed what-so-ever. If, however, you are like me and you prefer more of a Wolfenstein the New Order kind of experience when playing a modern shooter then this is probably going to be hit or miss for you. (most of this having to do with how much of a GitS fan you are) So if you like GitS and are looking for a shooter with a cyber punk atmosphere and some minor tactical abilities that show off your futuristic gear then this is most definitely for you. If you absolutely loathe both CoD and Destiny with a red hot firey passion as do I and you don't really care for novelty of the GitS "look" then just wait until the game is actually "free" to play and then give it a try. I can not stress enough though that even if you don't like CoD one bit that this is still a very good game and I would highly recommend it to any fan of FPSes.\n\nAll that said I can only give this game a 9.5/10 though because I did not get to drive a Tachikoma :'(","December 14, 2015","true","45.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Five dollars and ten minutes later I was playing my first match and as is the case with every online competative game I have ever played, I did reasonably well that one time. For every match thereafter I found that I had no say in how well I did, despite my best efforts, and that everyone I encountered with intention to cause my character bodily harm seems to play with a noticably higher degree of finesse than I do. Subsequently, where I am firing in controlled bursts with my basic M4 at the center of mass, I never seem to do enough damage fast enough to prevent my own demise, which always seems to happen the moment someone lines up my character with their crosshairs. My skill at the game (or lack thereof) nonwithstanding, the game itself runs very smoothly. It is difficult to say whether teams and weapons are balanced evenly, as I normally end up on the losing team. However, if played for its intended purpose, that is, for fun, the game is enjoyable. The only improvement I would recommend is controller support.","December 14, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
