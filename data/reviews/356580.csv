The control scheme is unintuitive on the keyboard, which is what I played the game using. Glitches are rare, and when they occur they're rarely gamebreaking. Hitboxes for certain actions, like grabbing enemies and ledges, are odd and often difficult to predict.\n\nThe story takes place in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv where men have been eliminated, a revolution somehow forcing all men to undergo hormone replacement therapy, and relegating them to second class citizenship. "Snowflakes" as they're called are reviled by society, treated as little more than potentially violent pretenders only good for reproduction. You play Ceyda Farhi, a Bulgarian Turk who works as an assassin. She was also a transwoman before the revolution occurred, and due to her status as a transwoman only finds illegal work available to her. The story features intense discussions of feminism, particularly factions within feminism, and the place transwomen have in feminism. The game features two endings, one of which feels out of left field and the other more in line with the story we've been told.\n\nA big issue with Aerannis is that it's short, I completed the game in seven and a half hours, and I'm sure a quicker run is possible.\n\nI highly recommend Aerannis based off its story, gameplay, and the setting behind. I feel like Aerannis is a testament to what indie developers can accomplish without the pressure of executive meddling forcing them to make the next AAA title.\n\nA warning: Aerannis features transphobic language and ideas at times, and anyone sensitive to these topics may want to keep this in mind while playing the game.","September 16, 2015","true","7.4"," 78 of 94 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","78","94","2","0"

Happy to say the wait was worth it!\n\nThe city of Plovdiv and its surrounding territories are a pleasure to explore, offering a range of distinctly themed locales and characters/enemies which have all been touched in some way by Aerannis's larger conspiracy. Every one of them is unique and deep and full of little design touches, like the suspicious crowds in the background in downtown Plovdiv to the corkscrew architecture in one of the surrounding suburbs to some of the hulking (and gooey) stage bosses.\n\nGameplay is satisfying and best played when really observing the stealth elements, as they always pay off. With the exception of the occasional tangle while propping Ceyda up on small ledges, the controls are responsive (I've been using a gamepad for my playthrough, which I would probably recommend).\n\nAerannis is obviously a labor of love, and it really does show.\n\n(And the soundtrack is fantastic as well (dev should really look into putting it up for sale alongside the game somewhere!))","September 16, 2015","true","4.8"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","24","30","4","1"

It's magic, I tell you! Aerannis is a strange amalgam of extremely familiar elements. It reminds me of nothing so much as Hotline Miami (the frequent checkpoints in levels cause that comparison), and yet there are a lot of metroidvania elements as well.\nThe controls feel floaty, which can be frustrating. I had a few deaths to them - not too many, but a few. The frequent checkpoints help to mostly mitigate this.\nThe plot is very science-fictiony and ... underexplained [the other thing that harks back to Hotline: Miami for me]. I felt like there could have been a lot more to the story and world, and a lot more to the main character, who is very ... well, she's what you'd expect from a shooter protagonist outside of her gender. In this story, you're basically just doing the "talk to contact, go through world to do mission, come back to contact, do other mission" loop, and it's very ... apparent that this is happening. Even with the fun touches [e.g.: the first mission is "Figure out why people buy day 1 DLC"], it all seems oddly rote for a story set in a world where there are no men in apocalyptic surroundings. You're forced through a linear path, and that path feels ... incomplete, or at least it did to me.\nThere are multiple endings, but you can see both of them almost immediately at the end, which I thought was a nice touch. The endings themselves ... are a bit of a lucid dream, as the rest of the plot is. To be honest, I don't think the art style does the game any favors in this area (and goodness, the elevator sprites are almost seizure-inducing), but there could have been more done, just in general, to flesh out the world.\n\nIn the end, I would rate this a maybe, but there's just a yes or no option. Upon finishing the game (it took ~6, 7 hours?) ... I didn't love it. It feels serviceable. If you love the subject matter, you won't regret buying it (I don't regret buying it). But I ended the game wanting more from the game than what I got - a character that isn't content to just follow what their handler says forever, a story that's more fleshed-out ... I wasn't really able to connect with the main character in the story. The small throwaway bits are consistent and then the larger bits didn't ... feel that way, to the setting and the story, to me. I felt along for the ride, like my actions weren't doing anything in the story - like I was watching an oddly-paced 8-bit movie about the Illum(inati) and Gods, Devil May Cry-style. And the action isn't good enough to compensate.","September 20, 2015","false","5.3"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","3"

That's basically all you need to know, but you can read on if you want to.\n\nControl-wise, it's what people call a "MetroidVania" game, because apparently only Metroid and Castlevania are allowed to have exploration-heavy side scrolling and shooting.\n\nYou alternately sneak, kill, and SneakyKill(tm) your way to the goal while carrying out missions in an oppressive feminist future society. Yes, you read that right.  We need more games like this that actually take risks with the setting instead of having every scifi game basically stealing the universe from Blade Runner.\n\nThe social commentary and humor are where the game really shines.  The dialogue is witty, references to other projects and jabs at extremist feminism and the gaming industry are plentiful, and the memes are spicy.\n\nIf the game has one shortcoming, it is the palpable lack of wacky waving arm-flailing inflatable tube men.  The devs really should have foreseen this problem and I hope it will be fixed in an upcoming patch or reasonably priced DLC.  Horse armor would also be a good, but less necessary addition.","September 15, 2015","true","7.1"," 45 of 73 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","45","73","10","5"

As I spend more and more time with it, little details stick out, like details in the background and NPCs, and different paths to take in the environment where you can either deal with enemies head-on or sneak around them. The story is really good, and though the dialog is eye-roll worthy at times, the balance between the humor the various characters possess and the seriousness of the story (which is handled pretty well, all things considered) helps keep the player engaged. The difficulty is just hard enough to not make the game a breeze while also not being overly punishing for players, especially with the controls.\n\nAnd speaking of them, this game isn't flawless. The controls are definitely weird, and can take some getting used to, especially if you play with a keyboard. There's definitely been a number of times where I've failed a section multiple times because I keep pressing the wrong button since I go for the key that feels more intuitive. Customizable controls would be a huge boon.* And sometimes the music choice and screen you're playing in don't match up well and feel weird to play.\n\nI bought this for $8.50, though I'd gladly pay $15 for it. Even with its faults, the game has me hooked, and I definitely can't wait to see what the developer has in store for the future.\n\n* EDIT: An update was added to allow customizable controls. This helps a lot, though the initial configuration of controls is still enough of an issue to note.","September 16, 2015","true","6.0"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

While it is mostly pretty to look at, this feels like it could have used a few more months in the oven. The music feels suitably cyberpunk and, if you look at what are supposed to be the core mechanics, the game employs an interesting setting (though this is not developed on nearly enough)\n\nIf you have a really soft spot for 2D stealth and have alredy played all the usual suspects, or are a huge fan of cyberpunk, you should check this game out. Otherwise, give it a pass.\n\nAnd that ending that requires you to go right was REALLY stupid and completely out of nowhere.","February 8","false","5.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/y2f/recommended/356580/","y2f","YinYin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/y2f/","38 products in account","In Aerannis you play the assassin Ceyda Farhi, who takes on missions from Elsa Wetzer. With tasks ranging from basic assassinations, destroying documents, comfirming/retrieving information as well as tracking down someone kidnapped or freeing a prisoner.\n\nYou start out with most of your arsenal and stealth skills, including a chargable gun that can be fired as you jump or move around at three different heights (walking/crouching/sliding) and a pop bomb used to lure patrols away. You can simply shoot most of the critters, but humanoid enemies are often too tough to shoot your way through and stealth missions will actually require you to not get spotted by them or cameras. To take out humanoids quickly you will have to avoid or abuse making sounds to alert them and crawl through vents here and there. If they are not aware of your presence yet you can grab them from behind for an instant kill or push them around as a hostage to open doors and grant you cover.\nAs the game progresses your skill set will expand, adding wall jumps, ledge hanging, a sprint and a few different bomb types. The whole arsenal is a lot of fun to use. Only the bomb switching mechanic sticks out a little sore, as it has you popping out a wheel of the bombs around you with a button press, select the active bomb type by moving left or right and closing the wheel again with the same button.\n\nBesides health refills enemies will also drop nano machines, which amount to your currency (nm). The only thing you can do with it though is purchase a single defense boost at a certain location in game and otherwise purchase health refills (half or full) directly from the pause menu. Considering the whole game can be played through entirely without buying such a refill it is probably a nice option for anyone having trouble getting past some areas. It does however feel weird if you abuse it to get through the hard mode (there are three difficulty settings which alter the damage from/to enemies and their vision range).\n\nThe world mostly consists of several very different city districts and a park, which in turn contain the level entrances (mostly buildings). You cannot enter any of these buildings (or new areas) prior to being directed to them through a mission and the city structure becomes irrelevant about 1/3rd into the game as several save points gain the option of fast travel between them. This however is a welcome feature as the game contains no back tracking and there would be no point in running through the same areas again and again. The game is very linear as all missions seem to happen in a very strict sequence and only the final mission branches out into two different endings.\n\nBesides great platforming, shooting and stealth action the levels throw a huge diversity of music and boss battles at you. Contrary to common convention boss battles don't simply happen at the end of each level, but instead sometimes at the very beginning, upon a mission to revisit a level later on (save point teleport sparing you a rerun though) or even several times in a row. All of which is very refreshing for this kind of game. Not to mention boss battle types range from the traditional damage dealing over survival/escape to stealth.\n\nThe story and setting heavily revolves around LGBTQA issues without rubbing it in your face. So even if you have no idea what that means or generally try to steer clear of that topic the writing is so well done that you should be able to enjoy it in any case.\n\nThere are some technical issues with the game, most annoyingly text boxes prompting you to hit a key to advance advancing on their own after some time while some other text boxes with a count down cannot be skipped before it reaches 0. Since the game clearly is a work of passion though I expect future updates to iron out such details.","October 2, 2015","true","24.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/356580/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","Aerannis in set in the mysterious future of 2XXX in a world where there are no longer any men and mysterious beings secretly run society. Ceyda is a tough hired gun who prefers to shoot first rather than second guess her orders. The issue of men, and the lack thereof, is questioned by various NPCs and issues of reproduction, femininity, women’s place in society and more are all touched on throughout the game.\n\nThe mystery of sinister government plots and the supernatural beings that act as gods is also played up throughout. The scene following most missions shows a prominent political figure addressing a faceless crowd to spin the missions’ happenings, often questionable acts that suggest something larger than Ceyda is willing to pursue is at foot, into digestible bits of just events. The aforementioned creatures haunt Ceyda in dreams and in reality, with their main characteristic being a large single eye and their often fluctuating forms. The omnipresent gaze and ability to appear anywhere and through any form most easily places them as manifestations of the gaze. It’s a fascinating setting, but at times the weightiness of its content gets heavy handed; there is a certain mission where Ceyda is tasked with controlling the leak of dangerous chemical called “testosterone,” which threatens to turn the populace into violent maniacs. Not every bit of text in the game is meant to be lofty though, and there are some clever jabs and nice bits of humor.\n\nThe colors, level, and enemy design seem to call back to the older Megaman X games. Even the mission start and end notifications feel like Megaman X style font and transitions. The gelatinous eye monsters in this game also recall a bit of the older Megaman’s Yellow Devil, though the monsters here are much more articulate and insidious. Despite the artistic inspiration, Aerannis very much manages to be striking on its own and the soundtrack does an excellent job of keeping the mood in place. This puts the games form near on par with the content present, but the mechanics of the game could have used some more polishing.\n\nThe controls feel unresponsive and awkward on both controller or keyboard and this affects all of the games mechanics. Platforming is a large part of Aerannis, and it delivers a less than stellar performance. Wall jumping slings you out just far enough to not be able to alternate most parallel walls, while at the same time demanding the player to return quickly to the same wall in order to climb vertically: it looks a bit like your character is a confused rabbit trying to stay in the same place but somehow managing to offset itself ever so slightly. The characters regular walk speed is set just above leisurely, and the sprint mechanic arrives late and with a very short use time. Ledge grabbing in the game is untraditional in that the ledge of most platforms isn’t counted as either end, but the center. This is of course more a visual annoyance than an actual flaw once you get the hang of it.\n\nGiven the wealth of great 2D games that have used stealth elements recently, Aerannis really seems to have taken a step back. Movement feels slow and controls feel unintuitive: with a button press you can hold up someone to instantly kill, open a door, or use them as shield. Generally the doors enemies can open do not offer much of a shortcut, and they don’t make great shields so you will generally be instantly killing them. The problem is that there were a number of times where Ceyda seems to have a change of heart and let the hostage go, and thus endure a few shots and an alert. The level design overall makes stealth seem disjointed and almost unwelcome. So where other stealth games make a sort of puzzle wherein you use gadgets and skill to figure out the many paths to complete an objective silently, Aerannis is rather stingy with the gadgets (a noisemaker, a boomerang, and a mine), and the linear platform heavy areas make it easier to just ignore large areas, while at the same time not giving you a stealth satisfaction. Similar games with stealth elements often rely on you being able to actually see your enemy: The Metal Gear series started top down to allow you to see enemies, modern incarnations are third person with first person options or gadgets, Mark of the Ninja and Hotline Miami both were zoomed out accordingly and allowed the player to see just a bit further than an enemies field of view for most areas. Aerannis instead has a colored globe that will shrink to red when an enemy is approaching, but beyond that, you are left to guess if taking a step through the door or exiting a hallway is going to earn you a blast in the face or a few quick kill.\n\nThe combat, much like the stealth, feels limited. Ceyda’s gun mimics Megaman’s buster gun in that it offers small quick pellets or a larger blast when charged. There was one upgrade that slightly increased rate of fire, but other than that you are stuck with a weapon that encourages you to not engage the enemy directly. The boss fights in Aerannis do attempt to change around the games mechanics: a reflex heavy running sequence, a climbing segment that takes precision mine placement, and then some regular scenarios where you follow a boss’s pattern.\n\nThe general rule of thumb for games that want to avoid being linear is that logistics should be quick and easy or traveling should be interesting and it ought to be made clear where important things are. While the first hub area has a few points of interest, a few being less than a handful, every area after that feels like a chore to traverse with no payoff:  no objects to examine, no upgrades, minimal aesthetic variance, and general barren concrete emptiness. On top of this, navigation leaves much to be desired once you leave the first hub area, because some bits of text might tell you a general area or directions, but there are a lot of vertical avenues and buildings of interest to come in clumps. These hub areas only serve to extend the game, which throws off the pacing, as well as highlight the clunky platforming and frame issues, which is overall not fun\n\nThough the mechanics are not the absolute highlight of the game, they are functional for the most part. Aside from the stutters and clunky controls, Aerannis plays fine and is not broken.\nAerannis is less Mark of the Ninja, and more Mega(wo)man with a focus on narrative and light stealth elements. Some have identified Aerannis as a metroidvania, but given the lack of techniques or gadgets that would allow one to explore new paths in old areas, relatively small world area, and minimal recursive structure, little encouragement to explore, and far from easy travel or navigation, I would not shelve this next to Symphony of the Night. Aerannis stumbles a bit in its approach, but the game is certainly interesting enough to overlook its minor flaws.","December 16, 2015","true","6.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

I spent as much money on this game as I did on an AAA console title. My current steam avatar is the main character, and every social media site I go on, I have "I love Aerannis" in my bio. I am in love with this game, and the rest of this review will explain why.\n\nI'll be honest, I was first interested in Aerannis because I heard it had a trans character. Call me an sjw all you want, but I only care about trans representation because I want to see myself more often in games. And holy hell, Aerannis delivered.\n\nCeyda Farhi is to trans representation what Samus Aran was to female representation before 2010. She's a capable badass who I would honestly love to be if not for the whole assassin thing. More than that, she's tired and angry from a world that either hates her or ignores her, and is on the verge of losing her mind confronting something larger than she can imagine. And yet she persists, she keeps going, just because she wants to see what's next.\n\nI love Aerannis because it finally gave me a character I can relate to on a personal level, and didn't just give me a trans character, it captured the feeling that comes with it, from the discrimination to the dysphoria. It let me see myself in a game, on a fundamental level. If you're trans, especially trans female, get this game. You'll have a character that you can, if not look up to, at least project a bit of yourself on.\n\nAs for the other aspects of the game, just look at the other reviews, I have pretty much the same opinions as they do. Really nice aesthetic, interesting little story, suboptimal (but still alright) controls, inorganic stealth sections, action sections that are fun but not as fun as Megaman, too short, and bad ending. I'd still recommend the game, even if you're not trans, because it's good enough to be worth at least $7.

And those were essentially what I was expecting kind of but they just ended up being really thin. I would've liked the game to have spent more time characterizing and engaging w/ those issues, whereas as it is it seems less like a game made about trans women and more like we're being used as some sort of window-dressing for an unrelated story. Which I am not necessarily opposed to if it means more positive representation in games for people like me, but I'm just not sure how to feel about it. I definitely wasn't able to discern any concrete thematic message about gender or feminism or anything. Our place in the story isn't offensive or anything but it seemed like an afterthought in an overarching plot that could've taken place in any other dystopia. Which makes it an odd choice, then.\n\nAnd what's confusing also is that there are quite a few elements in this game drawn from/common in trans women's culture (weird eldritch monsters and occult rituals, cyberpunk and cyborgs, Satan as a positive character, a joke about "tree slimes," and lots of bad puns), and it was these elements which were familiar to me that I liked the best and found the most interesting. I searched quite a bit to see if there were any trans women involved in the making of this game, and I couldn't seem to find a definite answer. I don't understand though why someone would want to make a game about this subject if they're not a member of that group, though. I read through a few developer interviews, but none of the answers there really made sense to me.\n\nThe gameplay is more consistently good, w/ the qualifier that it's really ♥♥♥♥ing hard. Incorporating some sort of difficulty settings would really make this game a lot more accessible to people like me who are bad at both stealth games and metroidvanias. As it is, it was impossible for me to get through without slowly killing everyone, and I had to retry several of the bosses many times before I could beat them. Maybe that is a positive quality for some people? But I would at least like to be able to choose how much I am going to be challenged by a game.\n\nOn top of that, the most confusing aspect of the gameplay was that there was no map and while Elsa would give you directions to each location, they were usually vague and they wouldn't go into the mission log on the pause screen, so you would just have to try to remember them and then guess what they meant. I spent a lot of time wandering around looking for stuff in this game. I actually really enjoyed the relatively open-world-iness of it (the park especially was nice), but if you're going to make the player wander around like that then you need to give them some help figuring out where they're going.\n\nOtherwise, it was pretty well put together. The music is pretty good and the jumping and dashing mechanics are fantastic. The pixel art graphics are decent enough and occasionally great (I really liked the main character's facial expression). But I guess I'm just not sure what to think about this one.","January 4","true","6.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's kinda like a poor mans version of Mega Man.\n\nWhat isn't workable though, is the stealth. It's tedious, unpredictable, and annoying. Imagine playing Thief TDP with no saves, that's what this is like, only worse. Actually, no, it's more like playing Mega Man where every enemy one shots you just by looking at you. Checkpoints are rare, so you have to do entire stages perfectly. Enemies move in unpredictable ways, and sometimes turn on you when you go to stealth kill them and you fail instantly. Cameras have basically nonexistant hitboxes so are incredibly hard to disable. Sound seems to play a role in enemies actions, but the gameplay never made it clear what makes noise and what doesn't. Sometimes walking alerted enemies, sometimes it didn't.\n\nOh yeah, and no map. You do have a radar, but it's made kinda useless with the pixel graphics and all. Don't know how you could make a metroidvania type game with no map system and think it was a good idea.\n\nThe world seems ok, and the graphics are decent. Music is fairly enjoyable but nothing notable.\n\nFor some reason there are only women, I couldn't get far enough to learn why.

I've seen this touted as a Metroidvania and a stealth-action game, when really it's neither of the two. Rather, the game sends you on purely linear missions and each mission plays either like a level from Megaman X (action missions) or a level from Megaman X where every enemy that sees you insta-kills you ("stealth" missions). While your character does upgrade, the upgrade path thus far is entirely linear and the currency system in the game is rudimentary at best: the only items you can buy are health restores, and you can buy them anywhere, anytime.\n\nThe game feels like it has the bones of a much better game, they're just configured wrong. As a Megaman style run and jump shooter it could work, but the poor and unforgiving stealth system make it feel weak and thin. Additionally, the controls are poor on keyboard and not much better on a 360 controller.\n\nLast but not least, the game has a bunch of current internet buzzwords like "special snowflake" and takes place in a world devoid of men, and so far I can't tell if it's supposed to be a shoutout to or a lampoon of tumblr / social justice culture. If you're not into either of those then steer clear.","September 30, 2015","false","6.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I don't see it doing anything special in that regard, but hey, it's novel!\n\nThe game reminds me a lot of Read Only Memories (it even features an advertisement for the game!), mostly in the UI design, not only the visual aspect, but also all the sound effects. That is yet another recent dystopian sci-fi game that tries to incorporate gender and discrimination issues into the mix. I don't really mind them, but it's a bit too "in your face", in my opinion. In both games, actually. Feels forced to me, but hey, maybe you'll feel different about it! I won't get into that any more than I already have.\n\nAs a stealth game, it's certainly not very good. It's decent, at best. It's not really frustrating, so you can get through the game without being constantly reminded of its problems, which is good. I'll get into that later.\n\nWhat is left, however, is its presentation. It's really cool!\nThe visuals, you can judge from the screenshots. There are some details I really like: the windows and the trees, for example. The monster/robot designs are also cool, in places.\nIf I had to mention something that I dislike is how it's very... busy/confusing, at times. I think it's the perspective on some buildings and background/foreground elements that were very disorientating in the larger areas. The game could definitely do a better job in differentiating between background/foreground elements, as well as what the character can or can not grab.\n\nNot much more to say about it. It has a distinct style, despite the somewhat overplayed 8/16 bit graphic style. I liked this one, for sure!\n\nNow, the music was also great! Nothing mind-blowing, or noteworthy in its use, but it fit the overal aesthetic very nicely! Once again, reminded me of R.O.M., and probably one of this game's highlights, for me!\n\n\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's a simple 2D shooter. You can walk, jump and shoot forwards, that's about it. It's simple, but it does manage to build a solid experience around it.\nYou can grab enemies, if you're close to them (and remain undetected), and you can kill them with a single shot. You'll also have 3 throwable weapons: 1 for distraction, a sticky bomb, and a boom-erang (yeah, it's a bomb too).\n\nThe metroid-vania elements are very, very light, as I mentioned. You'll get the ability to wall jump, and 2 of the 3 throwable weapons are also "unlocked" throughout the story. There are a couple of upgrades spread around the levels, but they're all very mild (slightly faster fire-rater, slightly more hp, etc.). It's mission based, to the whole point of exploration and backtracking present in something like Metroid isn't there at all. The upgrades are also almost negligible in comparison.\nSo yeah, nothing that enhanced the experience by a lot, but hey...\n\n\nFinally, the stealth. This is where I have most issues with. Why? Because Mark of the Ninja exists. I'm not saying to go play Mark of the Ninja instead (although you probably should, if you're simply looking for a stealth game), it's more about how much MotN can teach about 2D Stealth. There are tons of little details that Aerannis is lacking that become rather obvious after playing through MotN.\n\nI've already mentioned the ledge highlighting. There's also (and this was a very important one, to me) how much you can see of the room. The camera simply follows your character, and there's no way of looking up/down/left/right. It's very annoying! Especially when the camera something doesn't lock in the same place, despite the character begin in the same spot. So you'll have to walk a bit more to the right to see what is going on, etc. It's not very good, especially when you do need to see where enemies are going.\n\nThe game also doesn't respond to anything outside your view... like old NES games, where bullets disappear as soon as they leave the screen. This isn't as extreme, but enemies don't seem to take damage for bombs thrown outside your vision, for example. Neither from bullets. It seems like a pointless limitation, especially in a stealth game that relies on planning and sometimes setting traps.\n\nThere are other minor faults, like the dumb AI that can act very comically at times. I often just jumped up and latched onto a light and saw them walk around for a bit, as if I had disappeared. At those times, you can also thrown bombs down and kill the enemies outright.\nI did provide a funny moment, when a guard, immediately after running around stopped a wondered "What is lunch today?".\n\nThe AI sometimes gets stuck in a position without ever turning, which can make it impossible for you to pass undetected, although going back to the previous checkpoint easily fixes it. Checkpoints are very common, so you'll never lose much progress.\n\nSo yeah, the AI is both exploitable and sometimes get into very annoying positions.\n\nThe controls aren't very good, either. They're okay, but anything that requires either reflexes or precision will soon be met with disappointment. Thankfully, there aren't many sections that do require precise controls. Overall, it certainly hinders the game as a whole, combined with the stealth/visibility and AI problems...\nWith that said, as a whole, I still enjoyed Aerannis.\n\nNot the best game I've played, recently, but certainly did a couple of things differently than many platformers today, and looks promising, if the developer keeps improving!\nIf you like the look of it, give it a go.","January 25","true","6.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You get a few upgrades, but we're talking count-on-one-hand territory here*. Don't head into this if you're looking for the undiscovered exploration jam of 2015.\n\nStraight up, the highlight of this game is the soundtrack. I need to find out if it's for sale somewhere since it's not on-Steam purchasable, because dang is it the standout star of Aerannis. The game itself isn't bad, but it falls into that small-team issue where there's some jank, in this case related to the controls not being quite as precise as you'd like, doubly so in stealth sections. If, like me, you just don't want to put up with that: Cheat Engine + exact value search for a Double variable, your max health is 15. Lock it and stealth sections turn into "sections", disabling the auto-fail.\n\nI enjoyed the game and while I occasionally winced at a line, nothing stood out as slagging on one of the myriad real-world perspectives it covers. The ending was a little less so, but frankly, it's not the first video game to abruptly turn metaphor into something that falls flat, and it's not game-ruining, just kind of "...really?". I enjoyed it and will forevermore consider it the weirdest possible Half-Life 3 we could ever get, given that this basically takes place in City 17 + some extra factors.\n\n* It's entirely possible I missed some, but my final count was 6: Gun speed, wall jump, dash, stickybomb, bomberang, and defense+ from a shopkeeper.","January 26","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The problems is the repetition in the gameplay section. I'll cover this later. If you are into such type of games get it right now, it's not expensive and it does one thing great – storytelling\n\nHere options are almost non existent. No audio or video settings at all. Just two options for fullscreen, three for windowed, difficulty and limiting or not the fps. It's a 2D game after all, but even in fullscreen you have black borders and it would be nice to have some audio sliders. You can play with keyboard and rebind the controls, but it's not that intuitive, so controller is what I played the whole game. The problem is I had to use third party softwere, because the game didn't recognize my controller. Once I configure the buttons, controlling the character was great.\n\nThe story take places in Bulgarian City of Plovdiv in a dystopian future ruled by women, where men don't exist, because they are forced to undergo hormone replacement therapy. Society is treating them really bad as second hand humans, insulted by almost everyone, only useful for reproduction. They are called “Snowflakes”. You play as Ceyda Farhi, assassin who kills people for a living. She is transformed too. Ceyda uncovers dark conspiracy threaten the humanity. Pretty standard story in the beginning, but it's getting way better later and even tackles sensitive topics  – transgender people, femisim, hate and few other things. But this is not the core of the story. It's the supernatural conspiracy, but those topics are well implemented. At first I was thinking there will be nothing to remember, but later “Wow!!! This is really good”. The pacing is really great and when you see it's not just a “save the world situations”, it will involved you and the “fault” for this is the great writing. Ceyda is really fleshed out and great character. I wanted to know what will happen next. But keep in mind those sensitive topics if you want to play the game. There is more beside them, but you have to see it for yourslef.  The reason why I enjoy the story so much is, because I didn't read the description. I'm saying that, because part of it is spoiled there. It's a good thing to go blinded in a game. Also there are two endings and I think both are great, but one is more fitting for the story that is told here.\n\nThere isn't much to talk about the graphics. They are great. Beautiful, colorful, detailed and vibrant pixel art will please your eyes. Every part of the world – building, trees, even signboards, are great to look at and diverse. Ceyda's and enemies movement and details are great. When she fall from really high, you see her make this scared cartoon face and it's awesome.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty standard. You can go left and right, later even up. You start the game with a gun, who fire slowly at first and also have a charge shot, and a noise maker to distract enemies. Later you will gain the ability to hang on ledges, run fast and wall jump. By acquiring those abilities, you will acces parts of the world, previously unreachable. But you go to those places, when the story requires it.\n\nExcept noise maker you will get two more gadgets – a sticky bomb and a boomerang. They are usefull not only for killing enemies, but also to remove obstacles on your path.\n\nYou can try to can run and gun, but stealth is well implemented here and it's useful. In some levels it's required to not get caught. If the enemy spot you, it's instant failure, but you restart at the nearest checkpoint. The mechanics are simple – you crouch and walk slowly behind an enemy, grab him and kill him. I already mention the noise maker, but you can also use vents to get around them or hide inside doors or cardboard boxes. Even if the objective doesn't include full stealth, it's better, but not necessery, to sneak on enemies, especially on those with heavy armor.\n\nEnemies are diverse enough. In the beginning you will face regular with guns, later with swords, power armor, tough one with a shield, goo looking creatures and even bees. Beside them there few type of robots. The biggest treath is the enemy with the shield. If he sees you, he fires a plasma ball that can pass through solid surfaces and it follows you. So for them the best tactic, if it's available, is to grab him from behind.\n\nBoss battles are great. The all have completely different tactics to beat them. This is surprised me a lot. And there isn't a single repeating boss. Some are kinda annoying and it took awhile to beat them, but overall they are a blast to fight.\n\nControls are great. If you fall or get hit, it's entirly your fault. You can even control hight of the jump and move Ceyda while in air. This allow me to jump out of vent and while in mid air go through a door and grab an enemy from behind.\n\nHealth is restored by buying a health item from the shop. You have instant access to it. Sadly this is the only thing you can buy, nothing else. The other ways you can restore it is when enemy drops a health, when you kill him and when saving the game. They also drop crystals, nano machines, which are the curency here. And when you finish a job, you also get money.\n\nLevel design is good. All outside areas you visit are great, especially when you get to the final level, but inside buidings are just okay. They are just corridors without any branching paths. Most of them are design, if you want, to use stealth. There are boxes, vents, lamps and so on. Places you visit have different theme like office, garden, high tech facility, cave and so on. There is a lot diversity in the level design. You can enter in buildings, but only when the story dictates it.\n\nSound is great. There isn't voice acting and that's perfectly fine. Effects are nice and they are similar to SNES era games. The highlight is the soundtrack. It's really great. All tracks have this 70-80's dystopian futuristic sound, but modernized and it's not chiptunes. They are vibrant like the world you are in. So well fitting, fast paced, heart pumping. When you fight a boss the music changes dramaticly to have tension and those track are also great.\n\nMost of the issues I have are minor things. But there are two big problems I have. The first is the lack of exploration. When I see game branded as metroidvania I expect exploration to find secrets and other great stuff. Yes, there one or two upgrades hidden, but it's not enough. The other is repetitions. Maybe somewhere in the middle of the game, I start to see that some people might find the gameplay kinda repetetive. As for me, I didn't find that much. It doesn't offer something new, but what it does, it does it great. Honestly, the story is what kept me going. There few small issues. You have only one weapon and I'm not counting the gadgets. I know it's not run 'n' gun game, but still it would be nice to have at least 1 or 2 weapons more. Grabbing on ledges is counterintuitive. It's not automaticly done. You have to press and hold the direction the character is facing and after it catches on some surface, you can release the button. This apply to wall jumping too. It took me awhile, but eventually got use to it. There other little issues, but those are my main complains.\n\nI enjoy my time with Aerannis. There little jokes in the game that put a smile on my face, but unless you are from Bulgaria you won't get them. There probably better metroidvania games, but this one is definitely worth your time. The world is great, graphics are great, the soundtrack is really good, but the best part here is the story. It's well written and it have two endings, which in my opinion stand on their own and you don't have to play the whole game to see both of them. Of course, it's not a perfect game.But nothing stop from enjoying the game. It's worth buying even just for the story. I recommend it.","February 9","true","8.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Aerannis masters the art of being dark but not colourless like so many gloomy games fail at today. The characters all start out simple but over the course of the story all start to really come into themselves with the lead character Ceyda being one of the best.\n\nCeyda is a trans hit-woman living in a world without men, strange visions of abnormal shape shifting creatures and the chance to change the course of human history. This story starts off simple with you just moving from target to target but about halfway through the game things change up. The writing in this game is very nice and makes some wonderful points. I found myself taking screenshots of certain lines just to show them off to my friends on more than one occasion.\n\nI love the world that Aerannis creates. I found so much to love in this from the wonderful green trees clashing with the dark and moody purple cityscape behind it in the park to the not so welcoming streets of the TERF turf.\n\nThis game includes a few things from current trans politics which I enjoyed but some players might not understand. I can see some gamers confusing the TERFs are bad message with a more general feminists are bad one. I think this is a game made for the queer gaming community, or heck maybe is was made just for me because I know I loved it to bits!\n\nWebsite: RainbowWriting.co.uk","October 3, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The action/stealth gameplay keeps you wanting to go back in after every trip up – oh, I should have done this, I slipped up there – and things stay fresher than a straight up run and gun (not that there's anything wrong with a good run and gun). This action/stealth gameplay really adds to the character of being a gun for hire, you're not a tank, you need to outsmart the guards as you can't always run them over. And then there's the story which feeds you just enough information at a time to keep you going in for more. A trail of breadcrumbs, you're  not told what the big picture is off the bat, not about the overall goal, not about the enemy, not even about your character.\n\nJust, one critical word of advice: you absolutely NEED a controller of some kind to play this game, trying to play it with a keyboard is hopeless. If you have a Wii remote and you're on a Mac then you can download Wiiji and program the buttons through that (pretty easy user interface except it does not appear in the program bar at the bottom, it pops up next to the clock in the upper right when you open it. It also installs itself in the Utilities folder). There has to be something similar for Windows, but you can get by with just a Wii Remote, no need to the Nunchuk or other accessory.\n\nAnd to people who are writing negative reviews for political reasons I say this: stop playing the game. No one is forcing you to do so, hell, it's not even as if you have to be around it against your choosing, you can just uninstall the game. If you have genuine critism of the storytellling then, by all means, critique it so the developers can grow their craft. If all you have is political arguments and you bought this game just to give it a negative review based on politics and nothing more then, well, you look like the idiots that went to a concert by a band you don't like just to boo them: The band still has the money from your ticket purchase and the rest of the crowd thinks you're an ♥♥♥ for intentionally participating in an event you don't like.","January 8","true","8.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I saw the KS for Aerannis and thinking hey, dystopian metroidvania w/a trans lady protagonist? :allears: ....but I couldn't back it at the time, so I forgot about it til I stumbled onto a 50% off coupon. Pretty soon I heard vague iffy things and that V ETHICAL BACKER CONTENT got shoved into the game and i suddenly got suuuuper apprehensive about my purchase, but i figured hey, i should at least give it a chance, right?\n\nNOPE WRONG\n\nThis is a post-feminist dystopia where "listen and believe" (as in the Anita Sarkeesian quote - 'one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they tell you about their experiences') shows up in the same cycle of wackyyyy turbofeminist dystopian PSAs as "CAREFUL, MEN EXIST" and "zero tolerance, zero thought, it's so easy" and something about trangst.\n\n\nThis is also a feminist utopia where almost no one has anything of substance to say. Sometimes they talk about food or boredom or hit on Ceyda, and there are like 2-3 palette swap obese ladies who tell you to move out of the way (HILARIOUS), that's about it. (The mission/cutscene dialogue is mostly about Doing Violence, The Shadowy Conspiracy, or hamhanded state lies.) There's also TERF turf, where Blendin Blandin cosplayers with green mohawks tell you that pink hair is so generic and gee nobody gets their ~complexity~ and Ceyda mentions that THE RADFEMS MADE SAUSAGE ILLEGAL BC IT'S TOO PROBLEMATIC FOR THEIR MOUTHS and where, once THE LOOMYNARTY CONSPIRACY is kinda-exposed, randos tell you that they're totes okay with the government making false flag terror attacks if it means more people support the feminist cause. Subtle!\n\nThere's an enclave of trans women who all dress like anime ninja matrons and say "it can't be helped" in Japanese a lot and have weird internalised misogyny ("beauty on the inside is what matters, so liking or caring how you look and showing any skin = SELF-INVOLVED WEAKNESS") and their leader all but calls Ceyda a brainwashed beta cuck tr---y or w/e (there's a little speech about how SEE WOMEN HAVE BEEN MISSING THEIR OTHER HALF AND REGIME CHANGE WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU TOO ~YOU COULD EXPRESS WHO YOU REALLY ARE INSIDE~ WINK and it's like really?) This isn't the only time NPCs basically go "no see you're Actually A Dormant Man forced to be a trans lady by THE OPPRESSIVE GYNARCHY," either, and while i'm glad Ceyda just kinda rolls her eyes at it, it doesn't make it less gross.\n\nThis is a game where Vivian James makes a cameo, because members of That Harassment Group threw some money at Ektomarch for backer npcs/billboards and instead of going 'yo uh wait a sec doesn't this undermine what i'm going for' his response was "ahhh yes surely sticking the dead-eyed daughterwaifu mascot of a group whose members terrorize women over Wrong Opinions About Games and do violently, terrifyingly abusive things to trans women in particular (doxing, outing, threats, harassment, literally trying to drive TW to suicide) in my game about trans women trying to survive state-sponsored transphobic violence is a Good Idea." (also idk if the person who paid for it *said* 'yo my waifu should live in Terftown,' but l-a-f-f-o at that)\n\nThis is a game that can't even own its lazy antifeminism. The ks blurb had some interesting, half-thoughtful stuff about Ceyda's identity and how she fits into society and hinted at a trans lady co-writer, and the game at least doesn't have her go MY GOD YOU'RE RIGHT WHATEVER HAVE I DONE when npcs insinuate that she's a ~dormant man~ or Space David Reimer waiting for the crypto-mra revolution, but at the same time ektomarch going into some detached spiel in an interview abt how the trans woman/terf stuff was thrown in bc he wanted to explore ~a utopia where someone's still suffering~ and the inclusion of little gerbergripe references and potshots at modern mainstream feminism (weirdly inconsistent potshots, too -- like THE GYNARCHY persecuting trans "snowflakes" when attacking "snowflakes" (read: trans/NB people with "special snowflake genders" like "female") IRL is more of a chan/gumbygrape/nrx thing) kind of flies in the face of any thoughtfulness.\n\nI only saw more of this when ekto got shirty in screenshot comments over my ~incorrect assumptions~ about the game being written by a cis dude -- he brought up the Mystery Trans Cowriter with no writing credit at the end who only seems to come up when he's shoring up his LGBT Awareness Bonafides (nacho shield, anyone?), but then he got cutesycoy about throwing in "that one little [harassment group mascot] who seems to offend some people" and ended up on a tangent about how most of the billboards are mocking TERF/TURBO RADFEM LINGO like "manspreading" and "mansplaining" (a, HOW IS THIS RADFEM LINGO? b, does this mean that "listen and believe [when women talk about their experiences with harassment]" is CRAZY TURBOFEMINIST SLANG too?), and the kindest possible takeaway from this is that he straight up doesn't understand the stuff he is writing about beyond knowing that Andrea Dworkin existed and that hey terfs hate trans women and something about #murderingallballs and snowflakes i guess?\n\nBut even when it's obviously been co-opted by That Harassment Mob and Ekto/fff clearly doesn't understand feminism and there's a lot of gross, insensitive stuff in the writing and presentation, instead of up and going YEP IT'S ABOUT ETHICS IN MEDIOCRE SCI-FI DWI TUMBLRINAS the game still halfheartedly holds up a fig leaf of 'you see this is a game abt conspiracies but also abt trans women in a transphobic dystopia' even when the game eventually tosses that aside to go 'no see institutional transphobia is just another distraction President Latex Enthusiast Yung Venuz &co. made trans women a scapegoat for funsies because human society is p much a big telenovela for the REAL threat, the loomynarty!' Problem is,  pandering to gators alienates everyone but gators and the gator-adjacent, trans protag or no.\n\nEven setting all that aside, it's not even good *as a game*. The controls are slippery+janky and traversal is a mess, which makes the many forced-stealth sections and a chase scene a few hrs in excruciating. The combat is pretty samey, and if you get spotted, most enemies' tactics boil down to 'run into you really fast while shooting and stick to you' or 'tracking projectiles!' The game could have really used area maps, bc the minimap's p. useless and one hub area calls for awkwardly climbing signs that blend into the scenery to get from point a to point who knows. Like, the music's actually p. good but there's a word for the everything else and it isn't "fun."\n\nSo yeah! This is a Bad Game. It is a dumb game. It is a game where we learn in one ending that the key to OPENING EVERYONE'S EYES TO THE CONSPIRACY is going deep underground and waking up the only male npc in the game who is also Literally Satan who is also a shapeshifting demon but a good demon who just gets bad PR bc he's very selfless+pure+dedicated to humanity even when it hurts and everyone sees what he sees but he's sedated bc it's important to the secret feminist shapeshifter World Nanny Govt that everyone stay ignorant but think they know everything so they can be easily led and given scapegoats and [s]THE NEW PC ORTHODOXY[/s] social values and etc. that fit the time and people but their time is over because Ceyda wakes up Buddy Satan and says a catchphrase about doing a violence and--\n\nIt's dumb. The other ending is a slightly more satisfying kind of dumb and there's some subtext that would be meaningful if it was written by a trans woman or if the rest of the game was very different, but....it's not, and despite being about a trans woman it's less for trans people than it is for garbage dudes with low standards who think trans/feminist stuff is inherently wackyyyy and out there and bleat about tumblr culture and trolling SJWs.","January 3","false","5.7"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","44","11","25","6","8"

Oh, and there's the illuminati.\n\nThe main bulk of the gameplay is platformer shoot-em-ups, with stealth options available if you prefer. You get various missions, to do with either collecting things, or assasinating targets, with a few 'boss battles' to even things out. All in all I feel as if the gameplay was a little unbalanced, with some areas much more difficult/easier that others, but it was mostly good.\n\nYou have various weapons, which help aid your style of gameplay [be it stealth or just running in head-on], and as enemies die you get tokens and health boosts. I feel as if the tokens are sort of unnecessary as all they are used for is buying more health. In my mind it would have made more sense to just have health boosts drop.\n\nThe story to the game follows you in a plot to overthrow the government who, as it turns out, are a bunch of illuminati gods. Or purple monsters. Or something. Its a bit wierd. That said, ignoring the wierdness, it's not too bad. You meet various people who've been affected by the state of life, and you end up with some choices as to how you want to play it out to the end. Worth mentioning is its very, uh, 'feminist' for lack of a better phrase. But it doesn't strain too heavily on this as to get in the way of the main story.\n\nThe music and art are very good in this game. The music has a very distopian feel to it, and matches up well with the fast paced action. There's also quite a variety of it, as opposed to just a few looping tracks. At times, if you're going for stealth, the music doesn't quite match tot his, but I didn't feel that was a major issue. The pixel art is very nice, with a wide range of environments carefully crafted. [My favourite is probably the art in the garden area].\n\nThe main menu interface is a bit hard to navigate, but it does keep track of your missing, and your inventory. I feel it would be much improved with a map though, as sometimes it can be hard to remember just where things are.\n\nTL;DR - Aerannis is a pretty good platformer, with lots of classic shoot 'em up and some stealth levels.","April 30","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
