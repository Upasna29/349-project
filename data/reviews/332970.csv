(NOT a bad thing) Storm United does tons of things amazingly, but the lack of players on servers really hurts the games playability. (MP only) Right now, Storm United includes: twenty-one weapons, six maps, two classes, six game modes, and plenty of other features. Although Storm United shows tons of potential, the fact that it’s MP only and there is no way to play with bots really hurts this game. The gameplay is very solid, fast paced, and smooth. I have not been able to find anything (gameplay or functionality) wrong with the game.\nPros\nFast paced\nPlenty of weapons\nCool classes\nVaried game modes\nClan system\nWell-made FPS\nLinux support\n\n\nCons\nLow sever population\nRequired to join clan\nSome weapons don’t feel very satisfying to shoot\nServers a quite laggy at times\n\n\nConclusion\nStorm United is a class based FPS game that’s surprisingly polished for being in Early Access. While the gameplay is tons of fun and having tons of different maps/weapons/gamemodes, Storm United suffers from the lack of player on the servers (This can be fixed with adding bots to the games). If you are a fan of FPS like me I would highly suggest you to pick up Storm United and give it a chance.\n\nVideo Review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0J7QlEl7Ao\n\n-HiPFiRED\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

In its current state it's very polished, stable and, most importantly, fun. The player base is really small, but that's hardly the dev's fault. It'll grow. You can help make that happen! (Exciting) Think Halo's visual style and jump feel, Counter Strike's objective feel, CoD4's somewhat fast paced action, and Unreal Tournament/Quake's unique weapon and vehicle design. Do I have you yet? Good.\n\nPresentation - 6\n\nCurrently the menus, UI, etc are very much barebones. It's alpha ver. 1.0 though, so that can be forgiven. With time I'm sure these things will change, but right now there's nothing special here.\n\nGraphics - 10\n\nPretty much perfect. Barring one hiccup at the start of my first match (20fps. Entirely unplayable), the visuals are 100% fantastic. After my little mishap I turned the graphics all the way down, then a few matches later I turned them back to max and boom, smooth, solid 60fps. Wish you could turn off the motion blur, but that's a minor minor complaint. The design and style of the game is also great, sporting very mechanical and sharp designs as Halo and Unreal tend to bring to the table. Overall, the graphics are just what they need to be. A lot of games will give you some "in-engine" crap in the previews. With Storm United, what you see in the screenshots and vids is what you get.\n\nSound - 7\n\nThe sound design in the game is good overall. The music, when it's being played, is very fitting and pleasant. The weapon sounds leave a little to be desired at times, but as a whole they're quite well done and fit the game nicely. Not much more to be said here.\n\nGameplay - 9\n\nStorm United is a shooter, so obviously this is the most important point. There are currently 2 classes (4 planned), each with their own available weapons. The Guardian is a close range warrior, sporting assault firearms such as LMGs, rockets, automatic rifles and what I can only describe as a nail gun. The Shadow is a stealthier sort, exploying such weapons as long range sniper rifles, silenced pistols and mines. (The Shadow is not currently finished, and as such has a much lighter weapon selection than the Guardian. This is expected to change soon when the mines are implemented.) The two classes currently have a host of shared weapons, such as a medium-range semi-auto rifle and shotgun, one pump action and one automatic. In the future each class will also be able to use items like shields and cloaking devices, so that'll change things up quite a lot.\n\nThe controls are tight, reminiscent of Halo and Unreal, with a hint of CoD in there. Overall it feels very good, and compliments the game very well. Level design is also a plus, each map having its own flow and feel. There are currently a few modes in the game, most of which are mainstays of the genre (Deathmatch, TDM, CTF, Demolition), and also freezetag. Awesome. My one complaint is that currently the weapon balance is a bit off, but it's alpha, so that's to be expected. Altogether not a big deal, but enough to shave off a point.\n\nThe Devs/Support - 10\n\nWhen I first purchased Storm United, I could not get it to launch (do entirely to something on my end, not theirs) and so I added one of the devs to my friends on Steam. He was very quick to assist me, and did so graciously (we also played the game with one another for a few hours; very nice guy). The UDH "United Developer Hub" is a system implimented in the game designed to allow players to help develop the game, consisting of polls and things like that to tell the devs what YOU feel is most important and needs to be worked on next. Amazing idea.\n\nLooking Forwards - 11\n\nIf PixeBeam can manage to keep this momentum going into the future, then Storm United looks like it might be one hell of a game, rising up to join the likes of CoD, Halo and Unreal. That's an exciting prospect.\n\nTL;DR:  Shoot gun game that's super fun and allows you to shoot. Also freezetag. Cool weapons. Feels great. Maps are good. Shoot guys.\n\n","April 18, 2015","true","9.3"," 41 of 48 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","41","48","3","0"

The game works, the community is growing, and it is fun to play. Yes it has it's bugs especially the Linux version, but the team is working really hard to get everything sorted out. It is going to be an amazing game by it's official launch, and I can't recommend it enough. The reason you would consider buying into this game right now, is to get in at the ground floor, and help improve the game. That means dealing with the bugs, and helping the developers fix them.\n\nThe playerbase is indeed weak at the moment. The best times to play are listed below. We have also been hosting events on the weekends. I recommend you join the official Storm United group, and keep an eye on the forums. Feel free to add me on steam. I'm about to have 120 hours on record and well known in the community.\n\nLinux users you will want to stick with the EGN servers until the client crashes are patched in a future update. I maintain the EGN servers, and they only have maps in rotation that Linux users can play without crashing. If you ever have issues with these servers, please get in contact with me.\n\nU.S.A.: 10pm - 1am (EST)\nEurope: 6pm - 9pm (UTC +1)\n\nThanks everyone, and have fun!\n\n-DH4","October 16, 2015","true","123.8"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","4"

What you're looking at here is beyond any fancy desert.  It's the very pinnacle of what the future of FPS is.  This is some AAA idealism transformed into a masterpiece of bells and whistles.\n\nThe presentation of Storm United gives you the feeling of futuristic flavor with a hint of modernization.  A recipe that tastes just as good as it looks.  It's fast, but not too fast.  It's intense, but not overwhelming.  It's fun.  Really - damn - fun.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf I was to differentiate this to the other indie fps pre/full - releases that have recently taken place, I'd find Storm United at the top for it's unique approach to the genre.  Right now we have:\n\n-Reflex\n-Toxikk\n-Murder Miners\n\n2 of those games are going to die out (a shame) simply because they either have 1 weapon that is used 95% of the time over the other weapons (whats the point in having 9+ weapons then?..) , and/or have 1 game mode (dual) that is played over the other 3-5 game modes available.  And that's obviously not a problem if you're into that (talking to you elitists.)  So you're looking at a very VERY scarce player base overall.\n\nAnd the other game is practically just a shameless rip of Halo, with some interesting game modes.\n\nBut with Storm United, right off the bat the game tells you, "I'm a team-based game."  You have to either make a clan or join one before you do ANYTHING in the game.  Is this is a good idea?  For me, I very much love in-game clan support with my FPS, but for others, (see that scarce bunch) it may not be their cup of tea.  (And I'm okay with this, because those type of players do not belong in this type of FPS.)\n\nThere's loadouts in this game, which means all weapons can be utilized based on player preference.\n\nThe maps are actually fun and vary in size according to the game mode, and have a lot of flanking areas which are ideal for team play.\n\nAnd speaking of game modes, they have a decent amount of them that aren't over the top different, but do well to again support team play.\n\nAND THEN THERE IS FREEZE TAG.  My god -- this to me is Storm United's best game mode.  It's a positive and unique approach to the TDM game mode, but with a twist.  (Not sure if anyone has ever played Spider Freeze Tag in grade school when they were younger but it basically works the same way.)\n\nEssentially, you fight each other to the death, but instead of dying, you becomes frozen -- from this point it's up to your teammates to find you and unfreeze you, to which then you may resume play.  The round ends when your team or your enemies team are completely frozen.  This adds for some unique and strategic elements, along with some clutch-factor game play, which is all too sweet if pulled off.\n\nThere's a lot going for Storm United, and the developers are on top of this community to make sure that they keep our best interest for this game in mind.  They even have an in-game developer poll and suggestion poll.  That means that we vote on what gets implemented, what gets fixed, and can even throw in our own suggestions and have players vote on those suggestions, thus giving the developers an idea of what we'd like to see in their game.\n\nBut you have to actually be in the game to vote (which is pretty smart.)\n\nSo ya, there's all that.  I could keep going on and on about what separates this game from the other FPS releases and how pretty the game looks, or you could just take my word for it and start playing Storm United today.  The more players, the bigger and better the game becomes.  But if you choose to wait, you have nothing to lose.  It becomes F2P on release.  Cash shop?  Cosmetics.","April 20, 2015","true","6.2"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","77","30","39","7","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/weB04/recommended/332970/","weB04","[t]™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/weB04/","901 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStorm United is a class-based fast-paced multiplayer FPS. My initial thoughts are very positive for this game as I love this genre. One may find it quite similar to Quake Live in its gun play and action.\n\nIn its current state, I will give it:  6/10\n\nPros: A collection of 15 different weapons. All unlocked at the very beginning. Happy Fraggin !!\nA variety of maps, 6 in total.\nA Suggestion/ Bug reporting interface (Unified Development Hub) built into the main menu itself. Here you can vote for your top 3 choice of features, add polls and to-do lists. Basically, it gives a simple way to voice your opinion straight to the devs.\nRuns on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. Its nice to see the dev thinking about gamers on other platforms as well, this early in the game development.\nCons: Only two playable classes - the Guardian and the Shadow. As the name suggests, the Guardian is an assault class while the Shadow is stealth class.\nOnly one vehicle available - a buggy. It would have been nice to have more of them. Who doesn't like to explore the virtual terrain on a super bike.\nThe game directly forces you to choose a clan or create your own as soon as you get to the main menu. This is quite puzzling, since you have no idea what it does when you first start the game. I was worried, that i would be stuck in the same clan/ region and not be able to change. Fortunately you can change that later. A small introduction or tutorial would have been nice instead.\nLow player base. I hardly found 5 players to play the game on some German server. This, even after all the promotional key giveaways is slightly discouraging. But this might change in the future and the devs are constantly updating the game.\nLack of servers. Last I played, there are no servers in the Oceania region. Servers are available for North and South America and Europe.\nIn its current state it is a bit buggy but stable.\n\nMy verdict for this game would be to buy it  ONLY  if you want to be involved in the game's development. Else wait for a period of 4 to 8 months after which it will go F2P.\nBy buying the Steam Early Access, you will get to play the game before everyone else and will get: 1x premium character, 1x exclusive weapon and 1x epic random loot.\n\nOverall, It looks quite promising and has the potential to rise among the likes of Quake and Unreal Tournament.\n\nYou can follow the game's development at its  website [www.stormunited.com].\n\nDisclaimer: Review copy provided by the developer.","April 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

The controls are extremely fluid and intuitive and it's very easy to pick up. This is what a competitive FPS should be like. The graphics are top notch. I have two GTX 980s and with all settings on max at 1080p, I get an average 150fps. Other game devs could take an example on PC optimization from Storm United. I definitely recommend buying this game. It may be in alpha, but it certainly doesn't play like it. On the down side, there are two things. I've read other reviews saying that this game will basically be going F2P. I really hope that doesn't happen. I've never played a good F2P game. That ruins the game 100% of the time. To the devs: PLEASE DON'T MAKE THIS F2P! Just keep it at $20 and maybe give us some inexpensive DLC or something. But for the love of the Odin, don't ruin a beautiful thing! The other thing is that at this time there are hardly any other players. You may have a hard time finding a match. Obviously this isn't something the devs can control, and if word of Storm United spreads, the player base should improve dramatically. This is an excellent game that should speak for itself advertising-wise. So in that respect, help everybody out and play this game! If it can get a decent player base, it's going to spread like wildfire. 6/5 stars.","May 17, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","0"

Wrong, sadly.\n\nThere is one big contra aspect. There are almost never players online. I got to play a couple of games with like 4 people, but that´s about it.\n\nI would recommend buying it, however I would wait a bit until the game has some more players. It is almost unplayable as it gets really boring after 2 minutes of just running around on the map and doing nothing. The game has great potential and I hope some more people see this.","June 20, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

This game is quite a mix in my opinion of Halo (one of course) with many other popular arena shooters together. Eventually the developers said also they'll be including vehicles and whatnot making it feel even more of an enjoyable experience. This'll bring me to my nogalstia CTF Halo CE multiplayer days.\n\nFor those who don't normally play arena shooters, trust me it's quite enjoyable if this is even your first, this game feels like a unique genre than just an "arena shooter" I'd say it feels more than to be said as that genre but it is quite enjoyable.\n\nShould you get it or not is up to you really, are you a big fan of indies and wish to help develop very early on or are you just waiting to buy it when its completely finished? The game is still developing and by each update it does a crazy amount of changes towards it and these developers are working their butts off and they listen to the community as all developers should, so it's great. You might have trouble having players at the moment which is mainly the barrier stopping people from supporting these folks due to not being able to play mostly themselves for the players but things are shaping up nicely and they're planning events as well as players are slowly playing it more as of each major updates.\n\nIf you're really limited to your money and you cannot afford a price of Storm United then wait for a sale since I feel that you will feel cheated for paying for a still developing game with many to do, but trust me it's good.\n\nPros & Cons - Too Long Didn't Read Trend\nThere is a lot more I could mention for the good side but I cannot express it with my words, nor think of what pluses there are in the game to say right now as of this moment as of this review. Long story short, it's a gem of a game just developing still and working hard.\n\nPros:\nAmazing sounds, I could kiss it.\nThe way you move around is really mint and slick\nThey've added new classes and amazing new guns (Medi gun, a few bad ♥♥♥ guns you'd want to best avoid being shot at with)\nGame UI and Graphics - simply amazing, as I said before feels like Halo CE PC but remade in the unreal engine to be pretty as possible.\nMore things being developed still (I.E : Vehicles)\n\n\nCons:\nMay have a little trouble with players but don't let that stop you from supporting, they haven't really focused entirely in the marketing section a whole lot than they can from what I heard and that they're working on delivering the game more.\n\nCan't really think of any other cons.","October 16, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

The game seems to be growing due to their hard effort.\n\nFUTURE POTENTIALS:\n\nSo I have made several suggestions about the game and here are the things that are going to come up in the game in the future according to how the devs responded to my suggestion.\n\n- further character customization including armor customization\n\n- further weapon customization (may be being able to attach melee weapon to your gun idk)\n\n- being able to CREATE your own skin for your gun and character\n\nI assume these are not the only things that is going to come up in the future but for now the devs response show that these stuff will come up in the future.\n\n- I also saw in one of the reviews that vehicles will come up as well\n\nCAUTION:\n\nCurrently the game is still not complete so you can't expect it to have things that other shooters have. For example, currently you can't access your inventory box in the main menu.\n\nAlso, I assume the population is relatively small because I always have a difficult time finding players to play with. To minimize this issue the devs have established a time in which you can meet the most number of players.\n\nMY COMMENT:\n\n- I personally think the price is worth it although you can't currently play it at its full potential. I mean, this game is not near complete and yet you can enjoy it by playing with 20+ guns, each with its uniqueness.\n\n- If you are willing to wait patiently while the devs are working on this game, then you should buy it. By the way, you can get like a premium weapon for free if you buy it early access (check out the store page for more info).\n\n- Make sure you invite your friends!

The game it self is pretty stable. The weapons are good and has it's challenge of it's recoil.\n\nBesides this, everything else seems to be really good designed. Almost a feeling of playing a complete game.\n\nThe only thing i do not like is two things:\n1. Empty servers\n2. Jumpads feels too straight. When you jump on them, it feels hard to move out of the "jump line".\n\nI feel really sorry about the devs going free-2-play. It's actually really good game and i like it alot, which i would wish that my buy would not make it free-2-play. It's worth paying for, if we talk content.\n\nI would recommend this game, but i would ask people not to buy it unless they have a feeling too supporting the devs. If it's goes to free-2-play, it's kinda nonsess spending money on it. But well, lets hope at least they get more players at free-2-play since 0.01% of the current community don't want to give life to the serves. It took me two weeks before being able to play with a single guy.\n\nGive it a shot, if you are some few guys who wants to play a game together, or want to support them. On the other hand, it's like walking in the dark because of empty servers.","June 29, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Any thoughts or comments expressed are entirely my own.\n\nI played this game a couple of days ago and I need to say that I was really impressed with it. It is definitely fun and it will worth your time. Each time I played Storm United, I was a little bit happier afterwards and even if it may still be in Alpha 1 version, it looks really promising already.\n\nTo start with, Storm United is a class-based multiplayer First Person Shooter. The avail­able classes so far are 4; The Guardian, The Shadow, The Angel, and The Hacker.\n\nYou can try out these classes in a variety of maps and in 6 different game modes which are the Freeze Tag, Demolition, Extermination, Capture The Flag, Deathmatch, and the Team DeathMatch.\n\nI found the graphics astonishing considering its current version. The textures, the terrains, the armor that we were wearing were are really well made and with attention to detail.\n\nMoreover, I enjoyed the sound and the sound effects of this game. It was a good call having them open on my 5.1 sys­tem. They were realistic, not annoying at all and they made your stay in the game enjoyable, allowing you to play for many rounds till you realized many hours had passed since you first started playing.\n\nFinally, the gameplay can be characterized as pure awesomeness. It felt really smooth and solid and it had good mechanics and control of your character and the elements around you.\n\nHere's a quick list of pros and cons:\n\nPOSITIVESGreat graphics\nRunning smoothly\nReally good gunplay\nFun to play\nAmazing sound and sound effects\nA variety of guns, maps, and you have different classes to select from\nNEGATIVESFew people can be found online playing it\nSome servers were quite laggy\nLack of achievements\nIf you are a fan of FPS like me I would highly suggest you to pick up Storm United and start playing it right now. It is an awesome game with huge potential and you should definitely give it a try.\n\nRead the full review here[www.blowsomesteam.com]","November 6, 2015","true","7.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Every early access mulitplayer game I have seen has had a very shortly lived playerbase, even if they had some great potential, like this one. Almost all early access game has very slow development and it is extremely difficult to keep a healthy playerbase during that time especially for indie games like this.

Gameplay is kept very basic and fun with a lot of the guns being skill based such as the saw gun that can bounce saws off walls and hit hidden players.\n\nThe only issue is the game has very little players as of now. However, the developers have posted play session times to compensate for this with NA play sessions being at 10pm EST (I think) and I do not know about EU play session times.\n\nEDIT: This game now has a official TS you can join to try and meet up with other players","December 27, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Im giving it a recommend to encourage people to support the devs and make this into the game it could POSSIBLY turn into. Right now its just getting started so its hard to say what will happen from here as with many early access games now adays.\n\nAt the current time all the servers are empty so it might be best to wait until more people pick the game up.\n\nI recommend this game (as a "future purchase") because it has good fluid controls, interesting weapons and the graphics are decent. However i cant in good conscience say its worth buying now until later along in the development cycle.When more people pick it up and are playing.\n\nI think the devs would do good to give a free beta to garner interest for the games and get the word out. It seems like a great game but i honestly cant really say because all the servrs were empty and theres no bots to play with atm so all i could really do was walk/run around the map and try out some of the weapons. I really hope this picks up and does well because im kind of excited for it but right now i cant play and i sort of just threw down 20 dollars for nothing lol.

Love to play this game with friends and alone.

I definitely was not disappointed as it turned out be a fps with a lot of promise. Storm United described by many as being a fast pace shooter although not quite as fast pace as quake or UT but fast pace nonetheless. Using iron sights is optional, though I find myself not using most of the time which I suspect is the case with most players.\n\nThere are four classes, Guardian, Shadow, Angel, and Hacker. These classes cover the usual roles you see in class based games, (assault, support, medic...) Great visuals and textures, a style that reminds me of Halo. Game play is smooth and easy to get into for first time players. The game modes are traditional with a few unique ones. The maps are well designed as well.\n\nAs far as the cons go the main one that many pointed out is the lack of players. Its difficult to find a decent amount of players. Until the community picks up I suggest the devs organize more events as that is the best time to find the most players. There is also occasional server problems that make it difficult to join games and server lag. These are issues that should get fixed as the game develops so it's not a big issue for me. Vehicles are not in the game yet. so I can't comment on them yet. I would also like to see Bots introduced into the game. I think that would increase the community and be a big improvement.\n\nOverall I am impressed with the game at this stage.\n\n\n\n","November 13, 2015","true","21.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You have to encourage people as fast as it's possible or you will lose chance to promote and bump your game above others. SU devs lost their chance - they are trying to sell alpha of the game for price of regular shooter. This game isn't done well, it's early pre alpha of alpha pre alpha. It is better to spend $ 10  more and buy yourself a real shooter. Incredibly awkward character control, two hitboxes - the head and the rest of the body. With the announcement about Storm United - open world shooter - we got quake-like game based somewhere on the level of 90-s.

My review still stands. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, if you can even call it that anymore, what with it being unplayable as of late, unless a dev creates a "time of playability", of which the game is only active for a couple of hours. The devs have lost their way and are more worried about "bells and whistles" than anything else, for all three platforms, instead of just focussing on Windows until Release, by which they can outsource Linux and Mac to a company like ASPYR.\n\nYeah, I know, this game is in early access and all, but, like any FPS, shouldn't there be at least SOME people online at any and all hours of the day????\n\nSTORM UNITED: a mashup game that brings back UNREAL's original qualities, and adds in new-age concepts, what with currently two classes that any and all players may access at first, the "tank" and the "sniper"/"assassin" classes. As of yet, the only difference between them, is look and maybe what weapons they carry. This game feels like a lot of other CRAPPY FPS games, though. The game feels... stocky for a lot of us, where sometimes you move the mouse and EXPECT the cursor/crosshairs to move, and they don't... I've yet to play on a map with vehicles, nobody even plays them I guess? Anytime I ever see anybody on, it's almost always FREEZE tag, which is... interesting.\nOne thing that confuses myself, and many of the other players: CLANS. Soon as you start your copy of the game "YOU MUST CREATE OR JOIN A CLAN!" Why? Because people thought too far ahead and implemented a silly system that shouldn't even EXIST yet; damn clowns! It's EARLY ACCESS! WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS!?!?!?\nBack to characters/classes, why are ONLY 2 of the four accessible as of yet? Fix it, will ya? If you MUST follow a "class" system, try fully implementing the system before launch... some people want to play the SUPPORT, or an ACTUAL tanky class.\nAdvertisement: Where is your advertisement person, beyond your key supporter who WON'T let the game die so easily, because you need more people from around the world to play this, at any and all hours of every day, in all timezones. Which brings me to the one thing that is bothering me... servers. New York and FLORIDA...? Georgia should have been your server area, as it is one of the biggest conduits in the entire eastern seaboard of the United States, and even ties in to the south-American nations. Obviously not a lot of thought went into the placement of the servers... but that can be fixed, prioritized and replaced with ease at a later time... it's just a pet peeve of someone who does a lot in the region.\nThe maps, I must say, although they're OBVIOUSLY ALL INCOMPLETE, are interestingly designed, and I would LOVE to see them finished.\nIt is really a beautiful game, despite my needing to turn down the graphics to play effectively, without crashing while turning a little to the left, like a canadian with his right hand full of maple syrup.\n\nThe potential is unlimited for this game, although it cannot come close to defeating it's predecessor of UNREAL(any of the non-storyline games), even if the dev outright plagiarized the whole of Unreal 2k4, which would make this game infinitely better... but for now... I give this game a DISMAL... 3/10. For now.\n\nIf you want a game with far more potential, and a better setup, you might want to take at the 2011 game Nuclear Dawn, which I just bought on-sale, and although it is not NEARLY as 'pretty' as this, or smooth as UNREAL 2k4, it's a lot smoother, you can run with higher graphics, with less power required than this game, and you have truly unique acquisitions, where classes of characters actually matter, and you have a COMMANDER, which makes things... interesting to say the least.\nDevs, if you're reading this, you might want to take a look at it and see if you can't try implementing things from THAT game, into yours.\n\n5/6 people found this review offensive, so far, not taking into consideration that a GOOD PORTION OF THE OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE LESS TIME ON THE GAME THAN I DO! Hah! Only one person appreciated this as the HONEST and suggestive review that it is. There are those with less than a quarter of the time that I put in to this game, who praise it to the HIGH HEAVENS for no reason. WHY? Because fanboys who don't know what a finished work of Art is... probably never even played any of the UNREAL games...","May 16, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

This game feels very sluggish, hard to aim and slow to the feel.  Reload times on the weapons are pretty much a death sentence.  Some of the maps are either gank or camp fest.  Everyone was pretty much all playing the same exact class for a fast shooting weapon.  All the other weapons use slow moving projectiles.  I've never felt so helpless playing a FPS.  The other players would just jump or move side to side, wait for you to do your long reload time and kill you.\nI'm glad it was only $5.  It pretty much felt like buying a scratch off.
