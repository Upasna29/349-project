Who wouldn't want to point and click their way through an Amazonian planet filled with nothing but beautiful women? Most of them hate men and want them all dead, but still, you know, boobs and whatnot.","November 27, 2014","true","1.0"," 31 of 47 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","31","47","9","0"

This is important because at the time, this game improved the genre from where they used to type in the commands and hoping it works, and instead getting menu options. But unfortunately the mechanics presented don't help the already meh story. Some of the bad mechanics which was acceptable at the time such as pixel hunting, screwing up a terminal location that takes you to other locations (the car in the city about half way through the game) where you can't just click on the map, and the DRM which requires you to look up words in the manual (if you re-release games like this remove this kind of DRM for **** sakes). The story is in a similar situation, where they play to 50-70s B grade science fiction tropes. Interestingly enough it even has the bait and switch with sex appeal in the advertisements, even know there is very little sex in the game. Unfortunately the game is not funny enough to make the story work (this can work very well if done right), instead using gender stereotypes as a replacement for humor. Overall it is a 6.5/10, would not recommend.","September 14, 2015","false","4.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/328430/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender takes me back to the good old days of DOS PC games. It is billed as a graphic adventure game, and while it is that, the storyline is kind of flimsy. There is no real questing, just puzzles and obstacles to overcome as you travel from one place to the next. Slowly you learn what has happened on the planet you crashed into. I prefer playing games on the hardest settings, and with Rex Nebular, the hardest settings mean the most amount of puzzles and obstacles to resolve, as well as the most amount of death encounters. There are a lot of ways to die. If you want a good idea of how this game is and are familiar with the NES, the original Shadowgate is a decent comparison for how this game works. It surprised me as being not that bad of a game and in the early 90's there were A LOT of bad games, though I'm not sure what kind of price tag I would put on it. Since it is a DOS game, you can probably find a freeware version somewhere. The graphics look like crap, but it's 23 years old, so what do you expect. Personally, save your money and find a shareware or freeware version somewhere. Nothing against the game itself, I think it's mediocre as a game, but I don't think it is worth paying money for in 2015.","July 17, 2015","false","1.1"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","16","37","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/binarysplit/recommended/328430/","binarysplit","BinarySplit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/binarysplit/","863 products in account","Mediocre adventure game that has aged poorly. I played it to completion a couple years ago, before it came out on Steam, hence my low playtime. The story isn't very interesting, the puzzles are tedious and often the solutions make no sense. Putting in the effort just wasn't paying off, so I gave up and followed a walkthrough for most of the game.\n\nIf you're looking for an oldschool adventure game, look elsewhere. I'd suggest the LucasArts SCUMM games like Loom and The Dig.","November 15, 2014","false","0.1"," 21 of 48 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","21","48","0","3"
