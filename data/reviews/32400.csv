In reality I have much more, but I played it in offline mode because of traveling.\n\nAt first, I was gonna make this a stupid "Hurrr durrr this Star Wars and Doom 420/69" type of review. However, I really do believe a great game like this deserves an actual Pro/Con review. That being said, be prepared for lots of Pros.\n\nPros\n+ The environments of this game are some of the best I've ever seen in an FPS. They are all unique and encourage exploration, which makes every level memorable.\n+ Lots of different enemies, all faithful to the Star Wars lore. You've got your Stormtroopers, Commanders, Probe Droids, Dark Troopers and many more.\n+ Lots of memorable characters from the Star Wars universe. Mon Mothma, Boba Fett, and even Jabba the Hutt are all there.\n+ The guns are also all faithful to the Star Wars lore (You might even find a few in other SW games), and are really fun to use as well. Thermal Detonators, Repeaters, Fusion Cutters, and even the Imperial blaster rifle are all super cool and fun.\n+ Puzzles are thought out well, and are at that just right difficulty that you wont find too hard or easy.\n+ SECRETS.\n+ Every mission has its own briefing, which tells you exactly what you need to know, no bullcrap.\n+ Story takes place just before and after the Episode IV, so a big plus for me and many others. And its also super cool because YOU ARE THE ONE WHO GETS THE DEATH STAR PLANS.\n+ This is an FPS done well. Its so fun to blast the hell out of everyone. The gunplay is VERY fun.\n+ Creative obstacles. No, really. There was one room that was pitch black, with 4 Stormtroopers. The only thing that created light were all the lasers flying around, sorta like flying flashlights.\n+ You can use you fists to kill everyone. HOW BADASS IS THAT?\n\nCons\n- The story. I mean there has to be a story, right? Except it feels so rushed and there's no point to it, because you only objective (except the level with the death star plans) is to stop the creation of Dark Troopers. Boring.\n- The game is super short with less than a dozen missions, and lack of replayability makes it all the shorter.\n- The ground feels like its ice, you keep slipping and sliding everywhere which makes it kinda hard to focus on a shot and do a bit of platforming.\n- Lack of a manual. Thank Lord Vader for Steam guides, because it doesn't, ever, tell you the controls in the game.\n- Obviously, everyone's con, the graphics. The game came out in 1995, and it has not aged well at all. If a younger gamer, or really any graphics fan picked this up, they might get turned off by the graphics. BUT THATS WHY I SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST. There is a mod for this game called DarkXL. It introduces lots of things like 1920x1080 resolution, rebindable controls, more options, being able to look up and down, a reticle, and it makes the game look fantastic.\nIf you're picking this game up, download this mod, its worth it.[xlengine.com]\n\nThis game gets a 9/10. If it had just been a bit longer, and if the story had been A BIT better, this would've been a solid 10/10.","December 13, 2014","true","3.1"," 211 of 221 people (95%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","95","211","221","16","10"

I'd take this game over DOOM any day. Obviously, though, its age makes it good for nostalgia and not much else.\n\nThe main premise is a bit off beat for Star Wars, but the universe is generally represented in a wonderfully dark, gritty and accurate perspective of a rebel-aligned bounty hunter.\n\nAs an extra note, I'd like to say there is nothing cheap or fake about this game, other than the limitations that were common for its time. From start to finish, each mission feels like a well-organized challenge situated in a real, factual location of the Star Wars universe - without feeling like a repeat of any of the three original movies.","November 26, 2013","true","3.9"," 78 of 86 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","78","86","0","0"

You're an eleven year old Star Wars nerd and your dad just bought a sweet new DOS' with, like, a whole MEGABYTE of RAM! What do you do? You get Dark Forces.\n\nIn retrospect, you may think its just a DOOM-clone. But it isn't. And when it was first released, the Jedi engine was hardly thought of as anything but a massive leap gaming. With Dark Forces, you can look up and down, crouch, and even swim! There's multiple floor levels - and many of those levels feature atmospheric effects and all of them have animated textures!\n\nWe're spoiled in this day and age. I recommend Dark Forces because not only is it actually fun to play, and the storyline is pretty engrossing, but its a blast from the past from when games were actually more than layers upon layers of quicktime events.","July 23, 2013","true","4.7"," 66 of 72 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","66","72","0","0"

Built on an enhanced version of the DOOM engine, Dark Forces reset the bar for first person shooters. It introduces the lasting character of Kyle Katarn into the universe and proved that you don't have to be a Jedi or a starfighter pilot to make a successful Star Wars game. An epic storyline, combined with memorable characters and impressive level design makes this game a must have for any Star Wars fan, or those looking for a sense of nostalga about how far gaming has come.\n\nThe graphics were top notch at the time of release (1995) with smooth animation and distinct sprites and textures. Digital voice work is crisp and helps to give the characters a sense of personality. From the filtered 'halt!' of stormtroopers to the anamalistic groan of the Diagnosa as you wade through raw sewage, you will always know exactly what is hunting you.\n\nGameplay is standard fare for shooters of the time. you have a wide variety of weapons - pistols, blaster rifles, thermal detonators, along with more exotic weapons such as the fusion cutter or the assault plasma cannon. Health is non-regenerating and must be restored from medkits, along with shields.\n\nSound direction is excellent. The music features remixes of well known Star Wars tunes along with new music. Each tune fits the level it is attached to. Weapon sounds are unique, giving every gun its own feel.\n\nOverall, this is a geat game for retro lovers. Solid gameplay, a memorable story that has influenced many other games in the franchise, and characters with actual personality makes this a good choice.\n\nOn the technical side, this game comes bundled with its own auto-loading version of DOSBox, meaning that it will work on modern systems. Confirmed functional on all systems up to Windows 7 64-bit, with reports of it working properly on Windows 8 systems.\n\n9/10.\n","November 29, 2013","true","12.1"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","62","69","0","3"

It offers for a ton of memorable moments from the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY: 8/10\nThe lack of a quicksave function really is the main downgrade for me in this game. Otherwise the game is pretty solid.\n\nGRAPHICS: 8/10\nNo support for high res modes means you are pretty much forced to play in a low-res 320x240 mode. Otherwise the atmosphere is spot on and the levels are very well designed.\nThe spritework feels very authentic and detailed.\n\nSOUND: 10/10\nExcellent music and authentic sound design. No real complaints here.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 9/10\n\nAll in all, Star Wars: Dark Forces is a true classic FPS that you should definitely play if you're a fan of Star Wars or just oldschool shooters in general. Some of its features are well ahead of its time, while in some other ways it does feel a bit obsolete. But as a whole I had a blast playing this game.

You know why?  It's pretty damn obvious... when he's around, stormtroopers can't aim worth ♥♥♥♥!\n=====\n\nDark Forces... what is this?  It's an FPS from the DOS and PS1.  Don't back off the store page just yet, bear with me.  Is it canon? ... Yes it is, George Lucas is just a ♥♥♥♥ who somehow thought the Death Star plans were taken by a bunch of plain old rebels.  Nope, it was Kyle, the one man rebel pain train.\n\nThis game's very doom-style, mixing together 2D sprites with 3D terrain.  You may also notice the way the X axis is locked, just like doom.  But wait, what's this... what happens if I use PgUp/PgDown... oh ♥♥♥♥, I'm looking up and down!  And there you have it.  This is a doom-style that also allows jumping, crouching, and looking up and down.  Have your fill of "innovation?"  Good, now let's talk about what we all really care about-- gameplay.\n\nIf you haven't already guessed, it's a Star Wars shooter leading up to the events of the Star Wars: Jedi Knight franchise.  You play as mercenary Kyle Katarn and it begins with a setting we'll recognize easily-- this is an imperial base.  Go steal the plans to the Death Star.  Then, the story takes a unique Extended Universe approach, as we follow the development of an Imperial super-soldier project, codenamed "Dark Troopers."  Your missions are to go into various places and carry out the assignment given to you, as you go deeper into the project and try to put a stop to it.\n\nThe level design is great... it has a good balance of puzzles, firefights, raids, speedruns, and more as you plow through stormtroopers and Imperial officers, as well as the occasional robot.  More than that, the levels themselves are very dynamic and overall, the use of elevators and moving platforms really add to the game.  Multiple weapons can be found, from Blaster Rifles to Thermal Detonators to Imperial Heavy Repeaters, and the sprites/texturing are still at least decent.  The game itself is completely solid, and visually it won't hurt to look at with the simple Imperial designs.\n\nThe only pitfall in this game is what the greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at LucasArts have done with it.  According to George Lucas, slapping an outdated and incompatible DOSBox that isn't even properly configured counts as a proper "rerelease."  The controls have been "updated," with WASD to move and... no vertical aiming on the mouse.  Of all the things we needed, they left out the most important one and we'd be better off just using the damn arrow keys for movement!  Anyway, there are guides you can read on how to fix these issues, don't let them stop you from playing this game.  If you have any issues, check the bottom of this review for guides on how to update DOSBox, make it run better, and (optional) add controller support.\n\nOverall: ♥♥♥♥ the 'rerelease,' 7/10.  Game itself: 8.5/10, frantic FPS fun in the Star Wars universe with great level design.\n============\nCompatibilty\nThe following Steam guides will help you make the game work smoothly on your PC without color issues.\n\nUpdate DOSBox to 0.74: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=205637267\nBetter Performance: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=256728338\nController Support: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=213262211\n\n=============\nYou may also like:\n\nDoom 2\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/\nQuake\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/\nShadow Warrior Classic (Now Free on Steam)\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/238070/\n=============\nPreferred Purchase Method: Star Wars Jedi Knight Collection\nGet this amazing DOS era shooter as well as the critically acclaimed Jedi Knight franchise!  While the rereleases for Jedi Knight 1 and Mysteries of the Sith are downright broken (a shame, JK1 is easily one of the greatest games of all time), you still get the amazing Jedi Knight 2 and 3 for about $8 less than you'd normally pay, if you don't count the broken JK1.  Definitely still worth the buy for Dark Forces, JKO, and JA alone, all three are excellent single-player games with two of them working flawlessly on modern systems (widescreen is available via a console command).","December 31, 2014","true","16.0"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","42","55","8","2"

Fans of retro 1st person shooters shouldn't miss this nostalgic inducing, challenging, pixel art title. Considering this game was made over 20 years ago, it's held up remarkably well, and in my opinion is better than Doom.\n\nPROS\nCaptures the essence of Star Wars in a way that even George Lucas ("The Maker") couldn't capture with the prequel trilogy,\nBeautiful level design inspired by classic movie locales,\nA wide range of interesting weapons,\nClassic Star Wars characters, including a brief appearance by Boba Fett!!!\nLots of Stormtroopers, Imperial Officers, Mouse Droids & Gamorean Guards,\nIf you played this as a child, get ready for nostalgia overload,\nClassic Star Wars to the core,\nCONS\nNo Y-axis mouse control,\nBecomes quite cheap towards the end of the game, particularly on the last level,\nSome unintuitive puzzles,\nI personally couldn't get Steam Overlay to work,UPDATE please see @Kill-Cam Celebrity's comments dated 9th of March 2016 for a detailed workaround regarding the steam overlay issues. The review remains unchanged because this is only a work-around, and not a straight-forward one at that. Big thanks to @Kill-Cam Celebrity for providing this.\n\nCONCLUSIONS...\n\n"Look how old you've become". BUT WHO CARES! YOU'RE STILL AWESOME! What a great visit to my childhood. This classic Star Wars experience, heavily inspired by the original trilogy, is a morsel of gaming history. In thier glory days, LucasArts really did excel at game development, and they hit all the right beats with this title too...on so many levels.\n\nRevisiting this game after 20 years really highlights how much of the original trilogy LucasArts packed into this experience. From the classic enemies and weapons, to the incredible level design and vistas. It was great fighting Stormtroopers on a level whose interior was inspired by the Corellian Corvette from Episode IV, and undertaking a platform puzzle while jumping between pillars which look remarkably like the Death Star tractor beam controls.\n\nThis game brought back so many memories from my early days of PC gaming, and I thuroughly loved it. I can't wait to "hook into" the rest of this series, and i'll definately be plaing Dark Forces again in the future.\n\n\n_______________________\nRANKING DESCRIPTIONS\n\nScore        Description                1        This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!                2        Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.                3        Why did they even bother?

I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.                9        A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get.

Like most games from the early days of the (partial) 3D first-person shooter genre, Dark Forces builds on what was established by its predecessors. It takes Doom's formula, uses it as the foundations and creates something new and improved (just like Doom did with Wolfenstein 3D). From a gameplay perspective it is quite similar, but a number of key features have been added which were quite new in 1995.\n\nIn addition to all the typical stuff you'd expect from a mid-1990s shooter, Dark Forces also allows the player to aim vertically (this can however only be done using the numpad; the mouse is used for horizontal aiming instead). Other features added by the Jedi engine are the ability to jump and crouch and a number of atmospheric effects. Some missions require the use of a headlamp, night vision, gas mask, special boots and other tools. The player can also throw thermal detonators (explosives).\n\nDark Forces is set in the Star Wars universe. Since it is a licensed production, everything from the visuals and sound effects have a distinct feel. If you enjoyed the original trilogy of Star Wars (episodes IV, V and VI), this game will certainly make you feel nostalgic. The levels are slightly less abstract than Doom, but they are still very well designed and quite complicated, also forcing the player to think by adding various puzzles throughout. Dark Forces has a total of 14 missions and during the course of the game you will see aesthetically different environments.\n\nBesides differences in gameplay and visuals, Dark Forces is also more story-focused than the Doom games. You play as Kyle Katarn, a mercenary recruited by the Rebel Alliance, one that used to work for the Galactic Empire. The plot begins shortly before the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, but gradually takes you past the ending of the film and takes place between A New Hope and Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. It's not masterful storytelling, but the simple plot and visually pleasant cutscenes make the game more engaging.\n\nOverall, the game's numerous mechanical improvements and technological advancements make it a natural successor to Doom 2, adding variety to the Doom gameplay formula. Star Wars: Dark Forces was a brilliant game for its time; since then it has influenced other amazing titles (such as Duke Nukem 3D) and remains a classic.\n\nNOTE: The Steam re-release of this game isn't entirely up to scratch. Upon launching the game, you will experience terrible performance issues (especially when there are multiple enemies on screen). It's nothing that a quick Google search can't fix, but it should be in-game from the get-go.","June 6, 2014","true","10.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Never got past it until now, when I can proudly say I've beaten the game (on Easy, but nonetheless the game has been beaten). It was pretty fun, too.\nThe music's been well remixed in bleeps and bloops, and reacts dynamically to the situation. I played with the game in a window, which I think works better than full-screen - the assets are pretty pixelly, especially for objects far in the distance. Apparently I fought Boba Fett at one point, but I didn't know - he was flying around and I was just trying not to get shot too many times, so I couldn't tell it was him.\nI like how there's no objective marker (though a mini-map would come in handy, and a nicer one than the one that appears if you hit tab or F1) and the levels are kind of maze-like, and yet no matter how lost I am, I always blunder to the objective somehow. One thing that is slightly awkward for targeting is that the X-axis is controlled by the mouse, while the Y-axis is controlled by PgUp and PgDn, making me feel sort of like a mobile turret. Fortunately, auto-aim is a thing and it is a helpful thing.\nProbably not a game that you need with all the modern variety to choose from, but if you like FPS's with Star Wars and a vague sense of plot involved, and you like old-school stuff, check it out. Also if you like Kyle Katarn before he became a weird Jedi, and Jan was super cute. ;)","October 4, 2014","true","24.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/32400/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Star Wars Dark Forces is a FPS set during the events of the original Star Wars movie trilogy. In a nice surprise you don't follow the events of the movies but instead work as a mercenary for the Rebels. You are a mercenary called Kyle Katarn who is fully voice acted and seems to be in it for more than the money. In your travels you will discover that the Empire is working on a secret project to make Dark Troopers and it becomes your main reason for most of the missions. Along your travels you will encounter some familiar characters. Most will only appear in cutscenes and don't show up in game so don't go in expecting to be able to gun down Darth Vader.\n\nYour journeys will take you to a wide variety of environments and nearly each one feels unique and introduce more and more enemies. Most levels are enormous and they will take you quite some time to beat. It's not just running and gunning though, there will be rather difficult puzzles and actual objectives like rescuing a hostage or stealing data and making a run for the spacecraft. It's a nice change from most FPS games of the time where your only goal is to reach the end of the level. As unique and varied as the levels are the actual level design can be very confusing at times. A considerable portion of my playtime comes from being at an utter loss of where I am supposed to head to next and it definitely impacts the game negatively.\n\nStrangely Dark Forces does not allow you to save manually and the game will only save after you complete a level. You start off with three lives and can find more throughout the level though they are usually well hidden. If you see cracks on a wall it is likely you can blow it up and find some goodies. And my biggest gripe with this game is the amount of platforming you will be required to do. The controls do not feel tight enough for platforming and with the lack of quick saving it can truly be irradiating. Luckily the gun-play is top notch and there are a wide variety of weapons to dispose of your enemies. Some do share ammo like the pistol and the blaster which adds more strategy since you will have to decide if the situation is dangerous enough to use more ammo with the blaster. You can also punch out Stormtroopers or other enemies, which is very amusing to me but should be used as a last resort.\n\nIt is very true to it's source material having each gun sound exactly like in the movies, Stormtroopers shouting “Rebel scum!” and most of the music in Dark Forces are from the film but remade into MIDI format. I'm not sure if all the weapons are canon but this game does not feature lightsabers in case you were wondering. The story itself is mediocre and mostly told through cutscenes after or before missions. Most of the voice acting is surprisingly good especially Darth Vader and your character not being a generic mute protagonist is also appreciated. There is a nice sense of urgency as your enemies get more and more powerful as you progress through the story and you will definitely find out why the Rebels are so worried about the Empire's secret project. If you are having difficulty seeing remember that you have have night vision goggles which use up energy that you obtain by blowing up cleaning droids.\n\nThis version of the game has modern controls right out the box. You will be moving around with “wasd” and aiming with the mouse. Strangely you will not be able to look up and down using the mouse. There is no way to see the control scheme or rebind in game which is kind of annoying. Combat is fast paced and enjoyable. Most enemies have different means of attack like either shooting you or running toward you for a melee attack and it is very easy to tell an enemy apart allowing you to adapt and respond to a situation on the fly. A certain enemy in the sewer level stalks you from the sludge and boy, did they creep me out. When you pick up a powerup that doubles your rate of fire the game usually throws a large amount of enemies at you which is always a blast as you mow down all in your path and after all is said and done you will feel like the best darn mercenary money can buy.\n\nOverall Dark Forces is a pretty fun game kept from greatness due to a few serious design decisions. The flaws of having confusing level design, no saving, and controls not suited for the sometimes fatal platforming is just too deadly a combination. It is still a good game don't get me wrong. I had a blast playing through it and seeing Stormtroopers being competent fighters for once.  It is also pretty advanced for it's time featuring voiced cutscenes, level objectives and  an actual story to back it up. It is not a must play for those of us that are not a fan of the films but it's still a decent old school shooter. Though if you like both the FPS genre and Star Wars you should definitely check out this title.","April 22, 2015","true","13.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

When I was a kid I've always been puzzled whether or not I should have played it but, you know, money wasn't mine and my father was very reluctant on spending too much money, we already had DooM and DooM 2, so... But now, with steam sales... MUAHUAHUAHAUHAU...\n\nStar Wars Dark Forces was the first chapter of what later would become the Jedi Knight Saga. It's obviously set in the Star wars universe, around the first trilogy, between Episode IV (Kyle brings the death star plans to Mon Mothma) and VI (Kyle frees Crix Madine who explains the attack plan at the Moon of Endor). Our protagonist Kyle Katarn is a Mercenary hired by Mon Mothma and the Rebellion for various operations against th empire. During a mission Kyle and his partner Jan Ors will meet an odd advanced and deadly robotic trooper, and they will investigate this creation to find out a plan for mass production of these deadly "Dark Troopers".\nSo the game is essentially an FPS, one of the first as this came out after DooM, so the engine and the aspect is quite similar, hence there will be solid ambiences and 2d characters and items. But even though the engine looks pixellous as much as doom there are some very "solid" ad interesting news. There are Moving level parts, and I'm not talking about the classic elevators, but solid bridges or other parts that will slide or rotate according to their purpose. Besides there will be solid objects, or "entities" that will move, such as mechanic assembly arms, Tie Fighters, and that little black imperial Mini4wd that will run around rooms...\nBesides the engine, the weaponry is quite impressive apart from the trooper's iconic blaster (imprecise by default, almost kind of justifying the HORRIBLE Stormtroopers' aim... XD), the Thermal detonator (used by Leia to threaten Jabba The Hutt, but despite the name, here's just a grenade exploding on impact) you can count on a very big arsenal, but the most interesting part are items: especially night vision goggles and the light are the most impressive to me, especially the latter influencing the lighting of the rooms.\nUnfortunately (or luckily) this game is released as the original one running on DosBox. I was almost afraid to face another useless HORRIBLE release as seen with the original DooMs, BUT!!! It runs perfectly, with a good (X-axis only) mouselook integration and WASD movement setting. Unfortunately I wasn't able to find any key binding setup both ingame or in DosBox config (I know, there shouldn't be any, but you know, just in case) so I had to rely on some trial and error. I could have avoided that since there's a steam F.A.Q. with all the keys list and explains how to remap through a DosBox specific function. I also had to manually increase the cycles for the DosBox Emulator because the framerate was too low\nWhat really surprised me is the level design. Apart from the Star Wars aspect, the game gets to the point of pushing you to the limit by forcing you to get to hidden points, shoot to remotely triggered buttons, Make tough jumps and go back and forth in a maze of doors and buttons. It wasn't that nightmare today, but for the time I believe it was a very tough game, I'm sure.\nMusic is made of classic Star Wars themes and original Star Wars oriented tracks... rendered in MIDI, obviously XD. The best part of this is something that was very original at the time: dynamic music. A Slow pace track during exploration and faster more intense tracks smoothly kick during more active and shooting situations. This gives a great effect, because of both the Star Wars nostalgia themes and for the kind of music that perfectly suits the situation.\n\n+++PROs+++ STAR WARS. Enemies, weapons, ambience and music, not to mention the cinematics. Elements that simply kicks you back in the Star wars universe, not to mention all the various references.\nTOUGH. The latest levels are quite a maze and count a lot on hidden passages, or buttons, or small but complicate riddles to let you proceed with the level.\nINNOVATIONS. Even though the game is based on Star Wars universe, the engine is a classic FPS in DooM style, it still shows some innovations with solid platforms moving, sliding and rotating or even few 3d models animated and moving in the levels.---CONs--- NO SAVE. Unfortunately missions are quite long and you can't save your progress while you're at it, so you'll have to face every mission entirely from start to end without any chance to save. You also have a set of lives, for which I still don't see the point. At least at the end of each mission the progress is saved...\nCPU CYCLES.

This is just heresay on my part, I'm not a videogame historian.\n\nThe level design is fairly nonlinear and encourages plenty of exploration, but personally I found that the inability to look up and down (more than about 45 degrees either way, with really weird visual distortions) left me having only a vague idea that a floor was beneath my feet, which was incredibly disorienting and left me playing through most of the game with the transparent map screen plastered to my face (though I'll admit I found the way the map dynamically updated based on purely literal line of sight weirdly enthralling).\n\nLike many FPSes, or indeed games of this age in general, the bosses ammount to little more than a single enemy that is both better at killing you and worse at dying. Can't really dock points there, it's not like you can expect elaborate boss mechanics in a game that slightly predates the notion of having to actually aim your gun at things.\n\nWhile I still had enough fun to give this game a recommendation, do NOT try playing it without a walkthrough on hand. Many of the puzzles involve a sort of sideways moon logic that I never would have figured out on my own, even if I could fnavigate without staring at the map during firefights.","January 27, 2015","true","19.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

While playing it today may seem borderline impossible because of it's age Dark Forces pioneered many concepts that have become staple in FPS games today such as multiple height levels, looking up and down and flying enemies. Vertical gameplay in general was a massive feature.\n\nBooting the game up today does show it's age, and while it was a great game for it's time playing it nowadays is not really an option.\n\nA great game and one that deserves a lot of credit and recognition but also one that's not worth the play anymore in this age of technology.","November 7, 2012","true","24.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

From stealing the Death Star plans to escaping Jabba the Hutt's sail barge, the game throws you into maps, and gives you goals.\n\nUnlike Doom, you don't just find the exit. You actually have objectives to do, and if you fail those objectives, you lose the level.\n\nThe voice acting is quite good for the time, the gameplay and maps are all great, and the game proved that LucasArts could craft amazing story lines with it's own universe.

This game is similar to Doom 2, where the levels are fairly linear, finding keys to locked doors is a necessity, and there are several mini bosses that you will encounter. I personally am not too much of a graphics freak so the pixels do not bother me, but that should not turn anyone away from this gem of a game. I bought this game during one of the sales (Summer/Autumn/Winter) at around $2. While the replay value is very low as there are a set number of missions with no achievements or multiple endings, you will get your $2 back and more. Pass on the coffee or candy bar and do not miss the rare chance to be able to punch a Kell Dragon in the face.\n\n*The game requires DosBox however, with the Steam download, everything will be set up for you to enjoy as soon as the game is downloaded.\n\nStory/Characters:\n\nYou follow Kyle Katarn before his Jedi days as a Rebel mercenary. In my opinion, the story is a tad on the darker side when it comes to Star Wars. The basic premise is that you are the hero as you try to defeat the Empire with their new Dark Trooper project.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is very straightforward as you clear levels by going to the end/objective. There are no Force powers, lightsabers, or Jedi. Point and shoot at baddies shooting back at you. Thankfully, there are no escort missions.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game is from the 90's.\n\nSound/Music:\n\nEnemies will grunt and scream/squeal as they are shot/blown apart/punched to death. Music is always superb from John Williams, although after a while, the music for the missions will continue to loop.\n\nControls:\n\nBy today's standards, in my opinion, the controls are not so good. You will have to use the arrow keys to move and with the mouse, you can only look left or right. To look up or down, you are forced to use the Home and End keys. There is a fix for this however, in the form of a file called "Glovepie" which allows you to use your mouse to look in all directions.\n\nReplay value:\n\nThere is little to no replay value as there are no achievements. I suppose if you want to run through the game by changing the difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) you could play three times or start a playthrough with only fists.\n\nOnline:\n\nNone.\n\n---\n\n***If there are any mistakes to the facts pertaining to the game, please let me know. Also, if you have further questions not covered by the review, or if something were unclear, I will try to clarify as best as possible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nurgle523/recommended/32400/","Nurgle523","Nurgle523","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nurgle523/","541 products in account","This game is amazing. I want it to be clear: while I heard about it in elementary school [Year 3 schooling] I did not play nor see the gameplay at all. I have no nostalgia whatsoever. The closest is DOOM which I only now know is similar. I actually did not find DOOM compelling but I saw DOOM for the good game it is, that is another story.\n\nMy review therefore is absolutely uncolored by nostalgia of childhood or any other sort.\n\nThis game is an absolute amazing shooter that stands the test of time! I started it up only because it was a fast download to play while the other downloads got done.\n\nNext thing I know I am totally and utterly entranced by the amazing enemy and weapon graphics, the levels are beautiful for the time but wall textures are slightly "meh". They are the worst part for me, which means the game is great, and the walls are still not that bad.\n\nThe sound and cutscenes are great! I thought they'd be a laugh, in fact, I didn't think the game would play let alone be so easy for me to start up and blast my way through enemies without modding or any BS. This is truly a gem, I regret not playing it sooner, but if I have I could not write such a straight and honest review without suspect nostalgia creeping in.\n\nThe story so far is unique and most characters are too. It's not out of its element either, it sticks to a "FPS therefore FPS managable story". What I mean, is while the grand story of Star Wars is definitely here, it holds its own. It does NOT RELY on the Star Wars story [Of course the lore is huge in it but on its own.]\n\nI honestly cannot recommend this game enough. 10/10, would not regret going back in time and begging parents to buy it for me. Absolute full score here. My only worry is how it's ruining the fact that Star Wars games have now been shown to have been so compelling in the past, at least this one, and slowly broken down.\n\nAgain, 10/10. First time playing as of a little bit before writing this. Not colored by rosy nostalgia. Absolute dream in the style of DOOM, except Star Wars.

It's really fun pew-pewing half the stormtroopers in the Empire, at least.\n\nLike most of its contempraries, this game was groundbreaking; in DF's case it gave people in the mid-1990s the feeling of being in a Star Wars movie (that wasn't a prequel: those would come out a couple years later). Unlike most of its contemporaries, it accomplished this partly by putting actual effort into telling a story. Nothing amazing, but it's good enough to keep you playing and find out what that rascally Darth Vader is up to next.\n\nThe DosBOX port is actually good as long as you edit the configuration file to double the allotted CPU cycles - it runs like a turtle uphill otherwise. There's a checkpoint system to make up for the lack of saving in the levels, which can get rather labyrinthine, so keep that in mind. The game still isn't quite as hard or long as the old DOOM could get, especially since Kyle Katarn here punches like a literal champ.\n\nAs an aside, this was the only Dark Forces game I was interested in, due to its similarity to the old Doom formula (the engine is very similar to Duke Nukem 3D's Build) and because I'm not that interested in being a magical overpowered Jedi.","April 17","true","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

A great raycasting game.\n\nFirst and formost, if you cannot code or configure your dosbox controls, you're gonna have a bade time.  If you do not know what dos box is, you're going to be unhappy with this game.\n\nThat said, this is a very old game with very old design choices. You are going to have to put yourself in the mindset of the mid 90's gamer and computer user to enjoy this game.\n\nThat said, its a blast to play.  There is a quality aesthetic to this game that was quite consistent in the rest of the Katarn games that made me enjoy it very much.  The Lucas-verse felt like a place, somewhere you were in, rather than just another level.  Sewer monsters, Gamorran guards, thermal detonators, blaster rifles, everything felt on point.'\n\nThat said, the only issues I have with it from a gaming perspective is that there is no save system, so you're going to wind up memorizing much of the levels to get through them healthy and in one piece.  The back half missions have boss battles that ....aren't bad, but aren't great as well.  The Corescant mission felt like I was fighting the AI more than anything.  The fuel depot mission was similarly confusing in that exactly how you were to accomplish the objectives was a pain that look my lateral thinking ability to solve.\n\nBut all in all, this was a fun game, I enjoyed blasting imperials.\n\nIf Disney were to put a new FPS out, I'd only ask for something between this and Dark Forces 2, but minus a certain type of weapon near the end.\n\nBut seriously, learn to configure your dosbox setting so you can have a proper resolution and control setup.","May 27","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/32400/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","For starters I will be playing this via DOSBox.  Because unless you have an old Compaq Presario 5528 with Windows 95 on it sitting in the closet, you will too.  Which means, that since DOSBox is pretty much a requirment to play the game, I’ll be including it in the aspects of the review.\n\nAs I have said before, and I’m sure, will say many times again.  I wont ever down an old game for its graphics.  If the game had bad or poor graphics, in relation to competition at the time of it’s release, I might.  But so long as things are at least par for its time, I wont argue it.\n\n\n\nDOS Box is a neat little program that allows older DOS programs to run in the Windows environment.  It’s noting too fancy in that regard, but it does allow for a complete control customizing, something Dark Forces would otherwise be without.\n\nDark Forces graphics are great for its time, and a strain for the eyes now.  This is one of those games that I don’t expect a lot of people to go run out and play.  If you’ve been playing Battlefront II all weekend and then try to play Dark Forces.  Well, its gonna suck, plain and simple.  Especially if you’ve never played it before.  But again, this isn’t me saying this is a bad game, just uncontrollably dated graphics.\n\nThe story is excellent, giving the means to tell it.  There is the backstory, that unfortunately is not with the Steam version since it was in the original game manual.  But with a quick Google search can be found easily.  The meat of the story is told in short cutscenes and the mission briefings.  With the occasional comments from Kyle Katarn as you play.\n\nI would absolutely love to see someone remake this game.  Using a modern engine, or ever just a less dated one.  Yea, it was tried, but that project was recently canceled.  It does strike me as odd though.  With Dark Forces being a landmark game.  For all gamers, not just the Star Wars nerds.  It seems like someone should have done this, and done it fully some time ago.  This is what people want.  If it could have been done with Doom, it can be done with Dark Forces!\n\nThe level design is better than I expected.  It doesn’t follow that flat maze and corridor style I was expecting it to have.  Perhaps I’m thinking too much about Wolfenstein 3D?  There are places that could use improvement, but then when isn’t there?  And they make great use of the multiple floors, remember that was a big deal when this game came out.  So of course, there are stairs everywhere.\n\nDark Forces is one of those games where you can take your time and take in the sites or just run for it.  Either way you play it you get pretty much the same experience.  A sit down with it, will show what gaming was like ten plus years ago.  You wont be blown away by anything by any means, but you might gain a little more admiration for the old school.\n\nAn excellent game for what it is, but unfortunately, doesn't hold up well to modern standards.  Which to be honest was completely expected.","May 16, 2013","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you were playing games back in 1995 you most definitely know about this first person shooter and you are probably wondering why I am writing about it in 2015? Honestly, the game was included in a recent game bundle and I decided to check out how well did it age. You know, some games may be awesome at the time they were released, but as the time passes and games evolve, some of those old favorites end up being very bad. And we wonder how come we loved them so much back then and now they seem like games we'd never play for more than 15 minutes. Anyway, before I move on I want you to know that I didn't really like this game even when it was first released. Just as I didn't like Doom, a game that Dark Forces was too often compared to. I didn't dislike it either, I just thought it was an average Star Wars game and an average FPS and it was well accepted just because it was set in Star Wars universe.\n\nSo, how well did it age? Not good. First of all, you need a DOS emulator (DOSBox) to run it on a modern computer, but if you are using a Steam version of Dark Forces you don't have to worry about it as Steam was nice enough to set up DOSBox for you. The resolution is extremely low (640x400) and everything is very pixelated. There's another solution for this (and more) called DarkXL. DarkXL allows you to play Dark Forces even in full HD (1920x1080) resolution and/or in a window (as I prefer it). It doesn't just stretch the pixels as you may have thought, it really has new game textures and makes everything look a lot nicer. Don't expect wonders though, the graphics are still more or less the same, it just looks a lot more polished.\n\nBy default, you use mouse only to look left and right and if you want to look up and down, and more importantly shoot enemies who are above or below you, you need to use PageUp and PageDown buttons on the keyboard. Actually, the game will usually shoot up and down automatically if you line up the reticle with the enemy, but it's extremely frustrating and unforgiving at times. DarkXL fixes this as well as it allows you to use fully use mouse and view your surroundings. Trust me, this helps a LOT and not only with shooting the imperial scum, but also with switches and doors.\n\nHowever, DarkXL is incomplete and will probably remain so. There are certain bugs that have been reported and the most important are present in the very last level. You will be unable to complete the game with these bugs (you will have to cheat to advance and to give you a hint: hold G to move through walls) and it's a real shame. Especially since regular save game file is incompatible with DarkXL save game file, meaning you cannot just switch back to normal game and complete what's left regularly. Another annoying bug (or a missing feature?) is lack of weapons. If you play through the game using DarkXL you will be unable to pick up the strongest 2-3 weapons for a reason unknown to me. You can use another cheat to unlock and equip those weapons though, so it's a minor issue at the end.\n\nNow that you know how you can enjoy the game better using DarkXL, lets get back to the game itself. The story is mostly unimportant: you are Kyle Katarn, a mercenary who works for Rebel Alliance. You are being sent on a series of missions to find out about the latest Imperial project and ultimately destroy it. An army of Storm troopers, Imperial commanders and commandos, droids and other aliens will stand in your way as you progress through 14 levels consisting of mining facilities, space stations, cities and other environments. The levels are average in size, have no respawning enemies and will take an average of 30 minutes to complete (more if you play on hard since you have to be more careful). Most levels will require you to find switches, cards or buttons to open up certain doors in order to advance. However, I hated that part a lot. Why? Simply because you will often run into a switch or a lever, use it and... wonder what actually happened? The levels are not linear and you can wander around as much as you want, and as good as that is it confuses you because you are not sure what did that switch do. There is no "objective pointer" to tell you where to go (this is a 1995 game after all) and it's especially frustrating in missions where you have to go back to your ship after you complete the mission. I walked around for more than 20 minutes on one mission, looking for the starting point in order to complete the level. Frustrating! I tried using the in-game map as well, but since you can go up and down in elevators, the map adjusts and doesn't really help at all. Ah yes, you cannot save your progress during the mission - it is auto-saved after each complete mission so don't expect to load the game and see where something is before returning to your "real" save.\n\nAt the end I played through Dark Forces' 14 levels using DarkXL and it didn't feel rewarding at the end. The game is not hard, the story is nothing special and there's no special "accomplishing" feel once you are done. Again, I never liked Dark Forces much and I played through it some 15 years ago just because I loved its sequels, but that's an entirely different story. I didn't rate the game as I usually do because... it's just not easy to rate a 20 years old game, especially since it really did not "age" well.\n\nHave fun!","February 12, 2015","true","16.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was overshadowed by Doom, in fact when someone looked at this game they said "Doom Clone" but honestly this game improves on doom in every way. The maps actually look like real locations in the Star Wars Galaxy. The guns are all useful (But the most handy being your trusty E-11 blaster rifle) and have different effects, the concusion rifle creates huge plasma explosions the E-11 is the automatic rifle and the bryar pistol is well your pistol. This game is probably better than most modern day video games as it suceeds in several things, environment, Gameplay witch has been touched up since doom and etc. Of course this game requires DOS as it is from the computer stone age, But since steam is so nice its got that fixed for you.\n\nI give this game a 9.3/10 as it suceeds in so many, improving upon other FPS's gameplay that was released at the time and much, much more.

For one the screen is really small and that makes it difficult to see anything. I'm sure there's some sort of way to fix that but it runs on DOSbox so everything is a mystery. It's by no means a bad game but because it's just the original game running on a DOS emulator you're going to get a-lot of issues that come along with it.\n\nCons-\n\non bigger PC screens DOS Box is a nightmare and you will have issues seeing the screen properly. Good luck trying to get it to launch in full screen.\n\nIt feels sluggish even with the mouse sensitivity all the way up\n\nwhen you turn the sensitivity up it makes navagating the menus a nightmare\n\n\nPros\n\nIt's a star wars game\n\nit's a first person shooter similar to doom\n\ntons of great weapons\n\ngood cut scenes\n\ngreat action\n\nOn the whole for it's cheap price I can sort of recommend this game but it's going to take a-lot of tweeking with DOS box to get running to anyone's liking, If anything the game just needs some fans to give it some modernized love. mouse look and the ability to get rid of DOSBOX and have this run on another client. I'm unaware as of now if there is a fan project like that but if one ever crops up it'll make the game a-lot more enjoyable.","January 4","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's funny how subsequent Star Wars games couldn't make this as authentic, despite having all kinds of technological advantages.\n\nGameplay is very simple but still satisfying as hell. First few missions are little boring but then it gets better and better. My personal favorite is the one on Nar Shaddaa. The final mission was awesome too - very challenging and intense.\n\nThe graphics here are basically huge flickering pixels all over the screen. I've never had any serious issues with dated visuals but still I got to get used to these graphics for some time (it's been a while since I've played something that old). Even had a minor headache for the first 30-40 minutes - you got to strain your eyes sometimes because at first you can't even tell what's ahead of you in pixels. But once you get used to it, it feels totally fine. I must say, I still like this look better than early polygonal games which look unspeakably ugly.\n\nThe plot here is also really simple, but at least it's not something like Battle of Hoth or Death Star assault for the 100th time, it's its own thing. Yeah, back in pre-Disney Star Wars era we used to think it was Kyle Katarn, not the chick from The Theory of Everything, who stole the plans of Death Star and handed them to Leia.\nI liked all that Dark Trooper Project thing. It's nothing that great, but it fits the universe and works fine for a little spin-off story.\n\nDefinitely try this if you're into Star Wars (and Doom) and not scared of 1995 graphics and archaic controls. Still entertaining.","May 17","true","18.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","This is one game I am glad I accidently stumbled across. The Dark Forces/Jedi Knight is the beginning of one of the most enjoyable SW series of games available on PC, and its roots are still worth looking into.\n\nThe Canon Solution: Ignition Start, Soar Elsewhere Unexplored\nWe all are aware of the recent trend of SW games being tied to the SW canon. A lot of these games, as a result, feel worthless in their stories as we all know what happens whether or not we play the game. It also has the unfortunate side-effect of making the player ask, "So? Why should I care?" about these spin-off stories that don't do anything different.\n\nDark Forces only brings the canon to give context (time and place) at the start, then lets the story go on its own territory with its own cast of characters.\n\nThe first mission is to steal the Death Star plans (Ep 4).  After that introduction, the game leaves the canon behind for Kyle's Kataran's story. You are on a mission to stop a mysterious project for the Empire called Dark Troopers. The plot is bare-bones, but the character progression fits the SW universe.\n\nKyle Kataran, a combination of all the lovable qualities of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. He was once an Imperial Officer. As you learn throughout the game, he went rogue and performs duties with the Rebel Alliance--for a certain price, of course, or sometimes out of his own generosity.\n\nKyle is a simple character, but he becomes more interesting in later games (not simply for being a Jedi). For an introduction to Kyle Katarn, it's interesting to see how a non-Jedi character can play a vital role in the rebellion from the Empire, especially for the Doom-esque genre.\n\nNot only are the characters memorable, the atmosphere in this game is perfect. Sometimes dark and claustrophobic, other times laybrinthlike and open to exploration (and there is a lot! I never found all the secrets in any of the stages).\n\nWhile there isn't a complex story-arc, the story is servicable to add some depth. I only find this interesting as this was always something lacking for me whenever I play Doom or Duke Nukem 3D.\n\nAim Somewhere Between Doom and Duke Nukem 3D\nThe controls are top-notch despite being a Doom clone with no free-aiming. The only issue, which you don't have to use often because of auto-aiming, is tilting the screen up with the Page DOWN key and tilt the screen down with Page UP key. (Who programed this nonsense?)\n\nIn missions 3 - 6 there were some pretty cryptic nonsense that will aggrivate you, but the later puzzles are beatable with enough perception--I liked the puzzle on the Imperial City that I figured out alone. Enemies are nicely varied, there are tons of weapons that feel, mostly, different and the maps are HUGE.\n\nBosses, like most FPSs, are pretty lackluster and just require you to spam your heaviest weapons and to dodge their attacks. They are somewhat specatular or given some context to make them feel more threatening than other enemies.\n\nLevels consist of completing certain objectives and either returning to the LZ at the start, which can be tricky to find for some levels, or heading for some exit. The only level I despised for its maze-like quality is the Prison level, but the others feel expansive enough and meaty to serve for enough gameplay.\n\nThere are some other old-fashioned quirks that you have to adjust to in order to enjoy this game. Besides the resolution and sprite-work which, for the most part, looks great when up-close but a pixely mess from afar.\n\nThe first is the "lives" system. Die several times, you lose the mission and you have to start over. You cannot quicksave mid-mission (only after it). The lives system reminds me an awful like Rise of the Triad as you can earn more through finding tokens or you can earn a 1-up with enough points. And similar to RotT, there are SOME platforming sections. Nowhere near the amount of platform issues as with RotT; they just feel out of place for the game. Lastly, some guns share ammo, so be wary of using the same ammo type.\n\nThis is no push-over of a game. The difficulty doesn't feel as difficult as NIGHTMARE mode on Doom, but I remember toning it down on the later levels because of how often I got lost or frustrated because of the lives' system. I don't think the difficulty should be a concern of yours unless you've never played a Doom-like game before.\n\nOnly The Beginning...\nAs the start of a well-loved series, this game is a classic mired by problems within the FPSs of the time. Sure, it doesn't do anything new, gameplay wise, but what it does it does well along with the treatment of the SW lore done right. These qualities make it a worthy game as the gameplay works and the story keeps you engaged to play more.\n\nYou will feel like you are a flickering flame of rebellion fighting an oppresive threat that has its hold on the Galaxy. With each new challenge you must adapt to new enemies and locales. And in the end you don't defeat the Empire; you make it aware that its ending reign is on the horizon.\n\nHow can you not love this true-to-heart Star Wars game?\n\nUnless you're a hipster.","October 8, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was the first thing I bought with my first paycheck when I turned 16 that year.  I love star wars, and I love doom.  Except this game had a better plot, cutscenes to support it, and some nifty tricks like jumping, crouching, and looking up and down.  Due to the last of those, the level design is genius!  You really have to explore, as keys are often hidden in little side areas rather than be guarded by groups of MOBs.  Back then it looked amazing, although 20 years later not as much.  Although, the graphics are really not all that necessary, as those mid 90's FPS's are all about gameplay and level design.  I miss this.  I cannot stand FPS games where basic enemies are bullet sponges.  I get bored if I have to put 8 or more rounds in every basic enemy.  These games are more "realistic" in the fact that you can clear the guards out of an area to perform your espionage, with a few well placed blaster rounds.  Only droids and hearty aliens like Gamorreans.  You may even get to punch a Kell Dragon to death ;).\n\nThe introduction of Kyle Katarn and the whole Jedi Knight series does not play like the followups.  He is not a jedi, and you get no lightsaber.  However, at this time period in Star Wars lore, the amount of Jedi is down to a couple tops, including a couple geriatrics and a 19 year old kid.  Getting to play a part in the rebellion to help dismantle the Empire is pretty cool for any Star Wars fan, and the gameplay will satisfy any retro FPS fan.\n\nI do recommend looking into the XL engine.  It is a free fan made sourceport, currently in alpha.  It runs the game pretty well, and makes it much easier on a modern gamer.  Full mouselook, right click to use, and an overall refresh of the graphics.  Just textures, no new models or anything, but since the Jedi engine is not released, the guy had to build a new engine.","February 9, 2015","true","19.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main character is a badass who works as a Merc for the Rebellion. Due to this flexibility, he isn't a main part of the alliance, but he certainly perfers it then working for the empire.\n\nThe story to this game is you play as this character during the events of Star Wars Episode IV, and V I believe, it has been a while since I completed this game. The first mission involves you doing something none of the other Rebel Infiltraitor's had done, retrieve the blueprints to the death star. As any Star Wars fan knows, the plans are what revealed a weak point in the Death Star's defences and the leader even mentioned how they lost many men attempting to get that information.\n\nYou are then called in because a Rebel base when silent from an attack, but this was no ordinary attack as the entire base was taken out and if it was a army, they would've seen it coming and evacuated or atleast shot many of them down before going into hiding. It's then revealed that one of the most interesting enemies of the Star Wars franchile is created here. The Dark Troopers. Commando Troopers that are far more powerful and destructive than you're average trooper as they can take out entire complexs by themselves.\n\nMany weapons you get are references to the ones from the film such as blaster pistol, blaster rifle, Thermal Detonator and quite a few interesting and creative weapon designs.\n\nIt's well worth a play if you can get a hang of the controls and remember how Lucas Arts used to make years ago as this was during the age they made adventure games and before they went lax and started making half-♥♥♥♥♥ games.","January 29, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I recommend getting this on sale though because I don't think 6 dollars is worth it for a older and buggier game but non the less a good game.\n\nP.S. THE GAME IS FROM 1995!

It’s not because of technical issues or my hate of the game, I actually quite like it, but since I played it before, I’ve decided to play it on hard this time around and it revealed a couple of issues this game gained by aging very, very poorly. First off, the controls. The look up and down buttons are mapped somewhere to the numpad and thus every instance of looking up or down turns into an ordeal. It’s especially annoying when an enemy surprises you by standing on a heightened platform or straight under you, because you learn about it the painful way and before you can react accordingly by adjusting the view, your shield is dropping like vases in cartoons. There’s no in-game ability to remap the keys either. What’s more surprising – no mid-level saves, so screw up right before the end and prepare to rage quit. Now before you think of me as some amateur noob, let me assure you that that’s a thing that crossed my mind as well. But there’s challenging and then there’s straight broken ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. So if there is a turret placed on the ceiling of a maintenance tunnel/ventilation duct, doesn’t make a warning sound and is able to blast your bum from here to Tatooine with spotless accuracy, that’s just bad game design. When a mine blows my jacket straight off, because the only warning of its position behind a crate is a short beeping sound signaling that I just entered a domain of pain, I would enjoy at least a single checkpoint. This game is not a Doom clone, despite looking like one. It’s packed with ambitious innovation, which is alas very poorly implemented. And if you turn the difficulty up in Doom, that game at least has the decency to lift you off the tracks after shoving you under a train. This game, on the other hand, will shoot your kneecaps as soon as you scramble back onto your feet. And if you don’t plan on playing this game on hard, or conversely at least don’t mind putting your face to a cheese grater, then you may just enjoy this old fossil.","August 2, 2015","false","13.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

It's a great fast paced shooter with no hand holding, and has some great improvements over DOOM story and gameplay wise. The story is pretty straightforward; you're a bounty hunter for the rebels, tasked to go on a variety of missions (Such as retrieving Death Star plans). Shortly after the Death Star's explosion, the Empire has unleashed a new threat on the galaxy; Dark Troopers. The story will have you enrgossed through its dry wit and dark humor, while still keeping the Star Wars vibe.\n\nMust play for any Star Wars fan","May 2, 2014","true","333.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

This game serves as a prime example of many elements in games that developers had yet to smooth out (and no, I don't just mean that its old; there are problems with more than the limits of the days technology). As soon as the implementation of mines starts this game moves from possibly difficult to punishing and you will find that you have to remember things about the levels and replay them to move on with the story.

Obviously, by today's standards, this is a terrible game. But you also have to take into consideration that it was made in 1995. So it certinly wasn't going to be great. So, I'm going to write about some of the good and bad things about this game, I only gave it a negative review because i enjoyed many games made in the 90's. This game, however, is not one of them.\nThe only reason I bought this game was because of how much I loved Dark Forces II, So i figured I would enjoy this game just as much. But they're both completely different games.\nFirst off: You will get lost VERY easily. There's never any clear indication as to where you're supposed to go. You do have a map but that really doesn't help. So you'll spend the majority of each level wandering around and going a bunch of places that don't lead anywhere. The game is also pretty easy combat wise. You'll almost never die, (although, i did only play the game in medium difficuilty) All you'll do is see something move and just hold down the left mouse button until he dies in one or two shots. It;s also a bit confusing at first. When i had completed all my objectives it didn't take me to the next level. Confused, i just wandered around for awhile figuring i had to find an exit. After awhile, i got a message saying i had to pause the game and click next mission. This was more than likely my fault i'll admit. It probably sent me that message as soon as i finished all my objectives when i wasn't paying attention. But it's still odd and confusing.\nIt actually has a pretty good atmosphere. At one point it was even pretty creepy. During the second level you have to go down this water drain and you'll end up in this really dark room in waist high sewage water. After i walked around for awhile i heard a sort of growl. It actually creeped me out quite a bit. As i continued i heard more growls but i still couldn't see anything. Until, finally, i ran smack dab into this octopus looking creature that emerged from the water my immediate response was to hold down my fire button until it died. It was actually quite jarring.\nAll-In-All, It wasn't a horrible game, it's just not a game for most people. If you like games like DOOM then you'll probably enjoy this game. But, if you're just a fan of Star Wars or just saw this and it looked interesting. I would suggest not buying it.\n\n\n","May 3, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","4","18","0","0"

You're thinking "That's great then! What's the problem then?". Well, a lot actually...\n\nThe story starts off with a defect from the sith empire stealing the death star plans for the Rebel alliance, setting itself up for what starts off tieing in to Episode IV: A New Hope, but then goes off in it's own direction, including Dark Troopers as the Siths new method of ruling the galaxy, and you, the defect, have to stop them. Nice idea for a story, but the dialogue is so corny it's difficult to take seriously.\n\nThe core gameplay is Doom in a nutshell. Running around what are pretty much mazes, blasting stormtroopers that can hit something and occasionally collecting keys to open doors you found earlier that you couldn't open, with the occasional mediocre puzzle thrown in... and that's pretty much it. Backtracking is far too common in this game, which is a let down, and the platforming... Don't get me started on how bad that was...\n\nThe sound effects that we all know and love from Star Wars are there (no Wilhelm Scream though...) and the music we all know and love is there as well, including the music played during the Death Star attack from Episode IV.\n\nOne final note: Why did I have to look online for the controls to this game? Why wasn't there an option to access the controls ANYWHERE in the game? It would have helped me out in the first 4 or 5 missions. Playing around with the Gamma Correction in the options menu and shooting was not what I wanted to do to navigate dark areas thanks.\n\nIt's by no means the worst Star Wars game, but it's definitely not the best. However, it was definitely a bad start for the Jedi Knight series and not worth your time, unless you're a diehard Star Wars fan.","January 4, 2014","false","2.9"," 13 of 42 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","13","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/32400/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","Yes, this game is dated.  Yes, the controls are "weird".  Yes, the maps are confusing.  That said, for those of us who were fortunate to grow up in a day and age where this stuff was cutting edge, and weren't spoiled by games that assumed we were stupid and needed puzzles solved for us, this game still holds up as an awesome testiment to FPS history.\n\nNoted as being "Doom with Star Wars Graphics", Dark Forces took gaming to the next level.  The voice acting was simply superb for the day, as was the cutscene detail.  We were drawn into the galaxy of Star Wars and told a story that closely ties to the origional movie trilogy (before Jar Jar).  You were made to feel as though you had a part in those movies, without actually being thrown into them.  This great story would be continued in Dark Forces II, but we're not here to talk about that.\n\nFor nostalgia purposes this game brings us back to a time when gaming was still searching for it's niche.  it's a time when "WASD" wasn't yet tied to a mouse as the "accepted" way to control a character.  You had to have both hands on the keyboard and learn how to multi-task your fingers, a skill that the youth these days would probably find confusing and too complicated.\n\nLevel design in Dark Forces, easily the biggest complaint against the game, was very well done in my opinion.  Every part of the map is used in some way.  It's either a place to pick up more shields and ammo, or has a switch, or has an item you need, or has a secret you've yet to uncover.  There is no wasted space, and it's up to you to figure out what to do with it.  Sure, you can run around a map for 15 minutes trying to figure out the next step.  For those who are used to today's games leading them around by the hand it can be a little frustrating.  For those of us who grew up with these games, solving the challenge can be quite rewarding and we wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nDark Forces was designed back in 1995, where the standard was DOS based gaming.  That said, in order for this game to function it's packed seamlessly with DOSBox.  I, personally, have never had a problem with games that are bundled in this manor.  The game is a perfectly emulated version of it's former glory.  There isn't any configuring required, unless you're one of those stubborn control freaks who needs everything to operate THEIR way.\n\nThe only hick-up I ran into was remembering that at the end of each level, when your mission is complete, you have to hit ESC in order to move on to the next level.  That information was included in the origional guide (as I recall), and will eventually pop-up in the game if you spend a long time waiting for the level to end by itself.  It's a minor issue that's resolved at the end of the first mission, and as such doesn't change my recommnedation.\n\nIf you've been spoiled by the high-end graphics and hand-holding of today's games then by all means avoid this title because it's not for you.  If you, like me, grew up with games like Doom, Heretic, Hexen, Decent, and Duke Nukem 3D then this is a MUST HAVE due to it's awesome storyline and great nostalgic value.  Its a testiment to early gaming and definately worth every penny.","February 4, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was one of the first video games I ever played growing up in the mid to late nineties, and it has aged like fine cheese: pungent and stinky but delicious none the less. To those who actually remember the pre-sequel Star Wars era, this game does positiviely EVERYTHING right. The guns, the enemies, the locations, and of course the characters, are all done in a manner that is faithful to the Star Wars lore. When playing this game for the first time, everything feels new yet strangely familiar, which is EXACTLY how a Star Wars game should feel. You feel like you've heard the story before, but the manner in which it is being presented this time is unique and interesting. Atmospherically, this might just be one of the greatest examples of allowing level/character set the tone. Shiny Imperial starships feature well organized corridors patrolled by brisk, professional soldiers while filthy sewers are populated by dirty, grubby looking baddies with outfits that look like they've been cobbled together from trash and scrap.\n\nGameplay wise, the controls aren't as tight as they could be, only highlighting the fact that the platforming in this game is clunky at best. The story is no where near as long as it should be, and features only twelve missions. Despite its length, the story does do a good job of pulling you in and engaging you, even if it is a little corny even by Star Wars standards. The difficulty level is right about perfect, however. It is challenging without being impossible, yet simple enough that you rarely feel frustrated by it. That being said, the missions can feel a little bit confusing at times and you will occassionally feel like you don't know what you're supposed to do. Finally, the game's visuals haven't aged well and definately don't hold up to the standards that gamers expect out of a modern FPS. In all fairness, Datk Forces was on the cutting edge graphics-wise in 1995, and could look a lot worse. Its outdated graphical look adds a nostalgia factor to the game and give it an endearing quality that few retro indie games can match.\n\nAll in all, Star Wars: Dark Forces is most definately worth a play through. Whether you're a hardcore Star Wars fan or a gamer looking to play older games for the nostalgia factor, Dark Forces will scratch your itch and scratch it good. I would even recommend this game to any potential developers out there as a good lesson in atmospheric design. A true classic and an undeniable gem in Lucasart's crown.","December 25, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ultimatley Dark Forces is an expansion of the Star Wars Universe, while the story isn't quite on the level of mass effect, it's interesting enough to keep you invested in both Kyle and Jan, with some exciting cameo's thrown into the mix.\n\n8/10\n\n\n","December 7, 2014","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was one of the first video games I ever played growing up in the mid to late nineties, and it has aged like fine cheese: pungent and stinky but delicious none the less. To those who actually remember the pre-sequel Star Wars era, this game does positiviely EVERYTHING right. The guns, the enemies, the locations, and of course the characters, are all done in a manner that is faithful to the Star Wars lore. When playing this game for the first time, everything feels new yet strangely familiar, which is EXACTLY how a Star Wars game should feel. You feel like you've heard the story before, but the manner in which it is being presented this time is unique and interesting. Atmospherically, this might just be one of the greatest examples of allowing level/character set the tone. Shiny Imperial starships feature well organized corridors patrolled by brisk, professional soldiers while filthy sewers are populated by dirty, grubby looking baddies with outfits that look like they've been cobbled together from trash and scrap.\n\nGameplay wise, the controls aren't as tight as they could be, only highlighting the fact that the platforming in this game is clunky at best. The story is no where near as long as it should be, and features only twelve missions. Despite its length, the story does do a good job of pulling you in and engaging you, even if it is a little corny even by Star Wars standards. The difficulty level is right about perfect, however. It is challenging without being impossible, yet simple enough that you rarely feel frustrated by it. That being said, the missions can feel a little bit confusing at times and you will occassionally feel like you don't know what you're supposed to do. Finally, the game's visuals haven't aged well and definately don't hold up to the standards that gamers expect out of a modern FPS. In all fairness, Datk Forces was on the cutting edge graphics-wise in 1995, and could look a lot worse. Its outdated graphical look adds a nostalgia factor to the game and give it an endearing quality that few retro indie games can match.\n\nAll in all, Star Wars: Dark Forces is most definately worth a play through. Whether you're a hardcore Star Wars fan or a gamer looking to play older games for the nostalgia factor, Dark Forces will scratch your itch and scratch it good. I would even recommend this game to any potential developers out there as a good lesson in atmospheric design. A true classic and an undeniable gem in Lucasart's crown.","December 25, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can see that with your eyes. That's what they're for. Both the eyes, and the grpahics.\n\nThe missions still feel like missions. You're dropped off, you have objectives, then more often than not you have to return to your drop-zone for a pick-up. Occasionally the levels feel a little bit 'designed', but for the most part you can suspend disbelief and get into being on locale in the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe story still makes sense in the greater scope of The Original Trilogy. You first mission is to retrieve the plans for the first Death Star (putting it shortly before the beginning of Episode IV), and then the rest seems to take place between episodes IV and V. I'm not certain about that. At the time of writing I'm about 5 or 6 levels in, and I can't remember all the details of the rest of the story.\n\nThe gameplay still works really well. This game was a turning point for first person shooters. There are a lot of things that we take as given these days that started (or at the very least were popularised) here, so you don't often feel like you're playing Doom II clone (despite the graphics).\n\nIf you like the Jedi Knight series of games that followed, there is no gurantee that you'll get into this. It's graphically inferior, the levels are smaller, and there is nothing in the way of Jedi powers.","February 27, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Superficially it feels similar to the "Blood"-era BUILD engine, with the lightness of movement and spacious surroundings, but it's very well constructed. The levels are interesting, logical and practical. The puzzles are slightly more interesting than "use red key on red door", the AI isn't bad for it's time, and the graphics and sound are top-notch. If you like old-style FPSes, you can't go wrong with Dark Forces.\n\nI'll skip the cut-scenes though, if you don't mind.","February 26, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design may seem a bit awkward by modern standards, and the lack of quick saves/check points is also pretty annoying. You can find respawn items in the levels that will allow you to respawn a tiny bit back from where you died, while all the enemies you killed since remain dead, but thats about it. Some people may enjoy the level of challenge this gives.\n\nThe sounds and weapon effects are actually pretty great, and sound more star warsy than some of the newer games.\n\nHaving originally played only JK2 and 3, this shed some light on some of the design choices of those games. Playing through the Dark Forces and Jedi Knight games in sequence (not including Mysteries of the Sith) was very interesting and gives some insight into late 90s/early 00s game design developments, both graphically and ludologically. I would say the series peaked at Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast (although the JK3 Multiplayer was good), and, if you include the force unleashed duo as part of the series, hit rock bottom with TFU2.","March 11, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/32400/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","Surprisingly fun, albeit very rough around the edges. Star Wars: Dark Forces is a first-person shooter placing you in the shoes of Kyle Katarn, a mercenary trying to stop the Empire from completing development of a Stormtrooper that can actually aim--uh, I mean a powerful "Dark Trooper" unit. The plot itself is typical of early FPS games, and serves to do little more than establish a direction.\n\nThe Star Wars IP is applied liberally here, from the story to the art design to the music. Textures and level layouts are reminiscent of areas or architectural styles from the movies. The audio consists of MIDI arrangements of John Williams' score, as well as some decent if badly-compressed voice samples and a hilarious Wilhelm Scream when you fall at terminal velocity.\n\nStar Wars is modeled in a similar fashion to the Doom engine, meaning the game isn't really 3D, just fancy sprites and flat surfaces. However, Dark Forces boasts a far superior engine, allowing for more vertical level design, as well as water, cutscenes, low-poly 3D models, crouching, and a crude system for looking up and down. Considering the sheer age of this game and the newness of the FPS genre at the time, these features make for a much different game that your standard Doom clone. Combat is a bit slower than other FPSes, with a lower frame rate and some rather wonky aim assist, but enemy AI is smart and you never feel like you're hanging by a thread when it comes to health and resources. Dark Forces has nooks and crannies to scour for secrets, though not to the ridiculous degree Doom has.\n\nWhat IS ridiculous, however, is the low resolution. It's to be expected that a game like Dark Forces would run low-res as it is, but there's absolutely no texture filtering or refinement. The further away things are, the more they resemble pixellated blobs that are very hard to make out. Fortunately, the game keeps things in the foreground most of the time. Controls are all over the place and make frequent use of the Function keys, and the mouse movement leaves a lot to be desired. These flaws don't make Dark Forces a BAD game, they just show how primitive the FPS genre was at the time, and how clumsily the game ages. To the contrary, Dark Forces is actually very well-made and a lot of fun if you can deal with the rough spots. Its age alone is enough to pique my curiosity, as games like this are something of a relic of the days when game design was crazy difficult and crazy revolutionary. The DOSBox implementation ensures that this game should run fine on most machines, as it does on my Windows 8 laptop.\n\nStar Wars: Dark Forces did a lot of great things for the FPS genre when it came out, but that doesn't stop it from deteriorating to some degree. If you can look past the rough patches, you've got a pure old-school FPS that's fun to play, with a story and cutscenes that will at least keep you interested and a faithful expansion of the galaxy far, far away.","February 13, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first review and I'm brazilian, so I'm sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes.\n\nDark Forces I is a First Person Shooter developed by Lucasarts, it came out in 1995. In this game, the player takes control of Kyle Katarn, gun for hire and ex-imperial officer. I'm not sure if this game is canon, but we find out how the Death Star plans were stolen from the Galactic Empire - that's the first mission, setting the stage for Episode IV. After Katarn steals the plans and the Death Star is destroyed, the Empire develops a new weapon to unleash against it's enemies, and it's up to Katarn to investigate and neutralize the threat. One curiosity about it is that Dark Forces I is the game that introduced the ability to jump and look up and down.\n\nMy time with Dark Forces can be divided into three distinct eras: After it came out, my parents bought the cd for me to play. I found the concept of FPS - it was one of the first shooters I ever played, along with Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (the first game I beat) - very fun and interesting, and I'd already seen the classic trilogy. Shoot imperials, blow up facilities? Sounds fun!\nI was very little (seven or eight, I think), and I used the in-game "cheat" which can be acessed in the options submenu: super shields. I didn't know that it was some kind of cheat, so I thought the game was too easy. The third level was difficult, but I managed. Until the sixth level. There was no way I could figure that puzzle out - I didn't even know there was a puzzle - and, after some game rage, I went to real cheat codes. Ah, the scum and villainy... I beat the game like that, using super shields and level skip whenever I got stuck.\n\nIn the second era, some good six years later, I was determined to beat all levels, but still using cheat codes - ah, the scum and villainy II -. I finally figured the puzzle out - didn't take long - and I felt really dumb. Was I a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid? Maybe.\n\nAnd we come to the final era. I've decided to give this game another try, this time without any cheat codes, and on hard difficulty. Not surprisingly, I died a few times, especially against some certain kell dragons. Damn it, that was hard. But I did it, and I for certain recommend this game, for nostalgic reasons, to see how the First Person Shooters evolved and to see how Kyle Katarn began his journey!","April 21, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, if so, don't purchase this game, because, if you're seeking any of the above traits, you're sure to be disappointed - Star Wars: Dark Forces, is an exceptional work of game design. Though it is, in fact, the case that the game's graphics aren't of an overly high quality by the standards of the gamers of today's society, I can say that, despite this, it is still quite an impressive game; the various methods of, shall we say, "neutralizing" hostile units are all quite entertaining, and, though the game may be slightly old, the movement within the game on the part of the character is remarkably smooth. Never have I once found movement to be even the slightest bit, "laggy", no matter how vigorous my travelling has become. Look, I'm not saying this game is great - I'm just saying it's awesome considering the sale price, and that, for this, and numerous other reasons which I won't even begin to attempt to list, you should definitely buy it.","May 3, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to accept that this is a Doom-clone (the term FPS didn't exist back then) with fake 3D, low resolution, low polygon-counts and clunky controls. It's not very accessible if you're not used to old games like this.\n\nIt also has the problem that the early FPS games following Doom were a bit more detailed which was just enough to make the graphics look less clean.

The stormtroopers, albeit pixelly, have an incredible amount of detail, down to the gills on the rebreathers of the helmet. The game follows classic Doom gameplay (Sorry modernizers, you can't look up.) and the traditional mazelike maps of the 90's. The maps are the biggest problem of the game. Even using the map by pressing tab, the maps are somewhat hard to progress through.

Ultimatley Dark Forces is an expansion of the Star Wars Universe, while the story isn't quite on the level of mass effect, it's interesting enough to keep you invested in both Kyle and Jan, with some exciting cameo's thrown into the mix.\n\n8/10\n\n\n","December 7, 2014","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Force is strong with Katarn..... if you mean to shoot every dude in sight. This game does not feature the lightsabre or force powers. Later games do. This game held cheese to its high standard and back in the old days, these cutscenes were the bomb. Now, you have to use dosbox and cannot aim with the mouse on a vertical axis.... unless you use Pg up or Pg down. I quickly googled the hotkeys and stuff to bring up dosbox options for fullscreen off/on, resolution, how to change key bindings, and such because that was not native back in the good old days. Dosbox makes this highly playable and there were no problems on an 8 core Win7 64bit. Thank God for DosBox. The Mysteries of the Sith , I need to play on my laptop because there are issues with multicore and other stuff. That is its own realm of crap. This game was full of missiles and guns and blasting and PUZZLES. Screw Portal, these puzzles were fun......... and you have to pay attention because no one tells you when you're done or not. You have to check it out, do trial and error, look for patterns, and find it youself.

Also, I doubt you'd even be reading a review of a 20 year old game if graphics is a dealbreaker for you. What I would like to note is the level design. The levels are very distinct and all have a unique look and feel, despite the technical limitations of the time, you rarely find yourself running down endless corridors like in Doom. Also levels are more easily navigated than other early FPS games, and keycard hunting is at a minimum.

Star Wars: Dark Forces is very much its own game. It has all the fun of a 90's run-and-gun/FPS but it adds so much more. While playing as Kyle Katarn, you'll shoot storm troopers, solve puzzles, do some platforming, use cool gear (like ice cleats and a gas mask), set explosive charges, etc. I honestly didn't expect so much depth in a game that was so pixelated. This game seems to be ahead of its time. It seems as though the people at LucasArts wanted to create a rich Star Wars adventure rather than just a cheap cash-in on the newly emerged FPS genre. And they did a very good job considering the technical limitations. Anyone who likes classic FPS games should give this one a go. Though I needed a walk-through at times to make sense of the pixelated environments, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I had playing Dark Forces.\n\n+Original Trilogy Star Wars Goodness\n+Plenty of Guns and Explosives\n+Puzzles\n+Cool Missions\n+Simple But Fun Story\n+Occasional Voice Acting\n\n-Pixelated Environments\n-Difficult to Navigate at Times","May 7, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And... well, yeah, I enjoyed it as well. It definitely scores high on my Top Ten SW games I've played. It's a fun little Doom clone, where you play as a Rebel named Kyle Katarn as you steal the Death Star plans before the actual Star Wars film, and later uncover the secrets of a new Imperial army- The Dark Troopers. Of all the FPS' I've played, where you just fulfill missions, this game makes you feel like you're actually making progress. As you go on, you learn more about the Empire, their design of the Dark Troopers, who's in charge, where the Dark Troopers are made, what they're made of. You end up feeling like a real Rebel spy, in the end. And I like Jan Ors as a character. She helps tell you your situations, fight of TIE fighters, while you're on the ground, and you save her skin once.

Simply put, you run through maze-like levels and only have to point in the general direction of an enemy to hit him (no vertical aiming, its mostly auto-aim). I didn't grow up on Doom, but I have recently been playing lots of these earlier FPS games and love that style more than the contemporary style which is more about patience and aiming.\n\nIf you enjoy this style like I do and have at least a passing interest in Star Wars, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this game. Environments are varied, each level is very distinct and the length of the game is perfect for a game of this style. Don't be fooled by the difficulty options either, these are 90s difficulties meaning that even the Medium difficulty is going to test your Skill (The last level had me frustrated beyond belief).\n\nThe game also requires you to solve some environmental puzzles which are basically just "hit this switch to open this door, and take this code and type it in there to progress"-kinds of puzzles, and they are actually not as easy as they sound, but definitely do-able without a walkthrough.\n\nYes, you'll get stuck sometimes and won't know where to go exactly, but that's part of the fun here. It's not a perfect game to be sure, mostly because the game has plattforming sections (Again, no vertical aiming, and yet you are traversing through mountain paths... Imagine the plattforming!) but it works well enough, and the game is kind enough to give you just enough lives to let you mess up. If anything you can always use cheat codes to get you out of tight spots, but that would naturally be disgraceful.\n\nIt was a joy to play through Dark Forces and it felt very rewarding to beat it on Medium difficulty. There's some replayability... I mean, you could beat it on Hard mode and find every secret there is, but I will personally not replay this game any time soon. Still, I would definitely recommend it! This is an older game that is definitely still playable.\n\n(Note: The Steam version worked without any hitch as it runs through DosBox, and it has keys bound to modern standards, which is great!  No problems whatsoever on Win 8.1 for me, so don't worry)","May 4, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though a lot of people love the game, it is still to this day known as a  "Doom clone."  However, it's far more advanced than Doom.  The engine used is a complete from scratch job.  The objects and enemies are all 3D, not sprites like you had in Doom.  Also, you can look up, look down, swim, jump and do all kinds of things you can't in Doom.  There are also multi level areas, fog and all kinds of effects that Doom didn't have.  The game also has voice acting, which was still pretty rare in 1995.  So, this game is a technological leap forward.\n\nAdd all of that to a Star Wars theme and you have pure gold.  I've had this game (on Steam) for four years, I bought it because I remember playing the not as good Playstation version back in the day.  I just started playing again after not playing it for a long time, so I figured I'd write a review.  Game play is fun, great FPS action.  The level design is gorgeous, beautifully rendered and textured 3D objects (by 1995 standards.)  The midi music is really nice and is present throughout, as are the voices and cool Star Wars sound effects.  The game's story takes place before and during the original trilogy of films, and follows the exploits of Kyle Katarn, a former Stormtrooper working as a freelance mercenary for the Rebel Alliance.  I don't want to give away the plot, but it's a good story rich game with not only great FPS gameplay, but also some puzzles along the way.  If you like FPS games, Star Wars or both, you should enjoy Dark Forces.","May 5, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is much more than a mediocre shooter. Sure, it's Doom with stormtroopers, but still. The graphic style is amazing for the time period. The stormtroopers, albeit pixelly, have an incredible amount of detail, down to the gills on the rebreathers of the helmet. The game follows classic Doom gameplay (Sorry modernizers, you can't look up.) and the traditional mazelike maps of the 90's. The maps are the biggest problem of the game. Even using the map by pressing tab, the maps are somewhat hard to progress through. But the plot (despite Kyle's voice acting) is sound, it fits in with the overall story arc, and it just works on so many levels. Overall 9/10, pick it up if you enjoy DOS titles and/or Star Wars.","May 9, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can see that with your eyes. That's what they're for. Both the eyes, and the grpahics.\n\nThe missions still feel like missions. You're dropped off, you have objectives, then more often than not you have to return to your drop-zone for a pick-up. Occasionally the levels feel a little bit 'designed', but for the most part you can suspend disbelief and get into being on locale in the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe story still makes sense in the greater scope of The Original Trilogy. You first mission is to retrieve the plans for the first Death Star (putting it shortly before the beginning of Episode IV), and then the rest seems to take place between episodes IV and V. I'm not certain about that. At the time of writing I'm about 5 or 6 levels in, and I can't remember all the details of the rest of the story.\n\nThe gameplay still works really well. This game was a turning point for first person shooters. There are a lot of things that we take as given these days that started (or at the very least were popularised) here, so you don't often feel like you're playing Doom II clone (despite the graphics).\n\nIf you like the Jedi Knight series of games that followed, there is no gurantee that you'll get into this. It's graphically inferior, the levels are smaller, and there is nothing in the way of Jedi powers.","February 27, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It reminded me of how FPS used to have secrets that you can find which makes exploration worthwhile.  My only complaint is that something got messed up/lost in the port as you don't need to use the air/gas mask at all which actually makes it slightly easier.\n\nAlso a sidenote the game ran like crap at first and you have to goto your "Dark Forces" folder in the normal x:\blah\steam\steamapps\common\ and goto the dosbox.conf and change a few settings to make it work well.

Superficially it feels similar to the "Blood"-era BUILD engine, with the lightness of movement and spacious surroundings, but it's very well constructed. The levels are interesting, logical and practical. The puzzles are slightly more interesting than "use red key on red door", the AI isn't bad for it's time, and the graphics and sound are top-notch.

Even if youre not much into SW its still decent old school fps. Its challenging like all the games from this era, easy is what nowadays is normal and normal is hard, there is no quick save so you will find yourself restarting the levels often if not playing carefully. The maps are big and you easily get lost, there are some fairly easy puzzles (but for modern gamer they might be hard as there are no hints or quest marks).\n\nThe biggest negative thing is jumping, there are many levels where you need to jump from platform to another, but its hard to say when you have to jump as looking down and up is limited, so prepare to die often from falling down. The boss fights dont have any tactics, as they just have more hp and damage than normal enemies, thats all.\n\nIt rurns smoothly on DOSBOX with modern hardware and there is even some HD texture packs.\n\nIf you like Dark Force 2 then you definitely need to play this game also, as you will get the backround story for Kyle Katarn.\n\n8/10","April 18, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game features several weapons, most of which are really enjoyable to use.\n\nHonestly the biggest flaw of the game is that it's a bit short, barring some issues I will get to in a bit. Also if you are a younger gamer, the archaic design of the game may at times confuse you, definitly go look up a guide to find or change the controls. Fans of older FPS and star wars should definitly check it out (Although you probably already have).\n\nHowever... Whoever put this on steam didn't try very hard, it is running on a old version of dosbox and has very very poor default settings. It will run right off the bat, but you will really want to go check out some guides on updating dosbox and changing the settings to something that makes more sense. I haven't checked GoG for this game, but I'd assume they also sell it and they probably have it set up and optimized much better, just something to consider.\n\ntl:dr : Steam version is set up poorly by default, it's a great game though.","February 15, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first review and I'm brazilian, so I'm sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes.\n\nDark Forces I is a First Person Shooter developed by Lucasarts, it came out in 1995. In this game, the player takes control of Kyle Katarn, gun for hire and ex-imperial officer. I'm not sure if this game is canon, but we find out how the Death Star plans were stolen from the Galactic Empire - that's the first mission, setting the stage for Episode IV. After Katarn steals the plans and the Death Star is destroyed, the Empire develops a new weapon to unleash against it's enemies, and it's up to Katarn to investigate and neutralize the threat. One curiosity about it is that Dark Forces I is the game that introduced the ability to jump and look up and down.\n\nMy time with Dark Forces can be divided into three distinct eras: After it came out, my parents bought the cd for me to play. I found the concept of FPS - it was one of the first shooters I ever played, along with Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (the first game I beat) - very fun and interesting, and I'd already seen the classic trilogy. Shoot imperials, blow up facilities? Sounds fun!\nI was very little (seven or eight, I think), and I used the in-game "cheat" which can be acessed in the options submenu: super shields. I didn't know that it was some kind of cheat, so I thought the game was too easy. The third level was difficult, but I managed. Until the sixth level. There was no way I could figure that puzzle out - I didn't even know there was a puzzle - and, after some game rage, I went to real cheat codes. Ah, the scum and villainy... I beat the game like that, using super shields and level skip whenever I got stuck.\n\nIn the second era, some good six years later, I was determined to beat all levels, but still using cheat codes - ah, the scum and villainy II -. I finally figured the puzzle out - didn't take long - and I felt really dumb. Was I a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kid? Maybe.\n\nAnd we come to the final era. I've decided to give this game another try, this time without any cheat codes, and on hard difficulty. Not surprisingly, I died a few times, especially against some certain kell dragons. Damn it, that was hard. But I did it, and I for certain recommend this game, for nostalgic reasons, to see how the First Person Shooters evolved and to see how Kyle Katarn began his journey!","April 21, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uses a heavily modified Doom engine that allows larger, much more detailed worlds to explore, with multilayered buildings, detailed cutscenes, immersive music (complain about the dated mini soundtrack while not trying to whistle to the theme song or the Detention Center's action music), and many weapons with various functions, such as a BFG plasma minigun cannon that shoots rockets. The soundtrack features iMuse, which allows a varying soundtrack that changes depending on what is going on. Even for a 1995 game, it still impresses me, and it is one of the first games I have ever played in my life. It's also a bit scary, from sewer monsters to giant kell dragons to hovering black balls of painful "British Made" syringes and torment.

And... well, yeah, I enjoyed it as well. It definitely scores high on my Top Ten SW games I've played. It's a fun little Doom clone, where you play as a Rebel named Kyle Katarn as you steal the Death Star plans before the actual Star Wars film, and later uncover the secrets of a new Imperial army- The Dark Troopers. Of all the FPS' I've played, where you just fulfill missions, this game makes you feel like you're actually making progress. As you go on, you learn more about the Empire, their design of the Dark Troopers, who's in charge, where the Dark Troopers are made, what they're made of. You end up feeling like a real Rebel spy, in the end. And I like Jan Ors as a character. She helps tell you your situations, fight of TIE fighters, while you're on the ground, and you save her skin once.

Even though a lot of people love the game, it is still to this day known as a  "Doom clone."  However, it's far more advanced than Doom.  The engine used is a complete from scratch job.  The objects and enemies are all 3D, not sprites like you had in Doom.  Also, you can look up, look down, swim, jump and do all kinds of things you can't in Doom.  There are also multi level areas, fog and all kinds of effects that Doom didn't have.  The game also has voice acting, which was still pretty rare in 1995.  So, this game is a technological leap forward.\n\nAdd all of that to a Star Wars theme and you have pure gold.  I've had this game (on Steam) for four years, I bought it because I remember playing the not as good Playstation version back in the day.  I just started playing again after not playing it for a long time, so I figured I'd write a review.  Game play is fun, great FPS action.  The level design is gorgeous, beautifully rendered and textured 3D objects (by 1995 standards.)  The midi music is really nice and is present throughout, as are the voices and cool Star Wars sound effects.  The game's story takes place before and during the original trilogy of films, and follows the exploits of Kyle Katarn, a former Stormtrooper working as a freelance mercenary for the Rebel Alliance.  I don't want to give away the plot, but it's a good story rich game with not only great FPS gameplay, but also some puzzles along the way.  If you like FPS games, Star Wars or both, you should enjoy Dark Forces.","May 5, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theawesomegarrett/recommended/32400/","theawesomegarrett","The Awesome Garrett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theawesomegarrett/","109 products in account","Star Wars: Dark Forces, is a old, odd, game. When I purchased it on Steam, several years ago now... I really didn't know what I was buying. Yes, I knew it was a Star Wars game, but the main thing that had me eyeballing it, was it's ridiculous cheep price. It was $0.99.\n\nOne of the first things that surprised me was that it was an older game, Dark Forces came out in 1995 for MS-Dos. Which is why this game uses a pre-programed version of Dos-box to run the game on modern machines. I've played it on several computers, it seems to run just fine.\n\nDark Forces is the first in the Jedi Knight game series, you play as Kyle Katarn, a young mercenary, a cross between Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. In the future games Kyle grows to become a Jedi Knight, but in this game he's just a mercenary.\n\nGameplay is fine, think of a Star Wars meets Duke Nukem 3D. Dark Forces falls in from the time where 3D shooters weren’t quiet all 3D yet, a 2.5D pixel wonderland where you explore and take down stormtroopers and the evil dark stormtoopers.\n\nDo you have a lightsaber? Nope. But you really don't need to, Dark Forces has you play as a one man army. You're not a Jedi. You're a hired gun, and honestly it's better this way. You're not this over powered superman with force powers, mowing down enemies. You're a dude turned against the empire. You're not in it to be noble, you're out for vengeance. This could have turned into an interesting series, you have this character go deeper and deeper to the darkside basically by killing stormtroopers for the wrong reasons, yet fighting for the right of the rebellion.\n\nInstead, they dropped that, gave you a lightsaber, and called you a Jedi Knight in the sequel.\n\nDark Forces is an older game, don't expect to be wowed by the story or gameplay. You might be in for a shock to discover, much like myself that the Theme from Star Wars is played from a Midi version. But that's because its from that odd period of time. No, FMV... that’s for the sequel. If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll want to play this, and probably the rest of the Jedi Knight series.\n\nIf you're like me, and really didn't know what this game was about. It's a fun doom-like game. If you wait for it to go on sale for about .99 cents. I say give it a shot, I did and got a lot out of it. If Doom/Duke Nukem games really aren't your thing, I'd pass it up.","June 21, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's actually a poop-ton of fun, if not just a bit aggravating. Levels are pretty good length, and there is no saving your game, except between missions. You are on a life system, meaning every level, you get three lives to finish the level. Usually not a problem, but the game isn't always easy. In fact there are times where I felt like some levels were just cheap at times (but extremely well-designed). For being the launching point for some of my very fvorite star wars games (jedi knight 2 and jedi academy), I absolutely recommend this game.\n\nGraphics 8/10, i guess? I hve no idea what the standard should be, but it's certainly good enough if you at least understand that you're playing a DOS game.\n\nGameplay 8/10 Cool levels and puzzle like design, but gunplay is tough and some areas are littered with invisible minefields that just feel kinda cheap. Make sure ou grab the infrared goggles.\n\nStory 7/10 It's alright, but I bet it's downright impressive next to other games' stories of it's time.\n\nLasting appeal: 9/10 I mean, 14 missions, took me a total of 23 hours to complete the game, which is a pretty good length.

Played it for first time probably around Star Wars Episode 1 film premiere because it made to want to play everything with "Star Wars" in name. The only thing I was wondering when I will got lightsaber and have some cool Jedi fights but at the time, sadly, I was disappointed to see that I won't use one in this game. Many years later, in 2016, I wanted to replay it. To be honest, when it would be my first time playing, I would stop playing it few times. Why? First of all, nowaday gamers will have trouble finding their way to finish missions. Levels in Dark Forces are really complex. I laughted few times because I thought that finding a secret places in this game is much easier than finding actually your way trought mission and IT'S TRUE. Not that I hate it but let's be honest, how many games now have this much twisted level construction? Noone to very low... anyway, I love every each of levels. Those are filled with Star Wars - ever wanted to take a trip around Jabba's ship? No problem, there is mission like that!\n\nThe next thing which really builds well this game are weapons - even tho there aren't any lightsabers, first weapons like blaster pistol or laser rifle are fun to use. Still, in my opinion, nothing beats Stouker Concussion Rifle - once you will get it you won't use any other weapon but be careful: it's powerful enough not only to kill enemies but poor Kyle Katarn too. Who is Kyle Katarn? Our main hero, former Imperial Stormtrooper, working as mercenary. Is he someone important? Well, because of his action there was some kind of event leading to "moon" destruction but for more you will need to play game by yourself.\n\nThe graphics, music, controlls and everything feels really outdated but that doesn't mean it's bad. Years ago it was wonderful. Even the cutscenes looked amazing! As someone who loves to play old games it's still looks great but that won't be a case for everyone. I think everything gathered together builds a great Star Wars game. Sure, maybe you can't save game anytime you want like in Doom but levels aren't so long that you won't complete it at one sitting - there are some extras that will make your game a little more safe, so you won't need to start level at new when you will die. Three difficulty levels will also help you a bit to make your game fit to your taste but keep in mind, that even playing on easy won't be that easy.\n\nThere is one more thing because of Star Wars being in Disney hands. "Is this canon? It's not canon anymore, right?" - does all of this talk really matter? Kyle Katarn is interesting character and it's fun to follow his story be it in games, books or comics. Dark Forces game is also fun to play, it will surely please every Star Wars fans, Doom-based games fans or everyone who just love old games. It's all that matters. I had fun playing Dark Forces and I'm sure there will be another chance to enjoy it over again.","February 12","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this game is simply old as dirt it offers a fresh and interesting experience the likes of which are rarely seen within the Jedi obsessed nature of nearly every other Star Wars game.\n\nYou'll play as the mercenary Kyle Kattarn who gets the job done by the skin of his teeth. Relying solely on weapons fire and cunning to accomplish his missions rather than a swing of a lightsaber or force powers. Levels are similar to those seen in the older Doom, Duke Nukem or Marathon games where you'll explore secret Imperial military bases and the lairs of seedy underworld criminals in service of the then fledgling Rebel Alliance.\n\nWhile I can't promise that this game will sit well in most gamer's stomachs it will easily become a favorite to those who love dipping in to the past. For those gamers I highly recommend buying this old school title immediately.","February 6","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a DOOM-esque FPS with a bit of Puzzle/Platformer thrown in. The narrative is minimal, though it accomplishes what it needs to. It's probably noteable that this isn't really a "The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders!" story, rather you're a mercenary doing generally small-scale infiltration missions.\n\nThe map design seemed a bit confusing to me at first, but you get used to it. I was flying through the final few missions and still collecting most of the secrets along the way.\n\nIt's pretty short, but each mission is unique while being both challenging and fun. It's worth playing at least for a little bit to recognize the roots of the Jedi Knight series and some obvious inspirations for Shadows of the Empire.","June 26, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I originally got it when the Star Wars game bundle was on a massive sale on Steam. Out of the 10 games I purchased, I decided to try this one out first. Here are my first impressions of it.\n\nGraphics - 9/10: The graphics in this game are very reminiscient of Doom and Wolfenstein, both being pioneers for the FPS genre created by ID Software. It is in a pseudo-3D first-person view with pixelated textures. I give it a high score for being very revolutionary for its time, however, that doesn't mean it is perfect. The main problem is clarity. In both Doom and Wolfenstein, the graphics were clear, and you could see all of the walls, text and enemies just fine. In this game, I find that a lot of the time it is hard to see the walls and openings. This game managed to bring out the most that DOS could supply, so I give it a high score.\n\nStory - 9/10: From what I've gathered, the story of this gameis pretty much capturing data from the Death Star and bringing it back safely while fighting off Storm Troopers. This is exactly what you would expect from a Star Wars game, although I do take off a point for not much depth. The story is not particularly what you would care about, but it delivers exactly what you want for a Star Wars game.\n\nGameplay & Controls - 5/10: As you can see from my score, the gameplay does have some serious issues. First though, let me get out all of the positives out of the way. The gameplay does give you a good sense of exploration and does a solid of job when it comes to shooting. As for the controls, they do seem standard for the average FPS and can be adjustable easily. Now let's get to the negatives. A serious issue I had with the game play is that whenever you enter a room, you are completely vulnerable to enemy attack without being able to see where they are. There have been numerous times when I go up into an elevator, then as soon as I reach the top, I have to turn around to exit while my health bar is being drained by an enemy that I cannot shoot. The game also is very unexplanatory, as I could not easily figure out all of the controls without some explanation. The controls, when you figure them out however, can be a bit weird to use if you have been previously playing a 3D FPS. You're locked into a left-right point of view, so you can not look upwards or downwards. There are flaws with the gameplay and controls, but they aren't terrible. That's why they get a medium rating.\n\nSummary: Overall, Star Wars - Dark Forces is not a perfect game, but still a good one. The gameplay could be better, but it is still a solid FPS and one of the better DOS games out there. For a price of only $5.99 without sales, I would consider it a good deal. I'm sure that there are better Star Wars games out there, but this one is still worth playing.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.6/10\n\nHey guys! This was my first Steam Review. How do think it was? Please leave feedback, because I might do this again in the future. Thanks, and goodbye!","May 6, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I originally got it when the Star Wars game bundle was on a massive sale on Steam. Out of the 10 games I purchased, I decided to try this one out first. Here are my first impressions of it.\n\nGraphics - 9/10: The graphics in this game are very reminiscient of Doom and Wolfenstein, both being pioneers for the FPS genre created by ID Software. It is in a pseudo-3D first-person view with pixelated textures. I give it a high score for being very revolutionary for its time, however, that doesn't mean it is perfect. The main problem is clarity. In both Doom and Wolfenstein, the graphics were clear, and you could see all of the walls, text and enemies just fine. In this game, I find that a lot of the time it is hard to see the walls and openings. This game managed to bring out the most that DOS could supply, so I give it a high score.\n\nStory - 9/10: From what I've gathered, the story of this gameis pretty much capturing data from the Death Star and bringing it back safely while fighting off Storm Troopers. This is exactly what you would expect from a Star Wars game, although I do take off a point for not much depth. The story is not particularly what you would care about, but it delivers exactly what you want for a Star Wars game.\n\nGameplay & Controls - 5/10: As you can see from my score, the gameplay does have some serious issues. First though, let me get out all of the positives out of the way. The gameplay does give you a good sense of exploration and does a solid of job when it comes to shooting. As for the controls, they do seem standard for the average FPS and can be adjustable easily. Now let's get to the negatives. A serious issue I had with the game play is that whenever you enter a room, you are completely vulnerable to enemy attack without being able to see where they are. There have been numerous times when I go up into an elevator, then as soon as I reach the top, I have to turn around to exit while my health bar is being drained by an enemy that I cannot shoot. The game also is very unexplanatory, as I could not easily figure out all of the controls without some explanation. The controls, when you figure them out however, can be a bit weird to use if you have been previously playing a 3D FPS. You're locked into a left-right point of view, so you can not look upwards or downwards. There are flaws with the gameplay and controls, but they aren't terrible. That's why they get a medium rating.\n\nSummary: Overall, Star Wars - Dark Forces is not a perfect game, but still a good one. The gameplay could be better, but it is still a solid FPS and one of the better DOS games out there. For a price of only $5.99 without sales, I would consider it a good deal. I'm sure that there are better Star Wars games out there, but this one is still worth playing.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.6/10\n\nHey guys! This was my first Steam Review. How do think it was? Please leave feedback, because I might do this again in the future. Thanks, and goodbye!","May 6, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Force is strong with Katarn..... if you mean to shoot every dude in sight. This game does not feature the lightsabre or force powers. Later games do. This game held cheese to its high standard and back in the old days, these cutscenes were the bomb. Now, you have to use dosbox and cannot aim with the mouse on a vertical axis.... unless you use Pg up or Pg down. I quickly googled the hotkeys and stuff to bring up dosbox options for fullscreen off/on, resolution, how to change key bindings, and such because that was not native back in the good old days. Dosbox makes this highly playable and there were no problems on an 8 core Win7 64bit. Thank God for DosBox. The Mysteries of the Sith , I need to play on my laptop because there are issues with multicore and other stuff. That is its own realm of crap. This game was full of missiles and guns and blasting and PUZZLES. Screw Portal, these puzzles were fun......... and you have to pay attention because no one tells you when you're done or not. You have to check it out, do trial and error, look for patterns, and find it youself.

The graphics are dated to say the least, but the fast pace and satisfying feel of the blaster rifle makes up for most of it. Also, I doubt you'd even be reading a review of a 20 year old game if graphics is a dealbreaker for you. What I would like to note is the level design. The levels are very distinct and all have a unique look and feel, despite the technical limitations of the time, you rarely find yourself running down endless corridors like in Doom. Also levels are more easily navigated than other early FPS games, and keycard hunting is at a minimum. Some modern conventions for the genre might be missed, but it's a very enjoyable game despite its age.","May 7, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Star Wars: Dark Forces is very much its own game. It has all the fun of a 90's run-and-gun/FPS but it adds so much more. While playing as Kyle Katarn, you'll shoot storm troopers, solve puzzles, do some platforming, use cool gear (like ice cleats and a gas mask), set explosive charges, etc. I honestly didn't expect so much depth in a game that was so pixelated. This game seems to be ahead of its time. It seems as though the people at LucasArts wanted to create a rich Star Wars adventure rather than just a cheap cash-in on the newly emerged FPS genre. And they did a very good job considering the technical limitations. Anyone who likes classic FPS games should give this one a go. Though I needed a walk-through at times to make sense of the pixelated environments, I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun I had playing Dark Forces.\n\n+Original Trilogy Star Wars Goodness\n+Plenty of Guns and Explosives\n+Puzzles\n+Cool Missions\n+Simple But Fun Story\n+Occasional Voice Acting\n\n-Pixelated Environments\n-Difficult to Navigate at Times","May 7, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And... well, yeah, I enjoyed it as well. It definitely scores high on my Top Ten SW games I've played. It's a fun little Doom clone, where you play as a Rebel named Kyle Katarn as you steal the Death Star plans before the actual Star Wars film, and later uncover the secrets of a new Imperial army- The Dark Troopers. Of all the FPS' I've played, where you just fulfill missions, this game makes you feel like you're actually making progress. As you go on, you learn more about the Empire, their design of the Dark Troopers, who's in charge, where the Dark Troopers are made, what they're made of. You end up feeling like a real Rebel spy, in the end. And I like Jan Ors as a character. She helps tell you your situations, fight of TIE fighters, while you're on the ground, and you save her skin once. While Kyle may be bland himself, it's what's going on around him that I enjoyed much more.","May 8, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The question on everybody's mind is; is it better than Doom? The answer is simply no. However, you really can't compare the two games. This gem focuses more on puzzles and switch hunting, rather than testing your trigger finger and key hunting.\n\nPros:\n-Gets your brain working, requires strategy and wit.\n-Hard game even on the medium difficulty.\n-Dozens of secret areas and easter eggs allow for replayability (although I don't want to have to suffer through the campaign again)\n-Unique setting and weaponry allows for a sense of you actually being in a Star Wars film, despite there being no planets from the films.\n\nCons:\n-You can get lost very easily due to the insanely large environments and maps.\n-Puzzles can often be TOO challenging, most notably "The Elevator Puzzle".\n-Final boss was very easily beaten, I only lost 1 life while fighting him.\n-NO MULTIPLAYER MODE!!!\n\nMy final score for Dark Forces? 7/10. Nowhere near as good as other shooters from the era, but still very fun to play through.   The campaign ends at the exact moment when the game starts to feel repitive and boring, and the cheap price tag means you have no reason not to be playing this game.\n\nIf you're a fan of old-school FPSes, this game is for you. Just be prepared for challenging puzzles and open environments in which you will often get lost.\n\n[[[[[[FIXES FOR WINDOWS 7/8 USERS: There is a problem with this game where when you start it up, the colours are all incorrect. You can check if you have this problem by starting the game, the cursor will be white and blaster shots from your guns will be blue instead of red.\n\nQ: How do I fix this?\nA: Go to your steam folder, find the .exe file for the game, right click and click properties. Set the compatibility mode to Windows XP service pack 2 or 3.]]]]]]\n\n","July 7, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

WinXPSP3 was used for my systems.\nfirst try to start dosbox by itself - see that it runs.  You might even try to invoke dark forces by typing:\nmount c ..\Game\nc:\ndark.exe\n\nif the game runs then you can go from there and start editing the dosbox.conf file - first make a copy of the .conf file.  Then remove cpu=xxxxxx and also remove exit (last line in the file).  Additionally, change "game" to ..\Game (case sensitive just in case).\n\nOnce the game starts up - it may run exceedingly fast.  That's where you can go back to the conf file and re-introduce the cpu=xxxxxxx line to its original value.  If the game still runs entirely TOO fast, increase the left most digit of that number (originally 20000).\n\nHey - this game was released over 20 YEARS ago.  I wouldn't expect it to run flawlessly on every platform or the latest OS and processors today, considering it was made for x86 DOS platforms way back when processors were 133MHz single core and a math coprocessor was a luxury!\n\nHopefully that helps.\n...\n\nOf all the new FPS games that were being released in the mid 90s, DARK FORCES shines as something that incorporated a good storyline with an anti-hero.  Several levels required a bit of thinking, a bit of skill, and plenty of storm trooper fights.  Additionally the build up of some of the big bosses were great - sometimes very tense.","April 14","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah, that game that came out in 2015 and had the shiniest golden pixel? Forget it. It has NOTHING to offer in comparison to Dark Forces. Seriously. Dark Forces has triple the gameplay time (Halo 5 had ~3 hours gameplay time on heroic, whereas Dark Forces is ~9 hours), double replayablity value (secrets and whatnot) with a nice, simple story that is easy to follow and fun to engage in.\n\nHands down one of the best level designs for an FPS game. Not strictly linear, yet not too confusing (in most places).\n\nIt also has a good challenge in it as well. I finished it on easy, and that was hard enough.

If you've played Doom, Duke 3D, Shadow Warrior, ect, you'll feel right at home. Its core gameplay is pretty standard shooter fare, you're a walking armory and you shoot a bunch of stuff until it all dies or gets destroyed. The shooting itself is great fun, giving you access to a bunch of recognizable Star Wars arsenal, along with some weapons whipped up for this game specifically. This game does change the shooter formula up somewhat though by introducing more objective based missions and having a pretty decent overarching story. The levels are also much more maze-like and have a good number of puzzles compared to most classic shooters. You also can't save during individual levels, but the game has a lives system to kind of compensate for the difficulty of finishing a whole level in one go.\n\nUnfortunately, because its a DOS era game on Steam it needs some tweaking to get working properly. It does "work" out of the box so to speak, however it looks worse than it should and runs terrible on top of it. Luckily, there are several guides that are easy to follow on the steam forums that should fix most of the issues it has. I'd also recommend disabling the steam overlay for it, as it sometimes causes graphic issues. If you are willing to put in the extra work though, it's a great game.

While this game is simply old as dirt it offers a fresh and interesting experience the likes of which are rarely seen within the Jedi obsessed nature of nearly every other Star Wars game.\n\nYou'll play as the mercenary Kyle Kattarn who gets the job done by the skin of his teeth. Relying solely on weapons fire and cunning to accomplish his missions rather than a swing of a lightsaber or force powers. Levels are similar to those seen in the older Doom, Duke Nukem or Marathon games where you'll explore secret Imperial military bases and the lairs of seedy underworld criminals in service of the then fledgling Rebel Alliance.\n\nWhile I can't promise that this game will sit well in most gamer's stomachs it will easily become a favorite to those who love dipping in to the past.

It's actually a poop-ton of fun, if not just a bit aggravating. Levels are pretty good length, and there is no saving your game, except between missions. You are on a life system, meaning every level, you get three lives to finish the level. Usually not a problem, but the game isn't always easy. In fact there are times where I felt like some levels were just cheap at times (but extremely well-designed). For being the launching point for some of my very fvorite star wars games (jedi knight 2 and jedi academy), I absolutely recommend this game.\n\nGraphics 8/10, i guess? I hve no idea what the standard should be, but it's certainly good enough if you at least understand that you're playing a DOS game.\n\nGameplay 8/10 Cool levels and puzzle like design, but gunplay is tough and some areas are littered with invisible minefields that just feel kinda cheap.

A game similar to the Doom/Quake style of gaming filled with Storm Troopers and everything you love about Star Wars makes for a very nice combo. The variation in guns meant you had a plethora to choose from so you can quickly find your style and choose your stride. The character development left a lot to be desired however and the story was just ok. The mechanics as I said before are very similar to Doom/Quake, but while this may bring nostalgia it kind of didn’t work for this game. Many times I needed to look up and down and when you can’t do it with the mouse there is a bit of a problem. Yes you can look up and down, but it is keyed to button presses. This makes the game slow down a bit as you have to either stop moving or stop looking around. Now this can be fixed easily with Xpadder probably or even a mod, but I just wanted to play my game and at the time didn’t think about it.\n\nThat being said I felt the gameplay was overall solid and the story was easy to follow. The map was a bit hard to navigate and I did get lost a few times, but if you take your time and slow down, or do what I did and look up a play-through, you can make it through. Also punching giant lizards, sorry I don’t know what they are called bear with me I’m a Star Wars fan, but I don’t act like I have a PhD, was a lot of fun!\n\nI give the game a solid 7.

It involves really good voice acting for the time period and some cut scenes that I imagine looked pretty good in 1995 but now have a certain retro charm to them.\n\nThe soundtrack really makes the most of it's MIDI music, and most of the songs still hold up today, especially the opening song. Unless you don't like MIDI music, in which case you probably won't like this game's music.\n\nThe environment is well designed, and does a good job capturing the feel of wherever the level is supposed to be set. This is an area  that I always thought that Doom I and II frequently fell short, so this is rather big deal.\n\nCons\n\n\nThis is a FPS with LIMITED LIVES. You get three in the beginning, and you can find more hidden in the levels. This "feature" is definitely going to make a few people not interested in this game anymore, but it isn't as big of a deal as it sounds.\n\nYou can't save your game mid-level. Even Wolfenstein 3D had that feature, and it also had limited lives, so I can't see why they didn't put that in this game.\n\nAs with many early Doom Clones/FPSs, to aim up and down, you have to press Page Up and Page Down.  However when you aim at an enemy on a higher level than you are aiming, the game automatically detects that you are aiming at the enemy and your blaster shots automatically aim up. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. However, this isn't that big of a deal in the end. Fortunately, the game supports mouse control for looking left and right.\n\nLike other Doom Clones, the game is rather pixelated. However, you can use XL Engine (a source port of this game and several others) to fix this, as well as the aiming up/down issue.\n\nEasily the biggest problem present in  this game, as well as many other Doom Clones, is that the non-linear levels act as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can be quite liberating to play a fairly non-linear FPS, as you aren't being pushed down a corridor like in Call of Duty. On the other hand, it can be difficult at times to figure out where you are supposed to go next. This can result in a frustrating "Where do I go now?" feeling  compounded by the fact that you usually aren't doing a lot of shooting while looking where to go next.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf you are searching for a retro FPS to wash the foul taste of today's ultra-linear FPSs, this is a game for you.\nIf you like Star Wars, I can't  recommend this game to you unless you also like retro first-person-shooters. Honestly, this type of game is rather dated in some ways, so it isn't for everybody. But if you do like Star Wars and retro first-person shooters, you should buy this right now.\n\nSimilar games:\nWolfenstein 3D\nSpear of Destiny\nDoom\nDoom II\nHeretic\nHexen\nDuke Nukem 3D\nRise of the Triad\nBlake Stone\nRedneck Rampage\nBlood\n\n\nTIP: Press F5 to turn on a flashlight. This seriously helps in some of the darker levels.","April 19, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The biggest flaw I found was the inablility to look up and down with the mouse. like in doom, your pojectiles auto-aim to hit targets above or below you, but this does not always work. you will find yourself backing away from an elevated enemy hoping that you projectiles hit their mark, all the while getting hit yourself, which is very frustrating. you can however, look up and down with the page up and page down keys, but obviously this is too clunky. there might be a way to configure the mouse to do this, (outside of the game) but i didn't bother to look in to it because the maze-like level design isnt fun. you spend most of your time in a level figuring out where you're supposed to go. I can only recomend this game if you love doom-style games, but to be honest, I'm sure this must have been a great game at the time, but fps games have gotten better since the 90's and there better star wars games out there.\n\nBesides, you can play other doom-style games for free as shareware with mouse looking.

Oh man, I didnt expect myself to fall in love so quickly.\n\nThe games retro,"Doom"-stlye shooter with a Star Wars twist is what I believe sold me. The midi is oddly comforting. The story is simple, yet excilerating. There will be moments where you want to smash your keyboard in half. There will be moments of satisfaction. The puzzles challenge the player to think critically. The action will have your heart pounding at some moments, as it did mine. Who would expect this all from a game made twenty years ago. That was a time when games were made to be good.\n\nI give Star Wars-Dark Forces a 10/10.","May 10","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoy it even more now, than I did back then. It's amusing trying to play it without being able to look up or down, but other than that it plays pretty decently for a game that's as old as it is. All Star Wars fans would enjoy it, I think, especially if you enjoy the EU/Legends-verse (or whatever they're calling it these days) This was the first game in a strong series, starring the (at the time) mysterious Kyle Katarn. You're sent on missions to help the Rebels, you get to shoot at Imperials, and you even get a sidekick! Though sadly, she doesn't actually accompany you on the missions.

It took me about 20 hours to complete. The game consists of 14 very challenging levels. This game is definately worth your money. I only have a few issues with the game...\n\n1. Graphics sometimes randomly glitch out (To temporarily fix this, hid [Esc] over and over right when it happens.)\n2. Controls are whacked up\n\nDon't let these issues stop you from purchasing Dark Forces! It is still a great game and I would highly recommend it if you're into games like Doom, Portal, or just Star Wars in general. To make your experience better, here are a few tips for new players...\n\n1. If you can't figure out a level, stay determined! Try again, or look up a walkthrough! (I would reccomend G-Man's Gaming walkthroughs: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6DD3A833ADC1E543)\n\n2. The controls take time to get used to, and can be frustrating to use. Don't worry, below is a list of controls!\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] Jump\n[W] Walk Forwards\n[S] Walk Backwards\n[A] Walk Left\n[D] Walk Right\n[SHIFT] Hold down to run\n[C] Crouch\n[E] Use/Activate\n[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [0] Used for changing weapons\n[F1] Inventory/Objectives/Mission/Weapons\n[F2] Toggle Night Vision\n[F3] Toggle Ice Cleets\n[F4] Toggle Gas Mask\n[F5] Toggle Headlight\n[F6] Toggle Headwave\n[F7] Hide GUI\n[F8] Toggle Weapon\n[F9] Switch Weapon\n[F10] Switch Weapon\n[Esc] Pause Game\n[Left Mouse] Use Weapon\n[Alt]+[Enter] Toggle Fullscreen\n\n3. If you keep dying, try again! Or... you could just...   Type in the code, "laimlame'\n(Type it in while you're controling the main character [Kyle Katarn])\n\nThis game really is great!
