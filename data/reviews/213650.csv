"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkgirl/recommended/213650/","linkgirl","Muselord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linkgirl/","214 products in account","Dwarfs!? is a strangely addicting game. If you enjoy arcade games, where the main objective is to beat your high score (or someone else's high score), you'll probably love this game.\n\nThe way you score is by getting as much gold as you can, while trying to stay alive--but, you're dwarfs aren't the brightest and will insist on digging into caves filled with water, lava, and monsters, so you'll have to keep a close eye on them, which becomes harder and harder as the game progresses.\n\nThe F2P version has the two easier difficulties unlocked and each can be played in 5, 15, 30, and 60 min sessions (but beware, you cannot save the game mid-session).\n\nThe only problem I've encountered is in long games, where you have thousands of dwarfs in the field at one time, my computer starts to lag--which makes the game very difficult and frustrating to play.\n\nOverall, this is a fun, simple, casual game that can keep you entertained for hours or opened for a quick 5-minute session.\n\n[NOTE: If you buy the full version, your personal scores and achievements will transfer, but the F2P version has different global leaderboards, and your global score will not transfer.]\n\n[EDIT: For those wondering, I personally own the full version (non-F2P), which is why my play-time on the F2P version is so low.]\n\n\nConcerning the DLC...\nDwarfs - F2P Skirmish Pack (Recommended): Comes with 3 modes (Sandbox, Rush, and Dark). Rush and Dark modes bring new challenges to the game and can be a lot of fun. In Sandbox, you can experiment. In Rush, dwarfs spawn CONSTANTLY and you can only let 200 die. In Dark, you cannot see where caves or minerals are located.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Difficulty Pack (Recommended): Unlocks the two harder difficulty levels (Hardcore & Tedi Hardcore) for Arcade mode.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Endless Mode Pack (Not Recommended): Exactly like Arcade mode, except it's endless and you're allowed to pick the map size as well as the difficulty. Beware lag. Also, no high score is recorded.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Summer Carnival Pack (Extremely NOT Recommended): Was a prize for a Steam summer sale years ago; a very simple mini-game that is completely different than the base game.\n\nDwarfs - F2P Base Defend Pack (Not Recommended): A cute little tower defense mode that's rather different from the base game.","November 25, 2013","true","0.9"," 98 of 120 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","98","120","0","0"

What isn't fun is having to stop lava and water from getting through to your hometown and killing everything in its path, its sad having to risk a life of a little dwarfy just to seal the cave up.\n\nIt gets harder throughout when the dwarves start digging deeper in, you have to be more cautious of lava, water, boss fights etc. That is why we have a tower! A tower that can send your dwarves flying over into the cave where the boss is just to beat the heck outta those ugly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

I have played for over an hour, and I made a video for it on my YouTube channel. It's a game that takes from many other games, and is a great RTS.\n\nWARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE SPOILERS! PROCEED WITH CAUTION, FELLOW DWARF!\n\nYou are the dwarf overseer, and you see what the dwarfs be doing. If they start doing something you don't like...\nSTOP THEM!\nThis game does require a legitimate strategy, and due to the system of caves that appear, you never know if something will make you the richest dwarf in existence, or doom you and your hall. A dangerous cave can be many blocks away from the town hall, and depending on the danger inside, you can have an entire minute to deal with the situation at your own pace before it becomes a worrying threat. Sometimes you will uncover enemies. This can be a troop of 2 spiders, to 3 orcs and to a powerful warlock. To truly tackle these requires you to use fighter dwarves, which are very powerful fighters (and good miners). They cost 100 gold each (which by the time you encounter enemies you will have enough of), and are instantly available to fight.\n\nYou can place a battle tower in an area that you have mined for 500 gold, and this is VITAL to beating powerful enemies such as the warlock, as you can have up to 8 enemies. Of course, in a five minute arcade play-through, you may not need this. But in a 60 minute play through, you definitely will.\n\nMy one complaint is that you can't zoom out enough to view the whole arena at once, and this can be annoying when you have a load of dwarfs doing there own thing on multiple ends of the map. This has lead to many deaths in my playthroughs.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10.\n\nAnd to top it all off, this game has a cameo from the ultimate dwarf: Yogscast Simon! :D","September 26, 2014","true","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

(Ex. On a flight, long car ride, or a night to yourself.)\nThe random challenges can get a bit repetitive, but will always keep you on your toes.\nThe exploration factor and vast variety of enemies give the randomly generated maps an extra bit of flare.\nSadly, the game itself looses it's charm and challenge after a few rounds. The extra modes are priced cheaply, but I myself did not find the base game convincing enough to invest any money into any of the DLCs. I suppose that's something you'll have to decide for yourself after trying the base game!","November 30, 2013","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Learning the controls takes a few minutes, but by the time I was done, I was actually having a bit of fun with it. Expect to explore and discover things (where "things" can be gems or, say, lava) without being tied down with extreme depth.

Even then, they say they may or may not address the bug when this new game is finished. I feel that's bad customer service, and it reflects poorly on them.

The game is pretty simple.\nThere are only two types of buildings and only two types of dwarf's.\nThere are miner dwarf's and warrior dwarf's. Miners spawn automatically as you get more gold. Warrior's are obviously more adept to fight can be spawned at the main base (max 8) or, be spawned from the other building type, outposts.\n\nThe aim of the game is to get as much gold as you can within the time limit or before your base is destroyed. The miners will dig around randomly but you can guide them to caves or minerals. However, giving them directions costs precious gold. This is where it gets incredibly fun. There are really not that many different types of hazardous areas. There's caves full of water or lava that can flood your mine and there are caves full of enemies. What's fun is that you won't see what's in the cave until a dwarf has dug into it. But the caves may have treasure within and gold is what keeps your mine in order.\n\nOnce a dwarf has discovered a cave full of water or lava it you need to block it off with a wall, blow up a pit with dynamite (which require sacrificing a dwarf) and then solidify the rock around the area so your miners don't blindly spring another leak. These caves are certainly the most hazardous, especially when your mine has branched into something quite complex where water could be flowing through several shafts which all need blocked off.\n\nCaves with enemies can be dealt with warriors. You can build an outpost where you can spawn 4 warriors, train them and (best of all) shoot them out a cannon towards the enemy area. Shooting them out the cannon isn't accurate so you may get a dwarf or 2 in shafts without enemies. Again, this is where gold is much needed. Being able to build outposts allows you to be tactful with the placement.\n\nIt's all really easy to control with shortcuts to items being labelled at the bottom, it's very easy to pick up and play. There are also time controls. You can pause the game for a brief moment, if things are getting a bit hectic, to look around and work with your mine. Best of all is the ability to speed up the game. It allows you to be as greedy as you can be. Both these controls don't affect your time limit per game. Which is perfect as these are tools to help your mine rather than alter the match itself.\n\nThe F2P version probably has what most people want. You are only limited to Easy and Normal difficulties but Normal is good enough. There's no reason why people shouldn't give this a go. The game also features some humorous tutorials with a dwarf voiced by Yogscast's Simon which was a nice surprise. With games being timed from 15 minutes, 30 minutes or an hour, it is certainly a lot of fun to pick up and play.","February 14, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/concinus/recommended/213650/","concinus","Concinus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/concinus/","70 products in account","This is a game for people who think fast and act faster. The player does not have complete control over the dwarfs mining; you may guide some of their actions but ultimately you will have too many of them to guide every single one and then they'll dig in whatever direction they want. Your job is to guide them to gems and precious metals and see to it that they don't dig into caves with lava or water, thus flooding the cave and killing all dwarfs. To avoid floods, you have to block or blow holes in the ground. This, however, comes at a cost and thus is one of the reasons to why you have to find gems and precious metals early in the game.\n\nThe game's graphics has an old look to them, with a horrendously old-fashioned main menu design, which put me off at first. However, while playing the game the design is not bad and has a more "retro" feel to it. I rather liked the different maps and tutorials. The game seriously tested my patience, though, and I did not enjoy playing under constant pressure.","December 24, 2013","false","1.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The tutorials were odd as well, as I maanged to complete a couple of them without even doing anything, think that might need looking at. All in all it doesnt seem like a bad game but it desperately needs a film or some music to go along with it.

This game is pretty simple but a lot of fun.\n\nBasically you pick a time limit for yourself (up to an hour) and see just how gigantic a mine you can make with your little bearded buddies. You build defensive outposts, guide miners towards mineral nodes, block off water-filled caves and volcanic caves before they can hurt your men, and so on. Simple enough but the town hall is constantly spawning more miners who dig faster and faster as they level up. What starts out small becomes a gigantic mining complex in a surprisingly short amount of time.\n\nIts definitely worth a try and, hey, the price is right. :P","April 21, 2013","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingawesomeperson/recommended/213650/","amazingawesomeperson","Till Lindermann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingawesomeperson/","78 products in account","Let me get started. As an idea, this works. You control dwarfs that will mine into caves filled with either treasure or tragedy, and also get gold. You can build towers to get warrior dwarfs, who will fight off goblins when your digger dwarfs mine a cave full of them. You can play a round for up to an hour.\n\nAnd this would be a great game... if the dwarf digger AI wasn't so stupid.\n\nI mean, you bust open a cave full of water, you put a wall down, should be good. But for some reason, digger dwarfs think it's a good idea to mine through your walls even if you placed it to block lava right in front of them. Water poured into my base and I started getting spammed with messages of a group of 10 dwarfs trying to break through the walls every 2 seconds.\n\nYou can't explore or fight when you need to keep babysitting dwarfs that can't realise that walls aren't something to stick their pickaxes through. Your best bet is to hold CTRL and create unbreakable walls around said problem, but here's where that doesn't work:\n\nThe lava is pouring into your base. You've already sacraficed a decent dwarf to create the hole to divert the lava's flow. And then, it heads for your base from many directions. You can't make unbreachable walls out of nowhere as you can walls, so if it happens, you might as well let it pour right in. Otherwise the game will be incredibly dull and boring as you lead the suicide diggers away from their doom.\n\nI don't know why this is around £10. It should be free for all of it, no microtransactions. Get Dungeon Keeper, not this.","February 7, 2015","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have arcade mode which has easy and normal difficulty, and finally you have the score menu which shows all your scores, achievments, medals and so on.\n\nEven though for me I don't play fast paced arcade games, this I really enjoyed and the best part its free.","December 12, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VaultKiller101/recommended/213650/","VaultKiller101","Duton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VaultKiller101/","305 products in account","I've logged about 12 hours on this game so far and I've so far only purchased the endless mode DLC, so about twelve games. Maybe more. Dwarfs is a free to play strategy arcade game in which the player takes the place of an omnipotent god/guide/being/etc. The player guides the dwarves that start underground in a cave in an attempt to get a high score by doing things like defeating enemies, digging minerals, and so on.\n\nIf you want the short version of this review: If you like strategy, and you want something you can play in the off time, get this game. It's free, it's fun, and perfect for a "Lunch time game". If you want to get more out of the game once you buy it, I highly recommend you get the Endless mode DLC. If you want a little bit more in depth, here goes.\n\nVISUAL AESTHETICS:\n\nThe game looks very good, and a lot of love and personal style went into creating everything. The dwarves in particular are very adorable to me, and everything oozes with character. Something worth mentioning as well is how well the visuals coincide with the gameplay, in that extra efforts were taken to ensure that the player was not lost or confused at any point, though there are still sometimes where it gets very easy to get lost in the deep caverns. All in all, the game isn't next-gen and people who are even looking at this shouldn't be expecting groundbreaking graphics. It's cute, adorable, varied, and knit together well with the gameplay with a fantastic style.\n\nSOUND AND MUSIC:\n\nThere are a few songs on the soundtrack from this game and they're all very relaxing and gives the game a very zen feeling, most of the time (When lava/water/boss fights break out, it's kinda like running out of air in Sonic...) But the music is fantastic otherwise. It's very well paced with the gameplay, and it never feels like it tries to portray something its not, like some games have. The sound effects aren't very special, some fighting, some clattering. I think one aspect that shines though is the voice of the Dwarves themselves, they're very cute and add to the charm of the game. I think if one played this game repeatedly for hours, the music might get tiresome, but it shouldn't if you play it with moderation.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nSo, the big one. How does it play? Pretty damn well. The player has a pool of gold to start with, and the Dwarves dig automatically in random and unpredictable directions. Every wall they dig generates a small amount of gold, and can dig up minerals to get more gold. The player can click and drag a line to a destination on a dwarf (or strategically lay it out on his path) and he will follow that line until it ends, digging whatever lies in his wake, but this costs a small amount of gold. This priority makes controlling the dwarves fantastically fun, and easy. Where does the challenge come from? This game is by no stretch of the imagination easy, even on easy mode. The challenges come in three basic forms. Lava, Water, and "What lurks in the Darkness when you dig too deep." Basically, every game you initiate will always have caverns inside, their contents being unrevealed until you choose to dig into them. The three things I just mentioned above will literally pour out, and if they flood your starting location, that's game over. But the player is given the tools to dispose of these problems, which cost money from your gold pool, but for this review I won't go in depth on. As your cave gets bigger and bigger, managing these problems gets tougher and tougher. The player needs to make tactical decisions made primarily on luck ("Does that cave have baddies? Or lava? Nonono, ♥♥♥♥ that, seal that ♥♥♥♥.") or split second reactions because their dwarves tunneled into a cavern full of lava and ends up leaking it through a bunch of tunnels.\n\nEvery order in the game is given, but no result is immediate, it's similar to Dungeon Keeper or Evil Genius in that regard, combine this with the aspect of you can't liberally pause time like you can in a game like Dwarf Fortress or Crusader Kings II, this becomes extremely difficult, and that's where most of the challenge comes from (You can however speed up time which just helps the game along and increases its user friendly nature!). From there, it gets more difficult when you start unearthing the boss fights, Goblin Shamans, Spider Queens, and the dreaded Lich Lords. With even harder difficulties, and a bunch of scenarios to boot and DLC if you so desire, the gameplay is fun and inviting. In the base game, you can set your timer for as little as five (5) minutes all the way up to sixty (60) minutes. Despite the strategy involved, this makes the game absolutely perfect in terms of time management. You can pop on for a quick 15 minute game and be done before the kettle boils or its time to go to work. All in all the gameplay makes Dwarfs excellent.\n\nAFFORDABILITY:\n\nThis game is free. Not much else I should say there. The only thing you should really buy for this if you want a great time is the endless mode DLC, which is 2 bucks. If you want to fully support the devs, every DLC costs 18 dollars in total. It's great, afforable, and fun. If you like strategy games, you have no reason not to install this game, and buy the endless mode DLC.\n\nREPLAYABILITY:\n\nThis is arguably Dwarfs strongest suit. I've yet to get tired of this game, I love it and every game is enjoyable and different. For those of you that want high scores for leaderboards and such, that is available to you. I personally don't enjoy them, but the score in this case is still used fantastically to measure your performance, edging you to just give it one more shot, in a fashion similar to tetris. The caves are randomly generated, the scores are limitless, and the Dwarves do not stop. Keep digging on and on, and see how good you can get.\n\nCONS AND CRITIQUE:\n\nThis is a great game, but every great game has a flaw or two. My main complaint is with the end game, where you need to be able to bounce between places in a flash, you can navigate to problems pretty easily the first time, but after that you need to remember where they are. I once lost an extremely good run because a Lich Phantom I forgot about destroyed my base. This could've been very easily been remedied with the incorporation of a mini-map. There's also a few minor complaints I had where there's no way to repair the base or the outposts, which I can kinda understand why and these are meant (usually) to be disposable games, but in Endless Mode at least, I felt like that should've been a feature. Those are really my only complaints about this game.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIf you like Dwarves, get this game. If you like Dwarf Fortress, get this game. If you like strategy games, get this game. If you want a game you can play whilst eating a bowl of cereal in the morning get this game. This is definitely one of my favourite arcade style games to have come out in a while, and I encourage anyone who meets the criteria I listed to get this game. And if you don't meet the criteria, I ask that you at least give it a shot. It's a small download, and a 15 minute game certainly wouldn't hurt. The tutorial is user friendly, or you can just dive right in. In five words Dwarfs is:\n\nArcadey and Amusing Digging Adventures.\n\nThanks for Reading.","May 3, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something worth mentioning as well is how well the visuals coincide with the gameplay, in that extra efforts were taken to ensure that the player was not lost or confused at any point, though there are still sometimes where it gets very easy to get lost in the deep caverns. All in all, the game isn't next-gen and people who are even looking at this shouldn't be expecting groundbreaking graphics. It's cute, adorable, varied, and knit together well with the gameplay with a fantastic style.\n\nSOUND AND MUSIC:\n\nThere are a few songs on the soundtrack from this game and they're all very relaxing and gives the game a very zen feeling, most of the time (When lava/water/boss fights break out, it's kinda like running out of air in Sonic...) But the music is fantastic otherwise. It's very well paced with the gameplay, and it never feels like it tries to portray something its not, like some games have. The sound effects aren't very special, some fighting, some clattering. I think one aspect that shines though is the voice of the Dwarves themselves, they're very cute and add to the charm of the game. I think if one played this game repeatedly for hours, the music might get tiresome, but it shouldn't if you play it with moderation.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nSo, the big one. How does it play? Pretty damn well. The player has a pool of gold to start with, and the Dwarves dig automatically in random and unpredictable directions. Every wall they dig generates a small amount of gold, and can dig up minerals to get more gold. The player can click and drag a line to a destination on a dwarf (or strategically lay it out on his path) and he will follow that line until it ends, digging whatever lies in his wake, but this costs a small amount of gold. This priority makes controlling the dwarves fantastically fun, and easy. Where does the challenge come from? This game is by no stretch of the imagination easy, even on easy mode. The challenges come in three basic forms. Lava, Water, and "What lurks in the Darkness when you dig too deep." Basically, every game you initiate will always have caverns inside, their contents being unrevealed until you choose to dig into them. The three things I just mentioned above will literally pour out, and if they flood your starting location, that's game over. But the player is given the tools to dispose of these problems, which cost money from your gold pool, but for this review I won't go in depth on. As your cave gets bigger and bigger, managing these problems gets tougher and tougher. The player needs to make tactical decisions made primarily on luck ("Does that cave have baddies? Or lava? Nonono, ♥♥♥♥ that, seal that ♥♥♥♥.") or split second reactions because their dwarves tunneled into a cavern full of lava and ends up leaking it through a bunch of tunnels.\n\nEvery order in the game is given, but no result is immediate, it's similar to Dungeon Keeper or Evil Genius in that regard, combine this with the aspect of you can't liberally pause time like you can in a game like Dwarf Fortress or Crusader Kings II, this becomes extremely difficult, and that's where most of the challenge comes from (You can however speed up time which just helps the game along and increases its user friendly nature!). From there, it gets more difficult when you start unearthing the boss fights, Goblin Shamans, Spider Queens, and the dreaded Lich Lords. With even harder difficulties, and a bunch of scenarios to boot and DLC if you so desire, the gameplay is fun and inviting. In the base game, you can set your timer for as little as five (5) minutes all the way up to sixty (60) minutes. Despite the strategy involved, this makes the game absolutely perfect in terms of time management. You can pop on for a quick 15 minute game and be done before the kettle boils or its time to go to work. All in all the gameplay makes Dwarfs excellent.\n\nAFFORDABILITY:\n\nThis game is free. Not much else I should say there. The only thing you should really buy for this if you want a great time is the endless mode DLC, which is 2 bucks. If you want to fully support the devs, every DLC costs 18 dollars in total. It's great, afforable, and fun. If you like strategy games, you have no reason not to install this game, and buy the endless mode DLC.\n\nREPLAYABILITY:\n\nThis is arguably Dwarfs strongest suit. I've yet to get tired of this game, I love it and every game is enjoyable and different. For those of you that want high scores for leaderboards and such, that is available to you. I personally don't enjoy them, but the score in this case is still used fantastically to measure your performance, edging you to just give it one more shot, in a fashion similar to tetris. The caves are randomly generated, the scores are limitless, and the Dwarves do not stop. Keep digging on and on, and see how good you can get.\n\nCONS AND CRITIQUE:\n\nThis is a great game, but every great game has a flaw or two. My main complaint is with the end game, where you need to be able to bounce between places in a flash, you can navigate to problems pretty easily the first time, but after that you need to remember where they are. I once lost an extremely good run because a Lich Phantom I forgot about destroyed my base. This could've been very easily been remedied with the incorporation of a mini-map. There's also a few minor complaints I had where there's no way to repair the base or the outposts, which I can kinda understand why and these are meant (usually) to be disposable games, but in Endless Mode at least, I felt like that should've been a feature. Those are really my only complaints about this game.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIf you like Dwarves, get this game. If you like Dwarf Fortress, get this game. If you like strategy games, get this game. If you want a game you can play whilst eating a bowl of cereal in the morning get this game. This is definitely one of my favourite arcade style games to have come out in a while, and I encourage anyone who meets the criteria I listed to get this game. And if you don't meet the criteria, I ask that you at least give it a shot. It's a small download, and a 15 minute game certainly wouldn't hurt. The tutorial is user friendly, or you can just dive right in. In five words Dwarfs is:\n\nArcadey and Amusing Digging Adventures.\n\nThanks for Reading.","May 3, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

True, there are only a few game mechanics, and almost everything is automated, but It's not as "casual" as it'd like you to believe.\n\nThere are all these caves, and when a digger dwarf accesses one, it might have monsters, gold, water, lava, or nothing at all.\n\nThe further out they expand, the more caves you have access to. As a consequence of this, the creation of your very own Moria increases exponentially.\n\nThe monsters can be fought by the second type of dwarf, the Soldier, which can come from your main base, or from the only building you can build, Outposts.\n\nWater has to be walled off, and then blocked off with indestructable rock (at an expense.)\n\nLava is slower than lava, but can melt through the walls. This requires more long-term solutions, but can be dealt with in a similar way to water.\n\nSo, when does a REALLY HARD mechanic come into play?\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nWAIT WAIT HOLD ON.\n\nThe individual mechanics are easy to deal with, but ANY OF THEM WITHOUT ADVANCE WARNING?\n\nAs a game of "Dwarfs" continues, the dwarven diggers dig deeper and deeper. Naturally, they come across more caves. at increasing frequency.\n\nHow deep is too deep?\n\nThat's what this game is all about.\n\nYou're constantly on edge, and worrying about anything and everything going wrong.\n\nEntering a new cave is a consistantly sphincter-tightening experience. (yes, i did just use those words that way.)\n\nIf you think to yourself, "Hey, i can dig out little passages and mine precious metals... THIS IS DUNGEON KEEPER!! RIPOFF!!"\n\nNo, it's not. "Dwarfs" isn't trying to be Dungeon Keeper. If you try to play it as that, you'll find it lacks the depth to remain challenging.\n\nWhat IS challenging is the act of juggling one thing too many. ONE LITTLE ♥♥♥♥-UP can bring your whole house of cards crashing down, and, when it does, you'll just laugh like crazy before starting over again without any regrets.\n\nAnd I haven't even gotten to the best Part, the "S" key.\n\nThe devs probably say they they made it "S" for Speed, but I think it means "S" for Seperates.\n\nThat is, it seperates the people with two hands from the people with TWELVE.\n\nHolding "S" speeds up everything: the digger dwarves, the soldier dwarves, the monsters, water, and lava.\n\nFurthermore, speeding up has no effect on the timer that ticks away as you play. This means that your score will be higher, and you'll rank higher on the leaderboard the more you use it.\n\nWhen you add this all together, you've got APMs that make Pro Starcraft players double-take.","January 27, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are various other game modes, and different difficulty levels which change the prices of certain items, but in general it is a fun little time sink. Just be careful, your dwarfs are about as dumb as Lemmings, and won't hesitate to leap down death holes or into lava en masse. Try to mine as many treasure caves and minerals as you can for a chance to get on the leader board! Best part is, this is free to play, so doesn't hurt giving it a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VaultKiller101/recommended/213650/","VaultKiller101","Duton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VaultKiller101/","305 products in account","I've logged about 12 hours on this game so far and I've so far only purchased the endless mode DLC, so about twelve games. Maybe more. Dwarfs is a free to play strategy arcade game in which the player takes the place of an omnipotent god/guide/being/etc. The player guides the dwarves that start underground in a cave in an attempt to get a high score by doing things like defeating enemies, digging minerals, and so on.\n\nIf you want the short version of this review: If you like strategy, and you want something you can play in the off time, get this game. It's free, it's fun, and perfect for a "Lunch time game". If you want to get more out of the game once you buy it, I highly recommend you get the Endless mode DLC. If you want a little bit more in depth, here goes.\n\nVISUAL AESTHETICS:\n\nThe game looks very good, and a lot of love and personal style went into creating everything. The dwarves in particular are very adorable to me, and everything oozes with character. Something worth mentioning as well is how well the visuals coincide with the gameplay, in that extra efforts were taken to ensure that the player was not lost or confused at any point, though there are still sometimes where it gets very easy to get lost in the deep caverns. All in all, the game isn't next-gen and people who are even looking at this shouldn't be expecting groundbreaking graphics. It's cute, adorable, varied, and knit together well with the gameplay with a fantastic style.\n\nSOUND AND MUSIC:\n\nThere are a few songs on the soundtrack from this game and they're all very relaxing and gives the game a very zen feeling, most of the time (When lava/water/boss fights break out, it's kinda like running out of air in Sonic...) But the music is fantastic otherwise. It's very well paced with the gameplay, and it never feels like it tries to portray something its not, like some games have. The sound effects aren't very special, some fighting, some clattering. I think one aspect that shines though is the voice of the Dwarves themselves, they're very cute and add to the charm of the game. I think if one played this game repeatedly for hours, the music might get tiresome, but it shouldn't if you play it with moderation.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nSo, the big one. How does it play? Pretty damn well. The player has a pool of gold to start with, and the Dwarves dig automatically in random and unpredictable directions. Every wall they dig generates a small amount of gold, and can dig up minerals to get more gold. The player can click and drag a line to a destination on a dwarf (or strategically lay it out on his path) and he will follow that line until it ends, digging whatever lies in his wake, but this costs a small amount of gold. This priority makes controlling the dwarves fantastically fun, and easy. Where does the challenge come from? This game is by no stretch of the imagination easy, even on easy mode. The challenges come in three basic forms. Lava, Water, and "What lurks in the Darkness when you dig too deep." Basically, every game you initiate will always have caverns inside, their contents being unrevealed until you choose to dig into them. The three things I just mentioned above will literally pour out, and if they flood your starting location, that's game over. But the player is given the tools to dispose of these problems, which cost money from your gold pool, but for this review I won't go in depth on. As your cave gets bigger and bigger, managing these problems gets tougher and tougher. The player needs to make tactical decisions made primarily on luck ("Does that cave have baddies? Or lava? Nonono, ♥♥♥♥ that, seal that ♥♥♥♥.") or split second reactions because their dwarves tunneled into a cavern full of lava and ends up leaking it through a bunch of tunnels.\n\nEvery order in the game is given, but no result is immediate, it's similar to Dungeon Keeper or Evil Genius in that regard, combine this with the aspect of you can't liberally pause time like you can in a game like Dwarf Fortress or Crusader Kings II, this becomes extremely difficult, and that's where most of the challenge comes from (You can however speed up time which just helps the game along and increases its user friendly nature!). From there, it gets more difficult when you start unearthing the boss fights, Goblin Shamans, Spider Queens, and the dreaded Lich Lords. With even harder difficulties, and a bunch of scenarios to boot and DLC if you so desire, the gameplay is fun and inviting. In the base game, you can set your timer for as little as five (5) minutes all the way up to sixty (60) minutes. Despite the strategy involved, this makes the game absolutely perfect in terms of time management. You can pop on for a quick 15 minute game and be done before the kettle boils or its time to go to work. All in all the gameplay makes Dwarfs excellent.\n\nAFFORDABILITY:\n\nThis game is free. Not much else I should say there. The only thing you should really buy for this if you want a great time is the endless mode DLC, which is 2 bucks. If you want to fully support the devs, every DLC costs 18 dollars in total. It's great, afforable, and fun. If you like strategy games, you have no reason not to install this game, and buy the endless mode DLC.\n\nREPLAYABILITY:\n\nThis is arguably Dwarfs strongest suit. I've yet to get tired of this game, I love it and every game is enjoyable and different. For those of you that want high scores for leaderboards and such, that is available to you. I personally don't enjoy them, but the score in this case is still used fantastically to measure your performance, edging you to just give it one more shot, in a fashion similar to tetris. The caves are randomly generated, the scores are limitless, and the Dwarves do not stop. Keep digging on and on, and see how good you can get.\n\nCONS AND CRITIQUE:\n\nThis is a great game, but every great game has a flaw or two. My main complaint is with the end game, where you need to be able to bounce between places in a flash, you can navigate to problems pretty easily the first time, but after that you need to remember where they are. I once lost an extremely good run because a Lich Phantom I forgot about destroyed my base. This could've been very easily been remedied with the incorporation of a mini-map. There's also a few minor complaints I had where there's no way to repair the base or the outposts, which I can kinda understand why and these are meant (usually) to be disposable games, but in Endless Mode at least, I felt like that should've been a feature. Those are really my only complaints about this game.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIf you like Dwarves, get this game. If you like Dwarf Fortress, get this game. If you like strategy games, get this game. If you want a game you can play whilst eating a bowl of cereal in the morning get this game. This is definitely one of my favourite arcade style games to have come out in a while, and I encourage anyone who meets the criteria I listed to get this game. And if you don't meet the criteria, I ask that you at least give it a shot. It's a small download, and a 15 minute game certainly wouldn't hurt. The tutorial is user friendly, or you can just dive right in. In five words Dwarfs is:\n\nArcadey and Amusing Digging Adventures.\n\nThanks for Reading.","May 3, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have arcade mode which has easy and normal difficulty, and finally you have the score menu which shows all your scores, achievments, medals and so on.\n\nEven though for me I don't play fast paced arcade games, this I really enjoyed and the best part its free.","December 12, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But watch out for water and lava caves, for they can destroy your entire town hall.\n\nGameplay...\nControl the Miner Dwarves with arrows but also the same with Warrrior Dwarves.\nNot much to do but it will get harder and harder later so dont be like, "this is so easy" because later you'll be like, "WTF just happened to my town hall?!?".
