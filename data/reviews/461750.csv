There's very little to this game, but I can't deny that there's just something special about scaring the living daylights ouf of people.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/461750/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account","It's quite amusingYou play a ghoul in a house. Various numbers of people enter the house per round, and your job is to possess objects and scare each of them till they reach a certain threshold and drop dead of shock. There is a timer so you have to do it fast, or you end up being the dead one. (That is, if ghouls can even die.)\n\nIt has issues with movementThe game is in 3D - using the keyboard with your left hand, you have to control how near/far your ghoul is, and using the mouse with your right hand, you control how high/low he is. This wouldn't be a problem, except for the "sliding" that occurs with each move. That is, if you stop pressing the left mouse button or the "left" command on the keyboard for instance, your ghoul doesn't immediately stop, but continues to move a bit more before he finally does. This lack of precision with the controls makes it hard to accurately control your ghoul, and becomes especially frustrating because there is a timer every round, so not having precise movement wastes the amount of time you have left.\n\nWould've been better with some semblance of a storyOr at least, a point to all of this. Of course, scaring peeps is fun, but how about a bit of backstory as to why you became a ghoul, why you're haunting this house, what you hope to achieve, and so on. Just sayin'.\n\nIt's free thoughWith that in mind, go give this game a try. The premise is pretty interesting, the graphics alright, and the objects you get to possess quite fun. (There's a grand piano, grandfather clock, and trophy bear among many others.)\n\nU P D A T E\n\nAs of my last edit, this game is in a somewhat unfinished state and there are a few bugs/problems. These are a few that I encountered:\n\n- You can sometimes get "stuck" in the piano after you possess it;\n- Game jams up periodically (after you press "restart" the timer just gets stuck);\n- Power-ups 1 and 2 are virtually useless (i.e. they don't do anything);\n- No audio during the tutorial (no, it's not your speakers that are faulty);\n- People in the house can jam each other up, especially if there are too many of them.","April 28","true","4.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You're a Ghost haunting a mansion and you're trying to scare potential buyers to your mansion. The concept is like Casper, the friendly ghost. I would probably recommend this to people to try once since it's free, but that's the end of it. Nothing really interesting beyond triggering traps.\n\nPROS\n1. It's free\nFree stuff.

You play as ghoul kid (a ghostly apparition) who needs to haunt objects in a home to kill the stranger’s visiting it.\n\nThere are three different types of enemies who differ in the amount of items you need to haunt near them to kill and the models.  Killing a certain type of enemy will give you point towards a power up that can be activated to assist you.  All enemies in a wave need to die before 99 seconds expire or you lose.  It appears that the waves are endless, but I only made it to wave 6 before getting overwhelmed.  All controls are customizable and there appears to be a fair amount of video settings.  The one setting that this game is missing is audio as the music can be a little annoying after time.\n\nIn my opinion, this game does not offer much in replay ability in spite of the 3 modes that can be selected.  If this is the developers first attempt at creating a game, he did a phenomenal job.  However, I don’t recommend this game more than just a 5-10 min time waster.  This game would probably benefit more from being on a mobile device.\n\nIf you would like to see more of this game please check out the link below.

I really want to be able to recommend Ghoul Kid in the future.\n\n\nGraphics for the Ghoul Kid feel more polished than the levels and other characters, almost like conflicting/different art styles.   Ghoul kid looks awesome\n\nWas hard to get a good grasp of the game with the slow camera movement.   I didn't like how the character can move out of the screen.   I think a more fluid camera where it feels like your flying with ghoul kid would be a nice touch.  To be honest the camera made me want to stop playing.\n\nI think ghoul kids animation needs to be faster or he needs to move slower.   The animation doesn't match the movement speed.\n\nI found it hard to use the mouse and the keyboard for movement.   I feel the game would function better as a 3D platformer like super smash bros with 2 deminsions of control.\n\nIdeas?   Perhaps not imobilizing ghost kid when haunting. Then you could do combo scares and direct the scares more.  Perhaps different types of traps.  ex. instead of using the phone to scare, the AI could move towards it.  Also activating a trap too early could cause the character to run in the opposite direction.\n\nIts a good start, congrats on finishing your first release.

I'd say that the keyboard controls are my biggest complaint about this game. There are some instances where if you don't judge the distance just right you slide through the walls or past the object you want to possess. I did end up getting stuck in the piano at one point as well, but aside from that I had fun.","May 26","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
