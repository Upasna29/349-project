But I was surprised in a good way. This game offered what I didn't think it would. But for now here is the basic pros and cons of this game:\n\n*Positives*\n-free to play\n-licenses for all teams (unlike PES)\n-simple and clean UI\n-Very well written dialogue for the in-game commentaries\n-Player biography and faces add authenticity to the game\n\n*Negatives*\n-there is no 2D map to watch your players play like in Football Manager\n-no soundtrack leaves you sort of audiably bored\n-a ton of microtransactions (expected from a free to play)\n-more customizations are necessary\n-no steam overlay\n-no achievements,mods,trading cards,etc. (will probably be added later)\n\nOverall, the game is superb for being a free to play. But like all free to plays there are always the microtransactions which will hinder the game's experience.Updates in the future may fix the aforementioned negatives but the game offers  so much and all you have to offer is nothing. If you dont pay the microtransactions its not the end of the world because you can still end up in your goal but it might take longer.Having all the licenses and player biographies/faces is quite impressive for a free to play whereas big corporations like Konami still struggle to get licenses.\n\nSo get this game and try it out. For me I will give this game a pretty solid 7.5/10. The game is great for a free to play but there are some hindering qualities that will hopefully update soon. But for now try it for yourselves!","July 18, 2015","true","0.3"," 113 of 128 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","113","128","6","5"

But is it any good? And just how 'free' it is? Keep reading to find out. (or you know, download it yourself, you lazy bum.)\n\nPros:\n- Lots of official team data, if you've ever cared about football, you can easily find your favorite players and clubs.\n- Variety in teams, play around with the budget and players of a world-class club or try your best in saving a bottom-tier, financially ruined team from relegation.\n- From tactics and lineups to managing individual training routines, searching new players, upgrading team facilities, you can do everything but play football itself. (and I'm finding all that entertaining for some odd reason...)\n- You can observe games in real time, even request substitutions and changes to tactics during matches, so you actually feel like you want to prepare your team for every game.\n- Plenty of realism and chances to affect your team's performance... (finding the best tactic for your players, individual health, morale and skill levels, players age and retire eventually...)\n\nCons:\n-Some of the menus are a bit clunky, for an example, I'd love to have a way viewing individual stats without going back and forth between the player data and tactics screens\n- Virtually no graphics, even matches themselves are simulated with sports commentary -style text notes.\n\nIs it pay to win?\nNot really. You can play with high-level teams that win most of their games anyhow and even teams at the bottom of the predicted rankings can squeeze out wins with proper managament. The cash shop options are definitely there but it's not like they're actively locking away your chances to enjoy the game.","July 22, 2015","true","19.5"," 67 of 75 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","67","75","8","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaraRota/recommended/356370/","CaraRota","CaraRota | Game Dealer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CaraRota/","328 products in account","I want to clarify some things before this change of review: Don't judge this review because of my gaming time in Steam; i actually "helped" this guys fund this game by purchasing 3 copies of an advanced alpha paying 15 dollars each one (for a total of 35 usd) back in february 2014 when they were planning on releasing it (they even had a kickstarter project which i followed fondly).\n\nThis being said; the game now has changed for the worst; they took away the daily rewards for up to 150 credits per day by logging into the game and play some matches (i was using this credits to purchase 15m ingame dollars and improve my team, as the economy really sucks and you cannot make profit with any club in the world, not even Barcelona unless you sell your whole squad).\n\nThis is why now i decided to change my review; and throwing you the weakness of this game (please keep in mind that i played over 150 hours!):\n\nCons:\n\n1) Economy is extremely poor; you can barely afford to pay players salaries (don't even think about signing a player who is above your team's average rating!).\n2) The youth academy is a total waste of time; as players are mostly bad ones and if you get any good one: let's say a promising 16 years old with 78 rating with a 98 stars prospect; you will realize over the years, that the player won't even actually reach a rating of 93 even if you have the training facility maxed.\n3) You won't be able to upgrade your stadium more than once; meaning that you won't be able to generate more money from tickets sold; which obviously will mean that you won't be able to purchase any "good" player. Note: Im talking about a player rated 90-91 for Boca Juniors, who actually has Tevez in real life (Rated 93); im not taling about signing Messi or any other superstar!\n4) The more you play the more you will realize that sooner or later you'll be pushed to buy coins with real cash.\n5) Devs are ghosts in forums; not only they won't post the updates they make to the game, but they won't even read/answer your suggestions (they will do it randomly so it doesn't look like they give a rats ♥♥♥ about what you think).\n6) Careful with the player's "values"; it depends wether if you are selling or buying them. If you are buying a player, consider paying at least 20% more of their value; on the other hand, if you are trying to sell a player, keep in mind that clubs will end up paying you 20% lesser than their actual value (sometimes you are lucky and can sell for the actual value, but this almost never happens unless you are selling a promising player).\n7) If you are planning to develop young players to sell them and make a profit out of them, then plan again.\n8) If you are thinking about signing a free agent, then think again: not only they will not accept a lower wage, but they will be taking 75% of their current value.\n9) Keep in mind that players here retire at the age of 33 (approximately).\n10) If you spent a fortune on training facilities and youth academy, you will soon realize that spending money on hookers was going to be more profitable (or maybe more enjoyable, at least).\n\nPros:\n\n1) If you can afford spending 40 dollars, then maybe you'll have some fun.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nOLD REVIEW: Despite first impress; this is not a 100% microtransaction game; you can get up to 150 coins daily which is kind of OK if you don't mind waiting 20 days to get 30M ingame money. If you want to play "faster", then im sorry but you'll have to pay for it. It's somehow buggy in many aspects but i think time and work will polish those errors.","August 1, 2015","false","4.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

[chrisspeerswrites.wordpress.com]\n\nSoccer Manager vs Football Manger\nSoccer Manager 2015\nFun Rating:  7/10\nPros:  F2P; Simple; Nostalgia; Updated Rosters; Quick Gameplay\nCons:  Simple; Feels like a Beta game\nPrice:  Free to Play\n\nFootball Manager 2014\nFun Rating:  9/10\nPros:  Very in-depth; 3D matchs (rather than just word commentary); Realistic transfer system and wage negotiations; Data editor\nCons:  Very in-depth; Too many interviews\nPrice:  $50 (got mine for $25 at Green Man Gaming)\n\nHow Do You Dethrone a King??  There really is no debate. Football Manager is better than Soccer Manager. It has more depth, options, and has been around a lot longer. It also costs more. A lot more. Especially for those “faithful” fans that buy every year’s new iteration that only contains minor updates. This just baffles me, whether it’s FM, Madden, or NBA 2K. $60 every year for the same game? Rarely do such sport franchises make any earth shattering changes that in my opinion justify buying it every single year. Roster changes don’t count as earth shattering in my book. I own Football Manager 2014 and have played 562 hours on it and I could happily play it for several more years before needing to purchase the latest iteration. Especially since it comes with a data editor that many people are willing to make those updated roster changes for you. So, how do you dethrone this ruthless tyrant that has a stranglehold on the soccer (ahem, football for most of the world) simulation management industry?\n\nFree and Simple!  Make it free-to-play (F2P), simple to play, and as an added bonus, make it similar to the very first versions of the ruthless king, like back when he was a charming prince. Soccer Manager has a very Championship Manager (Football Manager was initially called Championship Manager before a split between the developers and publisher) feel to it. My first introduction to sports sims was Championship Manager 2 back in 1995 so there’s definitely a bit of nostalgia that helps boost Soccer Manager in a positive manner. It also is F2P and has updated rosters. Since I “only” have FM2014 I was able to try out my Tottenham club with their latest real world roster without having to shell out another $50. While you do have to pay for certain things like scouting faster and additional load/save slots, none of them will stop you from playing and enjoying the game. One of the great pros of Soccer Manager is that there are very few media interviews!! Football Manager, in attempting to make you feel like you really are the manager on the sidelines, has created a very “un-fun” process of 20 questions (the answers to which impact how your players will perform so you better answer them correctly!!) before each match and several after the match, and some more questions for you to answer when you’re not in a match, just because, that’s what managers have to deal with! Well, I just want to buy players and play matches! Soccer Manager gets you back to the basics. Yes, Football Manager does have a Classic mode, which is what I exclusively use now, but it just feels like Football Manager has gotten away from what their game used to be about.\n\nFinal Verdict!  Football Manager just hasn’t had much competition lately and maybe that is the reason why each version since 2012 seems to be getting worse and worse based on reviews and complaints that I’ve read. So if anything Soccer Manager will push Football Manager to be better. At the end of the day, Football Manager is better than Soccer Manager. But, Soccer Manager is free and with updated rosters, so give it a shot!!","September 28, 2015","true","11.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

And to anyone who was looking to go into the football manager series this is def. a nice try out version.

Don't get this game for mobile, it needs some work as of Jan 13 2016. If its a few months after and your seeing this review, go for it.\n\nSo where to start? This game is a click based game that is fun for people who enjoy managing things.\n\nSomething i found pretty sick, and just recently found out when i verified my account it gave me a prospect from my head scout labeled as me, my name. No profile or anything, but the fact that the game has that i found that VERY sick.\n\nSo now into pros vs cons. Im not insanly good at this, but lets go for it. TL;DR Its good where it needs to be, bad where it doesn't hamper gameplay.\n\nPros:\n-There is so much diversity, any team you join you will manage them differently\n-You are given control of everything except the soccer game itself (the one being played by your players)\n-its realistic in some extent. There are definate patterns I've seen after playing for 45+ hours\n\nThis is a small list but each of these things is good for a managing game.\nCons:\n-User interfaces could be better, searchs aren't very to the point there more generalized. Which i don't like sometimes but it isnt a deal breaker\n-After a certian amount of time (depending on person) the game doesn't get very satisfying seeing your team you've spent millions of dollars (ingame) lose to a team that is bottom of the league. Happened to me 4 times in a row... ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n-"Pay to win" (don't pay towards this game, not worth)\n\n\nAgain, small list, but these things arent to bad.\n\nIf you've read this far... Awesome, Hi my names Ryan o/\n\nDo i recommend this game? YES... This game is something I enjoy because managing things is fun for me. I enjoy managing, I enjoy the feeling of something out of my control doing well, or doing bad and trying to figure out why. If you enjoy these things, this should be a fun game for you.\n\nBecause I'm a nice person, heres a tip to help you get more out of your game. Don't pick the TOP TIER ULTIMATE teams, because you'll just continuously click and miss out on the point of the game. You want to pick a team thats at the bottom of the league or thats somewhere near the middle. The reason being is you'll be much happier to see your team go from bot/mid to the top of the list by your decisions aswell as it gives you a little challenge to work towards.\n\nSo yeah, This game is something i find fun that you can play on basically any pc. Pick it up. its fun","January 13","true","58.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Original review below.\n\nIn a nutshell - it's a free rip-off of Football Manager, drilled down to the essentials, and about a hundred times harder to do well which encourages you to pay for some in-game currency.\n\nThat said, the gameplay more than made up for the difficulty and considering a season of FM can take me anything up to a month to get through, to be able to get through a season in a couple of evenings in this 'FM-Lite' is a big plus.

I like how you can choose your team, earn more points, and manage your team in every way. I was slightly dissapointed when I found out that you don't actually score goals, or dribble, or stuff that. The decides whether or when you score the goals. It shows you whats going on. It controls you're team when their playing a match. Still, better then nothing! You get to decide witch plays on the team, and can find out how many stars there worth.\nAnother thing I'mdlad about is that you're computer's core only has too be a strength of 1.00 procession. That is low. My computer is more of a school computer than a gaming so it's core is only 1.04 prossecion. Almost any core can handle that. It's for free! None of my money used up. It only took about a minute download, here in my house's internet, which is suprising. This is my third game I got. My first game I got I couldn't play after a mont or two because it got old, and the Sponsor stopped on it. The second game I got was really glitchy because my computer's core couldn't handle it. This game I finally got, nothing going wrong. I really like this game.\n","August 30, 2015","true","8.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No matter how consistent you set your team out to be, completely uncharacteristic things cause your whole season to go awry and whole seasons crumble because your players happen to amass 3 red cards and two "5 week injuries" in one Champions League match. I've been playing soccer for basically the entirety of my life yet can't seem to understand how formations cause your games to be so calamitous in SM2015. I mean come on, Chelsea with Paul Pogba and Raphael Varane on the bench versus Everton and they're able to beat me consistently regardless of the formation, mentality, or even talent level? It's hard to put this game down because it's free but I really really do recommend that the people on Stream do not delve into this game. It'll eat away at your soul and make you question aspects of your life that you thought were unquestionable. Be warned soccer enthusiasts, this game will test every foothold of reality you may have.

However, I feel that there are some issues in the gameplay that I hope will be addressed.\nYour team's performance seems to be very much based on momentum.  I've had huge winning streaks, and then as soon as it ends, the team just goes through a long stretch where they can't seem to win against anyone.\nAlso, the player morale system is very difficult to work around.  Once a player's morale drops to 30% or below, it seems extremely difficult to get it back up, no matter what you do.  It feels like a vicious cycle where the player is not happy, then the low morale impacts the player's performance, then the poor performance by the player makes his morale drop even lower.  In the end the only way out seems to be to sell the low morale players and try to buy new players without impacting the morale of your other players.","August 18, 2015","true","127.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If I were to compare this game to other football/soccer games, I would say it is pretty similar to Football Manager 2015 or FIFA 15's simulation mode. When you first start playing Soccer Manager 2015, you will be given a choice to choose the team that like. Once you've chosen the team that you want, the players from that particular team will be given to you and from there you can customise the team however you want by swapping around the players' positions, changing the formation of the team, buying and lending players from other clubs etc.\n\nPros -Lots of customisation to be had\n-Hours upon hours of fun\n-Free to play\n-Ability to login using Facebook or Steam\n-Any computer can run it\n\nCons -No sound\n-Non-existent atmosphere\n-Gameplay feels unbalanced at times\n\nLet me elaborate on some of my cons and further explain what I meant. No sound is pretty self explanatory but what I meant by non-existent atmosphere was that you are unable to see your players actually playing on the field whenever there is a match that is ongoing and no sounds of audiences cheering in the background. Hence, I believe that this makes gameplay more stale and liveless. Gameplay is unbalanced at times as you could have 30 shots, 23 shots on target and 0 goals. I know this can happen from time to time but this sort of thing happens pretty frequently for me. I'm not sure whether i'm just bad at the game or there's something else I'm missing.\n\nConclusion Besides having some flaws, I definitely recommend you playing Soccer Manager 2015 if you want a free to play alternative of Football Manager 2015.\n\nAnyway, any Borussia Dortmund fans here? :P","August 5, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's be frank and start off by saying this game is no Fifa Manager, but it is snapping at the heels especially for a FTP game. The lack of audio kills me as I'm drowned in my own thoughts, but I suppose that's what its like for a real manager. The odd cards (my striker going in two footed and getting a straight red) and odd injuries (injured when not played for a bit, now sits out more games) makes the game realistic.\n\nI have only played for a few hours so I can't go in depth but so far I have only lost 1 game and drew a few. Morale is fairly high, except for those not playing, but that's the world of football. Will review again when/if I complete a season. The lack of 3D visuals and lack of sounds makes me stop playing prematurely, but a string of high profile games will keep me playing easily for 3 hours.\n\nSidenote... if you have never played football (yes, football, as only losers play soccer!) but have an appreciation of what happens from the sidelines as you look at the bigger picture, then get this game! If you're a player and like to be verbal and direct the action of play, then get this game. If you are an arcade style person who thinks players need a power jewel or something to play every match, avoid this game and get of the couch in order to get clue about the world's most popular sport!","August 6, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Your time is now as you lead a team of soccer elites into the exciting world of ball kicking.  By puting together a group of overly paid track runners with shin splints, you can get off on extreme dictation by being in full control of their future.

Of course, Football Manager is a lot better but if you don't want to pay for FM you should try this.\n\nPros:\n\n- Big enough database\n- Nice layout\n- Fun\n\nCons:\n\n- You can if you want; buy ''cash'' in game with real money to get a bigger club budget. But this shouldn't really be a problem if you start with a big club.\n- A lot of ''Share'' options always coming up on the screen, which is annoying in the length.\n\nMy rating for this game is; 8/10 cuz it's free.
