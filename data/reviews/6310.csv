It blew my god damned mind. You play as April Ryan, an unknowing savior of the two worlds that had been split ages ago. She is able to cross the border between them and is able to fully interact with both of them. You'll meet dozens of interesting people and creatures that are fairly believable and likable. You'll be solving some really tough puzzles that don't compare with what's called puzzle now-a-days. Some mysteries which don't make any sense in the beginning will be revealed and fit so perfectly in the story at the end. Other mysteries stay concealed until now and keep thousands of fans excited for more. I highly recommend playing this one before jumping to the newer Dreamfall games. I give this game the ultimate rating 10/10\n\nIn fact, I loved the game so much that I made a complete walkthrough  guide to it, feel free to check it out if you're seriously interested in buying this game because the tasks can get very confusing sometimes.","March 12, 2015","true","43.6"," 85 of 87 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","85","87","3","7"

You do have to put yourself into the Click and Point Adventure mindset however, as it is by no means, a fast paced game. It's more like an interactive book.\n\nThe game for me shined the most in its dialogue. Nearly every character has an incredibly natural enunciation rarely found in games. It gives you a stronger connection with them, and helps you believe every word.\n\nThe next best parts of the Longest Journey was its story and variety of characters. It takes place in the 23rd century Venice, and gives a fascinating perspective of the past, present, and future. With a story as interesting as this, that's all I can really say without spoiling anything.\nThe characters feature a wide range of tallent and personallity, which makes them so interesting to talk to. By the first sentence someone utters, you already know what kind of person he/she is, and how he/she is going to treat you, it really is that detailed.\n\nFor a game stuck in 640x480 resolution, it is full of very detailed and beautiful scenery. 3D objects are pretty pixelated and jaggy, and are probably the thing that aged the worst. Some up-resing would benefit The Longest Journey pretty well, but I quickly became lost in everything else it had to offer, that the quality rarely bothered me.\n\nThe puzzles as well can be pretty cryptic. I had to look up a guild many times to figure out what to do next. That didn't bother me too much either, but it would have been nice if the main character gave hits on what to do.\n\nI am currently working through the sequel, Dreamfall, which early on already has reoccuring characters and locations, and because it came out 6 years after the first, it's nice to see things in better detail.\n\nIf you want a less action oriented experience that feels like a mix of an interactive painting and a best selling novel, I highly recommend picking up the double pack. With a promising 3rd installment in the works, how can you go wrong?","November 25, 2013","true","25.3"," 76 of 78 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","76","78","0","0"

It is an epic adventure from beginning to end and it never gets tedious or boring like a lot of adventure games tend to do when they try to forcefully increase the playtime. The setting is unique, intriguing and creates a great atmosphere. The plot is original and inspiring and shows what adventure games can do when they're done right. The brightest aspect of the game, however are the characters. From the heroine to the minor characters, they are all wonderfully designed with a certain integrity that makes them incredibly powerful. They bring the story to life and make for a truly memorable game. This could not have been done without the excellent writing and voice acting. The only argument I have against the game's excellence is the pacing and execution of the lest stretch before the finale, which compared to the rest of the game seemed rushed. It seems as if the development team was not able to give this segment the attention and devotion that it deserved. It is a small issue barely worth mentioning however, since the rest of the game shines brightly.\n\nIf adventure games are your thing, this is a must-play.","February 1, 2014","true","23.0"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","59","60","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/6310/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","I came to The Longest Journey expecting a classic, critically aclaimed point & click adventure with a great story, and the game really delivered. This has to be one of the best written games I have ever played, without any exaggeration.\n\nThe thing with game plots and game characters is that we usually compare them to other game plots and characters when we praise them, so "slightly less superficial than everything else" gets named "brilliant writing". The Longest Journey's writing could easily have been a book or a good movie screenplay however, and it definitely is shockingly better than most games I can name. Characters have personalities, distinct voices, motivations, relationships, lives. Their conversations make sense and are interesting. You get to care about everyone, and you can empathize with your down-to-earth yet epically heroic protagonist. The world-building and exposition never feels like a boring dictation that you need to click through to go on. Even the in-game Diary serves an actual purpose, adds to the story and delivers hints in writing that you really want to read. There is drama and silly jokes, grand adventures that get toned down with humor, an epic sci-fi/fantasy save-the-world plot with twists that make actual sense and don't leave gaping plotholes behind. It's all quite a feat, especially considering the theme.\n\nAnd yes, the graphics didn't age all that great, the gameplay doesn't reinvent the wheel, there's the long back and forth running through mutiple screens to patiently wait for, and some of the puzzles are what you'd expect from classic point & click adventures - namely not all that brilliant. But it honestly doesn't matter. If you like the genre, you have to play this game, there is a reason it's still getting mentioned so often. It's not just a true classic, it's also very much a joy to play.","July 2, 2015","true","17.7"," 54 of 55 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","54","55","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/recommended/6310/","76561197995992757","Derp Derp Kill Kill","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995992757/","1433 products in account","English review (Polska wersja, jak zawsze, niżej):\n\nBy completing the Steam version of The Longest Journey I have broken one of the most basic principles of gaming: One does not simply come back to playing a game that one loved more than ten years ago. But upon doing so I have to tell you two things: This game aged pretty badly. And it hasn’t got old one bit. These two sentences do not constitute a paradox.\n\nBack in the days, the art of TLJ was simply breathtaking, which nowadays clearly isn’t the case. The 2d backgrounds are still impressive, but all the models are old and ugly. If you’re going to play this game in modern times take my advice and override the display settings from your graphic card’s control panel. TLJ really benefits from trilinear filtering.\n\nHaving said that, besides the models and somewhat clunky and dated controls ( though nothing really serious) TLJ remains the most complete adventure game experience I have ever played. The game skilfully balances between the hard dystopian sci-fi and magical fantasy, creating a truly uniqe and extensive storyline, the characters –even these appearing for a few minutes – are charming and original, and the humor is clever and entertaining. Speaking of characters: the game’s protagonist – April Ryan – is perhaps the most developed and unique character in gaming. And also, it should be noted that the game soon turns much more adult and dark than one should expect from a story about girl jumping back and forth between the worlds of magic and reason ( but then it swings back to cheerful fairytale just to get even more serious in the next chapters).\n\nThe voice acting is stunning. Actors do an unforgettable job, especially during the final chapters of the game. This may come up as a surprise since if you pay attention to credits, you will notice that one actor often voices three or four characters.  Furthermore, the dialogues are written in a truly brilliant way – even the shortest ones are witty and memorable.\n\nWhile it can be argued that after finishing there is nothing much to come back to (there is The Book of Secrets but obviously I won’t tell you what’s inside…), a single playthrough took me 16 hours which is enough time for two point and click games. While the puzzles usually aren’t that difficult (usually… the rubber ducky puzzle)and don’t take that much time,still there is an INCREDIBLE amount of lore, and some dialogues can take few minutes while characters convey that information. Vestrum Tobias is particularly guilty of that, since he introduces April to the story of the world. Worlds.\n\nThe ending is perhaps the most fulfilled and satisfactory conclusion to a game I have ever seen, but it leaves a sense of melancholy. I will probably play this game in the next ten years just the way I tend to re-read certain books to measure them against the impact of years. This may be the only game in my entire Steam library that I would grade ten out of ten without hesitation. And in the meantime, I’ ll be waiting for The Longest Journey Home…\n\nPolska recenzja:\n\nKończąc Najdłuższą Podróż na Steamie złamałem jedną z najbardziej podstawowych zasad gamingu: Nie można tak po prostu wrócić do gry którą kochało się więcej niż 10 lat temu i oczekiwać że doświadczenie grania w nią nie uległo zmianie. Najdłuższej Podróży wyraźnie przybyło lat. Ale też nie zestarzała się nawet odrobinę – i nie, te zdania wbrew pozorom wcale sobie nie przeczą.\n\nSwojego czasu grafika Najdłuższej Podróży zwyczajnie zapierała dech w piersi. Obecnie tła ciągle mogą robić wrażenie ale wszystkie trójwymiarowe modele są zbyt proste, słabo oteksturowane i zwyczajnie brzydkie. Na pewno pomaga odwiedzenie panelu sterowania karty graficznej i manualne włączenie filtrowania – grafika odrobinę  na tym zyskuje.\n\nPomijając grafikę i nieco przestarzałe sterowanie (nic bardzo poważnego) Najdłuższa Podróż ciągle jest najbardziej kompletnym i spójnym doświadczeniem jakie zapewniła mi gra przygodowa. Gra umiejętnie miesza dystopijne sci-fi z bajkowo-magiczną fantastyką opowiadając wyjątkową i bogatą historię. Postaci – nawet te pojawiające się na chwilę – są urocze i oryginalne, opowiadane dowcipy nie są nachalne i potrafią rozbawić do łez. Skoro mowa o postaciach: April Ryan – główna bohaterka – jest chyba najciekawszą i najbardziej rozbudowaną postacią z jaką spotkałem się w grach. Trzeba też dodać że atmosfera gry szybko staje się dużo cięższa i bardziej dorosła niż można by się spodziewać po opowieści o dziewczynie skaczącej między światami nauki i magii ( a potem znów zmienia się w radosną bajeczkę tylko po to żeby w następnym rodziale stać się jeszcze bardziej poważna – nie pozwala się nudzić nawet przez chwilę).\n\nOsoby podkładające głos dokonały czegoś niesamowitego. Gra aktorska  – szczególnie w końcowych rozdziałach – jest genialna. Tym trudniej w to uwierzyć, biorąc pod uwagę że prawie każdy z aktorów podkładał głos przynajmniej pod kilka postaci. Co więcej dialogi napisane są po mistrzowsku – niektóre zostają w pamięci na długo po ukończeniu gry.\n\nSkoro już o tym mowa – skończyłem grę w 16 godzin  i właściwie poza Księgą Tajemnic (Oczywiście nie powiem co znajduje się w środku...) nie ma po co wracać do świata gry. O ile zagadki na ogół nie są trudne (chociaż … dmuchana kaczuszka) i nie zajmują wiele czasu, świat gry jest niezwykle bogaty i te 16 godzin to przede wszystkim zwiedzanie i dialogi – niektóre trwające dobre kilka minut, szczególnie jeżeli ktoś zacznie opowiadać historię świata gry. Światów.\n\nZakończenie gry – jak cała opowiedziana historia – jest piekielnie satysfakcjonujące, przemyślane i kompletne. I zostawia straszliwe uczucie melancholii – po 16 godzinach gry, czyli czasie którym można by skutecznie obdzielić dwie lub trzy gry przygodowe, szkoda było mi że to już koniec. Z całej mojej Steamowej biblioteki jest to jedyna gra której bez najmniejszych wątpliwości wystawił bym ocenę 10 na 10.  Prawdopodobnie odświeżę moją znajomość z Najdłuższą Podróżą za następne 10 lat tak jak to robię z niektórymi książkami, a w międzyczasie czekam na Najdłuższą Podróż Do Domu … czy jakkolwiek zdecydują się to przetłumaczyć.","August 21, 2014","true","16.3"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","42","44","0","0"

I've just recently re-discovered it on Steam during the winter sale and couldn't be more excited.\n\nThis literally was the first PC game I ever purchased with my own money back in '99.  Entire evenings and weekends and school breaks were devoted to this game.\n\nI forgot the name of it years after losing one of the discs (the monster 4 disc collection to install it back then) and used to ask people all the time if they had heard of this game.  None had, so I figured I was out of luck.\n\nYeah, the graphics are dated, but it's still a beautiful game.  The voice-acting is phenomenal for the time and pulls you in.\n\nI'm so excited to start the journey over again, this time with my boyfriend watching as I play and getting interested in the lore as well.  This type of game is not his 'genre', but he will sit and watch me go through it like he's viewing a movie, and pretty much, that's what this game is good about doing.  It's a slow moving movie, with a great plot and characters that you help move along.\n\nI even remembered the rubber ducky outside the window right off!  That's how long lasting this game stays with you.  I loaded the game, went through the opening sequence, and as soon as April was in her apartment I declared "There is a rubber duck outside this window that I have GOT to get right now!"\n\nI'm not a puzzle person, at all.  So that aspect of the game has always had me pulling my hair out, but I'm excited to take this game on as a 30 year old and not as impatient 14 year old, who'd give up and find a guide online to just get through it.\n\nLong story short:  If you love point-and-click stories.  Get this one.  It is most definitely my favorite of all time.  Right after that, find Syberia and Syberia II.  They're another series of point-and-click adventure games that I thought were from this same developer and they were very close to the style of The Longest Journey.","December 27, 2015","true","18.4"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","36","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokemaztre/recommended/6310/","pokemaztre","pokemaztre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokemaztre/","104 products in account","The Longest Journey is a LONG journey of our main protagonist, April Ryan. She's confused, clumsy, ♥♥♥♥♥y, and sometimes can be manipulative too (well it's the nature of the point and click genre), but you'll love her! You'll get absorbed into the witty, funny, and deep story about "Balance", it's just like reading a really good novel that you can't put down once you started reading it. The writing is just so good, it's worth mentioned again, it's so good! And the voice cast is seriously GREAT, they not just speak, they 'live' the role. Sometimes the dialogue can be so long and take a lot of time, but I enjoy every single of it (Hell I feel guilty if I skip the dialogue!). It's one of main strongest point beside the story of this game, simply amazing. If you play the game and reach the point where you meet Crow, the most narcissist bird you've ever seen, you'll know what I meant.\n\nThe art is masterpiece in concept, but when getting compared to modern games, it's still good but you can see some limitations in the execution, especially in the character department. The character's polygon still rough, sometimes the animation get glitch and weird, but hey what games in that year doesn't? If you see the art concept by their artist, you just can't imagine, how great the visual will be if its getting remade with technology that we have now. Thank God it's happening right at the moment!\n\nThe puzzle is cool, some are smart and fun, some just aren't. In some points you need to go back and forth one place to another, moreover if you miss one dialog with one character, or miss examined that one tiny point of the scenery, sometimes it can be exhausting. Some people simply just attracted to the story and get annoyed easily when get stuck, it's understandable. If you want to take the 'fast lane' I recommend the guide of  UHS Hints [www.uhs-hints.com] because it reveals the only information that you need at the time, one by one, so you will not be spoiled. I still recommend to solve the puzzle by yourself though, because of its rewarding feeling.\n\nThe game has one of the most satisfying ending, the feeling you got from finished that Bioshock game, it's there. I don't want to spoil too much, but I just want to say, whatever made you stop and not finishing this game, for god's sake just-finish-it. Even it takes a long time, just like me :) English is not my first language; I reopened the game after have better vocabulary, and it's the right decision\n\nWell, here I am, 14 years later, finished the game, and now I can confirm when people said that this game is one of the best adventure game ever made by human, it's true.","August 3, 2014","true","18.3"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","31","32","0","0"

Up there, if not more enjoyable than The Curse of Monkey Island, Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars and The Walking Dead - I can see now why it is scored so highly.\n\nFirst of all The Longest Journey no doubt requires a lot of patience. The game shares more familiarities with a novel, having an extraordinary amount of dialogue to go through and numerous objects to click on and explore. Story felt refreshingly unique and flows well. It is split into thirteen Chapters of varying length and themes. The voice acting is brilliant – characters feel natural, not samey and often time’s humorous (mature content).\n\nPuzzles on reflection were mostly straight forward, logical and challenging – and only had to use a guide for small sections of the game that didn’t make sense or where I forgot one piece of dialogue (you need to complete certain things in order to continue with the plot). Graphics and cut scenes look dated at first impression but soon becomes part of the games charm. Musical soundtrack does a fantastic job at conveying the different moods throughout the journey.\n\nChapter Three is the funniest, and cements the fact that this is now one of my favourite point and click games.

(har har)\n\nTo be completely fair, the graphics are, as expected, very dated. But as an avid fan of the old point 'n' clicks, that came as no surprise to me. That being said, the static backgrounds were often very good and at times even striking. Gave me that warm nostalgic feeling without ever causing any real troubles with seeing items or what is going on.\n\nProbably the highest compliment I can give to such a game is to say that I almost never came out of a puzzle still feeling frustrated. For illustration, let me compare this title to some of the old Sierra games (which I adore): frequently in Sierra games, you would either spend hours banging your head against the wall or break down and look up a hint to get you through some tough puzzles only to find that you needed to:\npound the wall next door to\nknock a painting off the wall which\nfell on a rat to stun him then\npick up the rat and\nchoose the correct dialog choices to make him bite you\nwipe your bleeding hand on your napkin in order to\nfinally get the red pocket square you've been needing.Yes, this kind of makes sense. But no level of thought would have ever led you to that conclusion on your own. So usually, you are left to wander around trying every verb on every noun in the blasted game until the solution just falls into your lap. Not a very rewarding feeling.\n\nOn the other hand, TLJ only incited that feeling once or twice. True, some of the puzzles were especially easy -- perhaps too easy -- but I went through the story feeling smart and engaged.\n\nThe last compliment I can give this game applies to the series (and studio) in general, but also applies here. Funcom/Red Thread are great at making their games inclusive (e.g. female protagonist, racial diversity, different sexualities) which really adds to the immersion for me. Being in a world that more accurately reflects the real world creates depth and allows me to get swept up on a journey of my own.\n\nThis is now one of my all-time favorite point-and-clicks and games and series. 5/5","July 9, 2015","true","19.0"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","23","23","2","1"

I saw the trailers for Dreamfall Chapters and wanted to play the first games to get caught up on the story.\n\nThe Longest Journey is definitely a "classic" adventure game. It has all the pixel hunting, item combining, and obscure puzzles that are the hallmark of the genre. I admit I don't particularly enjoy this aspect of adventure games, and am glad to see it mostly absent from more modern adventures. GameFAQs was my constant companion while playing this game, and thankfully kept it from becoming frustrating. The graphics are very... 640x480, and while I can usually look past dated graphics in older games, there were points where it was difficult to tell what an object was, or what was going on in a scene, simply from lack of resolution/polygons.\n\nI don't want to sound too hard on the game, because I actually loved it. Definitely the strongest point of the game (and why I think it's remembered so fondly) is the fantastic writing and memorable characters. April Ryan feels like a *real* person, and talks like a real person would. I loved talking to Burns Flipper or Captain Nebevay or Crow just to hear what they had to say. Admittedly sometimes people can be long-winded or launch into overlong explanations, but it never really detracted from the game. The story too, while at times dropping into fantasy cliches and being the Chosen One (TM) who can save the world, was still really interesting and mostly unique.\n\nThe Longest Journey is still a great game despite its technical/gameplay flaws, and if you're looking to get into the Longest Journey/Dreamfall series like I was, it's definitely worth playing.","November 11, 2014","true","17.8"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

It is a joy to observe her grow as a person as I play, from a woman unsure of her future and place in the world to a savior of the people.\n\nAlso, I love how Tørnquist successfully blends both cyberpunk and fantasy elements together to create a unique narrative.\n\nI don't recall encountering a nonsensical puzzle, either, which is a flaw that some adventure games have.\n\nUpdate:  It's still a wonderful game and I played through it again because I've been going through a TLJ binge, but I had some trouble getting the game to display correctly even though it had worked for me in the past.  You may need to run this in compatibility mode to get it to work.","October 19, 2014","true","35.4"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

After the commercial failure of Grim Fandango the future seemed obscure, and The Longest Journey was a shining light. Maybe I am too melodramatic, but I like to think that TLJ saved this genre, because it showed to everyone that it was still possible to make extraordinary point and click games.\n\nI won't tell you anything about the story, if not that it has a strong sci-fi/paranormal vibe, because I really want you to discover it entirely. The setting is futuristic, and you'll help the main character, April Ryan, discover the truth about herself and the world she lives in. The characters are deep and very well written, the story manages to be funny and allegoric at the same time, and the puzzles can be really challenging. Old School. Awesome. In the end FunCom and its lead writer at that time, Ragnar Tørnquist created a world that feels alive, characters you really care for, and a story that will make you think about our role in modern society. Even the smallest details are perfectly integrated in the main narrative arc. The Longest Journey is a must have for any graphic adventure fan, and a great game in general.\n\nSadly, as many early 3D games, if played now feels (graphically speaking) very outdated, but I assure you it won't be an issue as soon as you enter this fantastic world.

Sure, there are plenty of puzzles to solve, but it's the story that will have you hooked. You play as April Ryan, an artist who moved to Venice from the countryside,  who is struggling to make ends meet in her art career. Everything changes when she meets a man named Cortez, where she gets herself into a plot to save both worlds of order (science) and chaos (magic).\n\nGameplay is presented in the usual 'point and click' fashion. You click on areas of the map to move April, double clicking will make her run. You can press 'escape' to skip animations (if you allowed this in the options menu) and dialogue if you just want to progress through the story quickly (although I recommend not to skip the dialogue as you may miss important information). You can interact with characters and objects by simply clicking on them. There is an inventory system which allows you to store and use items to solve the puzzles. The puzzles  may be a bit tricky to solve as your not given a clear indication of where to go and how to solve the puzzles, which makes you refer to the 'trial and error' approach. Other times you will be moving back and forth areas due to some fetch quests. The store page says the game will last you '40 + hours' although I completed it in about 17 hours through using a wlakthrough (because I wanted to progress the story, without dealing with the puzzles).\n\nThe graphics are somewhat outdated in this current age. 3D-models are a bit blocky and the textures aren't as detailed as other games in the genre. Having said that, they do a decent job at setting the atmosphere in the various environments you roam in. The CG movies haven't aged well either.\n\nPlot is where this game trully shines. The story is unique and will keep you guessing as it unravels. Voice acting of the main characters (especially April herself) is excellent and believeable, minor characters voice acting are somewhat mediocre. Your emotions will be tested here as you will feel a sense of wonder and awe, fear, laughs and a bit of sadness as the you progress though the story. The music is also decent at setting the mood.\n\nFurthermore, you can unlock 'The book of secrets' which contains dialogue and music which were removed from the final product.\n\nI highly recommend this game to point-and click gamers looking for a good story and don't mind solving puzzles (although I do advise using a walkthrough).","January 31, 2015","true","14.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Where her quest was once fuelled by crushing fear and unwanted obligation, she’s forced to accept her role in things, personally investing in the worlds and the people she aids along the way. The twenty or so hours from the start of The Longest Journey until the end exhibits two very different April Ryans. Not necessarily better, but certainly different. It’s a story before it’s anything else; a tale of change and acceptance and hardships and how a simple rubber ducky could easily have led to the death of two worlds. It’s hard not to fall to that particular obstacle, but an unforgivable wrong not to find a way through.

However, although LucasArts certainly perfected the genre, and gave the world the SCUMM system, they by no means make the only good games.\n\nAll the way back to the Atari ST with games like Erebus, or Obitus, there have been some intriguing and wonderful games.  Even "Scoop" back on the Archimedes was fascinating in its own way.  But technology has moved on.  Branching story lines, throwaway disk space, FMV, voiceovers, you name it.       The main thing which more modern computers allows is for a variety of backgrounds, sounds and models.     This allows the game creators to generate a less homogenous world, giving you more of a sense of adventure.   How many old PaC games have spent their entire time wandering around the same desert island, or the same metallic city?\n\nThe Longest Journey isn't made by a mainstream distributor, like EA or LucasArts.  It snuck under the radar, and has sat on shelves in stores, or on Steam for a long time, with an unattractive, amateurish-looking advert.  the postive reviews, however, show that underneath a game that outwardly looks decidedly second or third-tier (like some of the "hidden object" games, is a compelling, almost-first-tier game.\n\nThe game starts off strange, and remains delightfully off-kilter all the way through.    It really leverages the universe that it's set in, to allow fast, interesting scene changes.   The artwork is luscious, and the voice acting is both hilarious, and excellent.  The music's pretty good too.  It's very satisfying to solve puzzles, and you get a genuine flow of story.  Solving a puzzle doesn't leave you thinking "now what?".  The in-game journal provides an amazing amount of back-story and hints.\n\nSo, why do I say it's only "almost" a first-tier game? Well, it has a few kinks.  Although it plays perfectly well on a Windows-7 PC, it is ageing.  The FMV is older-style "3DSMax" rendering, with high compression (Think Tomb Raider 2 FMV).    Also, it's short.  Don't let my playtime fool you, I had the game minimized for a lot of the time.  I actually finished it in about 6 or 7 hours.      But the length, and the slightly "B-grade" FMV isn't what knocks it off the top spot, it's the habit that the game has, of breaking its own rules.  I'll explain:-\n\nThe game is a series of "compartments", You finish everything that's within one compartment, using everything that's in that area, and then you move through to the next one.   This is pretty standard PaC fare, actually.  Early in the game, you get access to the "Metro", which allows simultaneous access to the the next compartment, while allowing access to previous ones.   9/10 times, re-visiting those older areas does you no good at all, you just go to the next 'opened up area'.\n\nHowever, there are a few times in the game where you hit a brick wall.  You're trying to "use everything-on-everything" (uEoE)  in the usual PaC way, but nothing's helping.  The only thing to do it backtrack to an earlier area, and do the uEoE approach again, in the hope that you get a different outcome.    Sometimes it makes a kind of sense... often you scratch your head and think "uhh.. that makes NO sense, I could have easily done that THIS way, if the game had let me".\n\nTo attempt to reduce the futility, the game flashes objects when you hover them over each other, to show that it's a valid response to uEoE, but you're still dragging, clicking and right-clicking for literally HOURS until you find that (for example- changing the objects, but not the logic), using the "PEPPER SPRAY"  (obtained in area 5) on the "DUCK" (in area 3), will cause a door to open in Area 7. Why? Because eventually, after going through the door, you need to go back to where the duck was sitting to get the next piece of dialog, which is dependent on going through the door in area 5.  This is just after you have used the "BREAD" on the "DUCK", and have had a piece of dialog that says "Ok, I better leave him alone then".     Hmmm.  Why go back and bother the duck, when the game just told me not to.\n\nSo, I had to resort to the walkthrough a few times because i'd spent too long uEoE and the combinatorial complexity was teeing me off.   There is another puzzle where the hint just isn't good enough to let you know how to solve it, and the combinatorial complexity is something like  4x6x6x6x6  to just get it "randomly" right..  A futher hint which doesn't ruin the puzzle completely reduces this to just 2x2x2 (telephone puzzle).\n\nDespite this, I had a wonderful time exploring the interesting world.   For a "indie", this is amazingly well made.  The outtakes at the end are great too.\n\nI totally recommend playing it if you like PaC games which focus a little more on the cyberpunk / fantasy / sci-fi realm.   It's not "Blade Runner" or "The Dig", but you'll really enjoy its humour and setting.    Very well recommended, but keep one tab open on a walkthrough page! ;)","November 16, 2014","true","110.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The actual gameplay consists of puzzle solving (at times brilliant and challenging, but occassionally nonsensically contrived) and dialogue selection, but the value is in the imaginative story that it tells and the artwork that supports it.\n\nIt's hard to say how someone new to the series would take to the game now, as it was an oddity even when it came out.

Having said that the 2D backgrounds are stylish in their own way and do a good job of setting the mood for each particular scene.\n\nIf you can look past the graphical shortcomings and take it for what it is, the writing, the characters and the world will blow you away. All characters are fully voiced and the acting mostly lives up to a high standard. The semi-orchestral soundtrack is also amazing and boasts some very memorable themes.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly standard point-and-click-fare. There are a few particularly obnoxious spots where the solutions can only be found by randomly combining things without any clear logic behind it (yes, duck clamp rope, I'm referring to you). All in all, much like the graphics, the puzzles are something of a weak link but still solid enough to not detract from the overall experience.\n\nThe story is the main attraction here. Combining scifi and fantasy the plot reaches some epic heights. It might start a little slow, but in my opinion it only makes it feel even more grand when it eventually starts picking up momentum. The story goes into some pretty dark places, and you might be in for a more mature experience than you may first think. When it came out and I first played it, I'd never heard so much swearing in a video game. Of course the industry has changed a lot during the years, and that aspect will probably not be as much of a shocker as it was then.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story, especially if they're into scifi or fantasy. Those more gameplay oriented might just want to give this one a pass, since the puzzles really are just a vessel for delivering the main attraction.","December 30, 2015","true","11.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is about 16 years old now, and it is stil comparable to some of the great games of today. The graphis were awesome I'm sure (~2000), but to some younger players the game may appear a bit Minecraftish. The story follows a heroin that goes form Art student to the destiny of becoming a savior of two worlds. While initially taking place in the far future of the Earthen city of New Venice she finds herself learning about "magic" and powers she has had since birth.\n\nThe characters in this game are well-developed and the main character herself, April Ryan, is quite funny and sarcastic. Both the conversations and her personal journal are humourous to read. The settings are really well thought of, and the futurisitc corruption of coporations are placed. It is a point-and-click game that is worth the money.  Also, if you're thinking of buying this game for your children you might want to wait until they're a bit older. (Lots of profanity and sexual references).\n\nMore about the game play....\n\nTHIS NEXT PART MAY HAVE MINOR SPOILERS\n\nThe game itself isn't too difficult to complete. It plays as more of a story with some actions, rather than actions that contribute to a story. It does have the typical puzzle solving that most point-and-click games have. I would say in general about 95% of the puzzles can be solved without too much difficulty. There were a couple of times I had to "cheat" by looking up walkthroughs. That rubber duck contraption to get the key in the railway was ridiculous. Also having to knock three times specficially to get the garage door open was kind of pushing it.  I ended up with some items that I'm not sure if I was supposed to use or not.\n\nI was a bit dissapointed that we never got to see what became of her art show and other tidbits about her personal life. Although, I read about Dreamfall and plan on eventually playing that. I'm curious if they're going to pick up on April's personal life in the sequel. I read mostly in online forums that her breast size changes. I guess that's what matters.\n\n\n\n","March 21","true","18.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I had read about it from the PC magazines in 1999/2000 when it came out and I've always found it quite interesting. Why it took so long for me to finally play the game? I don't know. But I'm really really glad I finally did play it!\n\nThe Longest Journey is a point-and-click adventure game in which the player takes control of an 18-year-old fine arts student April Ryan. The events of the game take place in the year 2209 and the futuristic city of Newport is quite believable. April suffers from strange nightmares and is stressed out to finish her artwork for an upcoming exhibition. Soon she is pulled into a dangerous adventure of fantasy and magic, and all her former petty teenager problems turn pretty meaningless, as a far larger destiny is waiting for her to be fulfilled.  I don't want to give away too much the story — less you know, more enjoyable it is.\n\nApril's is a likeable character. Luckily she's quite a mature gal for a 18-year-old! She can be a bit whiny and sarcastic sometimes, but mostly she's great and well-written. The pre-millenial 3D graphics don't add much for the character, but the voice-acting is superb. Sarah Hamilton does an outstanding performance as April. There are also many other memorable characters.\n\nAs mentioned, the 3D graphics haven't aged that well. Don't get me wrong, the game's still charming looking and all, but especially the 3D character models and some of the cutscenes are quite cringeworthy. They have the "late nineties awkward 3D graphics look". The voice-acting and overall sound are great.\n\nControls are basic point-and-click stuff and you cannot die or screw up — just the way I like my point-and-click adventure games. Some of the puzzles are kinda strange and ”out there”. I had to check out a walkthrough a few times. It took me about 13 hours to beat the game.\n\nThe detail of the story and all the small things are quite baffling. April keeps a journal throughout the game's story and it really feels like it's written by a young girl. The journal is not necessary at all, but adds detail to this masterpiece and a lost player can find some clues while reading it.\n\nTl;dr: A fine quality point-and-click classic with a compelling story, a highly detailed world and great characters. The graphics are a bit dated. Some of the puzzles are ♥♥♥. Highly recommended!","November 21, 2014","true","14.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

I didn't know what to expect from this game, especially since I'm not a huge fan of point-and-click adventure games, but The Longest Journey is easily the best p-a-c game I've ever played, and is a highly worthwhile title for its story alone. The backgrounds are beautifully done, but the character models are quite dated; that said, that doesn't really matter, because the writing, world-building, and characterization are incredibly manufactured and suck you so deeply into this adventure you soon don't care about looking at a blocky April texture. Seriously, there are more memorable characters in this game than the last several games I've played *combined*. Crow, The Wheel Man, The Flipster, and especially April - she's an incredibly *real* character. I'm just flabbergasted how well Funcom has pulled her off. She seems just like an 18 year old girl would, and the rest (or most important) of the characters are equally deep and interesting. To add to this characterization, the voice acting is also outstanding (mostly, there were a few poor ones) and...I just really can't get over how real April was, I honestly feel like I know her, and the rest of the characters too - they're very dynamic and just so well done. There are also lots of dialogue choices to pick through that don't pertain to *immediate* story progression used to flesh out the worlds and the characters - this was much appreciated, and made the created universe feel large and dynamic. There were other nice features as well: the setting was very unique, there was a video replay option to view the FMVs, nicely done music...However, the downfall of any point and click adventure game are the puzzles. Some are very convoluted. I remember one where you had to make a fishing pole out of some kind of string, an inflateable duck, and a bandaide. It was just too much for me, I admit, I used a walkthrough. That said, I would recommend using a walkthrough if you get stuck in this game - it's definitely worth playing, even for a p-a-c adventure game.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent (like really) characterization and world building\nMusic\nBackgrounds\nStoryline\n\nCons:\n\nConvoluted puzzles\nA little too much backtracking at times\n\nThis was a great adventure, after playing it I'm really excited to move on to Dreamfall and I've also kept my eye on the kickstarter for the new Chapters that's coming out. I'm now a bonafide TLJ fan. Even if point and click adventure games aren't for you, if you enjoy a wonderful story full of magic, rather adult themes (including child abuse), great writing, worldbuilding, and astounding characterization, pick up The Longest Journey and use a walkthrough if you need it. A-\n\nNote: Initially I didn't like the movement speed of the character - then I figured out you could double-click to run around. I also thought it was difficult to find where exits to different areas were on-screen - then I figured out if you press "X" it will show you. Keep that in mind while playing if you have the same difficulties I did. Also, as mentioned, the puzzles can be tough and not so obvious. The story, characterization, and world building are what makes this game great - don't let aggravating gameplay choices stop you from enjoying April's adventure, use a walkthrough.","March 11, 2013","true","16.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I am glad I gave "The Longest Journey" the chance, it didn't meet all those I stated, but it Indeed does have a fantastic story with great characters and settings. At first I did not really get into the game as it was a "Point & Click" type of game, plus it is quite old being released in 1999, with a few graphical tweaks I got the game working and looking decent with rendering issues.\n\nTo be quite frankly honest I did start this game quite some time ago, but never really got into it and put it aside, and I am glad I gave it a second chance as I could not stop and was always wondering what would happen next as the story picked up and drove me in.\n\nSo I'll give a basic overview of the story but I won't touch on it too much as I don't want to give too much away.\nYou are April Ryan, an 18 year old girl who ran away from home and moved to a new city to start a new life at an Art School Academy, working at a crummy cafe and living in a tiny room in a bording house with fellow students and friends. Stark is a futuristic world, in which you live in you yourself live in a place called "Newport". Life is going okay, your "average" student life and attempting to keep yourself alive with little pay until one day everything changes. April starts having strange dreams, and soon these strange things and creatures start burrowing into the real world, a mysterious man named "Cortez" helps you and guides you to your destiny. He tells and shows you a whole new world called "Arcadia" in which only "Shifters" can travel too, and April unknowingly is a Shifter, during her journey between Two World to restore the "Balance", April must confront many different trials in order to prepare for restoring the Balance, along the way she meets new friends that help her on her Journey. April has alot to take in, she must keep her sanity and focus on saving both worlds, as she only has a few days to do it.\n\nThe Gameplay, "The Longest Journey" is a point and click game, which I didn't mind after awhile I got used to it. That being said this game is quite "Hard", keep that in mind as it forces you to obtain items, combine items, and use items at certain moments, It may sound simple as I word it but It can become a mind bottling headache to attempt to figures out what to do next, there is also ridiculuous puzzles combinations such as "The Rubber Ducky" and others that will make you cringe when you do finnaly figure it out (If your lucky enough), most people tend to just look up a walkthrough though I prefer to figure it out myself. Let your imagination run wild with combining items, trust me the "stupidest" combo or use of an item you can think of will probably help you proceed to the next part of the game.\n\nThe Dialogue system is something I really enjoyed, your conversations can have many different turn outs depending on what you choose to say, you can be mean and crude or friendly and nice even silly in your responses to characters. April also keeps a Diary that you can access in the menu and ready her thoughts on her day to day activities, and struggles with everything that is occuring, all your dialogue you have chosen is also stored in the menu.\n\nOverall the game can be difficult, but the pay off is from the Story, Environment & Characters you meet along the way (Also the cheesy voice acting). This game has lots of great references to things in real life which is quite funny, but please note this game does have alot of Profanity in it (Swearing, Sexual References etc..) its better suited for an older audience.\n\nThe Longest Journey is a game that is hard to get into at first, but once you finnaly do it does certainly pay off.","February 14","true","30.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So i bought this game for the story it provides not for graphics. i played it the first 2 chapters than forgot about it and put it aside.\n\nSo yesterday i can upon "Dreamfall:Chapters" again searching for a game with heavy story telling, like "Bioshock infinite" but without the FPS, and i was ready to buy on sale Blackfrieday. But after a reaserch i made i found out that its an awsome game but if you havn't played "The longest journy" you'll be lost, and wont know whats it about.\n\nSo i remembered i had the game already, and started palying it from scratch, this time paying atention more closely to the story telling.\n\nThe actual review:\nSo the game has a very very rich story telling, The chracters in this game each have its own uniqe personality and history, which is manifested in very rich dialogs between the characters, the vocie acting is Holywood worthy, top notch voice acting. You get really sucked in to the story and conversations. the chracters really show personality, with their own humor, dilemas, downfalls and positives. This game is all about story telling.\nThe gameplay is very simple, and you have some very cool and excelently written puzzles which includes everything from solving "code" sequances, to manipulating people with object to, for example, go away from a place, or give you something. you also have dialog pussles where you have to make the right dialog to get something.\nBut it shines in story telling. everything is connected, and you actually find yourself rimembering parts of the story and understanding what is happening in the story. There is a clear line of story trouggout the game.\n\nShould you buy it?\nIf you want to buy Dreamfall:Chapters, this is than a MUST. since Chpaters builds uppon the first game.\nIf you would buy an Indie pixalated game for a few bucks, and you dont accept action but logics, than you should buy this game. It may have old graphics, but so do many indie games today and those are on purpose.\nAnd the main thing about this game, the story, the chracters and the voice acting, these all make you forget your playing a pixalated game (the game also has sound fx which really contribute to the atmosphere).\nIf your a fan of cyberpunk themes in games than you should also buy this game.\n\nFor an old game, this game deserves a very high score, since its really the 90's equivalent of "Bioshock:infinite" or "Last of us", that is story whise. So on my scale this game is a 9.5/10.\neven today its highly playable, and enjoyable and a must if you want Dreamfall:chapters.","December 1, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If I had to put on my objective hat and evaluate it I would be forced to admit that it does have some wonky puzzles at times (particularly in the first chapter) and a few instances of somewhat awkward massive exposition dump (particularly the first time you get to Arcadia), but the world it creates, its characters, and more importantly, the way it introduces you to and draws you into that world puts this game in a class all its own--not only among adventure games, but video games in general.\n\nAnyhow, regardless of its position in the history of gaming as a whole, I do think it's safe to say that there's probably no better adventure game on steam than this.

It is set in two detailed worlds (one technology and one magic oriented). The body models are rather basic compared to today's standards, but the background art and scenery are quite good. Most of the puzzles and uses of various items that you find are intuitive - not too easy, not too difficult - although a few instances where you have to combine items seemed a bit farfetched.","December 27, 2015","true","27.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/6310/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","There are a lot of stale fantasy games out there. Games about men with swords and false British accents fighting monsters and animals alongside Dwarves and Elves. Few are the games which can truly create a unique world full of unique creatures and characters, and a unique story to go along with it. The Longest Journey is proof that, if nothing else, those sword & Elf games are just being lazy.\n\nThe Longest Journey is a good title, I feel. There's plenty lot of plot, and it's pretty important. Seeing the plot through to its conclusion is also important. But in this game, I wouldn't hesistate for a moment to say that the journey is far more important than the destination. For all the characters, I can't think of one that I didn't like - hero, villain, or neutral. From an egotistical wizard, to a short-tempered and superstitious captain, to the duly unloved police force, to your ladies' bird sidekick, to Burns Flipper, they're all memorable in their own way. And all of the races you'll meet along the way - the complexly-named ones who sing to the soil, the tense-confused ones who experience their entire lives simultaneously and the flying ones who hold storytelling in one's own words to be integral to their culture, to name only a few - are so fascinating that for all the time spent learning about each of them, I'm a little bummed out that I couldn't learn more.\n\nThe places you go are as wonderful as they are mysterious, and are only made moreso by the clash between the two worlds - the technological world of Stark, and the magical world of Arcadia. When I first visited the Haven Age of Myst IV: Revelation, I was greeted with stormy skies, a rough ocean, and an upturned shipwreck, all looming ahead. Once I climbed the nearby rock and peered over the other side, I saw bright skies, and a colorful, inviting jungle. The sheer wonder of this clash stopped me solid in my tracks, leaving me to admire the sharply contrasting views for some time before finally moving on.\n\nThis is what The Longest Journey is like *all the time*. Just on a much larger scale.\n\nThe journey is indeed long, for an adventure game. It's not always entirely forgiving; there are one or two infamous moon logic-y puzzles that are sure to frustrate, but please don't let them dissuade you. Barring those moments, The Longest Journey is such a lovingly crafted adventure, full of twists and turns, technology and magic, characters and exploration, and Burns Flipper, and it's all held together by April Ryan, our caring but sarcastic protagonist. April Ryan is, in my own opinion, the best-written female character of any video game I've ever played. And it's a good thing too, given the sheer amount of dialogue she has, all vocalized perfectly by Sarah Hamilton.\n\nI play a lot of adventure games. The Longest Journey is without a doubt one of the best I have ever played, and I cannot recommend it enough. It's creative, it's well-written, it's mostly well-voiced, the majority of the puzzles make sense, and April only looks terrifying in the FMVs. Don't be on the fence about this one. Get it.","August 24, 2013","true","26.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first game out of 3 others was probably the best STORY-wise, and this is coming from someone who initially snubbed this game because of crappy graphics. Dreamfall was amazing with it's story, but I have to admit that this one is better. Granted, the graphics are VERY dated, but they were all the rage in the year 2000. The story is so good though, that after I stopped paying attention to it I got totally absorbed in the story of April Ryan, Stark, Arcadia, Abnaxus, Cortez! Even though this is mostly about April's journey, you'll find yourself caring for the "backup" characters. I know I did. I love the humor and wit in this, and how it wasn't afraid to be sassy or goofy (without resorting to cheap kid humor).\n\nIf you want a game that you'll probably never forget, this is a good one to get. Dreamfall TLJ and Dreamfall Chapters are good too, but trust me, play this first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adazu/recommended/6310/","adazu","Kat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adazu/","94 products in account","Disclaimer: This was one of my childhood favorites, and although I've replayed it a couple of times in recent years the nostalgia goggles are so tight they've become a part of my skull and cannot be removed. Tablespoons of salt required as condiment to this review.\n\nTLJ is a slow-paced point-and-click RPG with a unique world concept and layered, realistic characters. The story is the primary draw, as it is both well written and executed with complimenting dialogue. You're put in the shoes of an accidental heroine with a personality to match her background as a struggling artist in a cyberpunk-age Venice. She, and many other characters in this game may not be immediately likeable, but are given genuine character devlopment throughout. Well-written characters, the lore and depth of the world are the crowning jewels of this game. It is rare to find such a profound world concept outside a game based on a traditional tabletop RPG system. While the physical exploration of the world is limited to relatively small, contained maps at a time, exploration is achieved hand-in-hand with the storytelling and puzzle-solving and not as an elaborate sidequest. Many secrets and hidden and revealed in dialogue and visuals, and there is more to the world than what April herself sees. You may want to take notes.\n\nIn terms of Roleplaying, you cannot change April's character. You're not entirely playing the game as her, either. The player is like a ghost looking over her shoulder, she will talk to herself more like she's talking to you, but never remark upon your presence.\n\nTo address the gameplay, this is stricthly a point-and-click adventure. You will not be engaged in active combat, you will need to find ways to circumvent conflict and bridge gaps in the road. The puzzles can at times be archaic and occasionally absurd, but if you're patient and put occam's razor to good use you will find your way. If you fail to do this, or simply cannot handle puzzle-solving games, following a guide and playing this game just for the story is still worth it.\n\nThe game's length is about 25-30 hours if you don't spend a lot of time solving the puzzles. This is enough time to unfold an epic cyberpunk/fantasy-hybrid tale in the pace that it deserves. This is a game where you do not start in medias res, and the ending is not rushed; everything happens in due time.\n\nI would recommend this game to lovers of good stories. I do not have enough experience with puzzle-games to remark upon the quality of TLJ as such, but I can say as a well-versed RPG player and bookworm that this is story worth experiencing. TLJ sets its' own expectations and fulfills them. [10/10]","May 25, 2014","true","29.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls aren't particulary complex.  Left-click, right-click, Esc for the save menu, click to skip through dialogue.  Pretty standard.  The graphics looked dated when the game was new, and by today's standard they're antique.  Puzzles are pretty logical, and not very difficult.  Death is impossible.  But none of that is the reason you want to play this game.\n\nTLJ has one of the most incredible stories ever told in interactive format.  It's like playing through an epic-length novel in 15 or 20 hours of gameplay.  The voice cast is outstanding from front to back.  The lead character, April Ryan, is likable and intelligent, and by the end of the game, you'll feel like you know her, and you'll be sorry to see her go at the end of the game.  Despite being dialogue-heavy, this game is never boring.  The plot advances with every puzzle solved, every character spoken to.  The cultures of two entire worlds are brought into conflict through April Ryan.\n\nApril is an art student in a slightly-dystopian, near future version of our world, a high-technology two-class society.  Magic doesn't exist there any more than it does in real life.  But April gets involved in a complicated plot that finds her being trapped in a parallel universe on a world called "Arcadia," where magic is real, and technology is sparse.  April occasionally goes back and forth between worlds, and even into space, in order to save Arcadia and her own world, and in the process learns a lot about herself.\n\nBest $10 you could spend on Steam.\n","December 5, 2013","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One of logic and technology, and one of magic and chaos. They are kept separated and in order by this "Guardian" character, who spends a 1000 years or so before being replaced. But an evil organisation want to merge the worlds again, and there fore kidnapped the replacement, causing the old guardian to grow tired and leave his realm, leaving the border between the worlds week and messed up.\nYou play April Ryan have the power to move between the realms, and you seem to be the only person that can currently fix everything. So you go on a long, epic journey. And you meet all sorts of people and creatures. And you travel both the worlds. And it's really really good but I don't want to spoil more stuff.\nGet it. 9/10\n\nNote: Got stuck on some puzzles; broke down and looked them up. try to avoid this as it takes away the fun","July 19, 2015","true","19.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

So the big question is: how does this game (which I considered to be an adventure masterpiece a decade ago) hold up today? The verdict is mixed. On one hand, it nearly perfects the classic adventure formula (click stuff, talk to people, solve puzzles), the number of absurd puzzle solutions are minimal, and the story is well thought out. But on the other hand, the writing, while well-intended, sometimes comes off as amateurish. The script is also extremely verbose and really could have used some serious editing. The graphics, of course, are extremely dated, but that is easily forgiven. All in all, the spirit of the game holds up well, if not the technical side. Assuming you are a fan of the genre and can overlook its dated flaws, it is still fun to play today.

So The Longest Journey has everything what comes with it. It has  nice and epic story, decent characters and wonderfull atmosphere. I realy like the sense of humor in this game, I won't spoil, but some quotes are remarkable. There are drawbacks, like with almost every p&c adventure. First of all pixel hunting. There are few places in the game, where you must be pixel precise to find items and interact with stuff. Next, some events must be triggered in the exact order or you are stuck (yes. I mean the pizza box).\n\nSo I don't know. If you hate point & click genre, you better look somewhere else. However I like adventures, the genre is almost nonexistent today. Therefore The Longest Journey is must for me (and I think you would like it too :)).","September 1, 2012","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So The Longest Journey has everything what comes with it. It has  nice and epic story, decent characters and wonderfull atmosphere. I realy like the sense of humor in this game, I won't spoil, but some quotes are remarkable. There are drawbacks, like with almost every p&c adventure. First of all pixel hunting. There are few places in the game, where you must be pixel precise to find items and interact with stuff. Next, some events must be triggered in the exact order or you are stuck (yes. I mean the pizza box).\n\nSo I don't know. If you hate point & click genre, you better look somewhere else. However I like adventures, the genre is almost nonexistent today. Therefore The Longest Journey is must for me (and I think you would like it too :)).","September 1, 2012","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend this game to anyone, who wants to play out a really nice story that is more heavy on the dialogue and the text than the action.\n\nThe characters are certainly one of the best parts, and April as well as her friends made it a very enjoyable journey for me. The game felt really slow at times, especially when you had to wait for the characters to slowly move before they began dialogue, continued the story, or just allowed you to click around again. It certainly felt slower than what I have gotten used used to, but then again it is a long time since I played point and click adventure games.\n\nThe game is very dialogue and text heavy, but it kinda compliments the games slow pace and atmosphere. A few times it got annoying if the character was too weird or dull, but mostly April Ryan's personality made me enjoy it the game as a whole, as well as the diverse environment and cast.\n\nI only experienced one minor bug during my playthrough. When trying to save the game, return to the main menu, and close the game, the "are you sure window" just showed up as a white square. But after I realized I just had to press "y" or "n", so i didn't need to see it, it didn't really interfere much in the game or outside of it. So yeah, pretty happy I was able to play the game with no real problems.\nThough the "40+ hours gameplay" that it promised in the about section doesn't really seem right...

Hahaha. No. Okay, enough of that.\n\nThe best way to classify this game would probably have to be something like fantasy science fiction. A sort of Lord of the Rings meets Blade Runner. Lord of the Blade Runners. Yeah, sure.\n\nThe main protagonist, April Ryan, is caught between two worlds; a world of logic and science (Stark, Earth), and a world of magic (Arcadia). There is also another dimension containing all that is in between. It's an interesting premise but an all too familiar one, yet The Longest Journey executes it fairly well.\n\nThe introduction and conclusion to the story are very satisfying, but the main journey is quite empty and void of any depth. The characters are very one-dimensional and are lacking in personality and do not elicit any significant emotional connection. It's basically "travel from point A to point B whilst saving an entire race of people. Now travel from point B to point C and do the same, over and over again."\n\nThere are very few strong supporting characters who you will meet along the way, the rest are very forgettable and are bid farewell as soon as they are met. There are some interesting characters, especially one in particular who seems to hold the power of omniscience, but their back story is not explored as much as I would have liked.\n\nApril Ryan's attitude, her denial of everything that is happening, is very grating. She comes off as a pretentious teeny bopper but I'm not exactly sure of her age. She has to be in her mid-20s at the very least, yet she acts like such an unenthusiastic, apathetic, ungrateful little ♥♥♥♥. If I had the power to travel between dimensions my mind would be ♥♥♥♥ing blown and I would absolutely love it, but with April it's as if it is a burden. I can understand it from her point of view, but she never reconsiders just how important her task is, but rather complains about it right to the very end.\n\nHonestly, it's a long game. I actually had to force myself to finish because of how bored I was becoming near the end. It's a very slow and sluggish game. Everything, from character animations to voice acting, seems to purposefully artificially extend the game's length just by dragging them out as much as any single person can tolerate. Many, many, many voices are spoken at such a slow pace that it's far easier to rely on subtitles and read through the text, skipping their dialogue completely.\n\nThe pre-rendered backdrops are very beautiful and there is some fancy cinematography going on in a few areas, but the character models are ugly and honestly aren't much of a step up from Final Fantasy VII's blocky models. I preferred the sci-fi setting to the fantasy world, it just seemed so much more welcoming and familiar. Although the fantasy setting was sprawling with life, it became a pain to make friends and explain your predicament to every single person you came across. I kinda preferred exploring April's home town and speaking with her friends.\n\nThe Longest Journey could have been so much more brilliant had 3D point-and-clicks not taken over from their superior 2D counterparts. It's a shame it became such a huge fad in the late '90s and early '00s, point-and-clicks just don't work in a 3D environment as well as their 2D brethren.","January 24, 2013","true","26.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The logic of this game DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, and it's too freaking hard to find the items, you get through a lot of pixel hunting, IT'S BORING, and even harder and more boring it's to try to combine completely unlikely items and try to use them on some part of the screen all the time. And it's not "hard" of a nice challenge, but a frustrating hard. When you get the right answer, you don't get "Whoa, how I didn't think about this before", you just get "This was so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid". Voice acting is ok, at best. Dialogues are uninteresting and long. I like puzzles and point and click games, but this one is not worth it.\n\nDesisti desse jogo quando descobri que tinha que colocar um anel no meio de um par de cabos cortados pra abrir uma válvula que me deixava pegar uma ferramenta pra combinar com um pato de borracha que tu consegue jogando pão pela janela com uma linha que nem lembro de onde peguei tudo pra pegar uma chave em um metrô que serve perfeitamente em uma caixa elétrica do outro lado da cidade. A lógica desse jogo NÃO FAZ NENHUM SENTIDO, e é muito difícil achar os itens, tem que ficar fazendo MUITO "caça-píxels", e ficar combinando itens totalmente improváveis, e toda hora ver se consegue usar algum deles na tela em uma combinação mais improvável ainda. Não é um difícil de desafiador, é um difícil frustrante. Quando você consegue fazer algo, você não pensa "Nossa, como não pensei nisso antes", você fica "isso foi extremamente idiota". A atuação é ok, no máximo. Os diálogos são desinteressantes e longos.

It may take you about 15-20 hours to finish, maybe even more. It's a traditional point-and-click adventure game and it is said that it may very well be one of the best ever made. The story is great and the voice acting is actually surprisingly good. If you don't mind the outdated graphics and that the game still runs with a very low resolution (extremely low) it's worth playing through. There are a few tweaks you can do to make the game more compelling for the eye, for example running it windowed. I recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of point-and-click adventures.","October 22, 2012","true","17.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moosa17/recommended/6310/","moosa17","Phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moosa17/","355 products in account","For the first 1/3 of this game, I would have given it a "no." Then up until an hour or so before the end, I felt pretty neutral about the whole thing. By the end of the game, for whatever reason, I had fallen a little bit in love with the world(s) this adventure spans. So it's a yes, but with some warnings.\n\nThis game was created at a time when 3D graphics technology, even pre-rendered, was quite limited. It shows, big time. The characters are chunks of polygons and the animations in particular are quite absurd. Like, unintentional humor absurd. Nonetheless, I could see how this could be visually captivating for people-- 14 years ago. I didn't come into this game expecting anything other than dated graphics but it is not a game that has aged well in that respect.\n\nIn terms of "gameplay," there isn't a whole lot of it. It's an adventure game, so it comes with the territory that a lot of your time will be spent walking about and taking in the storytelling. This game felt like 80% of it was just spent listening to people talk. There's just a lot to listen to. At times, especially towards the first half, it can seem very slow just listening to all the talking. But there are eventually puzzles to solve. Unfortunately they're not good puzzles. If you're familiar with adventure games, you'll know there are right ways to do puzzles and wrong ways to do them. TLJ does them the wrong way. I was forced to consult a walkthrough several times in order to progress, and the things I was "missing" were always ridiculous.\n\nThe defining (if not redeeming) aspect of any adventure game of course is the storyline. Despite a funky opening, The Longest Journey doesn't exactly dash out of the gate. The aforementioned long-winded dialogues quickly reveal a diverse cast, but they're not all what I would necessarily consider "fascinating." Unfortunately the voice acting is extremely uneven. Rarely, it's quite good, but occasionally it's plain terrible, and often it's just "off" enough to keep it from being believable. The game is ambitious; it really tries for a lot of drama with developed characters and action and humor, and the acting really doesn't sell it. Admittedly, 14 years ago, it was probably pretty impressive. So the game throws you into the "Journey" with really little reason to be interested in it, largely because you're not sure what's supposed to be going on. Then soon enough things get weird, and you start getting a sense of the scope of all this weirdness, but it honestly feels pretty cheesy. For some reason it was enough to keep me coming back to playing TLJ again and again (it IS a long journey), and eventually the game lulled me into appreciating the depth of its story. I became numb to the games flaws and was left to contemplate how thorough a world was created here, particularly the many characters and their stories, and how they all together belong to something bigger. Still, it isn't fantastic, but it is something rather special. By the end, I was glad to have met them, awkward as some of them may have come across at first.\n\nThe Longest Journey was clearly a very ambitious adventure, and while it may not have aged so well, you can still sense the vision of the creators as something that is quite remarkable. The game's ending can be described as unsatisfying, but moreso than leaving a bad taste in my mouth it just left me wanting more. And, as it turns out, there is more. So that's where I'm headed next.","December 22, 2014","true","30.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The beginning of the game drags on a bit but it introduces all of the characters and gets you to care about them and familiarize yourself with the worlds. The game is over 20 hours long so you get your money’s worth and the art style has aged well over a decade. this game has as much attention to character development and twist as a well written novel.

I was promised an experience, not any experience, but the ability to experience what is known as "The Longest Journey".\n\nI go back to their proficiency (or lack thereof!) in the name, because it's key to what makes this so special-- if not successful. What is shown by the game is far less engrossing than how they amplify that, sometimes excruciatingly, until the pointing, clicking, and adventuring is raised to a gale force bellow. You're pulled so close to the guts of the mouse that by the end you'll think you could build one yourself.\n\nThe first half of "The Longest Journey" simulates how it must feel to be eaten alive-- at least until the second half, when player one attempts to eschew the paradigm, drowning in it. But in the back half of the game, the storm ends and it = switches to a hush. "The Longest Journey" is ambient and gentle, almost absent-mindedly turning upbeat at the end, and "The Longest Journey" grows so static that it's not even a dirge: It's lovely to play but bereft of tension.\n\nWhich is why I'm so curious about whether it's actually "good", if "good" even has a meaning at all (it doesn't).  Like early Pink Floyd, it, (both player and game as a one-self 'playergame'^[1]^[2]) engaged in an exploration that was unrehearsed and maybe even naïve. The game tried to become something other than the sum of its parts-- and by emerging from free and unrehearsed improvisation, the game resisted containers; the wails and ballads emerged organically, and their apparent goal-- of creating spontaneous, non-idiomatic, and exhilarating adventure-- was reached again and again, if only by proxy through existence.\n\nIt feels like the game wings itself in front of us-- thrilling us with new discoveries one minute, and the next, batting around ideas that go nowhere. Is the organ lineup here to stay? (Probably not) Is the pervasive melancholy a stylistic choice, a side effect of playing without truth, or an emotional reaction? Does "The Longest Journey" survive, evolve, or die?^[3] Whatever the future holds, this is some of the riskiest improv ever recorded: In every moment of the game, you just wish you actually went on the journey which was in fact, in the longest, but you just ♥♥♥♥ing don't.\n\nFootnotes:\n1: As put fourth by Charles Montagu Doughty in The Titans.\n\n2.

I have trouble staying awake while playing this game. It is sooo slooow. For example, if you want to make the protagonist, April, walk from one end of an area to the other, you simply click where you want her to walk and then... WAIT. And wait. While she walks. Make that stroll. Saunter? She's obviously in no hurry. Okay, looks like she's finally there now. Now? No, now. There. Several minutes later you can start her walking to her next destination. (Update: Apparently she'll jog if you double click.) Let's see, what else bothered me? Shortly into the game we get to interrogate her landlady in detail about her lesbian lover. That, I'm sure, is pivotal to the plot somehow. When I tried to save the game I would lose my mouse pointer, but luckily I found the enter key worked. I can only exit the game via Task Manager/End Task and when I do, all the font on my desktop reverts to the crappy font from the game.\n\nRhetorical question: Regarding the abysmally low helpful review rating by the community...

Longest Journey has much more severe issues. The interface is kinda clunky, which is surprising, considering this game came out long after Day of the Tentacle, Fate of Atlantis, Full Throttle and all the other timeless masterpieces from Lucas Arts.\n\nIf you want to embark on this journey, prepare yourself for the slowest walkcycle ever, unskippable and pointless animations for every item-pickup and a severe lack of shortcutting screen transitions. In a way, I get now why it is called the "longest" journey - because backtracking in this title is painful, especially if you are used to doubleclicking screen exits and "insta-transitions" as established by LucasArts. A considerable amount of time "playing" this game is watching April Ryan move aaaaall the way from one exit to the next. Forget an item? Well, you are out of luck - you have to slowly get back there. Which is even more annyoing when there are one or two "mood"-screens to traverse that have no real point other than to set the scene, I guess.\n\nI will be frank, I have NO patience for this. It's really, really frustrating me. So much pointless clicking, so much waiting. Same can be said for the puzzles which are arbitrary and non-sensical. Sure, the key to a random fusebox (in a different part of town) just so happens to be laying on the subway tracks (and don't get me started on the contraption needed to lift it up from the tracks). The game doesn't strike me as oddball enough to go crazy with the "wild" combinations of items - and there are hardly clues what you are going to have to do or where to get stuff for that task. This brings the game to a fullstop several times forcing you to pixelhunt and endure more slow-walking. Adding to the overall frustration.\n\nNow, if the story and characters would be captivating or exciting I think I could have endured longer - but unfortunately that is the other big issue of the game. I am at Chapter 3 now, and the game is barely done shoving exposition down my throat. I mean, really - three chapters in and it turns out to be a basic "you are the chosen one"-story? So far, the game has been a boring collection of "bargain-bin fantasy novel"-tropes (good vs. evil, unlikely hero, secret orders, parallel words, high fantasy medieval crap and dragons).\n\nI am not intrigued by it, and to be honest - I really don't care to go on. I highly doubt the game will pick up the pace any time soon or the characters become any more interesting. The delivery of the whole thing is just so off and unappealing to me - I feel like I am wasting my time.\n\nThere are much better (older and newer) adventure games than this and I prefer short trips anyway - I am done with this.","June 22, 2014","false","3.0"," 29 of 87 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","29","87","0","1"

Trust me, I believe it.\n\nI like to consider myself a patient person but this game has way too much dialogue for its own good. It's hard for me to stay engaged when conversations go on forever and most of the dialogue is fluff. I'm sure I'd give this game another shot if they just trimmed the fat and focused on more of the core themes of the story.\n\nThey tried far too hard to make April a normal everyday girl and maybe they have succeeded to an extent. But she doesn't come off as relatable, or heroic, or even interesting, she's just all around bland... and whinny. So, damn, whinny. This wouldn't be so bad if the side characters were interesting. There are a few here and there that are, but not enough to slog through the entire game.\n\nI'm sure there are people who would enjoy this game for what it is but I expect my games to engage me on some level, whether conceptually, emotionally, or through raw stimulation.

Some of the puzzles I got to in the hour or so I played just felt illogical. I normally give "combine these two object" puzzles a pass in adventure games -- but there were several times when I had no idea what to do because you know, I didn’t pick up the one obscure object back at the starting point that you need like six or seven scenes later? Ugh.\n\nThere's also the fact that playing on laptop without a dedicated USB mouse means that every time you click to do anything you pull up the inventory. That's just an irksome mechanic that while it started out annoying become bothersome enough for me to stop playing over it.\n\nI really did like the idea of the game; and if you're playing on a console or with a dedicated mouse and don't mind swearwords essentially every sequence of dialogue then I'm sure it lives up to all the hype about it I'd read.

There's a lot of blah-blah about these people and that culture, but you don't *see* it. Much of the important information you need to know to progress is just dumped on you. There is no pacing and it becomes somewhat overwhelming (there is a conversation log that is helpful).The story itself was interesting enough, but the vast majority of characters are *not* particularly memorable (despite what many appear to claim). In fact, most of them are intolerable. 75% of the male characters are literally the exact same grumpy, horrendously sexist piece of ♥♥♥♥, but with a different face. So if you're looking for something deep story-wise, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nI don't even feel like I know the main character. Aside from the very beginning, very little time is spent getting to know April Ryan - every interaction becomes about the main plot or the universe's lore, and we learn about these sexist side characters a lot more than we ever learn about her. There is no meaningful character development. Despite its title there is no emotional journey for April Ryan - she seems to take things in stride pretty well all things considered. The only thing I know for sure is that she is frequently on the receiving end of sexual harassment and/or discrimination.\n\nI won't lie. I liked it enough to finish it - and I don't regret playing it (not too much, anyway). But I would definitely *not* recommend it and I would not say it was a good game. If it's on sale REALLY cheap and you have nothing better to play, sure. The puzzles were pretty good - you have to be creative and they were relatively satisfying to solve. I was more interested in what puzzles lay waiting than the progression of the story. Maybe the story was applauded because it was more in-depth and complex than most other games in its time, but I've played better games and read better books.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Interesting universe with some fairly intriguing lore\n+ Some creative puzzles that were pretty satisfying to solve\n\nCons:\n- Boring music (aside from a few standouts almost every track has the same "subtle" ominous feel to it)\n- Boring cast - frequently recycled personalities\n- Too much exposition\n- Weak voice acting (had to turn voices off)\n- Unnecessarily heavy doses of sexism*\n-- Seriously, can't April get a break?\n\n*It served no purpose for me other than to make me despise almost every male character. I don't know if it was trying to be funny or enlightening to the then majority of gamers (men). Would it have been too much to ask that at least the one consistent companion NOT be a sexist ♥♥♥?

Though it is an old style point and click adventure game and the graphics are dated, the puzzles never felt to be too hard or impossible to solve. If the longest journey was a book, it would be the kind where you're reading but after a little bit the words melt away. You're still reading, only you see the entire story in your mind like you're watching a movie, and you will quickly loose track of time as when you next look at the clock hours will have passed. That's not to say that the game is without its flaws - a few npc characters have foul mouths and other elements. However, story and character wise it doesn't get much better or real than this game.

The characters are very well rounded, and even though the 3d characters are VERY dated in appearance, you easily get past that after playing and getting pulled into the story. The best friend you can have when playing this game is to set in options the use of "ESC" key to speed things along. Sometimes it can take April a long time to walk to places, and though the dialogue is interesting... some of the characters can be quiet long winded.

The story bridges two worlds - a sci-fi dystopia and a fantasy world full of strange magical creatures. It's rare to find a story that manages to incorporate dragons and hovercraft, castles and spacestations and the game manages to do it almost seamlessly. The characters are believable with realistic motivations for the most part, and the voice acting (and almost everything is voiced - which is a rare treat for such an old game) is very good quality. It is easy to get frustrated with the pace of the game, however. Several people I know gave up after the first few chapters, and I almost fell into that trap, but it's well worth persevering through the endless *walking* (even with double-click or Escape to make her run, the protagonist seems agonisingly slow sometimes) and the extremely linear puzzles which sometimes have the oddest and most unlikely solutions. If you get too frustrated, as I did at some points, don't feel too guilty about doing a little cheating. It's worth a little shameless googling sometimes to get on with the story. The ending is a little abrupt, and I felt that I was wishing for something more, but maybe it's just because I missed talking to Charlie one last time!

The characters are very well rounded, and even though the 3d characters are VERY dated in appearance, you easily get past that after playing and getting pulled into the story. The best friend you can have when playing this game is to set in options the use of "ESC" key to speed things along. Sometimes it can take April a long time to walk to places, and though the dialogue is interesting... some of the characters can be quiet long winded. So read ahead of them and use ESC if that bothers you. Play the game, once you get past the first chapter you will be hooked.

And thus begins a long journey (huehuehue) to keep the Balance between these worlds protected by finding and restoring the lost Guardian of said Balance.\n\nAdmittedly, the story isn't much of a contender for "greatest ever" - it is certainly good, and sure as hell kept me wanting to find out what was next, but many elements will stand out to you as having been done many times before, and possibly even a little annoying at times.\n\nNo, what really makes the game work are the characters. In particular, April herself, who is one of the best protagonists in the world of video gaming, demonstrating an impressive range of emotions and reactions to everything that happens. You are well-advised to query as much in this game as you can - every comment, every snark that April makes on examined people/objects is another glimpse at her personality, and few characters are so well developed as her.\n\nThe gameplay itself is generally well-done for point-and-click fare, although admittedly the story sometimes works against it - there were times when I wanted to find out badly what happened next and was immediately confronted with an annoying puzzle, eventually leading me to consult a guide for puzzle hints so as to minimize wasted time. If this happens to you as well, I wouldn't worry too much about it, and treat it as a compliment of the story engagement.\n\nWith regards to presentation, it is simply an unfortunate inevitability that the visuals do not hold up well today, although in most cases this shouldn't be too distracting. The music, when noticeable, is generally thematically appropriate, but by no means particularly memorable. Voice acting on the other hand...is generally very well-done.\n\nDefinitely an interesting and memorable game. I look forward to playing its sequels.","August 29, 2014","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grubbses/recommended/6310/","grubbses","Grubbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grubbses/","150 products in account","The Longest Journey was an old game when I first played it and that was probably about 6 or 7 years ago. Then and now the graphics don't hold up terribly well, but considering that it was launched in 2000 I'd say it's not that bad. However even now the voice acting, story and dialogue are still fantastic after all this time and it's in these areas that Longest Journey truly shines. Like a good book you can't put down, I was sucked into the story immediately and hardly noticed the time passing until looking at the clock to see that it was the middle of the night. The themes are mature and intelligent, the dialogue extremely well crafted, and the characters believable. I almost feel like I need to exhaust all dialogue options because I want experience all of it and to see what the characters say and do in each situation.\n\nIt still has faults in the same way that point and click games usually do - the solution for the puzzles are sometimes opaque, or sometimes you know what you need to do but you're pixel-hunting to find where exactly you're supposed to click - but these are problems with the genre and not this particular game. However, there are relatively few of these genre-related problems given how long ago this game was launched.\n\nThe one glaring problem that may make this game unplayable for some people is the graphics - if you can't stand fairly blocky character models and low-res textures then this may not be the game for you (just check out the screenshots on the store page to get a good idea). Out of all the re-make games coming out, this is a game that deserves an HD remake. Once you look past the aging graphics however, you will be transported to an incredibly detailed world with an inventive mixture of fantasy and sci-fi in this excellent story.\n\n9.5/10","September 9, 2014","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember playing Sierra's Torrin's Passage when I was a child, and this game hit me with an extra large dose of nostalgia. When it comes to point-and-clickers, The Longest Journey dominates the field and is a classic staple that all people interested in the genre should definitely check out.\n\nIf you like point-and-clickers, expansive storylines, and challenging puzzles, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good, but the graphics are very, very dated. Despite this, the environment and the examinable items (in your inventory) remain well-detailed.The character models are a bit lacking, and this is most evident during cutscenes. The music and ambient sounds are approporiate for the themes presented throughout the game, The story is slightly convulted, but also fairly easy to follow if you take the time to read/listen to the dialogue. Your character records her thoughts in a diary, and these can be helpful for summarizing key details and better understanding the story. Each interactable character provides a good amount of backstory and lore. The voice acting is great, but I personally find the main character's voice a bit irritating.\n\nThe controls are simple and typical of a pount-and-clicker. There is no tutorial - you are simply dropped into the game, however, it is easy to pick up how to play if you experiment for a few minutes. The learning curve id minimal to moderate - the most difficult thing so far being item combinations (a number of the possible item combos are not obvious). I've also picked up A LOT of items, but their value and use have not yet been determined in my playthough.\n\nThe game and story are very cool - the main theme centralizes around two worlds (the magic and non-magic worlds) that can be traversed through "shifting," or moving through portals. At the end of each chapter, you are usually presented with a choice of two options, each potentially moving the story in a different direction. Much of the game involves you combining items and giving them to people, or using them to get more items. You can also "look" at certain items in your inventory, and experimenting with clicks on different areas may yield a new item added to your stash.\n\nYou can press "x" to show all the exits in an area, and this is useful if you don't want to scan with your mouse for different exit points. There is a metro train system, where you can travel to other unlocked areas freely.\n\nOverall, this game provides a very good point-and-click experience, and I suggest you give it a try if you are interested in that particular type of gameplay. The story is well-written and pretty expansive, so you will be spending a lot of time reading/listening to dialogue (all skippable).\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 20, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grubbses/recommended/6310/","grubbses","Grubbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grubbses/","150 products in account","The Longest Journey was an old game when I first played it and that was probably about 6 or 7 years ago. Then and now the graphics don't hold up terribly well, but considering that it was launched in 2000 I'd say it's not that bad. However even now the voice acting, story and dialogue are still fantastic after all this time and it's in these areas that Longest Journey truly shines. Like a good book you can't put down, I was sucked into the story immediately and hardly noticed the time passing until looking at the clock to see that it was the middle of the night. The themes are mature and intelligent, the dialogue extremely well crafted, and the characters believable. I almost feel like I need to exhaust all dialogue options because I want experience all of it and to see what the characters say and do in each situation.\n\nIt still has faults in the same way that point and click games usually do - the solution for the puzzles are sometimes opaque, or sometimes you know what you need to do but you're pixel-hunting to find where exactly you're supposed to click - but these are problems with the genre and not this particular game. However, there are relatively few of these genre-related problems given how long ago this game was launched.\n\nThe one glaring problem that may make this game unplayable for some people is the graphics - if you can't stand fairly blocky character models and low-res textures then this may not be the game for you (just check out the screenshots on the store page to get a good idea). Out of all the re-make games coming out, this is a game that deserves an HD remake. Once you look past the aging graphics however, you will be transported to an incredibly detailed world with an inventive mixture of fantasy and sci-fi in this excellent story.\n\n9.5/10","September 9, 2014","true","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Longest Journey conveys the feeling of exploring the fantastic and mysterious well, in addition to offering several thrilling situations.\n\nI feel the largest stumbling block is found in chapter 7, where a crystal puzzle has too many options that could have been correct based on the hints that are provided.

The world building is amazing, the settings are gorgeous, the voice acting is Hollywood quality, and the story itself is one of the best I've ever seen. If you're like me, and drawn more towards the story in a game than the actual gameplay, buy this immediately. The game is visually stunning, even when you take into account the late-90's CGI characters. Their animations are a bit slow and clunky, but to me, the beautifully rendered 2-D backgrounds more than compensated. And the characters themselves were so well thought out and well-rounded, with stories and lives beyond the game, combined with top notch voice acting, that it makes me care a lot less about what they looked like.\n\nThat being said, I felt the gameplay was a little flat. Some of the puzzles were pretty obscure, and there was a lack of in-game hints (there were times I had absolutely no idea even what puzzle I was meant to solve; I think they really missed the opportunity to make April's diary more helpful in that respect). And, like most point-and-click games, there is no danger if you get things wrong-- the game just won't progress until you do them correctly-- and replay value is, unfortunately, nil. It dragged in a few places, either from the clunky character animations, or just too much dialogue, and I often felt more like a passive watcher of events than the main character out to save the world.\n\nStorywise, there's not many games out there that can compare to The Longest Journey, and in the end, the story is one of the most important aspects of a game to me. As it is, I'd rate this an 8.5/10. I think if it had just been a little more interactive, or maybe had some alternate endings, it would have been the perfect game for me, late-90's CGI and all.","April 6, 2014","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was perhaps the most epic, involved, creative, and intelligent story I've come across in a game.  At the same time the writing and voice-acting are uneven across the entirety of the game.  Some clever humor is appreciated, but it too often strayed into just plain corny and bad.  The voice-acting was not very convincing on the whole, kept afloat only by the smart dialogue.  The puzzles were good overall, but at times quite inane and illogical.  Some of the solutions just weren't logical and I don't know how anybody would have figured them out on their own.  Also keep in mind that this game is nearly 15 years old.  The graphics may have been good when the game was originally released and some of the environments are nice, but by today's standards, the graphics are extremely poor.  The characters are at times gruesome looking regardless of how long ago they were produced.

On one hand, it's got pacing problems all over the place. The game's divided into 13 chapters, but not really, since some of the chapters are four times as long as others. And the game spends too much time worldbuilding; I can understand a certain extent of it but characters go too far in-depth about tiny things that won't ever be mentioned again. There's a lot of talking, also. A lot of talking. And plenty of instances where it will take you 15-20 seconds to run across a screen; and there's the option of walking it, too...\nPlus, the game is admittedly kind of hard to take seriously due to its datedness. The CGI cutscenes where you get close-ups on the characters' faces... the stiff animations... I found myself laughing at some of the most tense scenes in the game because of that.\nThe story itself is also kind of cliched, but that's kind of the point. The main character, April, is in fact entirely aware of how cliche it gets, which kind of makes it permissable and enjoyable. The gameplay is standard point-and-click stuff. The puzzles aren't the most obscure but they can be tricky and the slooow pacing can make them more annoying than necessary.\nReally though the major issue I do have with this game is its pacing, I still enjoyed it but if it had better pacing I'm sure I'd have enjoyed it even more.","March 1, 2014","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The protagonist April is a lovable character, and the voice acting really makes her seem like that she could be a real person.  The game starts out pretty slowly as you learn everything about yourself and the world around you, but it picks up.  Some of the puzzles can be a bit obscure, but it doesn't take away from the story.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys point-and-click games or quality storytelling.","March 22, 2013","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/recommended/6310/","ryanyth","Encephalon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanyth/","441 products in account","Be Forewarned: This is a pretty old game and you may have trouble running it on modern machines. I personally encountered the "No FMV/Cutscenes playing" problem until i had to set my Power Options to "High Performance" which solved the issue. This solution may, or may not work for you.\n\nThis review may also contain minor puzzle spoilers.\n==================================================\n\nThe Longest Journey is a graphic adventure game that was released back in 1999 by Funcom. During its time, it was hailed as one of the best graphic adventure games ever made (which i never played. I was more interested in Lucasarts and Sierra games in those days).\n\nThe most important element for any good adventure game is a good story, and this game most certainly delivers, although sometimes abit too much. It starts off simple enough, about an 18-year old art student April Ryan, her daily frustrations about school and boys until she starts having strange dreams and visions. What follows next is a mind bending over-the-top story plot spanning 12 chapters that will involve parallel universes and saving the very essence of reality. This is a very complex story indeed but can sometimes be too complex due to the many story jargons it throws at you and may be kindda hard to follow at times.\n\nThe art style have not aged very well. While the background art still does somewhat holds up well enough although barely, the 3D character art looks extremely dated. The look is reminiscent of early 90s 1st generation attempts at 3D characters in a video game. While this may be passable in 1999, it definitely looks ancient now in 2013, though I certainly cannot fault it for that. The game also runs at at maximum of 640 x 480 resolution, so it will look extremely pixellated running at full screen on modern widescreens. Sadly, there was never any "HD" patch ever made.\n\nGameplay wise, it adheres to the "Lucasarts" gaming philosophy where you will never ever come to a premature Game Over screen just because you forgot to pick up a tiny crucial object 30 screens before. Thankfully it also does not have any timed action sequence QTEs, although there is a very insignificant one at one of the later chapters, which can be easily done. The player need only focus on the story and puzzle solving.\n\nAs with any adventure games, puzzles are always the meat of the game, and unfortunately some of the puzzles in this game can have very obscure solutions. (I'm looking at you "Telephone Statue" puzzle). More then once, i had to consult a walkthrough because some of the solutions are too cryptic. Alot of times, i also had to resort to the "Use everything in my inventory until something works" tactic.\n\nThe puzzles are also definitely anything but subtle so to speak, and are put there for no apparent reason other then to present a challenge for the player to solve instead of it having a functional and logical use in the world. Alot of puzzles don't make alot of sense in their solutions. (Eg: Minor Spoilers: Who in their right mind would go touch a digusting green gloop on the ground that probably looks radioactive? Or dance around like a mad loon just because they see a shadow telling them to dance?" Basically don't use logic when you try to solve the puzzles, think "out of the box" instead.\n\nBefore wrapping up this review, theres something else that i'd like to add in that once you finished the game, you will unlock an extra option called "Book of Secrets" which is a collection of voice acting outtakes and unused/concept art that were used in the development of the game. This is considered to be quite a rare addition especially for a game released in 1999 where such bonus additions were rarely seen.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nFor old-school hardcore adventure gamers who appreciate a very complex story and don't mind tackling very obscure puzzles, this is definitely a game you should pick up. For younger gamers however, i'd recommend if you can watch a video preview before committing to it, as this game definitely shows its age now.","May 25, 2013","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The storytelling is extremely compelling and got me hooked all the way, never a moment of dullness (maybe except when I was struggling through some bizarre puzzles. I'm looking at you Mr Rubber Ducky).\n\nEach character is memorable in its own way, from April, and Cortez to Brian Westhouse and even Constable Guybrush! And of course, Crow, who brings such joy and laughter to any tense moment April might have. I really enjoyed April's comments on almost everything she sees (this is lacking in Dreamfall, sadly). It gave her great depth of character and her insights to the world around her. Her sense of sarcasm will be remembered!\n\nThe voice acting is top notch as well, combined with atmospheric, haunting, yet beautiful soundtracks, I was easily pulled into the world of Stark and Arcadia (completely forgotten of the low-res 2-D background environment). The extensive dialogue at some parts can be a bit long, but it gave the much needed background story to set up the rest of the events that are yet to be unfold.\n\nThe puzzles can be a bit on the unconventional side but they were not unsolvable. The game isn't hand-holding whatsoever, you just have to think a bit harder to get there!\n\nOverall, I am extremely impressed with this game.

For a title almost 15 years old, some elements of course  have become dated - the pre-rendered cutscenes are a clean giveaway - but Ragnar Tornquist's ability for story telling more than makes up for this. He created a universe of two worlds where The Longest Journey tells a great story and lays the groundwork for further developments. Dreamfall neatly expands on this and as of Q4 2012 it is clear that he will work on continuing the story in Dreamfall Chapters. If you are a fan of adventure games and you can appreciate a good story development I would recommend The Longest Journey. It's a great game in and of itself and if you have become involved into the world and characyers, you can continue your experience in the sequels.","January 2, 2013","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In reality sexual harrassment happens every day (unfortunately) so I am on the fence not sure if I should shake my finger at the creators for reinforcing this sexism and sexual harassment or acknowledge them for creating a realistic world full of realistic societal problems including settings with background characters depicting gangs, prostitues, and my favorite half unconscious junkies all while April completes her long journey.","June 24, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is also great, each character has its own unique characteristic that makes the game much more atmospheric to find so many different types of characters stringed together in the story. It has a great soundtrack to different enviroments and places that you encounter in the game, making it a much more pleasant experience. Overall the game is very pleasant and enjoyable and worth checking out, but it must be warned that since the game is old, it only runs in a 4:3 resolution (something like 640x480 at max) and I've also noticed that DSR (for NVIDIA users at least) causes the game not to have cutscenes properly shown, even when not using it, just enabling it causes this issue. But other than that, the game runs competely flawlessly. I definitely recomend this game for fans of point and click adventures or just story-rich games in general.","July 7, 2015","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are only a few harder but still managable ones. If I still got stuck - which happened quite often - I just took a look into a walkthrough. But that wasn't because I couldn't solve a riddle, sometimes the game just doesn't give you any hint at all on what's your next (illogical) step, there are some easily missable items and sometimes you have to trigger an event by looking at some insignificant thing in the environment.\n\nHowever, the greatest thing about this game is its story. It's exciting, you always feel that you're getting forward and you find a lot of lore throughout the game.\nSo basically there are two worlds: The logical world Stark, which is basically a dystopian future of our own, and the magical Arcadia, which is some kind of a dream world. (Notice the Lovecraft reference? It's not the only one)\nThe game keeps putting you in both of them, whereever you are it feels entirely different but it still manages to make sense.\n\nThere are few things I don't like about The Longest Journey, for example the epilogue was kind of pointless and there are some things that could have been explained better, but really, the pros overweigh the cons by far.","January 2","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world building is amazing, the settings are gorgeous, the voice acting is Hollywood quality, and the story itself is one of the best I've ever seen. If you're like me, and drawn more towards the story in a game than the actual gameplay, buy this immediately. The game is visually stunning, even when you take into account the late-90's CGI characters. Their animations are a bit slow and clunky, but to me, the beautifully rendered 2-D backgrounds more than compensated. And the characters themselves were so well thought out and well-rounded, with stories and lives beyond the game, combined with top notch voice acting, that it makes me care a lot less about what they looked like.\n\nThat being said, I felt the gameplay was a little flat. Some of the puzzles were pretty obscure, and there was a lack of in-game hints (there were times I had absolutely no idea even what puzzle I was meant to solve; I think they really missed the opportunity to make April's diary more helpful in that respect). And, like most point-and-click games, there is no danger if you get things wrong-- the game just won't progress until you do them correctly-- and replay value is, unfortunately, nil. It dragged in a few places, either from the clunky character animations, or just too much dialogue, and I often felt more like a passive watcher of events than the main character out to save the world.\n\nStorywise, there's not many games out there that can compare to The Longest Journey, and in the end, the story is one of the most important aspects of a game to me. As it is, I'd rate this an 8.5/10. I think if it had just been a little more interactive, or maybe had some alternate endings, it would have been the perfect game for me, late-90's CGI and all.","April 6, 2014","true","36.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are only a few harder but still managable ones. If I still got stuck - which happened quite often - I just took a look into a walkthrough. But that wasn't because I couldn't solve a riddle, sometimes the game just doesn't give you any hint at all on what's your next (illogical) step, there are some easily missable items and sometimes you have to trigger an event by looking at some insignificant thing in the environment.\n\nHowever, the greatest thing about this game is its story. It's exciting, you always feel that you're getting forward and you find a lot of lore throughout the game.\nSo basically there are two worlds: The logical world Stark, which is basically a dystopian future of our own, and the magical Arcadia, which is some kind of a dream world. (Notice the Lovecraft reference? It's not the only one)\nThe game keeps putting you in both of them, whereever you are it feels entirely different but it still manages to make sense.\n\nThere are few things I don't like about The Longest Journey, for example the epilogue was kind of pointless and there are some things that could have been explained better, but really, the pros overweigh the cons by far.","January 2","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a monumental game, and one I can't recommend enough that people play.\n\nThe best thing about The Longest Journey is, hands down, its story. You play April Ryan, and young art student who's just found out she's a "shifter" - a chosen one who has to maintain the balance between two worlds - Arcadia, a world of magic, and Stark, a world of technology. Both worlds are rich in lore and fascinating to explore, and the characters you explore with are witty and charming. There's never a dull moment in The Longest Journey.\n\nI think my favorite things about the game is the way it breaks stereotypes. Not just in our protagonist, considering female protagonists were very rare at that time, but the twist at the end. The subversion of the "chosen one" trope so frequent in fantasy stories was really awesome to me, even though it was heartbreaking in execution. The ending to the game broke my heart, I'd grown so close to April and her sidekick, Crow, that seeing them both suffer disappointment made me so sad. It was an amazing feeling to connect with characters like that, and one reason I'll always recommend The Longest Journey.\n\nOne thing to remember about The Longest Journey is that it was released in 1999. It's a seventeen year old game, as of writing. But it still warrants saying... the graphics didn't age well. The backgrounds actually still look really pretty, but the characters look really blocky and low-res. For people who are used to realistic, high res textures, it can be jarring. Still, it's worth it to try to appreciate this game for what it was at the time of its release. Along with the graphics, another product of its age is the bugs. I didn't encounter a ton, but the ones I did were frustrating. There was a particular issue with saving and loading saves that I kept having, I couldn't overwrite a save spot and I couldn't load a save while playing, without the game crashing. Thankfully, that was the only major one I encountered, and I was able to play through the whole game without too many problems as long as I didn't mess with saving too much.\n\nOutside of the age, my other complaint was a pretty typical one for adventure games - some of the puzzles just don't make sense. Here's looking at you, rubber ducky. There were some really great puzzles in The Longest Journey, but I found it got bogged down by what I can only describe as video game logic. You basically have to scour environments for random objects just because. It doesn't make sense in the actual game's logic, we just do it because we know we'll need that random piece of chewing gum later down the line.\n\nHowever, frustrating puzzles aside, this game is truly great. Experience the story for yourself. Honestly, this whole trilogy is great and definitely worth playing.","January 16","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is so engrossing, it was often hard to stop for the night. If you're a fan of the genre, you must play this. Several times, I found myself thinking it reminded me of Gabriel Knight, so if you liked that, that's a good sign.\n\nI do have 3 complaints. First, there were a few puzzles where I thought the solutions were absurd. I had to look at a walkthrough about 3 times, fairly early in the game. Second, there are LONG unpausable conversations. Finally, you can't play it at anything but its native 640x480 resolution, so it's stretched and badly pixelated at fullscreen on a modern 16:9 screen. Don't let these things stand in your way, though. It's a great game.","February 18","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm only a couple of hours into it. The graphics look like they were made in the Alpha version of Blender. But I'm really, really enjoying it. It feels like the games I used to play growing up and it still holds up to this day. It's really nice to take a break from the twitch games and go back to when games really had story and depth. It goes on sale quite often so I would totally recommend picking it up.","February 11","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are definitely showing their age, there's no autosave and I ran into one bug where I couldn't move and had to reload, thankfully there's a fastforward button that skips through most animations and conversations.","January 2","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looked pretty interesting and it was then that I learned about it`s predecessors and how I missed them. All of them. Never heard of the "Longest Journey" before.\nAnd so I decided to go and play these titles. Starting with the first part of the trilogy.\nAlthough I hab some difficulties with the immersion at the beginning of the game which were all caused by it`s really badly aged character models. The scenery looks even today pretty, but the 3D rendered models do not. But nontheless I kept playing and oh boy I don`t regret a single second of it. This game is amazing!\nIt`s storyline could have easily been a book. Or a movie. It`s fantastic. I loved this little masterpiece.\nThe games characters are full of life and absolutly believable. And most important you get to care about them.\nBrilliant writing.\nEveryone who like me several weeks ago didn`t play the game yet, please do.\nEveryone needs to play this, although the game is not flawless. The puzzle logic is sometimes questionable to say the least and the graphics aged not too good. And I wished there was a little more crow. Still this game is a masterpiece.\nBest adventure game I played so far. Even better than monkey island.\nLooking forward to the next titles of the dreamfall series.","April 27","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great buy! The game is a bit dated in graphics but the story makes you forget that. CLICK EVERYWHERE! I\'m still playthrough but so far every time I\'ve been stuck It was a matter of looking around the environment better or not checking to see what fit together. Good thinking game, not so much of an action game.","June 1","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
