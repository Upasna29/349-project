FMV was taking off, and a slew of adventure games came out, one of them including Myst. What made Myst so special, you ask? Well, it told a story from a new perspective, and had mind-boggling puzzles. It really gave you this sense of adventure. Sure, the game has aged like ♥♥♥♥, but it's a good trip down memory lane. Get past the graphics, and you can treat yourself to an adventure classic.\n\n*NOTE* This game has techincal issues on Steam, and I have experienced crashes, and has made the game almost unplayable. It's very glitchy and unstable in this condition. If you desparately want the game, try out GOG. The game probably runs fine with Win XP, but watch out for anything newer.","November 27, 2013","true","0.9"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","43","44","0","1"

Why? I dunno.... gotta move on to something else... 'nuf time lost....\n\nI changed my review after getting a personal comment from Noitalever.\n\nI run a Win7 64bit Pro and to run this game requires that the Myst.exe run in compatibility mode for XP service pack 3. Find your steamapps folder > common > Myst Masterpiece Myst.exe and right click to properties. Check box for XP SP3 compatibility. Leave all other boxes clear [I tested each one and in combination without improvements]. Doing this back flip in Win8.1 requires more technical knowledge than I can explain. Better to find an updated release that specifically supports Win8.1 on another digital download service : )\n\nThis compatility mode restored transitions, videos, and better volume control for at least 5 minutes. Yeah I know what you are thinking... FM sideways....\n\nI played this game in 1994 on a Mac with a 15 inch screen and it was beautiful.\nIn this 2011 re-release to the PC you relieve the wonder of this magical release. Note that  it impossible to get this to play full screen unless someone would like to share this secret with me; there is a black box around the play screen  [Note I tried setting various screen resolutions and color depths without improvement ]\n\nThis is one of those relaxed games, a thinking point and click without any time constraints. If you are a fan of this genre you will be delighted.\n\nThe time to Experience this Modern Digital Art we call Games is Now. It will be very hard in the future to play Classics and so seize the day.

Not only was Myst a technological masterpiece at the time, it also gave adult players that same exploration and puzzle-based point and click adventure that kids were consuming in waves. Puzzles are rarely difficult, and just require you to write things down or explore everywhere, at most. The beauty of Myst is the sheer level of immersion. You're not told what to do or where to go. You just open a book and climb in, and since all you're doing is clicking stuff to interact or move, it leaves you free to explore the universe of Myst and take it all in. Be prepared to do a little reading and puzzle-solving, as well as a lot of exploration. Buy this game if you want a deep and immersive experience, if you're interested to see what all the hubbub was about back in the 90s, or can't get realMyst to run right on your computer (it can happen).","November 26, 2013","true","0.5"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","1"

I was hoping that the availability on Steam meant this awesome game would be miraculously ported to modern platforms, but I had the following problems:\n- no animations worked.  Anything that was animated just didn't happen, such as the message from Atrus giving you the clue to rotate the tower.\n- occasional full crashes.  You can't even use Task Manager to kill the process, you have to reset the machine to recover.  The crashes were mostly due to saving the game, but also occasionally due to animation.\n\nI got it to work through the whole Channelwood Age (+- about 5 reboots), but because of the above I had a hard stop at the clock tower, whose puzzle involves animation and continually triggered a freeze.\n\nI'm off to try realMyst-Masterpiece, which was developed much later (2014) than this (2000).\n\nUPDATE: "realMyst: Masterpiece" is definitely the way to go.  Even ported to a 3D engine, the game still looks visually appealing, but more important is that it is rock solid on Win 8.1, and they cleaned up a few gameplay issues.\n\nIf you're interested in playing Riven, I can highly recommend the one from GOG.com over the one on Steam.  I tried both, and the GOG version was also rock-solid compared to the Steam version.","April 1, 2014","false","2.0"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","7"

It's simplicity and odd charm still ring through today, even though it is a point and click from the early nineties. I truly love this game, and I recommend it to all who are looking for something just a little different. The puzzles are not too hard, the art is gorgeous and the story is enthralling.\nBest to keep a pen and some paper with you while playing though, as note taking is essential.\nMy one complaint would be that it is too short, but to fix that there are four more games in the MYST series, going on to Riven, Myst 3: exiles, Myst 4 and Myst V. After that is URU: ages beyond Myst, and Cyan, the creators, are currently working on Obduction, the sequel to Uru. I cannot wait to get stuck into this series, and the rest of you shouldn't wait either. Myst is only 4.99 on steam and it is money well spent. So what are you waiting for?

It's an adventure game in a first person perspective where you click on your screen to turn or move forward.  Unfortunately, the resolution is stuck at a 640x480 detail level, so full screen does not look that pretty by today's standards.  What changed in Myst compared to other games is that you were told absolutely nothing and given no direction whatsoever.  This is all about exploration and figuring out what the world expects of you.  Now, this can make it extremely difficult if you are not able to catch the little clues hidden throughout the world of Myst, or this can make it really feel like an adventure as you search every nook and cranny for the clues needed to pass each puzzle throughout the world of Myst.  There are different islands to go to which offer different environments and a variety of puzzles.  The world itself can feel very lonely at times since the only characters you will see are typically embedded in books where finding pages throughout the world will help reveal more of the story.  However, the story is very short and succinct compared the long list of puzzles that you will go through.

Myst is a Point and Click game where you get to explore amazing worlds and solve puzzles.\n\nPlot:You bump into a book called Myst. Opening the book sends you into Myst Island. Now all you can do now is explore this desolate island and discover its secrets.\n\nGameplay:Myst is a Point and Click game meaning that clicking to where you move,turn, and look. The game contains many puzzles. But don't fret! The puzzles aren't that hard making it a much more enjoyable experience and feeling pretty achieved for solving these puzzles. Myst also requires you most of the time to take notes which is critical for solving puzzles. You will find info which contains clues and solutions. This game also runs in quicktime FMV's. Since this isn't a great port, You might occur a bit of game freezing and sound bugs.\n\nGraphics:Myst is made with CG and is shown with FMV's. The game is shown in pictures with some FMV animations sticked to them. Allthough this has all aged, it still looks great and does well on what its trying to present to you.\n\nMusic:There are some locations in the game that contain music. They are nice simple little loops and a nice touch.\n\nBefore I end this off. I'll give a few tips to make your Myst experience and enjoyable one:\nUse a pencil and paper to take notes\nDon't look at any guides or walkthroughs. That will just wreck the experience.\nRun this game in Windows 95 combatibility mode since the FMV's won't work without it.\n\nOverall Myst is an excellent game and and it has greatly inspired me. Its also only $5.99 making this an easy reccomendation.","January 15, 2014","true","13.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I can't reccomend it enough. It's a great point and click puzzle game where you land at a mysterious island in the possession of a strange book. You find 2 brothers stuck in 2 books, each telling you to help him and not the other. So you choose. And go on a strange book trip to help him.\n\nThe puzzles aren't hard per se, but they're decontextualized. That's the hardest part of the game: trying to figure out what the hell does [insert thing here] do and to what is it related. Not that this game is hard, not at all, but you have to be good at connecting clues. Some more obvious than others (  ♥♥♥♥ing spaceship trip I tell ya  ).\n\nNow there are some things to keep in mind as this is an old game. You may not be able to play it due to compatibility issues (Windows 10 worked fine for me but 7 did not). In that case you always have the realMyst versions. Many copies have an awful bug at a certain rotating tower where it doesn't turn North or West. It forces you to check a guide for the clues but does not prevent you from leaving that Age and finishing the game. Given how old this game is there's really no tech support from the devs, so don't bother.\n\nThere isn't a whole lot going for replay value besides the  4  different endings and different dialogue but it's still a wonderful experience and I definitively would love to visit the island of Myst and the remaining Ages as well.","January 22","true","22.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

(Although if you get stuck, you can click the bottom of the screen for hints.)  The world is interesting and the plot is unique.

I must have spents countless hours with my brothers and I recall actually beating the game. While it hasn't aged well and the gameplay is vague, it still has one of the most interesting stories that pulls you in. Trying to play the game again though, well, I just couldn't do it. I just couldn't imagine trying to get past all the ridiculously mind boggling puzzles or trying to read several guides again. I clicked my way through the island for a bit and it did bring back some nostalgia, but it also brought back some severe head scratching moments, like, "How the ♥♥♥♥ did I manage this at 8 years old?"\n\nWhile it's a great game for people that have never played it, it really is nerve wrecking and will just make you mad.\n\n10/10","December 6, 2013","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a puzzle game with a deep story which you can easily get invested in but when you tell people it's about books they turn their heads and question you. Or in the worst case they'll say something stupid without letting you finish like "Pfft. Nerd." The story in question (free of spoilers) is about some random bloke finding the book fo "Myst" which when read takes this unknown person to the island of Myst. Upon entering Myst you get adventurous and creepy vibes about the island and it's good fun when you finally discover the answer to certain puzzles. A puzzle in itself is actually getting the game to work functionally. Depending on what Operating System you the compatibility can be completely random. Crashes can be frequent for some and I've heard of some people having visual glitches. Luckily for me on my Windows 10 PC I did not have many problems except for one specific certain area crash which could easily be fixed. The big fix to this is buying the remake: realMyst: Masterpiece Edition but the compatibility issues are not as bad as I've made them seem so you could just live with this version.","August 4, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You're a man who somehow, falling through a book, end up on the Island of Myst. No one is around, and theres nothing but a note sitting on the ground waiting for you. From here on you have to figure out the next place you need to go, and do, all with your own wits.\nThe game is difficult, but the beautiful scenery and the feeling of being totally alone keeps you playing. Game-wise, this version of the game is a sort of railed adventure game. That rail deviates and splits hundreds of times, but it keeps you from wandering off into the forest with no reason. Those who dislike that, there is another version entitled "Real Myst" which removes that rail and allows for free movement.\nGraphic wise, I believe this game stands up even today.

Save a buck buying it on sale or buy the myst pack and get all the games. The puzzles themselves are very creative and unique I've never seen puzzles like these in any other point and click puzzle solving game. The storyline is very good although it's overshadowed by the time consuming puzzles and because this is game 1 in a long series the storyline gets so much better as it goes on.

It solves none of the vast compatibility problems you're faced with in getting the original game to work, and I was not able to discern any graphical improvements.  (I had been under the impression that the graphical update was the entire purpose of this version of the game).\n\nIf you have an XP box sitting around somewhere, you might be able to get it to run on that.  Anything newer and you'll face monumental problems in getting it to work.  (Of particular note is the need for an ancient version of QuickTime that Steam failed to package with the game (it handles DirectX and .NET and uPlay, so it seems reasonable to expect) - I've heard both 6.5 and 4 referenced; I think I was able to get the original game running with 2 point something.  OldVersion.com is where you'll want to be going to handle this part of the compatibility issues.)\n\nIt's a pity.  The original game is quite the excellent puzzle game, and Masterpiece Edition really sounded like the most faithful remake option.  (Free-roam exploration has its place.  Uru and Myst 5 did an excellent job in demonstrating that place is NOT in Myst games.)   And yet, despite that bias, I'd have to suggest anyone wanting to play the original Myst (who isn't an old hand at wrestling with major compatibility issues or a collector of old computers) should go for realMyst.  Unlike the sequels (particularly Riven), the stuff you'll need to find isn't so much hidden as walled off by puzzle-barriers, so you won't have to worry about missing important factors in the background details because you have nothing indicating that a particular area is worth taking note of.  (There's a couple things in Riven I'd never have found in free-roam - they show up because you're forced to look at it from a fixed perspective...kinda like that sidewalk art that looks entirely 3D if you stand in just the right spot.)","February 3","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

(on Win10 64bit)\n\nSooo... if you want to play a classic, mysterious, pathbreaking point'n'click game from the 90s, it should be a safe buy now.
