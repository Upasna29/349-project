And most of the times you need run away from the enemy just because they have thousands of troops and you have few peasants.\nThe final battle of the final mission give you something different...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/recommended/15170/","freelancer799","Freelancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/","1054 products in account","Heroes of Might and Magic V is a turn based strategy game in a long series which started back in 1995 with Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest and has been an extremely popular and successful strategy game for many years with the 6th game in the series coming out in October of 2011. As mentioned, HoMM V is a turn based strategy game where you control one hero for each army. The hero has 8 slots for 8 different units but they can have as many units as they would like under their command with that unique unit. The different units include classes such as archers, soldiers, cavalry, archangels and devils, ghosts, ghouls and many more. When your hero travels along the map they can pick up different relics and items that can increase attack, defense, luck, moral and other abilities and items that will help in a battle. They hero can only travel so far per day and after they are done they pass their turn on to the other opposing player whether that be AI or Human.\nDuring their turn they can fight any enemies within their range which in turn starts a battle with a grid like system. These battles are also turn based and are based on the units speed not necessarily strict turn order. If an archer gets a lucky shot in they can get a boost and moral and actually go again either right after or sometime before their original turn order. Some units are faster than others; for example, griffins can go twice before the peasants even go once.\n\nDuring the game the player can also take over cities, towns and keeps. The main city can be upgradable which allows you to build different units and upgrade others. Along with that the player can also higher other mercenary heroes that can have their own armies and travel around under the player’s control. Towns and keeps have certain units tied to them that each week replenish and can be bought by the heroes to add to their armies. In order to upgrade/build buildings and buy these units the player must capture strategic resources all along the map that include wood, ore, gems, mercury, sulfur, crystal and gold.\n\nThe story is a pretty simple one and spans across 6 different campaigns (the expansions add 2 more) which include Haven, Inferno, Necropolis, Dungeon, Sylvan and Academy. I only got through the first campaign as the game is very long but in this one Isabel the Queen is about to get married to King Nicolai when the demon invasion causes them to get separated and she is working towards getting back with the King while killing as many demons on the way as she can. She eventually finds him dying from some demonic spell that Agrael, a demon, attacks him with and is determined to get revenge against all demons and after which the dying king declares her ruler of the Holy Griffin Empire when he dies.\n\nThe graphics of the game are fairly basic and even for their time they weren’t anything special. In 2006 when we saw this game launch we saw other RTS and TBS games such as Empire at War, Company of Heroes and Warhammer 40k. So even if I was judging this by today’s standards it didn’t really even live up to the standards of 2006 when the game launched. Though there isn’t anything really wrong with the graphics, they just feel dated and not as impressive as other games of the time. There was one thing that kept bugging me about the game and that would be the camera. You couldn’t click on different items in the world without moving it around or if there was a fog of war it forced the unit to go all the way around or wouldn’t allow the unit to go forward at all.\nThe Sound was also equally bland and the music was very repetitive. The music didn’t so much get in the way or be annoying it just didn’t change very much. The voice acting wasn’t anything special but it wasn’t awful either. However the sound effects were unique for each unit so there is that. The biggest thing for me however was the setting the game was in. There are so many different areas and creatures in the game that it made for a very interesting adventure through the first campaign just getting to know this world.\n\nOverall I can’t really compare this to any other game in the series as I haven’t played them however I have really enjoyed the gameplay of the game so much that it made me want to buy the 6th game in the series since I know the graphics have been vastly improved and look very impressive. I am giving the game a little boost in rating due to the limits of technology at the time however my 5 tiers are what the game rates to today’s standards.\n•	Story  - 2 out of 5\n•	Gameplay – 5 out of 5\n•	Graphics – 2.5 out of 5\n•	Sound  - 2 out of 5\n•	Fun – 5 out of 5\nPros:\n-	Great Turn based gameplay\n-	Can be Hard and rewarding\n-	A nice learning curve\n-	Interesting world and lore\nCons:\n-	Music/Sound are ok, nothing thrilling\n-	Story is ok however the world is great\n-	Irritating Camera\n\nI’m giving a Total score of 74%\n","December 3, 2013","true","4.3"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","56","67","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drisana/recommended/15170/","drisana","Drisana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drisana/","618 products in account","Okay first off, for all those who want this game but read the system requirements and thought "Oh drat, I cannot play this on my system, I have a windows 8 and it says up to XP only". I have GREAT news for you-I have this game, on a cheap 350 dollar notebook from walmart. It has a windows 8 OS. This game-runs PERFECTLY on it. I did not even need to change or alter any compatibility settings or mess with the graphics or audio configuration. On default layout, no changes at all-it runs perfectly. Now, obviously, I cannot guarantee this will be true for absolutely everyone. I can however say given how cheap my own computer system is-I think this game would work for almost everyone running a windows 8 system. Probably also the same with windows 7 but I cannot say for certain on that one.\n\nNow onto the game itself. Heroes of Might and Magic series is a well known and well loved series for a number of good reasons. First of all, there are different races, all with their unique units and hero specializations. This particular Heroes of Might and Magic is I feel the best of the series so far (Yes, better even that Might and Magic Heroes VI.) The graphics are fine if not great, but the game itself is what makes this game so much fun. With both single player, multiplayer, and even hot seat player capability you can play with friends far or near, or solo. It has campaigns for each race, all of which combine into one epic story on love, loss, and each faction.race fighting to survive and rule over all.\n\nCombat is laid out on a open fiend or fighting to defend or gain control of a castle/keep with wall fortifications between you and the enemy. You have control over all of your units and can even through leveling you hero, gain control over the war machines in your unit such as the first aid tent, the ballista, and the catapult, allowing you to heal the units of your choice or aim the ballista at a particular target, or have the catapult try and take out only the door or remove the turret towers aimed at you as a example.\n\nThe units themselves can have special abilities. For example, the demon units can use a skill called gating, to summon up more of their own kind to join you for the battle (These gated units are temporary and vanish after each battle). The Undead units with the help of their hero can rise again after death, and if you defeat living targets, can even spend dark energy points to raise them again as undead units in your army (the type of unit they turn into depends on how powerful they were before). The list goes on.\n\nOutside of the campaigns which are fun and throw new challenges at you to keep the game fresh and fun (and also tie into the storyline perfectly), such as having to avoid a enemy or outrun them to a safe zone to meet up with a particular hero or town. Other times you have one week to take over a town and set up camp before having to wipe out the enemy that stands in your way and so on.\n\nThe game play itself has a little learning curve, to understand what different objects on the map do for you, and figuring out how best to defeat units or how to control your own to the best advanatage-but the learning curve is built into the storyline so you are not derailed by some overtly lengthly tutorial. You simply learn as you progress and by the mid-part of the very first campaign, you'll be a expert hand at building up your keep, controlling your units, and understanding how to level your hero to your advanatage (Though more time playing with all the races will be needed to fully see what is the best way to level a particular hero).\n\nEach hero has it's own unique talent as well. There is a elven hero who has a powerful ranged strike and boosts the damage of all it's groups hunter (archer) units. There is a demon hero whose spedciality is making each ballista shot explosive, doing extra damage each time the ballista's turn comes around. There is a Magic Hero who specializes with the smallest of units, the gremlins, who jhave a ranged blunderbuss shot attack that means a huge army of many small minions with a combined strength enough to take down far more powerful units of lesser numbers. The list again goes on. So it is in your interest to read up when you build your tavern, where you recruit new heroes, to see what each hero does and choose the one whose specialization you need most-someone who can race over the landscape and explore it our simply outrun the enemy, someone who brings extra firepower, or someone more specialized for a particular foe or to best defend your keep while you take your main hero out into the fray.\n\nThe game is, in fact-complete in every sense as is, but if you finish the campaigns and want more-good news again! There are two expansion campaign games for this game (look at the DLC for the game or buy the whole collection at once for $19.99 USD). Each one adds a new race and continues the storyline. First, the dwarven race and then the orcs-also calle dht eribes of the East.) I highly recommend both expansions as the races are fun, enjoyable, and and a completely fresh set of skills and tech and units to the game. The orcs are particularly amusing, as you can have cyclops through goblin in a kamikaze fashion into the face of enemy units. It only costs one mere goblin, the cheapest of units, to do a massive damage spray with the help of your powerful cyclops' throwing arm.\n\nIf you love having complete control over a army, a castle, and a hero-if you enjoy besieging castles and trampling the enemy under hoof and claw, if you have ever enjoy any turn based, fantasy game with a bit of storyline-then this game is for you. You will NOT be dissapointed by it.\n\nFor this game by itself without the DLC, it costs a mere $9.99 and offers many hours of gameplay and has endless replayability with the multiplayer mode (Which you can play solo as well against as few as one or up to 8 AI competitors).\n\nSo really, there is no reason to NOT buy this game unless you truly despise everything turn based.Even then, this game may well change your mind or at least make you willing to put up with the turn based combat for the sheer fun of everything else about the game.","May 7, 2014","true","102.1"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","28","33","0","0"

This game combines turn-based, army-oriented combat with RPG-like logistics to grow the various forces. Instead of clicking on a building to query up troops, you must either send out your general out to rally them, or recruit them from you town. It's a refresting, and unique take, on the stregy genre of games.\n\nThe graphics of this game havn't aged very well, as with most games published around the same time as this one. Also, it's art style is pretty much a rip-off of the Warhammer Fantasy tabletop game. But that is basically what this game is: "Warhammer: the Campign". And thats not a bad thing.\n\nIf the idea of a semi-casual, low-APM, army campign game sounds even mildly interesting, then you'll love this game.

Just like on the scenario map, combat is turn based and also easy to understand as well as the towns managing. The AI is good and challenging, tricky sometimes. Is graphically outdated but perfectly playable, the weak point is the animation of campaign cut-scenes, badly made.\n\nThe overall campaign is ridiculously large, there are 6 factions and each has a campaign with 5 phases with a storyline that connects them, the plot has no big deal and the feeling that remains is that the campaign was made to play and better understand each faction in case of playing in skirmish mode.\n\nBeing long the campaign becomes tiresome and the heroes skill system is a bit complicated to understand. I had performance issues and the game only opened when installed in the same directory with Steam. I recommend this game for those who enjoy strategy, fantasy, and looking for something different then RTS or with a slower pace.\n\n7/10","April 21, 2014","true","81.0"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

A new developer with a new vision, only the developer has no vision. This installment is in many ways just a recreation of Heroes III with a few features and some new technology. Unfortunately simply recreating an old game isn't enough to warrant a new purchase and the new features introduced does not quite meet the standard you would expect from a big name franchise like this.\n\nAlthough the basic gameplay is still great there simply isn't enough new in the game to really consider it a continuation of the franchise. New features, like spell-less heroes getting a free attack and an initiative list that lets you see in what order units are going to get their turn, are nice additions to the core formula but they don't really add anything new to the game overall when not combined with more extensive overhauls and improvements.\n\nOne of the more significant additions to the game is the new racial abilities that helps distinguish between the heroes, separating them into more sub groups than the usual Melee vs Magic that previous games in the series used. Unfortunately, as with all such systems, without proper balance it adds very little and this was not properly balanced which makes much of what the system tries to do an exercise in futility. Once you realize which abilities are strong and which are weak you will pretty much only have one or two hero builds that are worth following, regardless of what racial abilities are available to you.\n\nThe second and without a doubt the biggest change to the game is the move to full 3D. The game sure looks pretty but a number of bugs, jerky camera movements and items on the map being obscured by the wrong camera angle detracts much from what should have been a major graphical improvement.\n\nThe multi-player is heavily marred by bugs and crash. In particular the out of sync issues makes it near impossible to finish a game online.\n\nHeroes of Might and Magic IV is not a very notable step in any direction, it seems like the developers was so scared of doing any wrong that they ended up doing almost nothing at all which leaves us with what is just a prettied up Heroes III with a few new issues that need fixing.\nLike Heroes III it is still an enjoyable game however because of many lacks and faults in the game you can't help but feel it is a step backwards for the franchise.","December 1, 2012","true","179.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

But then again, at least this game is definitely not terrible, and overall, doesn't quite have the glitches, that "Might & Magic: Heroes VI" does.\nWhat makes it convincing is, this game combines the genres of turn-based strategy games with minor town development involved, (so in other words, games like Sega's "Total War" franchise, only with being fantasy-based) with tactical-rpg elements. Only thing is, only your leaders are able to level up, and NOT the recruited army members; they're simply being LED, by your leaders, that you get to play as. There are two types; "might", which focus more on strength, and "magic", which focuses more on spells that can be cast, to fight against your foes, but still being a bit more tricky, in some cases.\n----\nIn other opinions, This game is quite interesting; as an in-depth strategy game, I first remember playing the original "Heroes of Might & Magic", as a used computer game bought from a thrift store, and I did play it, back when I was a younger child. It was pretty good, and overall, I LOVED IT; it definitely had some depth into strategy-based gameplay, even for it's time.\nWhile the game definitely is not the greatest game on Steam, it's definitely a gem that not everyone knows about. I never cared for games outside the "Heroes" series, within the "Might & Magic" franchise.","May 13","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you've never played Heroes before, I's like to recommend this title to you as an excellent intro to turn-based strategy gaming.\n\nYou basically run an empire, determined by the scenario setup, of a few towns, and can recruit army leaders ("heroes") to lead your forces to victory.  The heroes level up, RPG-style, as they win combat encounters and explore the map, and the towns develop in a similar fashion, as you invest in them -- producing larger, more interesting armies as they get better.\n\nHeroes is very much a strategic title, rather than a tactical one -- its true that bad tactics can lose you a battle very easily, but good tactics can't really best a vastly superior force, because the AI simply never plays in a manner to would allow you to overrun it, in a such a manner.  You win the battle before it starts, as it were.\n\nIf you're into strategy, and high fantasy, this is a game for your library, plain and simple.","May 24","true","55.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Enemy AI cheats too much, so it might be worth seeking out third party mods to see if anyone was ever able to address that.

I just bought the M&M bundle a couple days ago and started with this game. I'd only every played Dark Messiah, and that was not at all what I expected (see my review). I thought Heroes was going to be similar to Warlords: Battlecry or Warcraft. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nThe only thing this game has in common with Warcraft is the fantasy setting Warcraft is an RTS; M&M is a turn-based wargame with RPG elements. You start the game with one hero, who has a small army attached to her (like twenty troops or something). You run your hero around the map, picking stuff up and claiming buildings for your team. When you get into a battle, you get whisked away to a battle board where you play out a strategic turn-based battle.\n\nThe controls are so intuitive that there are times I can't figure something out. Them I DO figure it out and I'm like "oh. I didn't think it could be that simple."\n\nI can't wait to play M&M 6, and I can't wait to play the two expansion packs for this game.\n\nMy advice: remove your head for a few hours and play this game. It's very easy to play, and there is a decent tutorial.","July 9, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

We should keep doing what we were doing before!" So they made a game that's like Heroes of Might and Magic III. Which is good. But because it's newer, they HAD to use bulky 3d graphics that waste space and emulate WoW. Cause that's what all the big boy fantasy games do. Of course, all that rendering and 3d map creation takes time, time that wasn't spent on actual content.\n\nThere are only about 15 different artifacts in the game. Only 6 factions. Spell selection has been cut down dramatically. Not as many skill sets as there used to be. There's only like, 4 or 5 heroes per faction. Maps are not nearly as big as they used to be, heroes can't move as far to give the illusion of space. There's barely ANY multiplayer and freeform maps, so you'll burn through them pretty quick. And another thing that irks me is that the little blrubsthat give you a small story on HOW you find artifacts and bonus sites and whatnot are gone, which isn't that big a deal really, but annoying none the less. And to top it all off, the music is bland and unmemorable, unlike the previous games. Oh, and all the sound effects for finding resources and interacting with the map are gone. That's annoying too.\n\nAnd despite all of that, it's STILL better than Heroes of Might and Magic IV. But if you want a really good turn based fantasy strategy game, stick with Heroes of Might and Magic III. It's the same thing, except more.\n\nI dunno. Maybe all the content is in the DLCs. I wish there was a "eeh." review button.","December 6, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It used to be fine, but now that my hero learned Deflect Missile (and taught it to all my other heroes), that's all they cast in battle. I will be battling against casters or just foot soldiers, and if left to his/her own, my heroes will just start uselessly defending against missiles!\n\nUI is super buggy. Clicking is a little off on buttons but the worst is using sliders. For instance, using the marketplace to exchange resources REQUIRES using the slider. Most of the time the slider doesn't work. Sometimes as you grab and wiggle around it will jump the bar somewhere around where you wanted it. It is impossible to get it exactly where you want it, so after 20-30 seconds of trying to slide, you will choose a value that is "close enough". Same thing when you split your armies, the slider is terrible so it's easier to split army in half (default position of slider), do transfer, then continue splitting the result in half until you get the exact amount you wanted.\n\nThis is definitely a keyboard-only game. Most of the screentips show you which buttons to press, but there are still many that you can only figure out by trial/error. For instance, there is no way to split armies without using the keyboard, and there's no tooltip letting you know to hold shift and drag the army.","April 27","false","102.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/recommended/15170/","aejira","aejira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/","537 products in account","Summary: If you're a fan of the genre, it's the same formulaic gameplay you expect from a turn-based fantasy game. It gets amazingly repetitive halfway into the game, there is a fair amount of challenge to push you along the way but the game has its' bugs and the difficulty spikes unrealistically at times. The lore and storyline is there to string a series of missions together, the characters for the most part unremarkable and limited development put forth.\nI rate the game as a 3/5, purchase if you already know what you're getting into or if it's heavily discounted for the unitiated.\n\nI've been playing the HOMM series since it first came out on my father's i386, playing custom maps and amassing a ridiculous stack of creatures to steamroll through the enemy. The game was addicting because there was nothing like it for its' time and to have limitless power and to just build the most amazing kingdom you wanted held its' charm on me. This and Civilization were the PC games that I remembered burning hundreds of hours playing as a child and so I have a certain nostalgic leaning towards them.\n\nFor those that have never played the series, it's a hex turn-based strategy role-playing game. It is a strategy game from the perspective of the combat involved, the resource collection and kingdom management, and the numerical emphasis of armies. At the same time a role-playing game from the hero creation and customization, to the fantasy lore and storyline, and the implementation of spellcraft and quests. Resources and territories will be contested by players and those that can manage both kingdom and hero well will be favored to win.\n\nNow to speed forward to the fifth installment, at its' core HOMM follows the same formula from previous games. But to me, take away the updated graphics and audio enhancements, and you're left with a game that is remarkably similar to the very first HOMM. This can be great for enthusiasts, but you would expect for a fifth entry the formula could be improved, a more compelling method of storytelling created, just a greater way of being both a strategy and role-playing game at the same time. The storyline is weak, the cutscenes really don't add depth or character development, at the end of the game I felt that I was just controlling 5 very bland heroes on a rather generic mission to save the world from another trite demonic nemesis. We could probably comment and say, "well the cutscenes were done with in-game graphics, which didn't detract from the presentation." But I would say, watching every character go through his in-game idle animation is really annoying and that was seriously the best they could do? Give me a past, something to make me feel emotion for this character, some anguish that they must overcome, some sense of an impending danger to evade, just an event that makes me feel for the protagonist(s). Sadly, there just isn't any.\n\nAnother point and the final one I'll make is about the buginess of the game. The game is not nearly as polished as one would assume, especially the base game which has two official expansions made. On probably 4 separate occassions I had not followed the 'script' that the mission 'suggested' (and I use the word suggested because the cutscenes rarely connect with the mission's objective) and it resulted in the game not properly triggering events to progress/finish the level. Just so many frustrating times where I would spend 1-2 hours on a level, completely destroy the enemy and just because I didn't do something in order, the triggers did not execute as it should have. It's BS, cheap, and ultimately buggy. The difficulty even on normal can be challenging, but a lot of times you'll realize that you've invested about an hour into a level and you're in an irreversible situation where you cannot win. Save often, turn on the auto-save, and don't rely on it. Save at key intervals to be efficient with your time. The game is frustrating and many times it's not from the player but just the way the game scenario was coded.\n\nNow I'm going to say that I would not recommend this game, which I think it fails on so many criteria. It's not a game I would play again after finishing it, not a game I would tell friends about and insist on buying, and it just did not have anything compelling enough to keep me happy while playing. I am not saying the game is bad, but it certainly isn't that great especially in today's VG market.\n\n(Overall 3/5)","January 1, 2014","false","47.7"," 48 of 106 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","48","106","0","1"

Was a huge fan of Heroes 1,2 and to some degree Heroes 3. Somewhere after version 3, this game series lost it's way. This is a type of game that can do without all the "3D" crap because it's about strategy, not how garish and inflated the graphics are. Mindless animations laying over the top of impeded gameplay make for an extremely frustrating experience. I mean, trees in the landscape should not obscure items that would be clear to the heroes. The adventure map is meant to look like... a map! The designers have just over done the heck out of this game, so much that it's totally lost the spirit and overall feel of it's predecessors. To add to this, there are actually no significant improvements in the game just COMPLICATIONS. Dress up the graphics a bit of course but always remember to keep the game mechanics simple, playable and fun! All I'm getting from this game drawn out frustration! I could write a list a few pages long on improvements to this POS.","September 12, 2015","false","21.3"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

The animation, the soundtrack, the characters, everything. I can't say the same for Might & Magic V. The game starts off with Isabel and Beatrice having a conversation.

When I saw Godric's appearance and heard him utter a few lines of poorly voiced dialogue, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. This Godric seems like a completely different character from the one I was used to in M&M IV (yea I know Godric is much older now, but still.)

It is impossible to protect your rear line by slowing / blocking the enemy with unit placement. This game uses a square grid system but allows diagonal melee attacks and movement. It also doesn't have any penalties for moving past an enemy unit. These combined make the tactical combat a joke and eliminate any tactics whatsoever. Your ranged units will always be prioritized and attacked by melee units with impunity.\n\nI've played a good share of similar games including HOMM3 and Kings Bounty. It's a general problem that ruins all games of this type when allowed. Other games that I can't remember off-hand do it right and make unit placement actually mean something.

I like the Heroes of Might & Magic series in general, as the stories are fairly engaging, and I like the idea of playing as a travelling knight commander and his/her entourage/army, as opposed to just one overpowered RPG character. It's very pretty, and generally engaging in gameplay and setting. An excellent example of the genre.\n\nHowever, the multiple layers of Ubisoft DRM, which go on top of what DRM Steam already provides, is just mindbogglingly frustrating. What would be a stable game is made highly buggy by the always-connected DRM.\n\nIf you can put up with buggy, interfering DRM, get the game, as it's kind of amazing when working. However, if you just like the genre in general and don't want to fight Ubisoft every step of the way, go with something in the King's Bounty series. It's not quite as pretty, but it's got similarly fun gameplay, and no Ubisoft.","December 4, 2014","false","83.5"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","2","15","0","0"

The artwork in Heroes III was perfect. But now we must have rotating cameras in the city for added dizziness and disorientation to the player, and also this messy world map that can be rotated. SIMPLE IS BETTER, PEOPLE! I will not buy another HOMM title until they go back to simplicity. A simple, elegant art style with a balanced gameplay like Heroes III.\n\nDon't get me wrong, HOMM 5 is not the worst in the series. Gameplay-wise, it sort of improved on the broken predecessor. But they went all fancy with the town themes and art style. So the game PLAYS well in terms of balance and strategy, but feels silly and you can't take it serious because the 3D models have this stupid exaggerated style and the town themes are dumb. It's not a world you feel like you want to daydream into when you play like it was with Heroes III.\n\nObsidian went back to roots with "Pillars of Eternity" by returning to a SIMPLE, ELEGANT and FUNCTIONAL graphics style, and the game was a success. The same needs to be done with the Heroes series. A new sequel is releasing now, what, is it 7 or 8?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/recommended/15170/","kentlang","Protesting Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kentlang/","230 products in account","Update 2014: A note to the steam community: Don't downrate this review because you disagree with it - that's not what the system is for. This is a well written review that points out important strengths and flaws in this game.\n\nUpdate 2015: 27% approval rate, BAH - this is why steam reviews section is littered by garbage! I criticized it as a poor choice as an entry game of the series - for new players. I still think this review is good and the mechanics will be no less puzzling for anyone else than me. There are very few guides and none in English on steam at the time of writing and there's no good tutorial for explaining how to really compete within the game. Oh well - enjoy your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reviews then Steam community. :P\n\nHeroes of Might and Magic has always been a puzzling franchise to me and the fifth game in the series is no exception. Heroes of Might and Magic V is a turn based game that goes into a turn based (very turn based) combat system when you meet enemies in similar fashion to the Total War series.\n\nPresentation\nA turn based battle system would be an entirely acceptable thing except that the game has so many variables and numbers that trying to get into it is endlessly confusing. In addition to that we have the fact that the "armies" are represented by mere numbers and a single unit model. It does seem like the game could have supported far more models on screen but sadly the user interface hinders you from having more than 7 stacks of units on field, this makes the game's presentation of allowing you to command vast armies seem very dishonest to me. It's always fun to stack numbers up but a game has far more potential for visual presentation that the game truly takes advantage of.\n\nWhat really strikes me with the game is it's fantasy. The basic game of Heroes of Might and Magic offers 6 different factions: Haven (Humans), Sylvian (Elves), Dungeon (Dark Elves), Necropolis (Undead), Inferno (Demons) and my favorite Academy (Wizards)! All of these factions feature classic mythological and fantasy creatures and gives them stats to reflect their strength. Every race is relatively well balanced as well I would say, at least for first appearance. Every single race has 7 available unit types and each of them can be upgraded once (or twice of you got one of the expansions). Haven's units starts off with the lowly peasants and end with bloody angels, in-between they have a sweet mix of medieval flavored units. How these armies are built up are pure genius and there seem to be little to no redundancy in the units neither.\n\nI also need to praise the city screen with looks glorious and the upgrades to it is amazing eye-candy.\n\nGameplay\nI cannot keep praising the game much longer though. I have a real problem with some of it's gameplay mechanics. First off is the unit growth system. In order to get together an army the player must build special buildings for each type. You even need to upgrade these buildings in order to upgrade your troops. Fair enough. However, there's a serious flaw that your units numbers don't grow without the buildings. So potentially another player could end up with far more units than another, and there's no way as far as I'm aware to even such a setback out, short off trying to win a battle early on. It seems to be then that unless you get a perfect start a game isn't truly worth playing to the end.\n\nThe heroes do have magic powers that could be used in an attempt to even the odds between the players but these spells mostly cannot be learned (at least not over 2nd circle of spells) without the respective skills in the magic field. This becomes problematic due to the fact that these skills are awarded to heroes at seemingly random. In addition to that the magic spells are also rewarded at random in different Mages' Guilds in different cities. Due to these facts it seems like the game is controlled solely by luck of the draw and little of good skills. In battle the randomness seems to take far less importance, instead the amount of randomness is mostly determined by creature characteristics.\n\nThe RPG elements in the game seems to amount solely to stacking stats. A hero with plenty of artifacts and a large army seems to be a force of nature and entirely unstoppable. There seem to be no apparent penalty for having large armies like having logistics problems or slow progress, instead large armies travel with the same ease as small armies, making taking on more powerful opponents very tricky and seemingly impossible.\n\nConclusion\nThere's a lot to admire in Heroes of Might and Magic V. You might have noticed that I like using uncertain words like "seem" a lot and that's because I have only played this game for approx. 15 hours yet and I'm still figuring out the quirks of the game. This pretty astonishing to me really as I've been annoyed at several core things in this bloody game and I still keep playing it for some reason. I guess it's extremely addicting and it shows giant amounts of potential. I still think that the greatest flaw as far as I'm concerned is it's presentation. There's never any real big army feel and as time goes on you, as a player only end up to feel more vulnerable. Don't think I haven't searched for any gameplay guides for this game, there isn't any! There's no good documentation either and pretty lousy "tutorials" and it shows that this game was made mainly for the fans of Might and Magic and few others.\n\nThe gameplay in itself is bad enough and due to the lack of being able to even out unbalances during the game's progress and the dishonest presentation doesn't help either - but in the other hand the game is also very addicting, has great potential and the fantasy aethetics are gripping. Sadly because it's so hard to play this game for anyone new to the series I have to refrain from recommending this game.","December 6, 2013","false","22.8"," 24 of 91 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","24","91","0","5"

And the reason why I begged was because I was playing it at a friends house in one of those situations where you and your friends mom are like ticking time bombs with no visible clock, never knowing when they are gonna stop ticking and make you leave. So we went up and started playing some duels in this game which I started to love it because of the close up shots of the battles which in my early tween ages, thought it was the coolest thing ever. However when I got it I immediatly started playing the campain and after a couple missions I thought "This is boring" And moved onto the ever so better multiplayer/scenario mode. This made me feel like a boss building up a huge army full of ents and blade dancers and useless fairies. That was until I realized the other army moving into my territory and thought "Oh crap" As I moved my mouse over their army and the words "About as much chance as having that seinior girl say yes when you ask her to the prom you puny freshman." Well after that I yelled at my computer screen that "I don't want to relive my freshmen year computer" And started playing with someone else. Which led me to another point, the point where the game is like monopoly, as there is no winner unless someone puts the game away, and they you are all winners.\nHowever, like monopoly the game is fun for the few moments where you trick yourself into thinking 'I can finish' at the beggening. So if you like extrodanarily tactical games and monopoly, take this game and go play it with any friends you can find. The more the merrier. And the longer it is till your turn again.","February 19, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visually it is akin to the Warcraft series with it's slightly cartoonish looking environment but that may just be me who sees it that way. Gameplay wise it is much like the Disciples series in that it is a turn based strategy where heroes take the field and move around the map while other units in the army are unseen until a battle occurs. Towns and resources must be captured to produce additional units which is a must as you will loose units along the way. Here again there is a similarity to the Disciples series where town building is on it's own screen and you must choose what to build this turn, unlike Disciples each building only takes a single turn to build and every seven turns (the beginning of a new week) there will be new units to recruit. Fans of the Disciples games will feel right at home with Heroes of Might and Magic V and if you enjoy Strategy games I recommend you give this one a try.","July 3, 2011","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
