The rules are simple and mechanics are easy to grasp. I'm almost worried they are too simple, because the game might be too easy to master. In order for the game to be competative, it needs to consistently provide challenges at every skill level. There's a good amount of interaction with the game, and it's fun to fine tune both your offense and defense depending on the enemies strategies. The game could use some more inirtia. As it stands, while using bad strategies, the game could go on forever. This could be fixed by slowly making the mobs stronger over time. As it stands, the games go on for too long. Additionally, if you're behind in the game, it is pretty difficult to catch up. If, while making the mobs stronger, the mobs also did more damage to the tree, then it would be easier for someone who is losing to make a come back.\n\nAll in all, really cool game and I'm excited to see how it evolves over time.","March 29","true","3.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","2"

It's great to see how far this game has come since it's kickstarter. I played today with my roommate and I could tell there was a lot of thought put into this game. I found it to be fun and competitive, especially playing with someone you know side by side! I loved strategizing and then watching the events unfold. This game definitely has a ton of potential and I am looking forward to more updates and things (especially towers) to unlock.","March 29","true","3.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

I mean every game in existance is possibly not for everyone afterall. Well, this game scratches an itch no other tower defense game has ever managed to scratch. PVP. Infact PVP is all this game has to offer! If you were hoping for some VS AI or team play or anything else then this game doesn't have it, sorry.\n\nThe way the game works is as follows. You have 45 seconds to build up your base defenses AND select a creep wave to send at your opponent. You both get money for attacking and defending successfully.\n\nIf, however you think you can just sit back and let your opponent do all the work while you gain massive money then you are in for a shock my friend. Everytime you send your creep wave, they level up. You don't have to send your creep wave every 45 seconds if you don't want too, but it behooves you to do so otherwise your enemy will level up faster than you can keep up and leveling creeps up is free, they just need to be sent on a death march to gain a level.\n\nAfter 3 level ups they can evolve into even more annoying fodder, usually ending the match outright.\nYou can however let the opponent level up while you farm their fodder and build the ultimate defensive wall. Its an interesting conundrum and shows surprisingly good design because their is no 'wrong' way to play the game, except by not placing any towers whatsoever but at that point why even play.\n\nYou seemingly gain nothing for losing and if your foe quits, you automatically win, likewise if they disconnect. ♥♥♥♥ing hell, just take that in for a moment and then realize that Capcom couldn't even add that for Street Fighter 5.\n\nThe game isn't without its downsides however, first of all, their is only the tutorial whereby you can learn the ropes of the game. This is annoying but not game breaking. The tutorial will serve as a testing ground for your various build ideas over time so it is good that it at least exists.\n\nThe game also features a shop and some of the items in the shop, well, yeah. Its a free to play game so its what you'd expect, units that seemingly have an advantage over people who don't pay.\nAlso clicking feels off, can't put my finger on it but if i had to guess, I imagine this game is also on mobile.\nFinally their is no single player campaign at all and wait times for matches are pretty long due to a low player count.\n\nI can think of some quality of life fixes for example allow us to save a specific creep loadout rather than picking every wave, with the option to change it if we want, mid match. I often go with the same early creeps, just to level them up and picking them game after game is just repetitive.\n\nWith all that said, I had some fun with the game. It isn't deep like a CCG nor is it as good as multiplayer co-op tower defense games like Bloons TD5 but despite all the reviews saying this game is bad, I honestly enjoyed it, even if I won't be clocking in a lot of hours into it.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","April 17","true","1.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/themissinglint/recommended/351630/","themissinglint","rgbDreamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/themissinglint/","180 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCompetitive tower defense is one of those holy grail genre crosses.  Fire With Fire makes you wonder why it every seemed like a difficult design problem.  Players simultaneously build their defenses, and can launch attacks on a cooldown.\n\nATTACKING:\nAttacking is very simple: you choose which enemies attack in what order, for example two groups of armored units then a group of fast ones.  Ranking up one type of enemy to level 3 unlocks another, and flying units have to be unlocked so players can tell if you're working towards them and prepare.\n\nThe attacking units gain levels each time they're sent to attack, so players are encouraged to attack as often as possible.  There is a clear timer until you can be attacked again, so there are short windows when it's safe to sell and reconfigure your maze.  This all combines to just work on the attacking end, without taking too much of your attention off of your defenses.\n\nDEFENDING:\nOn the defense side, players get to decide how to arrange their maze.  Enemies spawn from two points, so usually you'll want to merge the incoming streams.  Clear dotted lines show the paths of enemies from spawns to your tree, and as you are placing towers you can see how each one will change the paths before you build.  You are not allowed to place towers that would completely block a path.\n\nWhen you start a game, you can choose three schools of towers.  Each tower has a base tower and a tech tree with two paths of two more unlockable towers (5 towers per school total).  Building the base towers give you tech points in that school which can be used to unlock more advanced towers or to level up individual towers, so one way you gather resources is to build low-level towers.\n\nA major choice in each game ends up being whether to build a quick, mediocre defense which might get out classed if the game lasts to long, or to architect a complex combo of towers (like stun and splash) that can handle anything but might get you killed before it is completed.\n\nOVERALL:\nFire with Fire is a great structure for a style of game I have been looking for for a long time.  It already blows away most of the similar Starcraft mods I have tried.\n\nThere are some interface issues - things like upgrading a tower or building two different types of towers often just take more clicks then feels neccesary, which can be irritating.  Sometimes it takes too long to find an opponent.\n\nThe game still needs more content.  (duh, it's early access.)  There are only a few different options for which towers and enemies to take into each game, but it does still feel like there are a wide variety of options and tactical choices during each game.  There are still towers I haven't seen.\n\nAll and all this is a great game, and I'm excited to see how it develops!","April 28","true","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was sent confirmation emails which I did not confirm but was still able to connect & play which is concerning\n8) Reliance on MP - the playerbase for this is not going to be huge so there needs to be more than the tutorial level and MP available. (currently blocked from MP because progress was reset and the tutorial won't load, can't just jump in and play MP without first doing the tutorial)\n\nGenerally speaking this seems like a copy of one of the first TD games I played with slightly better graphics.

Shows much promise but is extremely buggy and needs a final layer of polish.\n\nDISCLAIMER - THIS REVIEW IS AS OF BETA (EARLY ACCESS). WILL UPDATE ON FULL RELEASE\n\nPros:\n\n- Simple concept\n- Attack and defense sequences\n- Replayability\n- Some progression (hopefully the systems are added to and fleshed out a bit more)\n- Multiplayer\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Havn't been able to finish a single match yet as the game freezes or locks up every time I play a game. Also random freezes in menus. Literally unplayable in its current state\n- Tutorial is not comprehensive enough. Was not aware of how upgrades worked in the attack sequence until my 3rd attempt at playing a match. Tutorial should encompass everything a player needs to know: creating multiplayer loadout, defensive sequence, offensive sequence\n- Needs a small of number of interface tweaks like double clicking to perform redundant actions such as creating offensive/defensive loadouts\n\nI very much look forward to playing a fix/finished/complete version of this game. Simple quick time killer. Suited for mobile applications.","April 7","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
