I guess let's start with the obvious. If you are looking for a scary game, this is not it, if you are looking for a game at all, this is not it.\n\nI suppose you could call it an experience, but it is not something to enjoy. It's dreadful. It'll make you feel sick to your stomach, you'll cringe, cover your eyes, and wonder why the hell you're even doing this.\n\nIt accomplishes exactly what it wanted to. It's essentially, a first person experience of the memories of a patient from before mental illnesses were treated properly, and the consequences that it has on said patient.\n\nAt times it almost feels like a documentary, one that you're doing yourself, other times it feels a bit like Shutter Island. But the whole time has this atmosphere - it isn't a scary one necessarily, but a filthy one. Both physically, emotionally, mentally, morally, you feel dirty playing this game. Like you need to take a shower afterwards, or maybe sit in the fetal position at the bottom and cry.\n\nSure, it's tense, but mostly you'll be wrestling with emotions. Sometimes it's disgust, sometimes it's pity, or confusion, I didn't know how to take any of it. Because nothing that occurred was anyones fault, it's just a culmination of so many problems, that nobody knew how to deal with. It's hard to witness something so horrific without someone to blame.\n\nI could relate it to reading on the Nazi concentration camps, but the difference is there's someone there to blame, to hate for it all, but here, I just don't know. And the game knows that too, offering certain options which exempt everyone of responsibility, or blame certain parties, but as onlookers, we can't know for sure, and to claim otherwise is just ignorant.\n\nTo the simpler things:\n- the graphics are beatiful\n- great optimization (120fps most of the time, occassional drops to 80)\n- solid voice acting\n- a story that sticks with you\n- thick atmosphere, wonderfully realized setting\n- multiple paths through certain chapters\n- sometimes things get lost in translation but it's rare\n- there are occassional bugs\n- lots of invisible walls\n- difficult to decide where to go, especially if you're prone to exploration\n- no sprint button makes things very slow, annoyingly slow on occassion\n\nLook this, "game," is wonderfully terrible. It's meant to be something that's tough to stomach and that often disturbs you. It's an analysis of what Outlast simply wore as a costume to jump out and yell "boo!"\n\nDo not buy this if you're looking for a scary game. But if what I've described sounds like something you might want to try, then absolutely buy it. But be warned, this is a phenomenally horrific thing to have to witness.","February 28","true","3.2"," 117 of 128 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","117","128","2","0"

Not one of those many, if not most, jumpscare and in your face horror games. No...the horror you feel is 100% psychological and leaves you feeling cold inside, the only true horror ive ever felt from a video game in my life was just now with this amazing work of art.

I have to admit i've already grown a bit weary of the horrorscene in gaming with their endless, cheap jumpscares, gory and bloody scenery and running away from monsters to stay alive, another jumpscare and rinse and repeat. I'm not saying i don't enjoy those, but after the game is completed thats about it and it didn't offer me that much of anything new as experience and i'll just start up another game.\n\nThen there is The Town of Light, if you're looking at something that will leave an impact after you've finished the game, you don't have to look further. A fresh view as psychological horror in first person view. You'll be instead forced to deal with humans for a change. More specifically, very rarely handled subjects of mental health, child abuse and institutionalising to a psychiatric hospital. On this you really have to give praise on the research and storytelling. One aspects where this game really shines.\n\nStory goes around on just that, you're wandering around on an actual abandoned psychiatric hospital as Reneé, our maincharacter, picking up grim pieces of your past and trying to discover what actually happened. Flashbacks, pieces of medical journal, letters all adds up to the story which you'll want to finish in one go.\n\nHowever. Eventhough this personally for me is one of the best i've tried out so far in 2016 and while the story, soundscape and graphics are just astonishing. It basically falls in the category of walking simulator and if you do not enjoy a good story, there isn't much else to do in this game and it might not be suitable for you.\n\nAll said, the story on it's own makes this one of the better if not best psychological horror games i've encountered in my life, it will make you crawl in your chair and feel uncomfortable from time to time, and i can suggest it to anyone who wants to enjoy something new.","March 14","true","23.9"," 53 of 65 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","53","65","0","4"

No jump scares, no spooky things chasing you around. Its a psychological thriller, more of an interactive story than an all out game with some very cool (albeit a little disturbing) hand drawn style flashbacks/cutscenes. Plus an ending that hit me hard as over the short time span of the game I developed a strange attachment for the player Character, Renee.\n\nIt looks good and runs well. Takes about 3 hours to complete but I still found it worth the price of admmision.\n\nIt's not all good of course, voice acting isn't exactly up to Rise of the Tomb Raider standards. As mentioned earlier it is a very dark game and your flashlight is pretty terrible and it has very basic mechanics. graphics aside you can tell this game had a low budget and an inexperienced dev team.\n\nAnd yet I enjoyed not enjoying every second of it and would do it all over again.

What I felt during the first time I heard the sound of my steps in those empty, abandoned, fightful corridors is hard to describe.\nIn my opinion the developers of LKA, through this their first work, can potentially pave the way to a totally new and unexplored format of videogame. In fact they were able to describe with such an abundance of accurate detalis and to a perfect historical reconstructions of the spaces and the facts set in an italian asylum in the 1930s (as in many others in the last century). What we have the possibility to play here is a novel cencept of videogame, because for the first time a game has been used as a critical testimony, as an information medium. At the same time this game let immediately realize, that the emotional involvement in a tragic story like this one is so touching and devastating, that cannot be compared to any film or graphic novel, althought they have been used for decades for a similar aim.\nThis videogame represents a first step on a long path, that could potentially be a revolution in carrying informations, denounce historical and social criticalities, yet in a subjective emotional perspective.","February 27","true","21.2"," 33 of 49 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","33","49","4","1"

I recommend to buy it\nSummary: The Town of Light is a different adventure graphic from the other, and it is something more than a simple video game. Through 3D reconstructions of environments and through a narration, often accompanied by illustrations, the game tells a story perhaps too uncomfortable and often buried in the rubble of the past.\nThe title, which takes up the story of a young girl of sixteen, underlines the horror and the sad truth, which for years has been hidden behind the gates of the Italian asylums. Electric shocks, cold showers, abuse and terrible experiments.\nThe Town of Light recalls the story, so it is not forgotten.\n\nIn general the game has very simple mechanics, but really well developed.\nThe technical sector is great and offers a very attractive graphics and a perfect audio segment; the music is spot on to the scene and evoke the right pathos in the gamer. The setting is a highlight, along with the powerful storytelling; the whole environment has been recreated in detail: every room, bed, bath, everything is just perfect. The more I go on with the story the more I feel involved in that environment; more I observe the rooms, books, drawings, and I feel close to horror and pain that those walls have embedded for years.\nSurely this title has the power to not only be a simple video game, what scares is not the supernatural, what inspires fear is just a real sad reality.\n\nPRO:- Interesting storytelling\n- Engaging storyline\n- The setting was created perfectly\n- Simple and fluid gameplay\n\nCONS:-The duration of the main story is slightly limited, but it is enough\n\n9/10","February 26","true","12.7"," 28 of 42 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","28","42","0","0"

This journey requires patience and time, but will reward those willing to give TO the experience of a game, instead of mostly taking, as we usually do. Prepare to suffer, and to hurt terribly in this opportunity to grow as a human being. There will be no turning back.\n\nThe Town of Light is almost certainly the most horrific game I’ve ever played, but not as the average gamer may expect. I just finished my first playthrough, and I have to wonder if this really even a game. It has the characteristics of a game. It has goals, it has a beginning and an end. It even has Steam achievements! Though it offers little or no fun or pleasure, it does provide the feeling of having the ability to change the player forever, and that should certainly sometimes stand as a replacement for entertainment. (Though offline time isn’t tracked by Steam, I’d estimate about 4 hours so far.)\n\nThe Town of Light is advertised as being based on fact, and of that I have no doubt. It takes place in Italy, but could be any country in the world in the mid-20th century, when care for the mentally ill was more along the lines of warehousing and concealment than actual treatment. A woman in modern times returns to the asylum where she had been housed as a 16-year old starting in the late 1930s, in a desperate attempt to find herself, to learn who she was, and who she may still be. The building she remembers is currently being demolished, so she finds herself stumbling her way through the debris of the building, as well as the debris of what remains of her mind and her life. The player is shown memories of the horror this child underwent, from early ♥♥♥♥ by male employees and being tied to her bed for weeks on end, to the death of her mother, which was withheld from her for two years. The walls are decorated with the most horrific medical posters depicting barbaric surgical practices ranging from removing a patient’s fingers to flaying their faces and operating on eyeballs.\n\nThe Town of Light has perhaps the BEST graphics I've ever seen in any game in my life....... sometimes almost too detailed. Though I have the most powerful i7 gaming laptop available about a year ago, I found myself decreasing all graphics settings to “medium” from “ultra”, as the game steadily slowed. Loading the game to continue playing required waiting so long that I literally started playing another game on my second PC each time. I’d guess three to four minutes, even with the graphics turned way down. (EDIT: Improved tremendously by changing PC settings to use appropriate graphics CPU, though this should not be necessary.) The movement is therefore quite jerky, but not unbearably so, Perhaps this will be fixed in time. (EDIT: If you have this issue, look up info in a pinned discussion.)\n\nSome of The Town of Light was lost simply because I don’t read Italian, but perhaps nothing critical. Most Italian seems to be translated, but things like signs often were not. There were far too many unimportant items made to be “action items” for no other reason to hold them and look at them, then put them down unused. Beyond documents, very few items had any purpose beyond the occasional need to shock with an item’s barbarity. Why have all operating controls and knobs on an old x-ray machine? The detail was nice, but unnecessary and time wasting. Most windows could be opened, as well as the screens, usually for next to no purpose. If a door was not to be opened it showed a tiny lock symbol when selected (or sometimes nothing.) The same with lockers, although some “locked” lockers could be opened, some “unlocked” lockers could not. Perhaps the weakest feature of The Town of Light was that the selection tool was a tiny white circle, but only IF at the proper distance, and IF it was suitable. As such, it required far too much effort to determine if an item should be investigated further, and I don’t doubt some were missed because the circle was small and appeared very briefly at just the proper distance. And the walking pace was dreadfully slow, though for a woman of now advanced age this may be appropriate.\n\nThe Town of Light had some of the poorest flow of any game I’ve played recently, but that may be an acceptable trade. Fact is, if not for the achievements a player could easily finish the game, completely unaware that there was a great deal of story left unexplored. The necessary sequence of actions was so difficult to determine (likely, it could be argued, due to the mental distress of our character) that the letter “H” was provided (but not indicated in the control reference, perhaps indicating an afterthought) to avoid the need to simply walk into every place in the game again and again, waiting for some event to trigger. Though logical (and tremendously helpful) to use the character’s voice and thoughts to advance the game to the next goal, it often felt contrived.\n\nThough The Town of Light has some negative aspects, and is quite expensive (no doubt due to the time required to generate such an amazing level of graphic detail), it is a very worthwhile game……IF you value compassion for humanity over fun. If you’d rather learn and feel on occasion, and grow in the process, The Town of Light is certainly an experience not to be missed.","February 27","true","2.2"," 30 of 46 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","30","46","0","0"

I think we can all use more games like that; haunting storylines that are a different sort of scary without worrying about some half-baked monster trying to nibble on my face like I'm a bedtime snack.\n\nThe Town of Light creates a setting that is inspired by real events. Yes, the asylum in Volterra exists. Yes, some of these rooms are exactly as they are depicted. Google-fu that. It is disturbing and it weaves a sort of story that makes a person cringe and their blood run cold. For all intents and purposes, this is more like a walking simulator with a few puzzles.\n\nA few very irritating puzzles.\n\nIt's not that there's anything wrong with them! It's fine. It's just...please have pity on us poor gamers, we're all not that smart. I've found that while playing, I needed a little bit more of an elaboration from our protagonist. Telling me "reception" when I know the asylum doesn't have a reception room made me want to throw my laptop and start crying. Tell me it's a gate. Tell me it's a room. Don't tell me just reception or I'm going to stare blankly and do something because I don't understand. This wasn't the first time I had run into a "lack of details" moment. If this is on purpose to illustrate how Renee thinks, then my god, you are certainly evil. But this really left me wondering where to go. It's like when we were looking for Charlotte, the doll. Telling me we abandoned her and that she's cold does absolutely nothing to help me find her faster. It just made me confused and thought "cold? MAYBE THAT MEANS SHE'S IN THE FREEZER!"\n\nGranted some of the puzzles you're going "I have no idea, I don't have enough details!" can be solved just by standing around and clicking wildly. Or you can use the H key, which does have Renee repeat what she said OR give you clearer directions. They aren't always clear enough, but it has saved my tuckus a few times.\n\nUnfortunately I also found a few glitches. I walked off the earth in chapter twelve and the valve to turn on the showers (chapter...seven?) never appeared so I sat in a tub in monochrome and cried at my laptop. (No I didn't actually cry.) The loading can also be very sluggish at times, but it doesn't crash so this tends to be a non issue for me. It might be an issue for you. Even after fiddling with the options a bit, it's still slow so I'm just dealing with it.\n\nThat is honest-to-god the only bad I found in this game. That's it. Otherwise I've been holding it close to my chest and crying, "Poor sweet baby I love you, it won't hurt anymore, I'll take care of you."\n\nThis game doesn't preach about the mistreatment of those suffering from mental illness before reform happened. It also doesn't try to paint mental health workers from this time as saints/super duper evil devils, either. It comes to this sort of understanding that there was overcrowding and people eventually grew apathetic. Preachy games can get pretty irritating, especially to those suffering from the illnesses that the game is highlighting. This is very sobering and it plays it straight. For anyone who hasn't heard about these topics, this should be an eye opener. For people who are already involved, this is just a refresher course. I think that deserves a lot of praise for just playing it straight.\n\nThe music and sound is very beautiful...and then it cuts off abruptly and lets you fester in the silence. It's very appropriate. It's like there's hope and joy...and then nothing. There is absolutely nothing but the sounds of crying and moaning in terror and pain. Beautiful, I love it.\n\nThe scenery is drool-worthy. It's gorgeous. You can even take a ride on the crumbling, decaying playground. Just remember your shots, kids. Tetanus! Whoohoo! There's just a lot of detail there from the playground to equipment you can fiddle with. Most of this has no impact on the story whatsoever but hell, it's fun to play with. Anything made so beautiful that you can also touch buttons or play with knobs? That's great! It all functions...\n\nYou're not going to be scared in the traditional way. You're going to be horrified at human beings and this is how we used to treat each other. You're going to be horrified at how the brain works. You're going to ask yourself if "the good ol days" were really the best of times. It's more of a fear that keeps you up at night, staring at the ceiling, and making you wonder what sort of progress we're making as the human race and if we can do better by others.\n\nGet it. Get it. Get it get it get it. Pray someone gets a guide up for the difficult parts cause once I blast through everything I'm not telling.\n\nIf you need accessibility information: You're gonna get some severe motion sickness during parts of this game. I do mean severe. There's some moments of bright lights, but no severe, fast flashes I've seen so far. I may have just closed my eyes at the right time, though. Regular keyboard moments with a flashlight button and help. Nothing special. Forgiving. Very high with disturbing content so if you're one of those people, you might want to beware of that.\n\nYou'll probably enjoy it if you like "different" horror games so hey, give it a shot.\n","February 26","true","5.9"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","20","28","2","0"

I have no clue how I found it, but I'm glad that I did. It caught my interest then, and keep my interest even now.\n\nThe entire game revolves around Renee T, a 16 year old mental health patient locked away in an Italian Asylum from the late 30's to the early 40's. It educates the player on how these people were treated in many countries, including Italy and how until recently people with mental health issues and special needs were seen as almost prisoners within their own body, tortured and mistreated.\n\nThe game is a non convential horror game/walking simulator so the main gameplay mechanic revolves walk here, do this, walk there, do that. Which some people would have an issue with.\n\nThe other complaint is that the game will lag hard when it's loading areas and I had a large amount of foliage pop in one particular area at the start of the game when the ground was bare and suddenly popped in all the trees and bushes that were supposed to be there.\n\nHowever I'd recommend the gameplay for the story, It's very pretty and draws comparisson in terms of art design to Homesick as it's set in an abandoned building where you find out the story from the various areas with the notes scattered around, and solve puzzles to progress.\n\nLKA.it I can't wait for your next game. This game was amazing and I would absolutely 100% recommend it. It is up there as one of my favourite games of all time, and I'm proud to say I discovered this many years ago as it bloomed into what it is today.","March 1","true","2.8"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

I was wrong on all accounts. This game plays on your own thoughts forcing you to question whether the character you play is actually insane or if the whole thing is being conjured up by 1920's hysteria and ingorance of the idea of insanity. You will play both in modern times and also relive memories by way of both gameplay and horrifying cutscenes. The game offers multiple paths being taken throughout the story and I managed to finish one path before the game released without collecting all of the various collectibles in the game so if you do the same you can expect around three hours of gameplay however I personally plan on going back to see the other paths that can be taken and try to find everything this next go around so the length will vary per user.

The Town of Light is highly ambitious in its aim to show how it would feel to be a person beset by mental illness and depression.\n\nSome will say that this isn’t truly a ‘game’ due to its lack of gameplay elements and others will find its focus too disturbing.

I think so. Conceptually, very interesting, original and previously unexplored. Executed with a lackluster yet neophyte touch, this will be a polarising game for years to come. I recommend this game with caution as I feel this isn't a game for everybody.\n\nThe Town of Light is an indie effort at showcasing mental illness through a 16 year old girl who - without spoilers here - develops a growing sexual interest towards a certain somebody. This co-exists with the way the patient is treated and the game pairs this with visual and audible effects. If you're a fan of walking simulators, heavy exploration and "sit back and relax" driven games, give this a shot. If you need puzzles, multiple developing characters and an arching story, you'll probably lose interest fast. However, this game seems to mix both sides of the field to create its own formulae using an original, but bizarre, setup it has going for it.\n\nGameplay is rather quite weak I have to admit, there's invisible walls and locked doors galore. Performance is hit and miss, mouse sensitivity and FOV are an issue, so are certain post-processing effects such as SSAO which, at lower settings, create this ugly black-spotted screen lay-over. Moreover, there's a lack of inventory, player responsibility and fail states, which disappointed me. You're given a flashlight, though is completely and utterly useless as no area in the game is ever dark enough. Anyway, as previously stated, this game isn't exactly well polished. Generally the game feels sluggish, uncared for and untested. Movement speed randomly changes, clicking can be finicky, mouse navigating feels heavy (especially on a directinput controller) and your characters' arms/body can be seen as its unfinished model at high FOV settings.\n\nNow, conceptually: is where this game succeeds. Let's get this out the way; there's adult themes, full nudity and implied ♥♥♥♥ (NOT ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥). Beyond that, it was intriguing going through what the game throws at you, the symbolism drawings on walls, scene-switching from the then-and-now asylum, and the voice acting isn't actually that bad. This game has alot of derp, but derp that will keep you wanting to see what happens next - that is - if you're willing to put up with the poor gameplay. If you've played Rule of Rose, it's a similar setup here in how the game is presented.\n\nIt's a really short game, unfortunately, but is doing things other games don't even dare to. I say bring on a sequel to this, keep the clean, tasteful and appropriate adult themes and even turn it up a notch. But for my sanity, you need to improved and expand on the general gameplay and exploration aspects. Make ALL areas and items of real use, cut down on filler, improved performance and put in more modern touches. Also, a much needed better hint system.\n\nGive this a go if you're willing to support a developer taking risks with original, adult concepts not seen before.\n\nOh, and this game has one of the most brutal, cringe worthy scenes that had made me look away. ;)","February 26","true","2.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

The game is purportedly based on true events, though the story told is unfortunately common enough that it doesn't really matter. Taking place in late '30s to early '40s Italy, you rummage through a derelict mental hospital triggering story beats through exploration and light puzzle solving. The narrative is depressing, the outlook is disheartening, but the game is not particularly any good.\n\nThere's a confusion of identity in The Town of Light, and it doesn't feel like an intentional design decision to help the player identify with the plight of the main character Renee. The game tries to create an atmosphere by avoiding cheap jump scares in favor of disorientation and unease, which I'm generally in favor of. The execution is spotty at best; it tries to present itself as “realistic”, but falls back on tired horror game tropes like endless hallways, creaky doors, howling wind, and the entire premise of the rusted, abandoned mental institution is entirely unnecessary. A period piece set contemporaneously with Renee's story would have been more than sufficient, and probably more powerful. Instead you're asked to wander hallways either endlessly without much direction, or ask for help and be pointed directly where you need to go to progress to the next chapter. This isn't exactly a well designed game. None of this is helped by the painfully slow walking speed, finicky cursor, or sometimes poor translation and spotty voice work, which all add to kill the pace of the game. There are good concepts here, they're just buried under quite a bit of chaff.\n\nThis is an “art” game and a walking simulator, and without diving head first into the debate about what the definition of a “game” is I still have to question why this exists in video game form when it would have worked just as well if not better in other mediums. The Town of Light tries to be a jack of all trades, mixing hand drawn static art, non-interactive cutscenes, letter correspondence, and traditional video game first person navigation and puzzle solving. The video game portions are the weakest, with an inconsistent frame rate, confusing level design, and unintentionally goofy interactions that derail any mood the game was aiming for. A graphic novel, animated short, or even a podcast would have resulted in a more cohesive experience.\n\nThe issues of mental health and the barbaric treatment of those who suffer from the affliction are important topics that are usually swept under the rug, even today. While it's refreshing to see games like The Town of Light tackle and expose this head on it's not a free pass for a shoddy game, especially when it's been done better before. Watching the trailers and reading the description for the game I was hoping for something as powerful as The Cat Lady (which had shades of Silent Hill), but upon completion I just felt hollow and a bit annoyed by an unremarkable, forgettable couple of hours. For those who want a real (as in: really real) look at the subject there are documentaries like Titicut Follies. For anyone who wants fiction about institutionalized horrors that are set in the same location and time period, there are films like Salo for the truly hardcore. The Town of Light just seems like an admirable but unnecessary attempt to capture the lessons of those better works, but don't tell the developers that. In perhaps one of the least tasteful and garish displays of self-congratulation, some of the first interactive objects found in the game are a couple of awards for Best Storytelling the game received that you're free to pick up, rotate, zoom in on, and just admire. That's pretty ♥♥♥♥ing cheesy and a great example of how they just don't quite get it.","March 6","false","3.2"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","28","48","0","1"

Very important tip!  It will give you an audio clue as to where to go next, because sometimes the game doesn't make this obvious.\n\nThis is a mature, powerful sledgehammer of an experience.  I don't really want to call it a horror game, because this is a story-led title that contains horror themes.  It is predominantly a "walk here" and "click this" type of game, with a story that unfolds gradually.  Such titles can often feel too slow, and whilst The Town of Light isn't quick (there is no run key), it gets it just right.  Make sure you play on a weekend when you have time to absorb the game.\n\nGraphically and audio are perfect, conveying a sense of decay and abandonment.  It feels like every detail has been researched meticulously, and a constant feeling of dread and despair fills every corridor.  There are no jump scares, but I felt a growing unease and sadness throughout.\n\nI found the experience utterly stunning and devastating.

Everything about it is disorienting, from the method of story delivery, the visuals and sound cues, literally everything. But it’s great.\n\nDon’t get me wrong this is a disturbing experience, but to be fair it’s meant to be. The premise of the game is to show you what it was like to be a mental health patient in the early 1900's and it’s horrendous. It’s hard to tell what exactly is going on, what’s real, what isn’t, who is helping or trying to help, etc. It’s a tough game to play, but in the end it is 100% worth it.\n\nI ended up finding out the truth and I definitely cried. It was nice hearing Cry’s voice at the end, it was a little soothing even though what he was saying was really sad. Tbh I wouldn’t have found out about this game if he didn’t tweet about it, so thanks Cry.\n\nThis game is a little on the expensive side, so if you can’t afford it at full price you should wait for a sale or watch a play through because the message of this game is extremely important and the truth about what these patients and their families had to endure needs to be heard.\n\n10/10 will play again","March 5","true","4.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Now for me not having jump scares is good as I dont like them so that aspect of the game is great. Not being able to sprint, its not a HUGE issue for me but it is a slight annoyance as there are times in the game where you will walk a decent distance only to find a dead end meaning you have to sludge your way all the way back and then find the right direction. When you are on track though I oddly found it quite nice only being able to walk as it allowed me to absorb the energy of my surrounding area. I really felt like I was in this asylum and the atmopshere all around was just incredible. The art style of this game is amazing, colors pop and the dark gloomy bits are done very well. The art style coincides well with the various noises/music you hear through out the game. The cut scenes are beautiful (in an odd way) in that the art style is to die for, however the story being unveiled infront of you is dark. I had goose bumps the entire play through and this game is in no doubt worthy of atleast 2 playthroughs as you have different paths you can take!\n\nThe best game I can compare this to is "Gone Home". Its Gone Home but longer, prettier, better sounding, more erie, and all around better basically Gone Home done proper.

You make some choices in 'speaking' to Renee, but I'm not entirely sure if they influence or change the plot at all (Edit: They do a bit if you're percise with your choices). Other than that this is a walking simulator in the style of Dear Esther and Gone Home. You are most often simply going to different parts of the hospital as Renee struggles to remember her past.\n\nMy one major 'gripe' is that the game never really seems to know if it wants to be a horror game or not. Occasionally- especially early on it would seem that way, but it never really commits. Theres a creepy doll and occasionally entering a room will give you a horror fortissimo and pop up a piece of vaguely haunting art on the screen but it always feels odd. Like touring a house and occasionally a man in a bedsheet ghost costume jumps around the corner and says "Ah!".\n\nOn that topic, all of the art is very well done. The scenery is pretty, and it really says something to have a game like this take place during the day- which to me is a very nice touch. The game occasionally uses human models which aren't *bad* but they do look out of place in the narrative to me, especially Renees herself.\n\nThe voice acting is.. hard to judge. In English, Renee sounds very "off". Not quite right in the delivery in her lines, and I was never sure if this is an intentional choice to reflect her state or simply rough voice work. The Italian (This is an italian game) voice is good, though came off too womanly and direct for me. I ended up playing mostly with the German voice acting, which to me was very very well done and fits in with the games atmosphere.\n\nBut this was a good game. The plot is interesting and a good choice for this genre of game, and leaves a nice balance of mystery and exposition to keep things interesting. It's about three-four hours to go through so a fairly good value. I woulden't say it has the replayability Dear Esther or similar did, though I may end up coming back to it.\n\nAnd as a final side note I should mention that at least for me I had some issues with low frame rates and texture pop ins. I'm not using a great computer but it can normally run things above this games standards, so if you're using a non-gaming laptop or similar you may want to double check your specs.","May 25","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I wouldn't say there was any horror to it but it was plenty disturbing.\n\nI looked into the 'real facts and places' this was based on and found Ospedale Psichiatrico di Volterra - a psychiatric hospital shut down for malpractice and cruel conditions that people called 'the place of no return' because of patients that would never be released. So the game's writers did their research, and pictures of the abondoned hospital show how spot on the game's art and design work really is.\n\nThe narrative was weak though and marred by what I thought was terrible voice-acting, and any choices presented in the game seemed pointless, but the documents pieced most of it together and the cut scenes brought the drama. All in all it delivered a good story - by good I mean painfully depressing - and an accurate glimpse into a harrowing bit of history, which is basically everything the game promised.

So even if this isn't the classic jumpscare game, it still arouses real horror - as the most dreadful things are seldom shown directly, but rather imagined by ourselves while wandering through the ruins, empty rooms and hidden corners.\n\nCan highly recommend it, please be aware that this is heavy stuff with some rather disturbing content.","March 12","true","5.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I really regret buying The Town of Light.

I'm not someone who rushes through a game; I love story rich games, exploring and taking my time. But God, how I was craving for an option to run or at least walk fast! The frustration was there throughout the game, at several points I felt like a wounded snail struggling to cross the road to get to safety. As someone else wrote in his review; "Feels like a chore rather than an experience".\n\nMaybe it's the effortless voice acting of Renee that made me pretty much indifferent about her story or maybe it's just because the game isn't good. The story of Renee isn't unique or even interesting and wether that's because of my prior knowledge in the subject I don't know. The Town of Light surely puts a light on a dark chapter in the history of psychiatry, but it doesn't offer anything new.\n\nThe Town of Light is a beautiful but empty snooze fest which will make your skin crawl out of frustration.\n\nI strongly recommend playing The Cat Lady instead if you're looking for a disturbing and powerful experience about mental health.","March 8","false","2.7"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","6"

Also, the opening puzzle, involving pushing Charlotte in the wheelchair were clunky and difficult to control, with some glitches that could you leave you stuck in the elevator.\nWhile the game has some important things to say about how patients in institutions were treated, the developers work too hard in cramming as many awful events as possible. Not only that but the sudden switches in the gameplay, from walking simulator, to a choice based game that affects how you access certain chapters but has little to no affect on the overall ending, is jarring.\nThe sandbox style clashes with the narrative driven nature of the game as well. Some chapters are skipped completely if the right items are not discovered, but for the most part there is very little reward for actually searching the enviroment, leading you to take the fastest route through the game.\nAt just over four hours of gameplay available, and the narrative only really holding your attention towards the final leg, it's also a very costly game.

There was nice immersion and the slow movement pace of the character helped reduce most of the potential discomfort. Some things seems extremely out of scale with light switches being huge and placed quite a ways up the walls, as well as the protagonists arms early in the game being quite huge and ending at the shoulder (obviously a model made for non-vr). The mechanic of looking at items up close was quite neat in VR, sadly I don't speak italian so it feels like a lot of content went straight over my head since there were no seeming on-screen translations for the documents so I just stopped picking them up and don't bother with the maps either.\n\nThe major issue I had with the game was the character rotation on the gamepad. Firstly the default sensitivity was set insanely high which made for an extremely uncomfortable couple of minutes in the start, I had to go into the settings and basically floor the gamepad sensitivity for it to feel decent. Might be something for the devs to consider to start it out lower if the first time the game is started is in VR. Secondly for some reason rotation when using the right thumbstick on the gamepad causes framedrops or jerkiness (very hard to tell which) which was the main problem for the discomfort I felt. At the end of my 40 minutes I started feeling eye strain and increasing discomfort which is why I stopped playing for the day, and it was mostly due to this jerkiness when rotating the character. Whereas simply looking around the room with the headset was perfectly smooth so it feels like something odd is going on just when rotating (works just walking around without rotating and looking around in the headset, no jerkiness at all).\n\nAlso the on-screen text jumps around quite a bit when looking around in the headset like there is some snapping/rounding issue.\n\ntl;dr\nSo far I can recommend the game, we will see what tomorrow holds. Would be nice though if the jerkiness could be reduced so it is more comfortable to play in VR.","May 9","true","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This is a pretty game, but I can't get past the story.\n\nI just feel like this is a step backwards. If this was entirely from the perspective of Renee in her time period it would've been much more interesting. This perspective is so alienating. It doesn't capture a psychological break at all, it kinda seems like you glanced at 'schizophrenia' in an old copy of the DSM III and guessed. Where is the gravity? This is a serious mental illness. Sure, quarters are cramped, it's severely understaffed, and medicine at this point is non-existant. A mental illness is so much more, these things obviously make it much worse.\n\nA psychological break is huge! You would've had tons of material! Everything and anything can happen, and I feel like nothing happened at all. A psychotic episode is supposed to be one of the most terrifying things you can experience. You're paralyed with fear, and reality slips away from you. People see, hear, taste, touch, and smell horrible (rarely pleasant) things. Things that are 'real'. Things you can't unsee. Considering the lack of space and proper medicine, Renee should pretty much be having daily episodes. ... And? Where are they? I see some 'spooky' hallways and that's about it.\n\nThe whole thing feels sloppy. The music is abrupt, mistakes with spelling and punctuation everywhere, almost all of the documents are in Italian with little to no translation. The voice over is in weird gnarly English, and we get it, we're in Italy. The voice acting is great, however.\n\nDid you interview psych patients? The first thing you'd note in a study group of schizophrenia patients is that Renee's story is incredibly common. Like, painfully common. The story seems like an afterthought compared to the lovely recreation of the hospital. This could've been so much more. The only fun I had with this game was messing around on the playground before it went straight downhill.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\nGame is beautiful, no denying it\nNice voice acting\nMusic is nice\nHistorically accurate depiction of life in a sanitarium\n\nCons:\nVery innaccurate depiction of early onset schizophrenia\n\nThis is my first Steam refund.","May 13","false","0.5"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heazie47/recommended/433100/","Heazie47","Heazie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heazie47/","143 products in account","When you start the game you’re on the outskirts of the insane asylum compound where the game takes place.  Well, you assume you are, anyway.  There’s plenty to see in terms of scenery and the real life areas of the Volterra institution are real lookers for sure.  You aren’t really given an directive at this point, and you’re free to explore while on your way to the asylum proper.  What you’ll find initially are things like a playground, what seems to be a work/recreational shed, and lush plant life all around you.  Everything looks pretty, and you can see care was put into how things look.  Once you make it up to the hospital and get inside, that doesn’t change.  Interiors are beautiful in the aura of sadness the abandoned building represents.  Exploring the interiors and seeing where patients had to live can be heartbreaking.  Seeing the experiments and treatments they had to endure may almost seem unbelievable at times.\n\nOn the flip side, seeing the cramped work environments and what they had to deal with on a non-stop basis from patients, as well as procedures that doctors and nurses had to perform can be upsetting as well.  Not only through the environments and graphical fidelity do they tell this story, but also through notes and newspaper articles, medical records and pictures where you see just how hard it was on the people who had to take care of the mentally ill.  You almost get the sense that even though they were paid to be there, some, if not most, felt like they were trapped there, too.  A debt of respect to both the developers LKA, because you can see clearly they tried to represent both sides, and the people who endured the almost impossible workload  (and seemingly always understaffed) while this place was operational.\n\nWhen you get to story beats or cut scenes, you are treated to a couple of different ways they play out.  Sometimes you’ll get a stylized in engine scene, while other times you’ll get hand drawn out pictures/movies like the one above to further the narrative.  They work really well, and every time I got one, I felt rewarded and pleased when they were over.  Sometimes it’s just a quick still shot, sometimes it’s a major plot point.\n\nRenée’s story is crafted from real life stories that took place here.  I’m sure artistic liberties were taken, because of course they should be, but throughout the game you never feel like anything is too exaggerated.  That’s likely because not only is everything put together well enough, but also because in your lifetime, you’ve likely either heard about, read about, seen on TV (real or entertainment), or perhaps experienced the situations showcased here.  Through all this, you not only get context to the place we’re in, but also how everything was playing out for Renée.  And that brings us to some of the game’s shortcomings.\n\nWhen it comes to the story, as I mentioned, it’s put together well enough, but there are definite missteps here.  For starters, the opening is very slow, and I don’t just mean your movement speed (which I will get to soon enough).  It doesn’t ramp up as quickly as you’d expect it to.  As for who you are, you assume you’re playing as Renée, but half the time the main character uses words or phrases to make you question that.  If you didn’t read anything about the game prior to playing (like the quote I used earlier), you’re left to wonder and assume.  One moment she’s speaking in first person, the next she’s in 3rd person, speaking about how Renée did this or that and what happened to her because of it.  I understand that this was likely a conscious effort to showcase her illnesses, but as a game, when you’re thrown into the start with zero context for anything going on, it’s confusing and disorienting.  One minute you think you know what’s going on, the next you get a line of dialogue that throws you off.  The problem is that it throws you off in the wrong way.\n\nSpeaking of the dialogue, sometimes it’s really good.  Sometimes it’s awkward and lacking in its delivery or writing.  I understand that you’re someone who has many issues, but it came didn’t come across as an artistic decision and more of effort or translation problems (kind of like how over the top “Japanese” Resident Evil games are that they seem so hokey and out of place to us in America).  Not only that, but even the subtitles or documents you find have grammatical errors.  Again, maybe some of the documents were artistic choices, and I can reason that out, but the subtitles?  That doesn’t make sense in the context presented, even if the person is mentally ill.  When a game is so focused on story that it is the main (or only) attraction, any slight dips elsewhere become much more apparent.\n\nKeeping on the subject of the dialogue, a lot of the time, especially starting halfway through the game, when a line is spoken or a scene is playing out, it abruptly stops on the final second or word like someone hit pause on the track just as it was about to finish.  At first I dismissed it, but when it kept happening, it got really annoying and distracting.  Yes, I had subtitles on, but imagine watching a movie and every final word of a scene was cut off in the audio.  That’s what it was like.\n\nMoving around the asylum you come across random items you can pick up and access to look at.  Nothing out of the ordinary for this kind of game.  Unfortunately, with this mechanic, most of the things you interact with, whether they be newspaper clippings, pictures, or random physical items have no use or reasoning.  They’re just there.  If they had something important about them, I never found it or figured it out.  That watering can was just a watering can I picked up.  Sometimes I felt like they wasted their time rendering an item because it offered nothing other than to look at it.  And to that end, figuring out what you can and can’t interact with can sometimes be a chore due to the size and look of the reticle on screen to interact with things.\n\n\nMy complete review is too long for Steam.

This is one of those hipster games like the movies, where the critics love it, and the general public didn't like. Sort of like the Oscars. Some of the good movies never get an Oscar (my boy Leo) because of the hipster people that run the Oscars. After watching sodapoppin make it through 10 minutes of the game and stopping, I knew I wasn't alone.\n\nWith that being said, I am willing to take the it's not you it's me approach to this.\n\nI love watching horror movies and playing scary games. This is neither and I didn't hold that against it. It's a "game" that delivers a story. Picture a movie, that you get to walk around in to trigger events. This is what it is. I liked Firewatch, which is the same thing, but didn't like this. So put all of this in perspective.\n\nI also play visual novels which are solely reading, so none of these factors are being taken into account when I did this review.\n\nPositive:+ Real life places\n+ Hand drawn art\n+ Good sound, good to use with VR\n+ Voice acting, know Cry who did the voice acting\n+ Great game to use VR with, and it supports that\n+ Developer seems active in the community\n\nNegatives:- Price\n- Story is very generic, predictable, and uses that of any horror movie about someone in a psyche ward.\n- Below average optimization of graphics and CPU usage\n- Very slow walking which makes the game seem very slow, unfortunately try playing a game from the 1980's and a game just released. There's a type of speed games have now days that is a pacing of sorts.\n- Not many puzzles, which makes this even more unbearable experience\n- Feels like a chore rather than an experience\n- Bugs (although they seem to get fixed pretty fast)\n\nBelow Average Game: 3/10\n\nThis "game" would be perfect for people who just got a Rift and want to test out their VR. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nTotally aware the hipsters out there are going to down vote the review because of the art I am just not seeing in the game, but oh well.\n\nWas the game enjoyable: No","March 5","false","2.9"," 14 of 34 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","14","34","0","0"

The elements of the game more involved having you go through different parts of the game in order to piece together the story of what occurred.  Thats the major reason why i give this a non-recommendation, other reasons pertain to the repetition of the audio and the gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe audio was well placed but I could tell where it was looping and I felt like they were in my ear the whole time, not all around me.  If the sound had more depth to it, example; if there was a location i needed to be it would get louder the closer i approached it.  The sound would only occur and at full volume when you are at the location.\n\nThe only puzzle I stumbled upon after an hour of gameplay was to heat up the water and even then there was no reason for it.  There was a note to do each part in a certain order, which i messed up at first but the game didn't punish me for it.  I was able to complete it without those instructions rendering them useless.  Also there were no other options other than pick/look at item move to next location and make noted decisions.\n\nI will probably play through the whole game because I like well-driven story games but I feel a bit cheated out of the horror/adventure part of the game.\n\n*Update 2/29* (response to developer note)\n\nI see, this makes a lot of sense because I have seen the issue you have stated happen with a lot of games on steam.  I do apologize if I did not at first see the intent of a pure psychological adventure game, which the game shows a good amount of. Thank you for your explanation and I will continue to enjoy the game further and update the post if I find any errors or concerns.","February 28","false","1.9"," 16 of 39 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","16","39","0","0"

So do be prepared for the unraveling of her memories, black and white illustrations, and case file descriptions that depict harsh abuse, neglect, and sexual and medical violations. I am not entirely sure if all the descriptions are combinations of actual happenings that occurred at the real institution that this game is based off of, or if they simply wrote it for the game, either way it's still something that is heavy for game play.\n\nThe main thing to keep in mind, is that this is much more like discovering the points of, and interacting inside of, a story. It's less about playing a game, and more about following through an environment and guided through specific points to see what had happened with Renee, during the time she was institutionalized. You get to different places or objects, at which you will need to do something to find out more about what happened with Renee, the character you are playing as.\n\nI had a few problems with some of the objects that I was being guided to manipulate. I had one object get stuck when moving it to another location.\n\nSpoiler:\nSometimes the goal of task felt awkward, and possibly distracting from the dark and serious tones of the rest of the game. In one instance, I was needing to move a doll, one that you find during your exploring, and it's clear that Renee recognizes the doll like an old friend and identifies with it. Renee's doll, an object of which she has attached her own sense of self to, is "cold" and "scared" and it becomes Renee's preoccupation to make sure this doll feels safe. At this point you must find a way to "warm" her up. Renee speaks to you persistently, until you get this done, and then also speaks hints directly to you if you aren't quite getting to where you need to go or what to do. At one point, I was moving the doll up to another floor via an old wheel chair. It was awkward and got stuck in the elevator. Moving a doll in a wheel chair to another part of the map was not something I felt was scary, or telling, it felt comical.  I do realize that the game is focused on those of the "insane", but this seemed to cross a line over into "ridiculous" for me that broke the immersion experience.\n\n\nOverall, I hope they keep working on the game, and improve a bit more how they portray the game being played. I think it's important that people understand the graphic concepts being presented in this story, so they know what to expect.","March 30","false","1.0"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

My biggest disappointment is the sound: music triggers and sop suddenly, most of the times you don't have any ambience playing in the background, footsteps are not well randomized, loops are too evident and the sound design itself is quite raw. I thought this game was going to be a really good indie but instead it is dull and not really well made except for the look and the fidelity with the real asilum.","March 12","false","3.2"," 4 of 16 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","4","16","0","0"

The setting isn't really that creepy once you get used to it. There are many other games that does the whole "creepy asylum" thing better. There will be some creepy music playing in the back ground at times and there are journals with some cool medically grotesque images, but it doesn't really amount to anything. I cannot stress this enough, and you probably won't believe me just by watching the trailer but I'll say it again: This game is not scary. This is not a horror game.\n\nNow, most people will tell you that this story is disturbing, and this is true. I will lay the facts out straight: This game deals with the subject of sexual and mental child-abuse. This game is about how medical malpractice ruined a girl's life.  The story itself hardly matters, and you won't care for (or even be able to keep in track of) any of the characters. This is partly due in part to how sometimes the main character will refer to herself in 3rd person. What you will feel is disgust and shock that things like this actually happened in real life. This is how the game tries to impact you.\n\nOn to the gameplay. This game is a walking simulator. The walking pace is slow. It's also very easy to get bored if you can't find what you're looking for. There is no exploration, and rooms are unlocked as you progress further into the story. At times, you will try to open a door only to have it open half way because it hits your character (in a first person game, no less). There is barely anything in the environment you can interact. This game doesn't give you crosshairs despite being first person. You cannot simply walk up to an object to interact with it. You must aim the center of your screen at the object. Using a gamepad for this game can get annoying.\n\nI have decided to avoid rating this game out of 10. I understand that whilst I personally do not like the game, there are some people who will inevitably find this game to be thought provoking. I can somewhat see the sense in that, as the game developers go out of their way to be historically accurate and touch upon a very important issue about the human condition. So I will part on these words: This game is not for everybody. Do you research on this game before buying it. Know exactly what exactly your paying for.","March 1","false","3.0"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","9","28","0","1"

When I tried playing it with my Oculus Rift DK2 it made me motion sick almost instantaniously because there are severe problems with the movement. For on, your movement direction is not synced to your head orientation. The movement itself feels strange because it feels like you "float" around. Level design (I do understand it is an exact recreation of a real environment - but still) doesn't help, because almost every room requires you to turn around full 180 degrees to leave again.\nIf you intend on playing this game in VR I cannot recommend it. For all other intends and purposes, I just didn't make it far enough into the game because of motion sickness, so cannot really comment on that.","February 28","false","0.9"," 11 of 39 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","11","39","0","2"

I was up for grabs with this because of the 80%+ scores, the positives in the review section and the decent trailers.\n\nAll of that does not live up to the game, the graphics were something out of a half life 2 spinoff if it did horror games in an Italian Asylum that involved a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ orderly, lesbian lovers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nurses/doctors that do nothing to solve this\n"Hellhole" that the badly voiced protagonist makes out.\n\nAnother thing, an American 16 year old with a doll ending up in an Italian Asylum that just happens to look the same in present and past. The place had the whole feel of a horror game waiting to happen but instead gave a handjob to Gone Home and Outlast and then pussied out after they realised they were too deep in the relationship.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to be made out, the music is obnoxiously annoying, the whole "anti-gravity" section where you walk on walls in a walking scene made we wonder what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on and finally, the characters were all either seducing a 16 year old or had weird facial features.\n\nNote to Devs:\n\nI understand you want to go for a story rich game but the foundation to a good story is interesting characters, a good hook and no cliches. What you instead ended up putting into the public's eye was an oversaturated location, an out of place and generically voiced protagonist, a cliche story of "finding yourself" and the god slam inaccuracy of the italian language.\n\nPlease think through your game's foundations before you create another.\nRegards.","May 10","false","1.1"," 8 of 35 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","8","35","0","3"

Worse yet, you can't run, so you end up plodding around.  The notes, clues building/room labels etc. are written in Italian.  While there are English subtitles, I find this very disincenting.  I would far prefer to read the original clues directly rather than the subtitles.  I did not find the naration of the story especially compelling either.  Chapter five was as far as I could make myself play.  It's not difficult to google a synopsis of the plot and while I agree that the point that game intends to make is valid, it doesn't make that point in a compelling way.
