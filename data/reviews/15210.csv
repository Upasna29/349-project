The tension and sense of achievement I experienced with it were quite unlike any other game I have played in over 20 years.\n\nMy most memorable moment came when patrolling in the Atlantic off the Western coast of Ireland. According to German command an Allied shipping convoy was expected to pass through the area. I patrolled the area leisurely for days, constantly checking in with my hydrophone operator for signs of the convoy. After 5 days, he finally called out a contact.\n\nI took over the hydrophone myself. He was right. There was the distant sound of screws bearing through the water. I immediately went to consult with my naval charts and try to calculate an approximate course for the convoy and an interception course for my boat. It was nothing more than guesswork facilitated by rulers and sextants. Nevertheless I gave the order for the navigational officer to change course. We had reached the Atlantic uneventfully and still had all of our torpedoes. Anticipation of the hunt crept into my thoughts.\n\nWe waited for about a day and a half, following the convoy through the hydrophones. Then the watchman at the conning tower reported he had sighted a ship. I went up in the tower with him and grabbed my binoculars. Distant dots littered the horizon. We had found the convoy. There were a little over a dozen ships guarded by two destroyers from the British Navy. It was late in the afternoon. Night and the protective shroud of darkness were still hours away.\n\nI decided to follow ahead of them and wait for darkness. I returned to my charts and plotted a new course for the navigator. Then we waited. The convoy grew closer and closer. Eventually, sailing on the surface became too risky a proposition and I ordered a dive, still staying ahead of the convoy. As we continued ahead of our prey, daylight eventually gave way to twilight, which gave way to darkness. The moment to strike had finally come.\n\nI ordered every man to battle stations and for the navigator to take the boat off to the right flank of the convoy. The boat was positioned perfectly in the darkness. About 6-700 meters off the closest ship. I ordered the torpedo hatches opened and together with my weapons officer I calculated a firing solution. We were in perfect postition. Our target was a Liberty merchant vessel sailing under the British flag. I fired two torpedoes. They went off towards our target. Due to our proximity we did not have to wait long for the results. Both torpedos scored direct hits and cracked the merchant vessel in two. A fiery explosion briefly turned night into day on the surface. I immediately ordered a dive and submerged beneath the convoy in order to hide the sound of our engines against those of the ships in the convoy and hopefully confound the escorts. It worked.\n\nThroughout the night I hounded the convoy, heading up near the surface to sink another ship before going back down again. I heard the sound of depth charges turning water into foam. I sank 5 ships worth nearly 30,000 tons of shipping. By the night's end we had spent all of our torpedoes and I pulled away, reporting the convoy's position and estimated course back to German command so that other u-boats might fall upon it.\n\nDawn arrived along with a feeling of euphoria. I set a course back for port. As I watched the sun rise over the Atlantic, Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" played from the worn old grammophone in my quarters.\n\nWe sailed North and East of Great Britain so that we might stay as far away from British patrols and air coverage as possible. Morale on the boat was excellent. Our patrol had lasted nearly 3 weeks. Then, the Watchman spotted another ship on the horizon. It was a distant, lonely dot. Impossible to make out. We had expended all of our torpedoes in the attack on the convoy, yet our deck gun was still fully loaded and able to sink unarmed merchant vessels. Enthusiastic about my earlier victory and eager to add another kill, I ordered the boat to close in on the distant speck. That was a mistake.\n\nEven as the ship grew larger in my binoculars, I had trouble making out its shape against the horizon. Then, its identity became all too clear, when I spotted two flashes of light from its deck. Panicked, I ordered an emergency dive but it was already too late. The first shell landed in the water a little way's off the boat and sent a geyser of water cascading into the air. The other shell scored a direct hit on the boat.\n\nWe dived and I ordered full power to the engines, even as water poured into the boat and started to fill the compartments. The men fought a desperate battle against a tide that seemed to be unending, all the while we descended further and further into the depths... 100 meters... 150 meter... The hull started to creak dangerously. The boat would not pull up. It had taken on too much water. We could not blow the ballast tanks. The destroyer was up there waiting for us...200 meters...\n\nI watched the depth gauge, my heart pounding in my chest. The hull creaked loudly. Finally, the chief engineer had managed to seal the leaks in the engine room and pump out impressive amounts of water. There were dead and wounded. Morale, which had been so high only an hour earlier, was now at a low point. The boat was still going down. I looked at the faces of my men. There was no other choice. Come what way. I ordered them to blow the ballast tanks.\n\nWe surfaced. There was no sign of the British warship that had opened fire on us. I could not believe our luck. I immediately ordered the crew to attend to full repairs and for the navigator to set us back on course for home. With luck and God on our side, we managed to limp back to Germany and safety but not without the harshest of lessons.\n\nOn the Atlantic Ocean you are only the hunter until you become the prey.","June 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 157 of 164 people (96%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","96","157","164","23","2"

It is a perfect example of a "Dad game," as Yahtzee Crowshaw once put it. It's meticulously detailed, and you must learn all of the different eccentricities of the sub to be a great captain.\n\nIt uses the real-life technological limitations from WWII to define the gameplay. Want to fire off a torpedo? A standard gas-powered torpedo leaves a trail of bubbles in the water, which ships can detect in advance and will swerve to avoid your torpedo. You can fire an electric torpedo, but you'll need to be close, or else the battery in the torpedo will die and it won't reach your target. SH3 is filled with these sorts of tactical nuances that really make it satisfying to play.\n\nDifficulty is customizable. It can be as simple as "point the periscope at a target and shoot," to manually identifying and anaylizing your target's position relative to your own. Difficulty is increased by making the game more akin to real life (limited air, limited fuel, no periscope stablilization, etc.) This helps tremendously, since beginners can relax the difficulty while they familiarize themselves with the ships' systems.\n\nThe player is awarded more renown following a mission with high difficulty, compared to a mission with a lower difficulty setting. Renown is SH3's version of experience points. It allows you to 'purchase' upgrades for your sub like improved batteries, hydrophones, conning towers, or even a completely different sub altogether. Medals are awarded after each mission, which you can assign to your crew. This is probably the single most satisfying part of the game; the medals allow your crew to function more efficiently, thus improving things like torpedo reload times.\n\nThere's a lot to cover here, so let me just wrap this this up by saying that this is probably the best simulation game I've ever played. I find myself coming back to it every couple of weeks. It's aged quite horribly, but I don't care, since the gameplay is just too good. Forget the sequels in this series, SH3 is the best.","November 25, 2013","true","198.1"," 116 of 119 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","116","119","2","4"

If that tickles your fancy it is equally as good as SH3.\n\nSH3 features German U-boats in the Atlantic theatre in WWII. It has adjustable settings for difficulty, which the game deems "realism". These features include whether the game will just automatically lock on to a target and automatically set your torpedoes upon them, or whether you would like to do the calculations yourself. Let me tell you there is a significantly rewarding feeling when doing the calculations yourself, waiting for what seems like an eternity for the impact, not knowing whether the torpedo will hit... then you see it happen. You almost can't believe it. Such a great feeling.\n\nThis game isn't about instant gratification. There is a lot of planning involved and you will have to figure out how to best intersect with your targets' headings. It is really rewarding though, and I can't say that about a lot of games.\n\nAs far as mods, I suggest going with Grey Wolves and then heading over to subsim.com to check out what is available.","January 27, 2014","true","13.7"," 66 of 68 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","66","68","0","0"

Simple, easy to remember.\n\nThat is, until you get dud torpedoes that cheat you out of that BIG score, a swarm of aircraft just won't leave you alone by swooping down time & again, your crew are all exhausted, an escorting destroyer is determined to depth-charge you back to the stone age, sweeping over you again & again while you desperately try to contain any damage & sneak away to safety...\n\nThe game allows you to fast-forward the cruising bit, you don't strictly have to return to base once you complete your objectives, you can program each torpedoe manually or let the game manage it, manage & train up your crew, upgrade you sub, go whatever route you want, sink what you want, Silent Hunter 3 really is what ever you want it to be.\n\nIf all you want is to drool over high resolution textures & realistic faces, go somewhere else, but if you want a fairly unique, utterly immersive & tense gameplay experience, Silent Hunter 3 really is a great game. Highly recommended.","June 21, 2014","true","84.0"," 54 of 54 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","54","54","0","0"

It's quite simple.\nBut the idea - of making ships go to the bottom (that's very well detailed as well) simply grabs my attention irreversibly.\n\nIf you're into ships, this game is one you should try.\n\nAlthough it's nearly 10 years old, a marvelous mod called "The Grey Wolves" breathes some life into it, while a small but friendly community on www.subsim.com keeps this legendary game alive and sailing.\n\nI'd say it's quite sad that we don't get these types of games more often.\n\nAlso, yes - this is probably better than Silent Hunter V at least without mods (not many of them (up to today - 23/07/2014)).","July 23, 2014","true","88.0"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","45","46","0","0"

I remember buying this game when it first came out in stores and this is by far the best Silent Hunter, in the entire series. Silent Hunter 4, in my opion is the last game that works Silent Hunter 5, is a half finished game that you have to mod in order to fully enjoy this game is what Silent Hunter, is all about and best of all you can choose what year to start your career. Until 1943 but the campign continues until 1945 when Germany surrenders to the allies. After 1943, being on the surface is a death trap especially when the allied submarine hunter groups are formed. I highly recmoend either GWX or Living Silent Hunter to enjoy this great game even more my personal preference is GWX, Living Silent Hnter, adds more details to the game where as GWX adds more story into the games great story.","October 20, 2014","true","63.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

January.\n\nThe Wermancht is slowly being pushed back by the Soviet Union, and the Allies plan their invasion of France. Things are looking grim for the German war machine. Many look to the renmants of its once-mighty U-boat fleet to perform a miracle and strangle Great Britain's supply line, but you know better.\n\nYou are the commander of U-99, and you patrol the North Sea in a vain attempt to find something, anything, to sink. Then, your spot something on the horizon. Smoke. Possibly an unescorted supply ship. You try to get a better look at the distant ship, and your heart sinks when you spot more smoke. Not a single supply ship, but a fleet of destroyers. A fleet coming right toward you. You give the order for a crash dive, and the sub quickly sinks below the frigid waters.\n\nMinutes pass. Hours. Eventually your hydrophone operator reports them cruising right above you, apparently oblivious to your presence. After another nail-biting hour, their engines fade into the distance.\n\nYou got lucky. With a deep breath, you order the sub to silently cruise underwater, before surfacing to recharge its batteries.\n\nSilent Hunter III is a U-Boat simulator, and probably the best one in the series. Your objective is simple: sink as much of the Allied fleet as you possibly can. This goal becomes more and more difficult as WWII drags on, and by the end you're thinking less of how many ships you'll sink during one tour than whether or not you'll survive.\n\nThis game can be as tense as any survival horror. If you're a fan of any kind of vehicle simulaton game, or just a WWII buff, buy this and buy it right now.","November 26, 2014","true","126.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

SH3 is set against the backdrop of WW2 (in its entirety), but it is a different beast to any shooter or RTS. The war is definitely going on out there, but you're merely a boat in the ocean and your focus is your orders, your crew and the deep waters immediately out around you. In historical writings this ocean arena is referred to with reverance for both sides playing a high stakes chess game in an isolated battlefield with little of the political discolourings of the mainland.\n\nOne of those games to draw you in and hold your attention across many hundreds of hours.\n\nNOTE: the Grey Wolves 3 mod is considered MANDATORY!

The stock game is alright but the mods are what really take this game to a higher level. Look up the Grey Wolves Expansion (GWX) and other mods for a more realistic and interesting   experience. This is not designed to be an arcade game and will get boring if you don't know what you are doing or you are not interested in the events the game represents.

Definitely add the GWX mod.  I have played this game more than one time, so I have the hours racked up on it.  It's easier than mastering a sub simulator like Sub Command.  Nice interface to make your own missions.\n\nBugs:  You will occasionally spend time sinking a ship and it will not be counted as being "sunk."\nOn my computer the graphics sometimes flake out until restart on heavy particles (smoke fire)\n\nOnly real complaint is that the game campaign needed an ending.  It really doesn't have one.  When you finish your final patrol at the end of the war, the game just sort of stops.  Would have been better to show a resolution like the subs being bombed, being taken prisoner or something....\n\n\n","May 23, 2014","true","823.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

By the end of 1942 its hard to tell who's hunting who as Allies develop more brutal and effective weapons and tactics to put and end to your rein of terror on the high seas.\n\nFortunately the difficulty is fully adjustable so you can give your self some help if needed, but navigating without aides and acquiring, tracking, and destroying targets by hand with dive bombers and and destroyers hot on your tail gives a satisfaction rarely seen in even the newest and most hyped games.","January 12, 2014","true","126.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What.... you haven't bought one of the best games of all time? Please.... you're kidding me? Right?\n\n\nProbably one of the greatest, if not amazing and outstounding games to ever surface (pardon the sub-themed pun there).\n\nDon't be deceived by the cheap, Disk version like i was, absolute piece of rubbish, and will only work on the recommended OS's on the back of the case- Some hooky software programs within the instalation process prevent it from working.\n\nThat aside, the Steam version tops the charts, easy install and easy to use. Only 2 main problems (which you MIGHT) come across, with easy resolutions:\n- If a message, on startup, pops up saying something about failed run, or cannot run e.t.c 3D graphics (something related like that), just simply alter your screen resolution to the notch down (right click on desktop, screen resolution) simple!\n- If you're installing GWX, then make sure it goes to the Silent Hunter 3 Steam folder, and not the make-believe, Disk-domain 'Ubisoft folder'.\n\n\n\nOn the note of GWX, GWX Gold is highly recommended, fixes most, if not all, the bugs. Adds in more realsim and greater weather and weather-fixes, as well as more sounds, subs, ships and skin-packs for new campaignes and designs.\n\n\nEasily deserves a 100 on the Metascore, and definitely a 15 out of 10 for me.\n\nIn 2 words: Simply outstanding!","December 29, 2013","true","97.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You litterally cannot surface your boat anywhere south of greenland without being pounced by bombers.  It's neither realistic nor fun.\n\nEDIT: A bit of clarification, as I realised that "south of greenland" is somewhat ambigous. I prefer to operate out of Bergen which means having to navigate north of the british isles to get to the patrol sectors in the central atlantic. I tried several different routes to get there and anything short of sailing way north and hugging the southeastern coast of greenland would immidately draw the ire of RAF. No amount of underwater erratic saling would shake them, as soon as I surfaced, bam. There they were again. They certainly didn't have this behavior when I last played the game so I suspect some sort of patch has been involved to force players to take exactly that route to greenland which means north atlantic missions get excessively long and BORING (you hardly find anything worth sinking up there)\n\nI don't mind being chased by a flotillia of destroyers, that's what makes this game so intense. But Bomber harrasment of this magnitude seems pointless, as there is really nothing you can do about it, save for remaining submerged and hope they loose interest before you loose battery power and oxygen","July 31, 2015","false","14.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","1","8","0","1"

Lots of control panels indicated your depth, c02 levels, pressure, different kinds of deck gun shells, torpedoes, etc.\nThe complexity of this title is appealing, as it leads to more in depth gameplay and I like that. It took me about 3 hours to figure out how to maneuver my uboat somewhat decently, fire off the deck guns, and launch torpedoes terribly off the mark.\nJust the training has left me feeling a little eager to try myself in real(albeit simulated) combat.\nI continue the training and work on my torpedoes. They bounce off, they miss, they are in limited supply. Its moderately frustrating.\nThe visuals continue to be unappealing, and I decide to drop the game. My opinion is that a game of this type requires better visuals, and therefore I dropped it. I am not sure if I will try again, but I doubt it.\nFor this reason, I do not recommend the game, even though I have, on many occasions, been able to look past visual elements without an issue.\n\n","March 7, 2014","false","3.9"," 5 of 33 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","5","33","0","2"

Plotting intercept courses, manual torpedo solutions, etc. all require a knowledge of trigonometry and angles that the tutorial does not cover. This presents a problem to people like myself who graduated a while ago and can't remember a thing related to math, other than basic concepts.\nThe reason I say that doing the above things is the most satisfying way to play is because when I played on easy settings, where the AI does all the torpedo calculations and course calculations, I felt like I was a lazy, under-qualified ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ captain who did nothing by himself and who inherited the position of captain because all other candidates onboard the sub were killed by chestbursters and the Alien. I felt cheap, in other words, because then it just became to easy. You might say "Geez dumbass, why not look up how to do these things on the interwebs and the internets?" Well, peeps, I did do that. And you know what? It made me feel worse, cuz I still didn't ever successfully intercept a ship.\nNow, if you are in high school and have a fresh knowledge of trig and math, then you may like this game, because other than the incredible difficulty, everything else is great. The graphics are good, the sub exterior and interiors look awesome. No complaints there.\nIn summary, only buy this if you have an understanding of trigonometry and angles and will put serious effort into this game. Otherwise, watch "Hunt for Red October"","October 23, 2014","false","10.7"," 3 of 30 people (10%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","10","3","30","7","0"

Save often, and sink ships. This game is frustrating at times because you literally leave port and sail for days to get to your patrol grid. Thankfully you can fast forward time. It is very rewarding to sink a ship in this game, and you always need to be vigilant and think ahead. You spent an hour getting to this grid. Try not to waste your torpedoes. Aim true, and google how to manually set your torps, using impact or magnetic pistols, depth, speed, and trajectory. The graphics are from 2005 so don't expect a visual masterpiece. There aren't many bugs. This game is pre DLC and it is awesome. Buy it if you enjoyed movies like red october, U-571, or any other submarine movie. I'd rate this a solid 10/10, this is a classic game from a time when computer games were innocent.

This game was a dream out of my fantasy.\n\nYou're a Nazi officer tasked to patrolling the waters of the world (full world map, landscape, & ocean generated), building a career and managing/commandering a U-Boat (you bet they sim the ♥♥♥♥ out management too!). You get a believable feeling from the beginning. You can begin right before WWII. All of a sudden, while out a few days on a mission around the North Sea, the radioman tells you that UK and France are now enemies, as with historical accuracy of 1939! Uh oh!\n\nI love to play a little hardcore, with only playing in realtime.\nThis makes it so I can do homework/housework on the open sea.\nAnd have more realistic feelings when I see something on the horizon or something happens on the ship.\nBut of course there is a fast forward timewarp option....\n\nThat said, Silent Hunter III has less Roleplay and "gamey" value, and more Sim value. Almost everything is interactable, with all kinds of planning, charting, manual torpedo firing (extremely involved), maneuvering, option for German-only voiceovers etc etc etc. Almost everything simmy you want out of a submarine sim is here.\n\nHowever, my heart ♥♥♥♥ing races when we get hit and water is spewing through the pipes, and my crew is in a panic looking to me for orders, with fear in their voices as they acknolwedge, and the red lights are beaming in the sub....... moments like these make the sim a more valuable roleplay experience than anything.\n\n....Albiet an old game, with some expected flaws of an old game, it's a submarine dreamer's fantasy, with a historical immersiveness, and mod community to boot!","October 17, 2015","true","181.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TorkWrench/recommended/15210/","TorkWrench","TorkWrench","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TorkWrench/","83 products in account","Another personal favourite of mine that I keep returning to. SHIII is an excellent game, with in-depth (no pun intended) mechanics and realistic simulation aspects. I'll examine my pros and cons fro the game, as it would be difficult to write an entire review about it and keep it succinct.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent interface: With such a complicated game, it would be easy to cllutter the screen with a billion little buttons. The inclusion of several different interfaces that are easy to get to allows easy navigation of not  nly the massive world, but also the beautifully baffling complexity of the game.\n\nTime compression: While the sense of scale of a full size Atlantic Ocean is impressive, I can't imagine how dull it would be to sit down and do noting for weeks of real life time. Allowing the player to manipulate the time by speeding it up by up to 1040 times facilitates much wuicker travel.\n\nRealism options: I'm not gonna lie, I'm a scrub. I can't do anything on high difficulties. I was very happy to discover an option given right off the bat that can be changed at nearly any time. This ooption allowed me to avoid some pitfalls that would have destroyed me within minutes. I don't need to surface to vent CO2, and I believe that the boat can take more damage. There's other options that I can't remember off the top of my head.\n\nCombat: Some of the tensest moment I've experienced in all of my time playing PC games, or indeed, any games, have been during Silent Hunter combat. A destroyer detecting you can be a death sentence, so encountering one can immediately ratchet up your stress level. Of course, you need to sink that tonnage. So, there's always a decision to make. Do you turn on silent running and dive a a few score meters, or do you put your attack periscope up and put a couple fish in the water, knowing full well that they could detect you at any moment and open up on you with a massive deck gun before going right over you and depth charging the water? A daring captain might take a page out of Clark Gable's book in 'Run silent, Run Deep', and get the destroyer to head your way, full steam before you fire torpedoes. The tension and choices of the game are immersive.\n\nThere are, of course, more pros that I can't put down now, as I can't think of them.\nCons:\n\nYou are a Nazi: Well, you may not share the insane philosophies of Reich brass, but your character serves one of the most evil governments that the world has ever seen. Fortunately, this fact is dulled by the lack of anything that would detract from the gameplay, so there is no hateful ideology directly in the game.\n\nNo Steam Workshop Modding Suppourt/ Developer's Console: I know that the game is about realism and the problems one faces as a submarine captain in the age before advanced targeting systems and onboard homing devices, but sometimes, I can't help but wish that I could put a nuclear homing torpedo in the water and instantly blow up a warship, or fearlessly ram a destroyer, splitting it in half. Also, due to the large number of models, it would be extemely difficult to retexture the game to make it feel, somehow, even more realistic.\n\nNo Online Play: It's an old game, and Ubisooft no longer has servers for it, though I've heard some great stories from people who played it when online play was a thing.\n\nTime compression does not work when close to shore: It's good to remember that the next con I have is a personal one, designed to prevent someone from bottoming out or beaching the boat in shallow water, but it can make prowling fjords and areas around harbours very tedious, while getting out of some friendly docks can be a pain, with the time compression slowing down to four times, especially in one French port, whch I can't remember the name of.\n\nLooking back at what I've written, I realize that though I attempted to review such a complex game in a succinct manner, I've only succeeded in writing a full length review. Now, though, I'll brand the game and end the review with a numerical score.\n\n9.2/10\nWould play again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.","July 9, 2015","true","289.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was a dream out of my fantasy.\n\nYou're a Nazi officer tasked to patrolling the waters of the world (full world map, landscape, & ocean generated), building a career and managing/commandering a U-Boat (you bet they sim the ♥♥♥♥ out management too!). You get a believable feeling from the beginning. You can begin right before WWII. All of a sudden, while out a few days on a mission around the North Sea, the radioman tells you that UK and France are now enemies, as with historical accuracy of 1939! Uh oh!\n\nI love to play a little hardcore, with only playing in realtime.\nThis makes it so I can do homework/housework on the open sea.\nAnd have more realistic feelings when I see something on the horizon or something happens on the ship.\nBut of course there is a fast forward timewarp option....\n\nThat said, Silent Hunter III has less Roleplay and "gamey" value, and more Sim value. Almost everything is interactable, with all kinds of planning, charting, manual torpedo firing (extremely involved), maneuvering, option for German-only voiceovers etc etc etc. Almost everything simmy you want out of a submarine sim is here.\n\nHowever, my heart ♥♥♥♥ing races when we get hit and water is spewing through the pipes, and my crew is in a panic looking to me for orders, with fear in their voices as they acknolwedge, and the red lights are beaming in the sub....... moments like these make the sim a more valuable roleplay experience than anything.\n\n....Albiet an old game, with some expected flaws of an old game, it's a submarine dreamer's fantasy, with a historical immersiveness, and mod community to boot!","October 17, 2015","true","181.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
