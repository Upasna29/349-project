(Yep you read it right, controlling something that is out of control.)\n\nI can't say this game is in a category of Shoot 'Em Up since it doesn't really require you to shoot things. (There are many undestructable object).\nYour job is to evade all the objects and make your way throughout the waves.\nThe game itself is fast paced. you start with a normal speed and the speed will keep on increasing every seconds.\nIt will only dropped if you're dead.\n\nConsidering the price, it's also not a bad game for a quick entertainment.","October 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

No idea, but whenever I have few minutes to spare, I play this game.\nGive it a chance, don't let small price and simplicity fool you. :)","October 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A very simple, very fun game with tight controls and a charming aesthetic.  They've done a good job with the trailer and screenshots - what you see is what you get.\n\nThis is probably the first shmup I've played in which the levels can be snarky.\n\nAbsolutely worth the tiny full price.  Controls wonderfully with a gamepad.\n\n","October 6, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
