You start out as a lowly samurai doing jobs for your daimyo (fighting in top down zelda style battles, battling in one on one sword duels and even going on assassination missions and whatnot) until you're promoted to Daimyo yourself at which point it becomes more of a strategy game where you have to birth heirs (or face game over with your death) and slowly start conquering every province of Japan until you can claim yourself emperor in one giant RTS battle.  There are so many facets to this game and even in this crude state it still brings me hours of fun.  Check the credits closely and see even the great Sid Meier worked on this one.  It'd be a definite classic if they'd put his name on it but I don't think he had that kind of clout yet back then.  I have looked for years and can say there is no game out there that fully encompasses everything this game has to offer and I wish someone would make an updated remake or at least try something as ambitious as this game was.","October 18, 2014","true","1.7"," 99 of 111 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","99","111","2","9"

At the time, I immediately answered Sword of the Samurai. It was an immediate buy for me when I discovered it tonight. It was (is) a very deep game for it's time and had many different, and fun elements. Heck, if you are ok with minecraft graphics, then you should have no problems with these. And don't forget, Sid Meier was invloved with this game. He helped develop the AI and the dueling. Long Live Microprose! And that! Don't forget the long history of amazing Microrpose games.

Despite the tropical paradise surrounding me, I spent a lot of time sitting in the hotel room reading through the extremely well done manual, excited to get home and give it a try.   And, of course, when I finally did get home to try it, I played the living crap out of it.\n\nI've always felt this game never got the recognition it deserved.  I'm glad to see that it's available on Steam at a low price so those who missed out can give it a shot. Obviously, this is an old game and if the older graphics are a problem for you, you may not enjoy it.  But if you are into the kind of gameplay provided by other Microprose games like Pirates!, you don't want to miss out on this.\n\nPersonally, I think a modern remake is in order.","January 4","true","2.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","20","20","3","1"

The depth, especially for a game of that time, is simply amazing.  Diplomacy, duels, warfare, and personal missions exploring an enemy castle to sabotage, humiliate, assassinate, or take a hostage (or get one of yours back!).  And while the graphics show their age the writing is still well done and I think the artwork in the still shots is still enjoyable.  But it's the gameplay that I'm buying this for, not for pretty pictures.\n\nThere's some tricks to the game of course and the enemy AI has its weaknesses.  The battles especially are easy to win at once you learn a few tricks.  The enemy AI isn't very aggressive and will sit there and let you surround it and hit it's army from both sides at once, guaranteeing victory.  And with the duels you can pretty much win by just hammering away.  But the AI is much stronger in the diplomacy section with enemies working against you.  The first time someone shows up with a pack of ninjas to kill you, you'll probably die.\n\nIt's in the over-head battles/adventures that the game's AI really shines especially while sneaking into an enemy castle.  If you're not seen or kill the guards before they sound the alarm you can actually succeed just by stealth.  Usually tho you'll end up with the alarm being sounded and you'll have to fight your way through.  That's when you learn to hate the spear wielding enemies and that's when you see the enemy AI be smart, especially on higher difficulty.  I generally will set up in a long hallway and use my bow to kill enemies as they charge at me but after a while the guards will notice the pile of bodies and do two things: they'll try and work their way around and hit you from another direction and they'll start to wait for you as reinforcements arrive.  Time is on THEIR side and if you wait until there's three swordsmen, an archer and a spearman waiting for you, you're in trouble Charlie.  On higher difficulty settings the number of enemies increases until even today I find those types of fights a challenge on highest difficulty.\n\nAnd on that note I'd like to recommend the roleplaying aspects of this game.  When you're in that type of battle you can take two hits before losing and/or dying but when you get hit the first time your character starts to move noticeably slower as his wounds slow him down.  Your enemies have morale and if you slay enough of them the others will run away like cowardly dogs!  The writers had a good understanding of Japanese culture and it shows in the diplomacy and how you go about getting ahead in society.  That's the kind of thing you just didn't see that often in games of that time.  There were individual games that had these aspects, but few that combined them all.\n\nSo... if you're more interested in gameplay than graphics, give it a shot!  You'll be glad you did.  And of course ignore the limited number of hours it shows me as having played this game, I've played it for hundreds and hundreds of hours, just not on steam ~_O","June 12, 2015","true","9.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rpundurs/recommended/327950/","rpundurs","rpundurs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rpundurs/","230 products in account","Sword of the Samurai is an unbelievably deep and charming game. The ancient graphics hardly distract from the incredibly solid mechanics, especially since retropixel style is all the rage these days. Sword of the Samurai offers essentially three minigames under an umbrella of casual strategy roleplaying. The one-on-one duels, one-on-many melees, and full-scale battles all have their charms, but by far the most satisfying (and difficult) play experience is to be found in the melees.\n\nSometimes you'll be minding your own business when you come across a band of uppity ronin whose heads need to part ways from their necks. Sometimes you'll be stealing into your lord's mansion in the dead of night to stab your way to a promotion when a tripped alarm turns your stealth mission into Kill Bill Volume 1. Sometimes your psychotic father-in-law keeps breaking into your house to kidnap your son. It's delightful!\n\nThat said, the strategy roleplaying layer that connects these minigames is nothing to sneer at either;  even taken on its own, it's more interactive than some RPGs. What's truly remarkable about Sword of the Samurai - especially for its age - is the depth of agency it grants to the player. Your goal is to become Shogun, naturally, but your means of doing so are entirely up to you. Diplomacy, conquest, and subterfuge are all valid paths to success, and a successful player can make use of whatever tactic suits the present moment. It's little wonder that a young Sid Meier (yes, *that* Sid Meier) had a hand in its creation.\n\nThe least attractive aspect of the game has to be its control scheme, which is somewhat opaque and unintuitive even with the help of the manual and technical supplement. (PROTIP: The keys you will be using most are the arrow keys, Enter, Backspace, Escape, and F1 through F3.) Even once you've figured out the controls to duels and melees, the battle interface is so unwieldy that in battles with more than three or four units to a side, mostly you will wind up watching your troops do the fighting for you on autopilot - attempting to intervene directly usually does more harm than good.\n\nAll things considered, Sword of the Samurai is a forgotten gem that's worth at least one playthrough. $7 may be too steep for any game from 1989, no matter the quality, but if you see it on sale (like I did), be sure to snag it.","July 15, 2015","true","26.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

At the center of this role-playing, action-adventure simulation of combat, statesmanship and intrigue, you are a samurai warrior struggling for honor. More important than life itself, honor is crucial to achieving your ultimate goal: unifying feudal Japan under your noble rule.\n_________________________________\n\nStory\nBasically, you lead a lineage of noble Japanese lords as they ascend from simple local leader to conqueror of the entire realm. During your voyage, you will have to perform numerous feats- from leading your armies in combat to sneaking in kidnapper hideouts, wishing to rescue the maiden worthy of your family's name. You will also enter in furious duels, and take part in court intrigues which never cease to threat your position in game.\n\nYour goal? To ultimately become the Shogun.\n\nGameplay\nSword of the Samurai is a fantastic mixture of strategy and action elements, which can teach a lot of lessons to modern gaming titles.\n\nIt is up to you to use your wits, followers and skills to usurp, assassinate or befriend the opposition. You can also dishonour your opponents, and force them into ruin by nefarious means- but beware! Any treachery resulting in failure to slay your superiors can mean loss of face and honour, forcing you and your family to commit seppuku, ritual suicide.\n\nYou can take on a wife and create a dynasty, that will one day inherit the title of Shogun, lord and master of all Japan, unified under your banner.\n\nGraphics | Immersion | Sound\nSword of Samurai is remarkable at giving you the impression of really "being there". Despite old graphics and rudimentary sound, it somehow manages to immerse you in its fascinating world, as you anxiously think of your next move.\n\nDifficulty\nFortunately the game is very unforgiving on higher difficulties, but never frustrating. You always blame yourself for failures, angry that you succumbed to your greed or agression.\n\nThe drawbacks? Sometimes you build your character to a very high level, only to die in a duel or lose prestige due to a bad choice. Then you are put in position of your character's own son, whose stats might annoy you at first. But luckily, thanks to quick progression the game doesn't bore you too much with this.\n\nPrice\nNormally the game will hold you back $6.99, I bought it on sale for $0.97 however.\n_________________________________\n\nConclusion\nIn any case, I highly suggest this game to everyone, especiallly those who value gameplay and immersion in a title. The controls may be a little wanky, and the graphics may not have aged incredibly well, but if you put your mind to it and take the time to settle yourself on the game you're in for a good time.","September 12, 2015","true","21.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

It has simple controls with complex decision making. In regards to the controls, I highly recommend reading the manual and the technical supplement before you start playing. They explain what the controls are as well as what sorts of strategies you might want to employ in order to ascend the ranks of medieval Japan. With 4 difficulties, and 48 provinces to start from, this game has a lot of options that can fit any play style you might choose.\n\nTypes of choices you may come across. In the quest to increase your honor, you can complete quests offered by your lord, wander around killing bandits, OR you can sneak into your competitors estates and decrease their honor. Be careful though, if you get caught it takes a huge chunk of your own honor out. The game also takes several generations in order to win. You start off with your initial character being a youth, and as you increase your land and honor, you become a suitable spouse. After the marriage your wife will give you children and once you have a son you have an heir. If you decide not to get married you do have an appointed heir who is not related to you, really your preferance, but it is nice knowing your name will be carried on. Once your son grows up and your character dies control is transferred to your son and the cycle continues. You also have your daughters to consider though. Suitors will come with interests in marriage. This is useful in creating marriage alliances so choose your daughters husbands wisely.\n\nWhile this game does have a lot going for it, the strategic army v. army battles are pretty clunky. Its not really a surprise considering this game is from '89, but really the only way the ensure victory is to have an overwhellmingly huge army against a moderate to small army.\n\nso, in the end\n\nPros:\nHighly replayable\nSuits many play styles\nVery good RPG elements\nFun\nVery nostalgic\n\nCons:\nClunky RTS combat","October 20, 2014","true","2.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

In that sense, this game is a sibling of Pirates! and Covert Action, both of which I also highly, highly recommend.\n\nIn this game, you are a low level Samurai  in feudal Japan, with a few loyal warriors under you, and ambitions of becoming ruler of all Japan. To do this, you need to beat your rivals to become the leader of your province, then the leader of your clan, and from there set your sights on total conquest.\n\nYou do this by you, personally, aiming to be the best possible candidate for succession when your lord and master dies. You do that by acquiring honour, land holdings, and skill in swordsmanship and generalship, exceeding that of your rivals.\n\nOr.... if you are without honour, you can sneak into your rival's home, silently kill the guards, kidnap their heir, and force them to send you a proportion of their income or even speak well of you before your mutual lord.\n\nOr, if you are a skilled swordsman, you can challenge your rival to a duel, by insulting them and their ancestors. They must accept or lose honour, and then it is down to your own skill with the blade (and the swordfighting minigame).\n\nOr you can wander the countryside, righting wrongs, slaying sea bandits, kidnappers, thugs, and anyone else who would insult the honour of a noble samurai.\n\nNot forgetting to get married and have a child to take over your legacy when you die or retire (alowing you to continue the game after your character retires or is killed).\n\nOne of my favourite things about the game is that it does not prevent you from doing illegal, dishonourable things. If you are caught, your lord may order you to commit ritual suicide, but you still have the option to act the next turn (including launching a military assault on your sworn lord). If you do not carry out the seppuku (or depose your lord), the game ends with your entire family exterminated. If you do, your heir takes over and the game continues.\n\n\nVery much recommended. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Japanese culture and/or history.\n\nThe one major gameplay flaw I've found is there's not really any honourable way to increase your rice income except for military conquest of foreign lands, but you need rice income to recruit soldiers to participate in campaigns. That said, there are dishonourable options available...","October 25, 2014","true","3.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It is somewhat sad to see that it was 'cult' status but then again, just about all PC games were during the era in which this was published.\n\n\nThe game itself - is steeped in Japanese imagery and music... and bows low to Feudal Japan's system of honor and caste.  It plays as a series of minigames with over-arching strategy that will span generations.  One need make decisions in order to make oneself stand out amongst his peers for promotion.  This can be done in numerous ways from performing feats of honor (by way of minigames - the duel, 1 vs many, or military engagements), or by subterfuge and treachery (inciting rebellion, insult, kidnapping, and even outright assassination).\n\n\nAs one progresses in game - your character will most likely be survived by an heir.  And as one reaches Daimyo - the conquest and unification of Japan becomes the mission (as opposed to posturing oneself as the most honorable retainer amongst one's peers).  This is where the game might more closely resemble "Nobunaga's Ambition," "Romance of the three Kingdoms," or "Shogun: Total War" - as one would be concerned with the map of Japan and bringing each fief under his control.\n\n\nWhile the game isn't overly complex the path to greatness is multifaceted and has a depth because of it.

At lower difficulties it's quite easy and the difficulty curve rises at a reasonable rate so don't be intimidated. If you don't usually play retro games I suggest waiting for a sale, but don't miss this game, it's a blast!\n\n8/10","April 10, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The main problem is that it's not as intuitive as it could be. You'll probably want to read the manual (which is included) before diving right in. Fortunately the game is pretty forgiving of mistakes if you skip reading about the game before playing it.\n\nRight now it's on sale for $0.97 and you can't really go wrong here. It's definitely worth more than a dollar.","September 12, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls maybe confusing at first but there are some very well made manuels on the internet that kept me playing. It has more than what really meets the eye. For my first playthrough I thought that grinding was the only way to rank up, and ranking up only usually happens when the higher power dies. I later learned that you could assinate the other lords, and attack their villages to weaken their power and up your standing in the realm. You can also dishonor the other familes in several different ways. I know I just kinda went off a bit but I just wanted to point out that this game gives you more than just one way to play and more than just one way to conquer Japan. I would honestly recommend this to anyone who loves older games like these and has the patience to learn the controls from an online manual for the game.","March 7","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Can;t believe it was made in 1989. Clearly, the Shogun Total War (of which I am a big fan of), has beenheavily inspired by this.

I found the strategy, political intrigue and different battle modes strangely addicting despite the limitations of 1980's computing.   The game can be put down and picked up again later and never seemed to get boring for me.  If you find it a little too easy,  playing a campagin all the way to Shogun without refusing any random event or saving once can be an interesting challenge.","March 11","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the experience is very entertaining, and there is a lot of replay value. However, the game is a little bit too easy.
