Damage you take is all down to skill and awareness. Items have benefits with drawbacks to match. Hitting a Wheel of Misfortune that gives both players Mighty Foot is a thing that happens, and it's a glorious time where you combine hysterical laughter with screams of terror until it kills you (or wins you the run).\n\nPick a friend, any friend. Buy the 2-pack or drag them in front of your computer. Use voice chat if you're online. Enjoy the hilarity of knocking each other into pits, spikes, fire, and giants. Get that cathartic relief when you finally manage to kill the final boss on Hard, then somehow beat everything in one shot on Insane.\n\nIt's worth every penny.","September 4, 2015","true","58.2"," 113 of 124 people (91%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","91","113","124","21","0"

And I have to say, it's really damn good.\n\nRandom generation is pretty well done. I've been playing for 40 hours now and I still see new rooms often, and new items every now and then.\n\nControls are pretty good and responsive and the game plays great even on keyboard.\n\nCombat is very enjoyable. You can slash with basic attacks, you can uppercut the enemy which will have you beat him up in the air and then smash him onto the ground. You can also grab an enemy and spin him around (dealing damage to nearby enemies ) and then throw him into a wall, another enemy or even into a pit which will instantly kill him. It's a pretty good move for crowd control. You can also charge into enemies and use dodge-roll to avoid their attacks.\n\nYou can also use magic if you pick up certain items.\n\nThere's a pretty decent amount of items in the game as well. Different weapons, boots, armors, belts and all kinds of accessories.\n\nWeapons will not only have different damage but a lot of them have different attributes to them. So the game isn't just about finding the weapon with highest stats, you'll have some hard choices to make. Will you for example keep the weapon that deals extra damage when fighting multiple enemies at the same time or will you pick one that occasionally freezes enemies while hitting them?\nAlso some weapons have shorter range while others longer. You'll also have to take that into account.\n\nThere are a lot of breakable objects in the game. Destroying them can drop gold or food, even potions if you're lucky.\n\nThere's a decent amount of special rooms in the game. Some are different kinds of shops, some are vaults with lots of chests, then there are several mini-game rooms such as wheel of fortune and playing cards with the devil.\n\nYou can also customize your character in the camp before starting a run by picking different head and hats. Some heads change your body as well so you can for example be troll, ogre, demon or cyborg. Some of those have to be unlocked though.\n\nOverall the game is really fun and quite hard. Singleplayer is great and I'm sure multiplayer is even more fun. There are 4 difficulties so if you want more challenge than normal has to offer you can play on hard and if you're a masochist you can try insane.\n\nDefinitely a game I would recommend to anyone who likes brawlers and games with roguelike elements.","September 10, 2015","true","74.4"," 58 of 64 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","58","64","3","0"

There are six classes, five of which must be unlocked, and are all rather unique in set ups and play styles, all of which is not without its own pro's and con's (save for the Adventurer class). Playing co-op allows for some fun synergies and the ability to revive one another by killing a certain amount of enemies, making the pressure both intense and fun. Single player is also do-able as enemies are less in number and bosses with less health, alongside having two lives unlike co-op, plus the fact that items you find are all yours for the taking.\n\nPro's:\n*Multiple levels of difficulty in a game where even the lower setting can kick your teeth in.\n\n*Very Rogue-like being that items empower the way you play on top of a combat system that focuses on your ability to be aware of your surroundings.\n\n*Random generation in all areas, yet each area has unique aspects that are retainned.\n\n*Replayability is very high; lots of achievements that makes you feel like a giddy 12-year old playing CoD for the first time.\n\n*(Co-op only) Bosses are excellently designed so that dead players can revive (kind of a must-play to see the value in).\n\nMeh~:\n*Co-op is much more fun than singleplayer, but take of that what you will.\n\n*The difficulty is extreme; every hit counts, may or may not appeal to most. (Perm-Death on all but lowest difficulty).\n\n*Friendly-Fire when playing Co-op; does not do damage but annoyingly knocks one another around. Hard to avoid.\n\nCons:\n*No true customization of characters; you're given a list of pre-made characters of males and females (though less female costumes).\n\n*Items tend to be seen multiple times; you can actually get an item, find it again, and have it stack, though most of the time it's a weapon you've already passed on.\n\n*Some runs can be very imbalanced due to room generation and the types of monsters spawning (example: you can play through an area with all little enemies, or meet a room with all giants, or even not find any worthwhile treasures at all.\n\n*Hitboxes can be very annoying and frustrating; jumping well-over enemies to be hit anyway really sucks, the game is very roll oriented since most enemies that you ignore will spam you with projectiles.\n\n*(Co-op only) HE.

I always like a game where just a name of an item can make me giggle.\n- Great graphics/animation for an indie game.\n- Single player is enjoyable but it's even more fun and entertaining with a buddy (co-op).\n- Random variety of stages, events and bosses for everyone depending on difficulty mode.\n- Monsters / Items are original, unique, and hilarious.\n- Variety of classes and difficulty modes to be unlocked.\n- Achievement hunter friendly.\n- Online lobby browser for public/private games.\n\nCONS:\n- imo Plot is a bit cheesy but not sure if that was intentional or not. While you're playing, you don't really think about it and it's only brought up again when you finish the game.\n- No multiple game saves yet. It just starts off where ever you left off including co-op (currently being worked on).\n- As much content there already is, it could definitely be a much better game with more stages/obstacles.\n\nTHOUGHTS:\nI really like the 50/50 friendly fire in co-op mode, I think it not only brings a challenge to the duo but encourages playful rivalry. You don't take direct damage from eachother but the impact of attacks and usage of items/spells can affect your partner indirectly. It definitely spices up the game experience. That's why I recommend not just playing with anyone but playing with a good buddy or someone "special" that you don't mind getting you killed over and over again ^^\n\nUPDATE Nov. 12:\n\nNow that they added in the Online Lobby Browser for multiplayer, its easier to find people to play with and it includes private/public options.","October 24, 2015","true","35.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","23","24","6","2"

The combat feels very good, different combos(Although I'd like to see more, and different ones for different classes), and when you hit an opponent you get that feeling of impact. I also really like the cartoonish artstyle, and the character design and implimentation is great, and I'd love to see more combos(Perhaps versions of the skeletons on the last few levels that throw bombs, champion enemies that have different stipulations to them, ect).\n\nObviously I've given a few of my own recommendations so far, but here are a few more\n\n1. Alternate levels. I'd love to have an alternate castle(possibly more difficult) that appears every so often to explore, to give more variety. You could have repeat enemies and possibly new ones(Giant spiders, poison rats, ect). Also an alternate to the Enchanted Forest, perhaps a desert with mummies or something. Just a suggestion.\n\n2. A reason to what we're doing. This is a minor one but I feel it could help the tone. Perhaps just a minor cutscene that explains what we're doing, similar to The Binding of Isaac or Rogue Legacy. It doesn't have to be anything complex, just a simple reason that gives us motivation. Perhaps its simply the treasure inside the castle, maybe theres a Giant beast that threatens the land if we don't get inside and take it out. Anything, really. Again, this is a minor thing on my mind, but it would help with the tone I feel.\n\n3. I'm sure you guys are probably working on this, but I feel an overall progression system would help. I think thats what the strongman is for? I'm unsure since its not been implimented yet, but something that feels like your progressing overall and not just in how far you get in the game would be nice. Maybe a town we could build on? Just suggestions.\n\nI'm sure you guys are working on more enemy variety, so that goes without saying. Nice work on the game so far! I'm glad you guys realize Early Access isn't for broken, buggy messes, but for games that have a solid foundation to add on. I think this game has the potential to be a hit.\n\n-This EA review is more for the Developers, I've also posted it on the forum. As the game develops and is released I'll alter my review. If your mildy interested I'd recommend picking it up. Its not finished, but its a very great start-\n\nBuy At Full Price","April 21, 2015","true","10.3"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","28","33","0","0"

Free updates, tons of content, superb communication.\n\nThe Game itself\n\nRampage Knights is a rougelike dungeon crawler. If I had to sum it up in one sentence, I'd say it's the love-child of Bindings of Isaac and Dark Souls. The game heavily focuses on Multiplayer (Both Local and Online are Co-Op are available), but it can be played alone aswell.\n\n{Sidenote : This game has an amazing controller support, both DirectInput and XInput controllers are recognised in an instant}\n\nThe game has endless replay value. I've been trying to get all achivements for a while, but before I could finish the last 5, a free update arrived with TONS of new content. Every playthrough is a different experience, thanks to the random drops, random bosses, and the available classes, of which there are 6 at the moment.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. The fact that it's only 11â¬ is just another example how amazing the developers are. With this quantity and quality of content, I wouldn't mind paying even 50â¬ for Rampage Knights.\n\nIf I had to give a rating, it would obviously be 10/10","October 29, 2015","true","59.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","26","30","4","2"

Time to seek out this demon to regain your loot and pride!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aO15XFxqKjI\nRampage Knights starts you in a village with access to several NPCs, some unavailable but the ones active gave appearance changes, alternate hats and choice of classes. Combinations ranged from wild-bearded vikings to leprechauns in space helmets (all visual changes only). Class options were Adventurer (no pros or cons), Barbarian (+strength, +HP, +better weapon -slower movement -no armour), Pirate(+parrot +bottle of rum +regen while drunk -no shoes) and Assassin (+faster movement +double jump +throwing weapons +assassinate finishing move -lower hp). There was also a challenge NPC (kill X quests) which didn't seem to be functional.\n\nWhile the game is randomized you will move through select zones, each containing different enemies and alternate themes. Some areas you can make a beeline for the exit while others lock you in until completion of mini objectives or slaughtering everything onscreen. Enemy loot is gold primarily but also drop all manner of items (armour, weapons and 1-time use) so it's worth your while to be clearing rooms, including static structures which often surprise you with nice treasures.\n\nControls were playable and completely remappable with both gamepad or keyboard/mouse, but I would highly suggest a gamepad as it did feel much more natural. Game supports solo and co-op online play and while I didn't have a chance to test multiplayer yet, I'm sure it would only be more enjoyable. Soundtrack was upbeat and fitting though it could use a little more variety. Maybe I just didn't make it far enough yet. :)\n\nIf you enjoy things like Castle Crashers + Binding of Isaac and looking for a new fix, this is probably the game for you. With most of the content in place other then bosses, there is plenty to keep you going after "one more round".  Look forward to seeing future updates and easily recommended to fans of the genre or games I mentioned.

I got this on a whim, and boy am I impressed. This really does have a nice balance of complexity and roguelike elements. I really wish it was 4 player, and not just 2, but either way its alot of fun.\n\nYou can play with permadeath, or just casual mode where you don't have to start over fresh when you die. There are lots of  great powerups that really make a difference, and great humor with potions and such. The fighting mechanic is solid - strategy will certainly go a long way here.\n\nPros:\n+Really fun combat that rewards strategy and knowledge of the controls - this aint button mashing\n+Artwork is really cool\n+Randomly generated environments which is really fresh in this genre\n+Cool character customization including hats, male/female, classes, etc.\n+It is difficult!!!\n+You will certainly get tons of hours out of this\n\nCons:\n-It is very difficult.

The controls are easy to grasp and feel tight enough that you'll be rolling around and dash attacking with wreckless abandon in no time.  And while the levels are linear (fitting with the beat 'em up genre), the randomized layout, enemies and loot help to keep it from becoming too repetitive too quickly.\n\nWhile I don't think it has the sheer volume of special items that Binding of Isaac has, it does have a bit of that same feel with certain items altering your character's appearance and granting special abilities.  There is a nice mix of different weapons, items, potions and spells that can be found randomly that will keep you looking for more.\n\nHowever, the game is surprisingly hard, at least initially, but not in an artificial way.  The game will generally give you warning when enemies are about to attack.  You really have to pay attention and know when to dodge or otherwise avoid being hit.  One lapse of concentration can also cause you to accidentally roll off a cliff or miss a jump and leave you falling to your death.\n\nPlaying with a friend feels a bit like Magicka in that your partner can be your worst enemy at times when they accidentally knock you into a chasm.  Who am I kidding?  I was generally the one launching my partner to his death to the point where you would think I was playing with Jebediah Kerman.  Fortunately for me, my adventuring partner seemed to share Jeb's endless enthusiam for experiencing rapid unplanned disassembly.\n\nI've only played the game for a few hours with a friend, but I can say that it was well worth the price of admission.  Being a fan of games like this going all the way back to River City Ransom on the NES, I may be a bit biased.  But I can already say laughs were had, tears were shed, victories were celebrated, losses were lamented.  And that makes for a worthy game in my book.","September 7, 2015","true","4.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","21","25","7","0"

Most the times when you will die it will be at the hands of your coop partner, or you walking into something you shouldnt. There are multiple traps spread across the rooms, with a multitude of different triggers for them. Spikes may be permanently there, they may rise when you step on them, they may rise prior to you getting there and you walk on them after the fact.\n\nThere is a multitude of weapons, each with their good/bad perks. Also plenty of other gear to collect along the way. Its all RNG based, but the RNG is always amazing.\n\nBy far my biggest thing with this game, the Dev's are ON POINT. If you post any concern/question/feedback in the forums, I have not had that question go unanswered for more than a day. They are genuinly engaged to make sure this game is as polished as possible. I have given feedback that happened to be right before a patch was coming, and that feedback was fixed within 12hrs. In this day and age, Dev's like this are what seperate indie from mainstream. I'm still waiting for my Arkham Knight patch 2 months later, whereas here, if something is wrong its fixed nearly instantly.

Me and my friend jumped in to see what changed. There are a couple new enemies and alot of new items. Just that small halloween update made the game so fresh that we've almost beaten hard on every class now (from having only beaten it on one class). I'm amazed by how much life was breathed back into this game by just a small content update. These devs rock. You should buy this game on the spot.~ Stay spooky everyone ~\n\n\nI love this game, it really scratches an itch that Castle Crashers left for me. But honestly, it plays alot better than Castle Crashers. It's got better combat, less "stun lock the enemy by standing still and attacking" and a large number of item drops to customize your character. There's alot of different head styles that also change your skin color and hats to go on top of them. My personal favorite combo so far is to play a Troll Barbarian with a Skull helm.\n\nSo far each run has felt very unique to me.\nThe first run was me dying to silly mistakes like falling off a bridge.\nSecond run was actually learning how to play well.\nThird run was unlocking the barbarian, I was also the ugliest face/hat combo I think I could have accidentally made.\nMy barbarian run was me slaughtering everything with brute strength, finding a flaming greatsword and learning a fireball spell that carried my unskilled butt long enough for me to feel like i've gotten good at the game.\n\nGame plays very well with a controller. I think it's very well worth it's price tag, good handfull of classes that play very differently to replay through the game with.

Combat. It has to be fun and it has to be varied enough or youâll get bored really quick.\nRampage Knights do not have a lot of combat variety in terms of possible actions - you can do 6 basic attacks: normal, jump attack, charged (and charged directional), uppercut and carousel. And thatâs it. If it was just a plain brawler, thatâd get boring very quick.\nBut Rampage Knights is not your simple brawler. First of all, it has crazy number of different pickups - from throwable weapons that do massive damage, but no always available, to a large variety of potions that can make stronger, curse you, turn your head into â¥â¥â¥ (I kid you not) or do all of that at once. How about some large foot curse that causes a large foot (pretty literal, yep) to stomp your location with a small delay every dozen of seconds? Can be a pain in â¥â¥â¥, but can be damn useful too!\nIn addition to usable pickups you have different weapons and gear. Those are a bit more rare and youâll usually have to fight a mini-boss to get them. But they as well can change the way the game plays quite a lot since all gear has special props, and weapons have attack arcs, speed and delays. You have to know how to use this stuff to survive.\nEnemy variety is pretty decent - you usually have 2 to 5 types of enemies per specific level. It gets really hard when enemies start to combine with each other - getting those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ archers behind knights with shield can be damn hard!\nLevels are usually 5 to 10 randomly generated rooms (think Binding of Isaac rooms) made to murder you. Not that long, if you are good you can beat a level in ~5 mins or so. Again, according to devs the full campaign run should take about 45-50 mins. I wasnât able to finish 3rd level, let alone the campaign - that stuff is quite hard :D\nAnd all of that is accompanied by permadeath. Once you are dead, you have to start again from the very beginning. And youâll go through the same levels, but with different rooms, different loot, different buffs and curses.\nItâs pretty damn fun! And works equally good with keyboard and controller.\n\nDownsides right now:\n- No meta-progression, but according to description texts in camp - itâs definitely coming\n- No local co-op (which would be perfect for this game)\n- No proper resolution options, only fullscreen toggle (which might be problem for some setups I imagine)\n- No way to rebind controller buttons (but thatâs a minor one, default controller layout works pretty well)\n\nYou can watch a bit more in-depth look at the game here:\nhttps://youtu.be/Rc6hV3ZHFlU\n","March 29, 2015","true","2.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","2"

Then, did the world need Rampage Knights? It depends, for someone the answer can be yes.\n\nA lot of people won't like this game, but what's in it is almost perfect, so, if you are looking for certain features this could be the game for you.\nThis is a roguelite brawler. The game has a standard permadeath system: you start, you play, you die, you ask god why, god doesn't answer, so you start it again.\nYou always respawn in your camp, after death, so you may think you can power-up your character in between playthroughs, wrong. As I said the permadeath system is a standard one, you die, you lose everything, you restart brand new, the camp only serve the purpose to let you choose your class - you can unlock them completing achievements - customize your character appearance and set the game difficulty level, all that you find in a run, it's only for that run. Then, if you're looking for a grindy roguelite, you'll be disappointed, but if what you want is a difficult game with real permadeath, you can buy this.\nYou even need to like brawler games, of course, but if you do, this is a sweat one. The game is hard, if you just smash the buttons you'll die, everything can be approached in the right way or in the wrong way, and when you do it well, it's gratifying. The gameplay is not too linear, you have different kinds of attacks, enemies, spells, and, most important, you will often use the environmet to defeat your opponents.\nIf you are tempted by what I wrote, buy this game, especially if you have a friend to play with, this game has a two player co-op mode, and double the player, double the fun.\n\nConclusions:If you want a roguelite brawler game with a standard permadeath system, randomly generated levels and cute graphics, Rampage Knight is probably your only option available, and a nice one.","October 13, 2015","true","1.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","14","18","4","2"

I spent a modest time with it and haven't explored its co-op mode, but have gone through enough of its single-player component to give a solid opinion on how it plays out. Here's what I think.\n\nDeveloped by Rake in the Grass, an indie studio from the Czech Republic, Rampage Knights has one very clear inspiration not only in how it plays but in how it looks: famous XBLA indie hit Castle Crashers. If you've played The Behemoth's game, you'll feel right at home with Rampage Knights (or if you're more the oldschool sort, think Golden Axe).\n\nYou start off at a small encampment where you can customize your character: there are many bodies and heads, from lumberjack lookalikes to vikings and orcs, and hats (because who doesn't like hats?) to choose from, starting with a sizable collection that you increase as you complete challenges and perform certain tasks. While these are strictly cosmetic, you can also choose from six classes - each one playing different from one another - that you'll unlock as you progress in the game. Accompanying these are also a plethora of challenges and dozens of achievements.\n\nYou'll then head out into the randomly generated enchanted forest to recover your treasure, stolen from a mysterious fiend. There are multiple weapons to find, each with their own reach, damage and special attributes (such as freezing or dealing additional critical damage), along with four other types of item: a permanent item that allows you to perform a certain action, such as casting a spell or dealing additional damage, for mana; throwing weapons; spell scrolls; and consumable potions. Certain potions and interactions can yield negative things, such as getting the head of an â¥â¥â¥ or running uncontrollably.\n\nYou can chain combos to swivel foes around you, tossing them up and down, stomping on their heads and bowling them into other enemies. Combat is fluid and dynamic, with many combos to perform and different approaches required depending on what you're facing, but I couldn't help feeling that the visuals were too flattened, making it difficult for me to ascertain precisely where my character was. Variety comes in the form of enemies, who can go from simple skeletons who slice you with their swords to charging undead and fire-spitting dragons, but more often than not it's a matter of side-stepping when their attack prompt pops up and going back in for a few hits while they recover.\n\nThe game played well enough and has plenty of unlockables and extra content to keep you coming back to it, if only to get that cool extra hat or beat a tough challenge. It lacks the humor and story Castle Crashers had, shunning the linear experience in favor of a roguelike structure where you must begin from the start after dying a couple of times, and trading the leveling/skill system for more varied classes and single-run items. The boss fights are hard and the game itself has multiple difficulties you can unlock, and I can imagine from playing other co-op brawlers that the two-player multiplayer is even better. At the end of the day its a solid 2D brawler with plenty of progression elements and unlockables to keep you coming back to it."","September 20, 2015","true","7.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You couldn't get enough Binding of Isaac? Well, then here's just another game made for you!\n\nSearched for a game a friend of mine and me could play together, and found just the game. It may not be something fancy, with lots of awesome looking particles and fx, but it's so charming in it's own way. A 2D brawler game that is actually quite challenging, since it has a rogue-like playstyle... and maybe some meanies in between.\n\nThe way of style is, may I say, quite lovely kept. Even though there is a lot of blood, whether it's your own because your friend keeps hitting you while you go for a sandwich, or more preferably the one of your enemies, it still has that little something that doesn't make it completly "senseless"-slaying looking.\n\nAnd even though just running towards your enemy and bashing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them sounds quite exhausting and boring after a while; but just like me, you'll learn the hard way there is some tiny bit of strategy needed... and the will not to drink every potion that drops from chests. You might also fall into pits, get pushed near explosives that get blown up a second after, might get pushed by your ally, or knock him down by throwing enemies at him. Even your greed can literally kill you in this game.\n\nYou find gear along your way that increase your stats, or give you other benefits like immunity to explosions or poison, you'll find items that allow you to cast different spells, you can have throwable weapons, and of course pots. Gold drops from trash you can destroy to chests, with which you can buy some items here and there that should help you along your way.\n\nIt is challenging in it's own way, not only because just running ahead is not always the best solution, but also because, and that's a point many people might dislike, if you die, you are (kinda) dead. In Co-op, it is possible to get back to life, if your ally finishes off enough enemies while you annoy them being a ghost. But if you two are unfortunate, you will have to start from all over, losing all items and benefits. Same if playing solo.\n*The developers have no intention to put in a save option, since they want to keep the rogue-like style to the game, since that is and was their intention when creating the game. They might add different difficulties for levels, and might even add one allowing you to save - but that's no 100% yet.*\nSo if you're not that kind of person, you'll probably have a hard time.\nEven if dying and starting all over might want you to throw your controller away, still, you can't blame the game, and just keep playing anyway.

Oh wait its ok there is a casual mode! Wait this is just as hard if not harder then normal.... Still unpassable deamon alters with permascrew curses! (You will soon find casual mode way way to easy)\n\n2] I enjoy the variety of enemies the game has to offer. some easy to kill some very very hard. I DO NOT like the fact every enemy has every ability. archer kick me and swordsman throw daggers there is no escaping from anything! I dont think they should all have close and long range attacks. one or the other for god sakes. its just a Sh!t fest late game of stuff flying through the air. (this game is purely ment to kill you, though you will find yourself with an advantage in many runs. items have been added and the game is more complex now)\n\n3] The maps are cool, but i find myself on the same ones alot with little variations to them.(rooms have been added and other modes as well, the RNG is better for rooms now)\n\n4] Weapons and stuff are very cool! I like the different build possibilities. Dont seem to get many good items in Co-op also same amount from chests and stuff more people? (the game would be to easy in the long run of things otherwise, this adds alot of depending on your allie not to help kill you :P )\n\n5] Potions, ok lol very creative and funny with friends... But now that i have played alot I...we all just avoid 75% of the potions because they are bad.... WHY? i mean they drop these potions on almost every map! They are use less and have no plus only neg affects?( I found many uses for potions late game, you will have to see for yourself but really fun stuff)\n\n6] Hitting your team, this is awesome! I love that i can just rage out on my friends and they take no damage.. I would also like a way to turn this off. maybe idk CASUAL MODE!!!! that doesnt seem very casual right now. :P (again casual mode is a joke lol)\n\n7] Combos, love the combos! Some are very funny, pick up\throw is great! WANT MORE! i mean just a few more complex higher damage move combos would be nice. It would also be nice if i could say, Grab a Co-op player and combo throw him into enemies doing extra damage. (there is no way you will coordinate such attacks with the chaos style of the game)\n\n8] Last one! and this is just a peeve, shields! where the F@*% are my shields! i see every other enemy with a shield that is a pain to break in small areas! Why the hell dont i get a shield? Yes yes they dont really have armour and we get to but. there are also 100's of them and 1 of meeee!!! (I still want a shield lmao but have found it would make the game to easy)\n\nGuys over all this game is fun, just needs a little work I believe. I am sure there will be some changes good and bad as all games go now a days. I give it a 9-10 if they want the 10 or more they gotta some things :) (LIKE DLC's SO YOU CAN TAKE MY MONEY because this game is awesome!!)","September 12, 2015","true","428.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

However, the game adds several things to that, making your each run more dynamic.\n\nSOLO gameplay is good, however, CO-OP gameplay will push the fun meter to its limit. Sometimes, the most troublesome enemy is your friend :D\n\nRecommended for AVERAGE gamers. However, if you are the type that do nothing, but gaming, thinking that the dynamic aspect will encourage you to play likes 5 hrs straight, this game might not be what you are looking for.\n\nStill looking for more detailed, but spoiler-free review?, continue reading.\n\n::::::::::::::: Visual and other FX :::::::::::::::The art is nice, 2d cartoonish, not pixelated. Nothing special, but it fits the game really well.\n\nCharacter looks funny, with some surprises here, and there. There are many different character, categorized into classes, but with different styles, equipments.\n\nAudio, and other FX is well designed to fit the visual. Just a little something that I found several audio to be boring, lacking some BAM! factors, for my personal tastes though.\n\n::::::::::::::: General Gameplay :::::::::::::::The combat is simple. You are limited to few movesets, and you will continue chaining them together until you lose or win each run. The game relies more on player skills.\n\nYou have several classes to play with. They have almost the same basic movesets. Each class has its own pros&cons, which will affect your playstyle.\n\nFor example; a big guy. He has bigger weapon, so longer range. He is buffed, more health, but slower, and he refuses to wear armor! the other guy, carrying a cannon on his back, so he can use it. he is faster than the big guy, however, he cannot wear boots!\n\nYou can pick up weapons, armors, accessories, relics, pets, enemies!!?, map props, consumables, and etc. to help yourself go further in each run.\n\n::::::::::::::: Randomized Factors :::::::::::::::There are some rogue-like elements here, which is enough to make the game interesting. Although you might be disappointed, if you are expecting fully randomized kind of game.\n\nThe game consist of several stages, and each stage consist of several maps connecting to one another. Each run will pick a number of maps from its available maps, then put it together as a stage, by connecting them with doors, or passages. They are not randomly generated. However, it offers some varieties, enough to keep the gameplay going.\n\nEach map will randomly spawn-in enemies, chests, some map props, and some surprises. This can be ranged from an empty room to a tresure room fully pack with enemies, and traps.\n\nThe items you get during each stage is random, however, within the difficulty range, that it doesn't make you stream-rolled everything in your path, and they are not randomly generated, but pre-made items.\n\nThere are also many surprises, that you can find along the way. They can be good, bad, a little bit of both, or nothing ... really ... >w<\n\nOh, and don't worry, your hero will be reset in each run.\n\n::::::::::::::: CO-OP Gameplay :::::::::::::::I think that the game is more enjoyable this way. The difficulty scales up a bit in CO-OP. more enemies, less loots (you have to share items)\n\nIf one of you is killed, your partner can revive you, as it suppose to in CO-OP games, or the dead you can even revive yourself (with the right condition, of course) ^^v\n\nThe game is friendly fire enabled, just a reaction hit though. Trust me, that's is more than enough to kill off your partner when things get messy.\n\nOne downside for the CO-OP ... you need good, fast, and stable connection for smooth gameplay. The lags can be extreme, which can result in very nasty way, and it affect both of you.","September 14, 2015","true","17.8"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

A single campaign playthrough may last only around 40 minutes, not not one single play through will ever be the same.  This game is a good mix of Diablo, Castle Crashers, and River City Ransom.  This is can be a great single player experience, but its even better on co-op.  There's a bunch of different items you can pick up on your adventure, and some can be a game-changer.  There are numerous curses and diseases, and little optional mini-games that could end up very good, or very very bad.  Its a chance to take.

I normally wouldn't recommend this game due to it being too easy. ALL difficulty levels are just way too easy and you can speed run it without even trying. No game ending, no reason to actually keep playing it other than achievements ("in my opinion"). For a kid, this would be a fun little game for them to play. The way the game is now, it just lacks so much in so many areas that it just seems like it would be a virtual dust collector in many individuals steam libraries. Gameplay is fine. The sprites are decent as well. Not many other pros. The price now on sale around 7 USD, worth it if you have extra change. It really needs more content and reason for replay value other than achievements... It becomes WAY too monotonous way too fast.

Fight through forests, dungeons and a castle to find loot, unlock classes and outfits.\n\nPros\n\n+fun with friends\n+catchy music\n+interesting Boss fights\n+upgrades are refreshing\n+tons of customizable character outfits\n\nCons\n\n- levels feel a bit too similar\n- animations are rough\n- story mode feels a bit short\n\nRampage Knights starts with a short cutscene involving two men sitting around a campfire. These two men are brave heroes back from their latest adventure! They're lost in a forest so they decide to rest until sunrise and set out again but before they can do that, a strange figure arises from the bonfire. It looks like the face of a person who wore the Majora's Mask if it took a toll on your health and sanity and horribly disfigured you. The figure is a Warlock who steals the heroes hard earned treasures and while the heroes try to fight back, the warlock subdues them easily. The heroes later wake up in the middle of a camp and that is where the game begins...\n\nOnce you're in control of the player, you soon realize that you're surrounded by many strangers who seem to have the abilities to help you in some way, except for Tim the Alchemist. He seems pointless with that cauldron of his. This is the centralÂ hub for the rest of the game, where you'll practice your moves, change classes, and change outfits. The only way out is through the forest, but the forest is full of monsters and only leads to a nearby castle, presumably where the warlock resides with your treasure.\n\nClasses are unlocked through completing certain achievements during your runs, most likely related to the class in some way. There are 6 different classes to choose from and you only start with the very first class called Adventurer. Adventurer has no unique traits and is considered average in every way. Other classes will have unique abilities or traits such as the Barbarian who has more vitality and wields a Final Fantasy 7-esque longsword that has an insanely long reach but the downside is that a Barbarian cannot wear armour. The Pirate class has a peg leg, starts with a pet parrot that attacks enemies and regains health while drunk. Assassins can one-shot enemies lying on the ground and uses smokescreens to avoid attacks. Warlocks can summon demons and Battlemages can use multiple magic attacks and Teleportation.\n\nBefore you can set out, there's a short tutorial section to the left of where you begin. A notebook explains the mechanics of the game on screen in short and simple terms. X is to attack, you can chain combos depending on the way you move your thumbstick and the distance your enemy is before you. If an enemy is extremely close to you, you can push kick them which knocks them back and on to the ground. Once enemies are on the ground you can either pick them up or stomp on them for major damage. You can charge up your weapon for sweeping attacks, sweeps and aerial combos both break shields. There are also four item slots used for magic, throwable weapons, scrolls and potions. That's about all the basics to learn! Now you're armed with the knowledge to kick some monster tail.\n\nRight at the entrance of the forest is a jester with the option of changing the difficulty setting. The default setting is Normal Mode, there are four difficulty settings ranging from Casual to Insane Mode. On Normal, permadeath is activated which means once you die you have to start over completely from the beginning of the game and losing all items and weapons. Casual Mode disables permadeath allowing you to restart at the last level you died if you're afraid of losing your progression. This allows even non roguelike fans to enjoy Rampage Knights as I know some players don't enjoy the aspect of starting over from nothing over and over again.\n\nI feel that Rampage Knights plays best with a friend, while I played solo for a bit, it was when I coop'd online with a friend of mine that I truly felt like I was having a blast. The gameplay consists of moving room to room clearing out enemies that can range from a few skeleton warriors to mobs of demons and giant Orc minibosses. When you play solo, it can be easy to get flanked by hordes of enemies from every direction on higher difficulties. With another player at your side you can spread the aggro into a pincer style battle formation, making it much harder for enemies to get the jump on you. If one of you dies, the player becomes a ghost that can help stun enemies and can be revived by receiving a certain number of souls from killed enemies. Throughout the rooms you will find lots of treasure chests, these chests are unlocked using a minigame very similar to the lockpicking one in Elder Scrolls Oblivion where you push tumblers in a pattern except that if you fail it will do physical damage to your character.\n\nThese chests usually contain money which allows you to buy rare items from vendors but chances are they will also drop weapons like a generic battle axe or even the Mjolnir itself which shoots astral hammers. They can also drop rare items that can boost your attributes or give you special abilities. Monsters can also drop loot that may give you demon like powers such as familiars that can shoot giant laser beams or fire breath. This is where the game truly feels at it's best, the weapons you can find have so many different effects. You can find weird weapons that are weak but summon giant pillars that rain death on your enemies or even yourself if you're not careful. There are also Altars which contain magic orbs that will give you abilities that consume mana such as teleportation or chain lightning. Combine this with all the different armour slots and you get a huge variation of abilities and skills during each run that are drastically different. You can get cursed or diseased by drinking potions, making deals with devils, or even altar sacrifices which usually 'reward' you with perks of some kind like double jump, or permanent strength boost but the downside is that you may end up with an â¥â¥â¥ for a head or worse, every single inanimate object in every room is now an enemy you have to defeat.\n\nOverall Rampage Knights is a fun beat em up game that is best played with a friend. With multiple difficulties it accommodates many different levels of players, even allowing pearmadeath to be disabled. With so many outfits to unlock you'll always be able to slay monsters in style. With so many different weapons and builds to experiment with, it's easy to do multiple runs and lose track of time. I highly recommend this to gamers who want a fun multiplayer or couch coop experience similar to Castle Crashers but with a lot more variety in weapons and loot.","February 10","true","7.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Then once we finished customizing and deciding on our classes we headed out into the first levels, right away we are having a blast, struggling to master the art of the Rampage Knights combat meanwhile constantly knocking each other down and being more of a problem for each other than actually helping it was hilarious. Then we come upon some strange mushroom in the middle of the level and my buddy Sander runs to it before me and starts whacking away and all of the sudden he starts yelling profusely "Whaaaats happennninggg tooo mee!!!! Where am I goingggg Im so higghh wtf!! loool and we shortly after both die. So we try again... dead and again make it to level 3 round 1 both of us sub 10 hp and we both die within a minute. We try this again same thing happens. We try again and once again same thing we die. Frustration starting to take hold of me thinking thoughts like this game is too hard what are all these items why do I keep killing myself with potions why is my face an â¥â¥â¥ for god sakes. We decide to buckle down and make it all the way we start again from the beginning and with our expirience we'd acquired from failing time and time again we managed to make it past Level 3 round 1 but unlike the times before we didnt stop there we kept moving forward never once did we run past a single enemy without slaying it first we arrive at the first boss and we are feeling confident with our new much stronger items and its starts off terribly we have no idea what this boss does and we take a major beating I die.. but its not over sander survives long enough for me to collect my 10 souls and i come up and imediately after Sander dies I get focused now knowing what to expect from this beast and fight the best I can Sander comes back after his 10 souls are collected just to imediately die again from the mass of mobs that are upon him instantly I'm low on health at this point and my only goal was the kill enough mobs for sander to come back I kill 9 enemys and Sander needs one more soul and at that moment the Boss sends out one of the first wave attacks that he had used since the beginning of the fight and i wasnt ready for it and at the very last second before I die I jumped up into the air and dodged the attack and killed one last enemy allowing Sander to respawn it was such an awesome moment and goes to show how fun and intensely difficult this genre of game can be we ended up both being alive and defeating the boss and making it all the way through the early access but boy was it hard and fun all the way through.\n\nI am ecstatic for the full release of this game and cant wait to see what will come 100% satisfied and glad I could support the devs with my early access purchase.\n\nSorry for the long rant but I wanted to share my story about how awesome this game is.\n","March 30, 2015","true","39.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

The nicest thing I can say about the art is that, at the very least, the developers have a good sense of the color wheel and this game avoids color palettes that are somehow 'off' in a way you can't quite put your finger on.\n\nWhat's important here is the gameplay. What you see in the trailer is what you get. It's a brawler first and foremost, with randomly generated environments and permadeath. There are options for a "casual" mode which will just allow you to fight through to the end, but that's taking out the one thing that makes this game unique.\n\nUnlike arcade games that are designed to eat your quarters, this games enemies all have patterns you can learn - the challenge comes from managing multiple enemies of different types at once. Every death feels like your fault. While it does have some more obtuse elements to it (such as potions with unidentifiable effects, items which will give you random curses or other ill effects), sessions are short and satisfying enough that it doesn't feel terrible. There's enough humor to be found in some of the ways an item or curse will change your character to balance things out, I think.\n\nIf you liked games such as Castle Crashers, Golden Axe, or any one of the dozen classic Konami beat em up games of the 90s, this game is the next logical evolution of that sort of game and I highly recommend it.","January 1","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No matter how often it kicks the utter s*it out of me and makes me alt f4 in disgust, I just keep coming back and playing it.\n\nBest way I can describe it is Binding Of Isaac but less f*cked up. You have permadeath, tons of random loot, some helpful, some put in just to laugh at your stupid face. It's got brawler like mechanics, you can swing enemies around giggling as you whack their skulls into rocks, trees, other enemies, or youir friends if you're in multiplayer. Then you can uppercut them into the air and basically Falcon punch them across the map. There's no real combo system, but it really doesn't need one. The combat does what it's meant to, without being overly complicated. The game is too fast pased and frantic to need combos.\n\nThe only real problems with it is the final boss is pathetic. It's a 3 stage fight. Stage one barely does anything. Stage 2 can't attack, and stage 3 doesn't take into account anything you have collected since it's a completely different game mode. Only time your items matter is when you get a certain few items that literally render all it's attacks useless.\n\nThe controls are very fluid and respond well. Out of all my deaths I've never once felt like it was due to s*itty controls or the game just being a d*ck. The game is very skill based and very fair. You never get curb stomped because the game felt like you had played enough, but because you decided to dodge away from the enemy, into another enemies axe blade, you idiot.\n\nThe game has a good risk - reward system. An example would be; thereâs some armor you can find that slices off 20 life, and has the lowest armor rating in the game, only being able to block 3 hits when most are 4+. So why bother using it? Every kill you get regenerates its rating. Meaning you will not take damage as long as long as you keep killing, you can ensure you always have 1 - 3 armor points. Itâs entirely based on your skill, and if you f*ck up youâll be down armor and 20 life. If youâre good at evading and killing youâll always have armor for those oh s*it moments.\n\nThe only time the  game feels unfair is on the later levels + difficulties. If you don't get the ability to fly over pits, there are times you just have to accept the death and restart, because some levels can be literally nothing but a massive pit, with spikes on almost every surface, against flying enemies. So if you can't levitate you're pretty much boned.\n\nRuns are short, so the permadeath isn't a big deal like it was in Isaac. It usually takes me about 30 mins to go from spawn to final boss. With the randomized loot and level layouts, the runs never get tedious. Even the first area has some parts that can stomp you into the ground if you're not paying attention.\n\nTo summarize a bit:\nVery frustrating but satisfying game. Get frustrated at all the deaths, then satisfied when you go up against hard enemies and turn their faces into mince with your now super good skills.\n\nInteresting and creative items and other things. I once got a curse that made me take nonstop damage unless I was in combat, then a curse that made inanimate objects come to life and try kill me.\n\nControls are solid and very responsive. I've never had a moment where I was yelling at the screen for my character to move due to bad controls.\n\nFinal boss is pathetic, and once you know his 2 attacks he's utterly pointless, until you get to the final stage where you either get very good very fast, have a series of items that renders every attack ineffective, or die and restart.\n\n\nIt also has local and online co-op. No servers or anything, you have to invite people for the online thing. The co-op has a very interesting revive mechanic that involves ghosts and me floating about going "Wooo spooookkeeee" and p*ssing off my friend.","October 10, 2015","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Downiepour/recommended/314410/","Downiepour","Downiepour","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Downiepour/","23 products in account","Very fun game for it only being in beta. The game offers tight, easy controls and mechanics that newer players can grasp quickly, while also maintaining a difficultly curve in-game to help keep even verteran players on their toes. As for gameplay, there are many classes to choose from including Pirate, Battlemage, and Assassin, none of which feel alike which offers great varitey in play. All characters have both ups and downs, some have higher vitality and do more damage, while some have lower vitality, but have spells or special abilites to help them along. These characters are unlocked from completing achievements corresponding to the characters traits. For example, to unlock the Warlock class, there are 3 demon related achievements the player must accomplish before gaining access to the class. There are also many non-class oriented achievements in the game which once unlocked, give permanent stat boots to your characters. These not only insentivize different playstyles needed to unlock these achievements, but also give the player something to work towards. These stat boots arn't that powerful though, some of the most potent being a +10 Vitality or a +5% Crit Chance. The game also offers plently of variations of enemies and room configurations, all of which varying from run to run. The only drawback to this fun rogue-like is that there arn't that many items in the game. Once you get to your 50th or so run, you've seen most if not all of the items in the game. Although, this problem will most likely be addressed as the game continues it's progression throughout it's beta.\n\nSUMMARY: Fun rogue-like with tight controls and both varied and interesting play. 11/10 Pls nerf Assassin class.","October 21, 2015","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The nicest thing I can say about the art is that, at the very least, the developers have a good sense of the color wheel and this game avoids color palettes that are somehow 'off' in a way you can't quite put your finger on.\n\nWhat's important here is the gameplay. What you see in the trailer is what you get. It's a brawler first and foremost, with randomly generated environments and permadeath. There are options for a "casual" mode which will just allow you to fight through to the end, but that's taking out the one thing that makes this game unique.\n\nUnlike arcade games that are designed to eat your quarters, this games enemies all have patterns you can learn - the challenge comes from managing multiple enemies of different types at once. Every death feels like your fault. While it does have some more obtuse elements to it (such as potions with unidentifiable effects, items which will give you random curses or other ill effects), sessions are short and satisfying enough that it doesn't feel terrible. There's enough humor to be found in some of the ways an item or curse will change your character to balance things out, I think.\n\nIf you liked games such as Castle Crashers, Golden Axe, or any one of the dozen classic Konami beat em up games of the 90s, this game is the next logical evolution of that sort of game and I highly recommend it.","January 1","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ever wanted to hit your friends but not actually hurt them? Ever wanted to screw your friends over after you die?  Rampage Knights is the game for you! While it's a beat 'em up similar to castle crashers, it puts it's own twist on how the game is played. With it being a perma death game, that means when you die you have to get a new character kids. With it being a perma death game, it keeps you on your toes whenever you get items that seem like they're worth more than 12 rocks and a bug at a market to you.\n\nNow, my favorite part sprouts, is the fact that when you die your friends can revive you by killing a certain amount of enemies.... But while you're dead you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ with them by flailing your ghost arms at them and knocking them over. Do it till they get mad enough to punch you, do it till they do punch you, or even stab you! It's fun for all ages!\n\n8.5/10 in my book","September 20, 2015","true","15.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

After playing through a few levels, I found myself with a mini-dragon that periodically shot fireballs over my shoulder.  My partner found himself with a curse in which explosive barrels fell from the sky and covered each room we entered.  So, as you can imagine, my dragon blew both of our characters up innumerable times after hitting these barrels with his mini-fireball.  Despite this, I had fun with the game, the wide variety of weapons and enemies and the feel of the gameplay.  I suppose receiving unfavorable curse/pet combinations may be par for the course for a game like this, but we spent a large chunk of time unable to cleanse my partner's barrel-dropping madness!","May 6","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everytime you pick your controller up and play this game you'll have a different experience. Mmost of the levels change randomly, the items and curses have different effects and there is no guarantee you'll get the same things in different gameplay sittings, then there are potions with different effects, different types of chests, alters, you even get to play a card game with the devil(at your own risk). Every time you play there is a different scenario and you can easily be forced into game changing positions at the blink of an eye. RK is very tough game, you'll die...trust me you'll die and die again....but the addictive nature of this game will make it hard for you to put your controller down, especially once you become better at the game. Once you know the right potions to pick up and the ones to throw away, once you learn how items works the games becomes easier, yet it's still very easy for the player to get his â¥â¥â¥ handed to him, AT ANY MOMENT, because of how random the game is. Even still, when he gets his â¥â¥â¥ handed to him he'll just want to dust himself off and try again.","March 30, 2015","true","260.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The combat, the unique/nostalgic graphics.\nSomething that you should keep in mind while playing co-op with your friend/s. (If you have any)\nIf one of you is 20 hp and the other is full hp, the 20 hp guy should go kill him/herself so when the level ends they come back alive with full hp. (make sure you dont have a guardian angel or something that saves you from falling or damage) Also do not take the same dragon head 1 goes for the left one while the other goes for the right one and then one covers the other from the minions that the dragon spawns. This game is early acess so be kind to the game. It has 7 levels for now with 1 of 2 bosses as the 5th level (dragon or slime). It is only 2 player altho it was ment to be 4 player they failed the campaing for it and as it seems they wont have it anytime soon. If you have a friend that would play this game with you buy the 2 pack.

I was a  big fan of arcade Golden  Axe and  Final Fight, and the  most important thing for  me is how the controls feel, if i have good control over the hero  so that any damage i take is my mistake. Rampage Knights is alrready very  mature in that regard. The game  is not that long, i dont  think i am bad at  this game and my completion  ratio  is about 15% maybe,  most of the variance comes from all  the awesome items which really change  up the gameplay.

Early Access at the moment so yes it is unfinished, but it is very enjoyable in the current state and the developers are addressing bugs and working on more content.  Combat is primarily with one button and different attacks are executed with the direction you hold.  Simple, but if you do not time dodges and attacks well it is punishing.  Passive diseases keep combat from going stale as well as stacking bonuses.  $10 is well worth it.","April 23, 2015","true","37.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Rampage Knights is a very fun Rogue-lite beat 'em up with procedural generation.  If you enjoyed games like Rogue Legacy because it hearkened back to your childhood of 8-bit classics, this one will surely pull at those same strings.  The graphics aren't 8 bit, more like flash game quality, but that really shouldn't bother you.\n\nThe gameplay is fun.  You accrue upgrades while playing very similarly to Binding of Isaac.  When you die, you can play another class that you have unlocked back at the camp.  I'm not sure if the dev is going to decide to include meta game upgrading back in the camp, but it would surely add to the games longevity.\n\nHighly reccomend this.","August 10, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

'Contracted', were the exact same 'â¥â¥â¥ disease' but sometimes they have a different effect, I often got myself killed on purpose just to get rid of the ugly effect it has on your character's appearance. Although I do admit this feature kept me amused for a good 5 minutes.\n\nThe game has a good amount of customization options, it lets you choose from 14 automatically unlocked male characters and 4 unlockable male characters, 9 female automatically unlocked characters and 3 unlockable female characters, and it also lets you choose from 19 automatically unlocked hats and 11 hats that are unlockable through these sort of.. Challenges. It's a shame there's no actual character customization though..\n\nClasses work the same way as the customization options do, you unlock them through challenges/achievements. There's about 6 classes in the game, they don't have any major changes from one to another apart from perhaps a special ability or the ability to use magic. The combos stay the same, and you start with different items. But your controls sort of change.. For example, the pirate can't dash, instead he fires a cannon. Another example for the ninja, instead of evading normally, he will use a smokescreen. And the most unique one, which is the Battlemage, he can use four spells with four key combinations, for example using the evade + use buttons will conjure a magic barrier around your character. Quite a neat feature, but it's not really enough to keep me interested in this game.\n\nAh, forgot to mention something important. The multiplayer is practically dead, so if you don't have a friend who also owns the game and is willing to play it with you, the multiplayer is NON-EXISTENT.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nAll in all, the game is good fun, but it's just way too short and doesn't do much to keep you interested in it.","January 2","false","1.2"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","6","23","0","0"

For the most part the game is enjoyable, but some aspects feel cheap and repetitive. The biggest problem I have with the game is that the combat feels awkward and cheap (compared to other rogue-likes) for example you can be having a great run and then two large monsters spawn into an awkward locked room with you along with several knife throwing enemies, ruining your great run... and the worst aspect of it is you can come out of a difficult fight and get nothing but a few pieces of gold (which isn't massively useful). Which in binding of isaac terms that's like fighting the haunt on the first floor and getting Pageant Boy with only pennies as a return. Overall the game isn't bad but I feel in terms of a rogue-like it is disappointing.","September 7, 2015","false","5.0"," 39 of 100 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","39","100","2","0"

Rather it would if the gameplay was fun. A one button fighting combo means that for most all enemies its go in, hit them, do an uppercut get off damage and then back away and repeat. Most of the "Boss" stylee enemies only have 1 attack "Swing weapon". There really isnt much value in the coop either, for some reason its limited to 2 people, when it could clearly handle 4. I was hoping the class system, (That you have to unlock), would save the boring cobat, melee style classes would have a combo, and mages would have innate spells, I dd not get far enough to see meages, but barbarians and the like just have different stats, which means I can hit X better now. But still only hit X.\nThe loot generation is interesting, some neat buffs lie around and last for a number of rooms, (I think thats the best way they could be done), But the problem herein lies with money; I didn't find a use for money. The only one i found was a game of chance with a guy who looked like satan, but thats about it. Overall I think the game has some good ideas, a pocedurally generated indie beat 'em up has a place on the steam store, but it needs to fix its combat, loot generation and co-op first before I dip my toe back into Rampage Knights.

You have to die 4 times in order to unlock casual mode, which just makes you feel even worse about the fact that you can't even beat the game as the developers intended... but it's just terrible all around for look and design.\n\nIt's not your conventional Beat 'Em Up / RPG hybrid... The tags for this game are incredibly deceiving. You have two lives, if you lose them, you start over from scratch again... meaning, no conintues, your progress doesn't save either... You could find a new weapon, some trinkets, gold, etc... it all gets reset... it's completely ridiculous and stupid.\n\nThe Beat 'Em Up genre usually gave a character a way to continue from where they left off in limited quantities... So like 5 credits or whatever, and you re-start from the stage you lost all your lives on, which is fair because the game play was balanced. In this game the balance is tipped against you right from the beginning. The tutorial area of the game alone felt like it was somewhere near the middle of the game and that I should be using advanced techniques... they don't ease you in to the battle mechanics at all.\n\nBeat 'em up's with RPG elements such as River City Ransom would allow you to keep your character progression even if you died 100 times. You would be penalized 50% of your holding cash if you died, which is a fair trade off considering you needed cash to upgrade your character and progress... so it forced you to grind to get stronger so you could progress if you lacked the skill.\n\nIn this game you lose EVERYTHING when you die... TWO  lives to beat the entire game, if you lose both lives, all holding cash is gone, all character equips are gone... completely insane, sorry I have a life and don't have aspergers syndrome, I don't have time for this garbage.\n\nAfter this happened to me three times in a row after beating the opening tutorial area, I got fed up and got a refund... It's a stupid game with unfair mechanics, it looks like crap and plays like crap as well...\n\nThe only appeal it had to me was the Beat 'Em Up and RPG tags, which is a complete bold faced lie because it only has SOME elements resembling that hybrid genre. It's not a conventional RPG / Beat 'Em Up game at all, it breaks all the rules in order to decieve the buyer, if this was the original developers intention for the game, news flash, you're doing it wrong...\n\nIf you expect this game to be a conventional RPG / Beat 'Em Up game, then stay away as you will be highly disappointed... it's worth about 3 dollars at best and would be good as a novelty game if you got insanely bored and ran out of ideas to keep yourself busy... not worth the time.","January 26","false","0.0"," 8 of 33 people (24%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","24","8","33","3","0"

There's enough randomness in the dungeons and in the strangers you'll play with online to keep it entertaining for a surprisingly long time. Plus, the combat, teamwork, and various items are fun to learn and (hopefully) master.\nThere's a fair diversity of randomly-chosen mid-game bosses, but I will say that I wish there was more than one final boss. He's not very difficult once you get used to him, which can make the fight with him boring and repetitive. My other gripe is that multiplayer is limited to 2-player co-op (either on a single computer or online), although it is executed very well.\n\nI would love to see an expansion or sequel to this game!\n10/10","January 20","true","194.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You choose your class (bad: you can only play as one class in the beginning) and go into the dungeon. There you beat up monsters, find items and defeat the final boss - or die.\n\nThough it may seem very hard to play at the start, as soon as you figured out some of the game mechanics it becomes really funny and easy to play. And even if you die 10 times in the first level - hell, itÂ´s a roguelike game, what did you expect?\n\nYou make progression by completing challenges, for example dealing a certain amount of magical damage. By completing a challenge, you get a permanent boost for your character (like more magical damage), unlock a new character class, a higher difficulty etc. Simple and good.\n\nLetÂ´s move over to the cons now. It is very easy to die in this game, and playing coop will sure test your friendship for you can not damage your friends, but still send them up flying and stop their attacks. The hitboxes of enemies and yourself are pretty strange sometimes, but it is not that much to worry about. The only thing I really disliked was that after 16 hours in coop with my friend (I count myself and him as casual games), we unlocked about 80% of all unlockable content and are currently trying to beat the game on the highest difficulty. There are no new items or weapons anymore, we know them all. The only thing to do for us is to simply hope for the best drop luck - there is nothing new anymore.\n\nTo conclude, I say that if you like rogue-like games and donÂ´t mind comic-styled graphics, this game is definetely worth a try. It lacks a bit of content, but you can still have your 20 or 25 hours fun with it. Go ahead and try. I really like it.","January 30","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So far we've both had a blast. Every hit feels impactful, and items can really change the way you have to play. The achievements are challenging, but achievable, and everything just feels well put together. That said, I feel as if there needs to be more items variety (Only 9 hours played currently, but we've seen nearly every item multiple times). And the final boss... well... I wont spoil anything, but it was a bit of a disappointment. Other than that, great game. Highly recommend if you enjoy arcade style beat 'em ups, a Binding of Isaac item system, and a fairly diabloesque atmosphere.","November 29, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is assuredly a low budget, small-house kind of game but it takes those limitations and makes them charming in the kind of ways that we see from other developers that can manage a vision that fits their means.\n\nEven at its most "unfair", which has to be when both players get the big foot curse, the game doesn't feel frustrating and in spite of its simple controls and relatively easy to learn systems, there is a lot to be learned about approaching situations and dealing with mixed groups of enemies.\n\nThe layouts and items are randomized a la binding of isaac and you can run into one of ... six? seven? bosses on your way through the main campaign.

Definitely very fun to play in local coop.\n\nInsane difficulty gets quite challenging which is always good. The super randomized Dark World mode is really fun to play as well.\n\nHowever, the last boss is really disappointing and quite easy even on the hardest difficulty. The green slime monster is harder than that... even a room with 3-5 mages is harder than the final boss.\n\nIt would be nice if they added a bit more content (especially bosses & enemies) as well as more varied stages, since they are all very similar except for the forest at the beginning.","October 18, 2015","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After i came back to it and beat one playthrough i was hooked\ntheres alot to unlock and the classes are well balanced, you will unlock a bunch of classes later on\nafter starting with one by completing some goals wich are satisfying to achive, and those classes will\nmostly be picked later on for harder modes, you will unlock skins,hats and premanent buffs later on\nbut the game depends alot on decisions comparing it to binding of isaac this game has alot of trait items\nfor example armours that give you less health but give you back armor for kills and weapons that benefit from curses\nbut unlike the curses from binding of isaac, these will be painful and will effect the gameplay alot but it doesn't seem to bother me if i can gain benefit and synergies, the bosses can be stressful through the first gameplay, and they are much harder then the once in binding of isaac and they will get harder depending on the difficulty you're playing on. I think the game is perfect and definetly worth the price, alot of replayability and if it recieves updates or if they would make a dlc i definetly would buy it. 10/10 would play it again and again and again. =)","October 20, 2015","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/newwisdom01/recommended/314410/","newwisdom01","RedMageKnight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/newwisdom01/","357 products in account","Rampage Knights was one of those games on a whim that a friend and I decided to chalk up to chance and give it a shot. I'd been hankering for a game that reminded me of the action-packed, responsive, game-play mechanics that were offered by games like Castle Crashers (as many people have already mentioned) and, while dated, extremely satisfying in this respect, Streets of Rage. I have to say, I'm very satisfied with the purchase! It satisfies that hunger for quick (or not so quick depending on your intentions for progression), gratification that comes with simple objectives yet satisfying the desire for the complexity that comes with character customization (both cosmetic and functional), character diversity (in class choice availability), and advancement (that comes with the numerous available power-ups, weapons, armor, and accessory choices). In many, many ways it exceeds all of the expectations that came from its predecessors.\n\nThe difficulty scales appropriately based on how far you've gotten in a single session, is adjustable based on your masochism (I kid slightly, but make no mistake, harder difficulties prove to be VERY challenging especially when playing cooperatively), and rewards you for your diligence and skill. You can very quickly find your patience dwindling faster when playing cooperatively as it can be very easy to set your friend off track with an accidental strike placed in their direction, or an unfortunate curse that involves a giant foot crashing down on your unsuspecting companion.\n\nDungeons seem randomized in a way that makes every experience fresh while still providing you familiarity in the general progression with each 'level' being the same theme as you continue your adventure, but the rooms you encounter can change drastically with whatever monster, items, or mini-boss/game events you encounter. I always find myself pleasantly surprised (or feeling dismal surprise) with new blessings or curses encountered in each playthrough. It's roguelike in almost every sense of the word - offering permadeath, procedural generation, and the plethora of available magical items that alter your character for good or bad. Not a true rougelike with turn-based business and emphasis on multi-session labyrinths, but close enough to scratch that itch if it's what you're hankering.\n\nIn all:\n+ Procedurally generated areas that offer fresh diversity with every playthrough\n+ Tons of items and artifacts to collect to enhance or hinder your character during your session\n+ Fair difficulty scale that rewards skill over button bashing and sheer persistence\n+ A number of character customizations that come from the start and from earning them along the way\n+ Easy to pick up and put down with diverse schedules\n+ Simple plot that gets right to the point and focuses on the journey itself and the mechanics that make it so enjoyable\n+ Very responsive, action-oriented gameplay that make you feel in total control of victory or defeat\n\n- Cooperative gameplay can be frustrating with included mechanics to not specifically damage your ally, but totally disrupt their movements and cause lethal consequences that are 'usually' completely accidental\n- Up-combo-strikes seem to always result in painful enemy openings unless it's one-on-one\n\nThe negatives are a stretch too as they add a very tactful variation to the way this game can be played, so I likely wouldn't replace them. I've experienced 0 connectivity issues either (which is a relief), especially since I play with someone who currently lives on the other side of the world (literally).\n\nDefinitely recommend this game!","October 8, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The super randomized Dark World mode is really fun to play as well.\n\nHowever, the last boss is really disappointing and quite easy even on the hardest difficulty. The green slime monster is harder than that... even a room with 3-5 mages is harder than the final boss.\n\nIt would be nice if they added a bit more content (especially bosses & enemies) as well as more varied stages, since they are all very similar except for the forest at the beginning.","October 18, 2015","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After i came back to it and beat one playthrough i was hooked\ntheres alot to unlock and the classes are well balanced, you will unlock a bunch of classes later on\nafter starting with one by completing some goals wich are satisfying to achive, and those classes will\nmostly be picked later on for harder modes, you will unlock skins,hats and premanent buffs later on\nbut the game depends alot on decisions comparing it to binding of isaac this game has alot of trait items\nfor example armours that give you less health but give you back armor for kills and weapons that benefit from curses\nbut unlike the curses from binding of isaac, these will be painful and will effect the gameplay alot but it doesn't seem to bother me if i can gain benefit and synergies, the bosses can be stressful through the first gameplay, and they are much harder then the once in binding of isaac and they will get harder depending on the difficulty you're playing on. I think the game is perfect and definetly worth the price, alot of replayability and if it recieves updates or if they would make a dlc i definetly would buy it. 10/10 would play it again and again and again. =)","October 20, 2015","true","29.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Online co-op works pretty well, with just a couple of lag spikes so far in my 4 hours of online play.  A few things could be tweaked in my opinion, such as not being able to knock your teammate over with friendly fire - they don't take damage, but they can be knocked over which can lead to bad things.\n\nThis game is fairly challenging, but you will get better as you learn monster attack patterns and make use of ranged attacks, throwables, and the terrain.  Casual difficulty does not seem to really lower the actually difficulty, it just lets you restart the current level if you die versus starting at the beginning of the game.\n\nThere is some cheapness in the game which I wish would go away.  My friend in co-op says he cannot see the red circle that appears to tell you where the Mighty Foot will strike when I have the curse, so he has no good way of dodging it.  Having large monsters that can jump diagonally and strike so quickly is surprising...you can adapt to it, but their agility seems odd considering their size.  Minions that randomly strike the area around you should not attack exploding barrels - that just sucks.  Also when you have the magic carpet and the mighty foot curse, I think you should have the red circle overlay the carpet so you can tell when the foot will strike.\n\nAlso I feel the sound levels are too high in this game.  I have to turn sound to 5% and music to 0% to hear my friend over steam voice chat (and yes my receive volume in voice chat is cranked to max).\n\nThat sounds like a lot of complaints, but even in light of the 'cheap' difficulty, my friend and I are having a blast.  We bought the two pack on sale for $15 and will probably get a good 10+ hours out of it.  Not a bad deal.  The art style is enjoyable, there are lots of humorous moments, the random level elements and drops make each run unique, and there is a good balance of challenge versus fun.  It's not quite up to Castle Crashers, but it's a great time with a buddy.","September 6, 2015","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every single run in the game is different, none are alike, you will never know what you're going to run across, or who you are going to meet. You could meet the Devil and play cards with him, or meet a shopkeeper to spend your hard earned gold, or even a haunted tavern filled with ghosts.

The game levels are randomized on each play through, and there are plenty of monsters, and other enemies in your way.\n\nRampage Knights has plenty of random items to keep things fresh. Your characters have four equip slots for things you'll find on your way to the end. The slots are for Magic, projectiles, magic scrolls, and potions, one per type.\n\nThere is a lot of fun to be had with the fighting in this game. Although I wish there was a higher variation of attacks the characters can perform, I feel the developers made up for it by making sure that you'll die by your mistakes alone.\n\nThere is a dodge button (which you should get used to fast!) and moves that can help even the playing field when you're surrounded. You're able to pick up enemies when they've fallen and throw them, and swing an enemy which effectively hurts any others nearby. An aerial combo can also be performed.\n\nI have a good time playing this in single player, but its the co-op that makes this game shine. Your attacks hit your co-op buddy, but won't take health away from them. I had a pretty fun time communicating with the people I played with to make sure our flashy attacks wouldn't mess the other up in the process (No ones perfect, I admit I've kicked people into pitfalls to their death a few times).\n\nThere is local and online co-op offered, as of this moment you can only play with a Steam friend online. No server menu or matchmaking. I had no trouble with lag whatsoever, but the people I've played with live about an hour drive away from me tops.

I really like swinging and throwing enemies around and stomping those nasty skeletons on their faces. Sometimes it is a little bit too easy to bash enemies into a pit, but it's a valid tactic I guess.\n+ The thing I enjoyed most about BoI was the random item combinations you end up with. Rampage Knights has less items, but there are still a lot of interesting combinations to be made. In one playthrough I got a curse that summoned explosive barrels in every room; luckily I found an item that made me immune to explosions. I really enjoy it if a game allows you to use a seemingly negative effect (such as a curse) as a positive thing.\n+ Nice bit of humour, silly animations, goofy characters.\n+ The game can be difficult, but it is never really unfair. If you die, it's your own fault - you can do better next time and learn to avoid that damage.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that there isn't any global progression over all your playthroughs. You can unlock some new classes, but that's it. A nice mechanic that a lot of rogue-likes (BoI, Rogue Legacy) have is that you slowly build up your progress every time you die, unlocking new stuff, which slightly increases your chance of a succesful run. Rampage Knights just puts you back to square one every time, but I guess it works for this game.\n\nI finished the game in about 10 hours, but I definitely want to play this some more with a friend in local coop.\nThe developers also wrote on the forums that they will release more content for free later on.","September 6, 2015","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Online co-op works pretty well, with just a couple of lag spikes so far in my 4 hours of online play.  A few things could be tweaked in my opinion, such as not being able to knock your teammate over with friendly fire - they don't take damage, but they can be knocked over which can lead to bad things.\n\nThis game is fairly challenging, but you will get better as you learn monster attack patterns and make use of ranged attacks, throwables, and the terrain.  Casual difficulty does not seem to really lower the actually difficulty, it just lets you restart the current level if you die versus starting at the beginning of the game.\n\nThere is some cheapness in the game which I wish would go away.  My friend in co-op says he cannot see the red circle that appears to tell you where the Mighty Foot will strike when I have the curse, so he has no good way of dodging it.  Having large monsters that can jump diagonally and strike so quickly is surprising...you can adapt to it, but their agility seems odd considering their size.  Minions that randomly strike the area around you should not attack exploding barrels - that just sucks.  Also when you have the magic carpet and the mighty foot curse, I think you should have the red circle overlay the carpet so you can tell when the foot will strike.\n\nAlso I feel the sound levels are too high in this game.  I have to turn sound to 5% and music to 0% to hear my friend over steam voice chat (and yes my receive volume in voice chat is cranked to max).\n\nThat sounds like a lot of complaints, but even in light of the 'cheap' difficulty, my friend and I are having a blast.  We bought the two pack on sale for $15 and will probably get a good 10+ hours out of it.  Not a bad deal.  The art style is enjoyable, there are lots of humorous moments, the random level elements and drops make each run unique, and there is a good balance of challenge versus fun.  It's not quite up to Castle Crashers, but it's a great time with a buddy.","September 6, 2015","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it gets pretty hectic with lots of enemies so you need to predict and react to attacks/projectiles and kite away from swarms of enemies so you can fight them separately.  I am bad at video games and this game makes me feel like I'm not, because it pretty much always does what you want.  It's also very good at getting you a little further each time you play, and doesn't feel like a grind or hitting a dead end.  The more you play the more challenges you complete and the better your characters get.  The different classes of characters (though I haven't unlocked the warlock or battlemage yet) all feel fun and different, if maybe not balanced in strength.\n\nThe co-op is very entertaining, if a bit harder than the single player in my opinion (my girlfriend keeps knocking me over so I can't do anything in the middle of fights...).  It's sort of a half-way friendly fire system.  You can hit your partner and knock them down with your dash attack, but you don't damage them.  The loot is also "shared", so prepare for your friend to take everything and let you die.\n\nThe art style is fine, nothing feels out of place.  It's a cartoony game full of cartoony humor.  Controller support was pretty good, I was able to use a PS3 controller (emulating Xbox 360) and a Logitech Direct Input controller, both were recognized and mapped properly.  It'd be nice to have proper button remapping, but the default is pretty good (it can take a bit to get used to the item bar and learn how to use it).  Technical settings are adequate, not much to be said for a 2D game.  Full mouse and controller support in the menus.\n\nOverall very good game that I keep wanting to play more.","September 18, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Same beat em' up smash fest as castle crashers with the absurd power-ups and "re-playability" of binding of isaac.  All that being said - this game is difficult and if you can't get past the first stage you probably won't enjoy the game.  There are a few powerups and class changes that you get from various challenges but they're not nearly as significant as learning how to play, how certain mobs behave, how to jump over pits properly, picking the right items, how to open chests etc....\n\nOverall I'd say that this game is worth picking up if you enjoy a challenge and don't mind slogging away for a few hours before the game starts to feel "fun".    I picked up the two pack during the winter sale for 25% off - if I had the choice again I probably would have waited until this game was 50-60% off before buying though!","December 28, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must admit, half of the fun comes from this, knowing your partner is not a ghost that you can't interact with (Your partner may become a ghost but can still kill you accidentally :)).\n\nVariety of spells, items, diseases, curses and levels is very satisfying and random enough to make your every playthrough not feel like a grind. Also it woud be foolish to not mention devs are releasing new content occassionally with updates and making the game harder and more fun.\n\nThe game may be considered a bit short but the randomized nature makes up for it with high replay value and permadeath.\n\nI should mention, some of the diseases and curses are too hilarious and you may accidentally start dying too often from laughing.\n\nOldschool gamers will find the difficulty satisfying and may feel nostalgic while playing.

You choose your class (bad: you can only play as one class in the beginning) and go into the dungeon. There you beat up monsters, find items and defeat the final boss - or die.\n\nThough it may seem very hard to play at the start, as soon as you figured out some of the game mechanics it becomes really funny and easy to play. And even if you die 10 times in the first level - hell, itÂ´s a roguelike game, what did you expect?\n\nYou make progression by completing challenges, for example dealing a certain amount of magical damage. By completing a challenge, you get a permanent boost for your character (like more magical damage), unlock a new character class, a higher difficulty etc. Simple and good.\n\nLetÂ´s move over to the cons now. It is very easy to die in this game, and playing coop will sure test your friendship for you can not damage your friends, but still send them up flying and stop their attacks. The hitboxes of enemies and yourself are pretty strange sometimes, but it is not that much to worry about. The only thing I really disliked was that after 16 hours in coop with my friend (I count myself and him as casual games), we unlocked about 80% of all unlockable content and are currently trying to beat the game on the highest difficulty. There are no new items or weapons anymore, we know them all. The only thing to do for us is to simply hope for the best drop luck - there is nothing new anymore.\n\nTo conclude, I say that if you like rogue-like games and donÂ´t mind comic-styled graphics, this game is definetely worth a try. It lacks a bit of content, but you can still have your 20 or 25 hours fun with it. Go ahead and try. I really like it.","January 30","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The weapons and items that drop in the game are well though out, each are powerful in different situations. Overall, this game is certainly woth the purchase, so go and get it!\n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZZDspIOdKcHdZrzpyaA7eA\nTwitch: http://www.twitch.tv/avyur","December 28, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots and lots of achievement-type challenges to accomplish as you play, which in turn unlock new things in the game such as customizable heads, additional damage, or changed properties of certain attacks.  Lots of weapons and items to experiment with, and a nice mix of enemy types to fight.  The online co-op really makes it shine, though it's quite a challenge staying out of your partner's way at times, since friendly fire (while not damaging) can interrupt your friend's attacks and movement, or knock them off cliffs and kill them.\n\nIt's short for a rogue-lite, but long for a brawler.  Expect a successful playthrough on Normal to run you about an hour or more.  Good in short bursts.

The selectable classes (adventurer, barbarian, pirate, assassin, warlock, and battlemage) can also be unlocked with the same system - except adventurer, you start out with that. Even though the levels feel a bit similar and the controller buttons are not bindable -- it is more of a minor gripe.\n\nIt also has amazing pop-culture references. There is: Monty Python, Marvel and DC, Star Wars, etc., to be noticed as you fight toward the boss(es). Getting there is a task on its own, however, as this game is difficult. Maybe too difficult, but I still keep coming back for more. I must be a masochist.\n\nRampage Knights is so much fun that I played for 5 hours straight without noticing on my first impressions. If you have beaten the game your first time through, I will forever question your skills - because you would have to cheat somehow.\n\n\nPros:\nâ¢Clever references.\nâ¢Online & local co-op.\nâ¢Permadeath!\nâ¢Randomized everything.\nâ¢Extremely humorous.\n\nCons:\nâ¢The levels feel similar.\nâ¢The controller's buttons are not bindable.\nâ¢I die a lot.","May 16","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderingai/recommended/314410/","wanderingai","Shelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wanderingai/","129 products in account","An excellent local and online co-op game, Rampage Knights scratches that itch to beat up your friends and enemies indiscriminately. Except your friend only dies if you knock them into a pit. Or under a strategically positioned Mighty Foot curse that smashes them into the ground. Or walk into your bomb. Or knocked down by your ghost after they killed you.\n\nRegardless, the randomized dungeons, traps, curses, and loot add a perfect amount of variety to ensure at least a few fun run-throughs. The combat isn't just brainless button mashing, especially with its different mobs, bosses, and curses (hi, Mighty Foot!) out to get you. Oh, and of course, your friend on occasion.\n\nWith its silly, gory, and explodey panache, Rampage Knights is definitely worth the price tag on sale or not.","May 18","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is like a moderns Golden Axe, if the reader is old enough to know that game, but this one is way more fun. It has lots of replayability and can be played with a friend online or locally. I came across this game because the developer company made nother one of my favorite games: Jets 'n' Guns.\n\nThis game is money well spent, give it a try.","May 16","true","28.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a dungeon crawling beat-em-up with enough items and randomization that it keeps it interesting each go through. I would suggest this most as a co-op game, but playing it by yourself is still a lotta fun!","May 22","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
