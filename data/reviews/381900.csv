Maybe because it is unusual. But 'unusual' usually makes me curious!\n\nThe game is a platformer and plays solidly with an Xbox 360 controller. You start easily but then the difficulty kicks in and represents a real challenge. What I totally dig is the amount of secrets you find, you optimize your playstyle, adapt, overcome - run by run. The permanent upgrades at the end, motivate me to keep on playing.The game's setting and pace are very interesting and finishing a stage with all your loot and upgrades feels like a small, personal victory every time. I also like the mellow music. This game is truly a hidden gem - just like those hidden gems in the game. If I am not mistaken, it's the first game from that developer and I'm curious to see where he will take his ideas with his next games.","August 14, 2015","true","9.0"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","4"

It stars Bard (the player) attempting to get his family heirloom back from a nasty goblin who stole it. Bard must travel through four worlds, each containing seven levels in an attempt to obtain his treasure. The game is fairly hard and punishes you for making a mistake, but it's not the kind of punishment that would make you overly upset. Patience and level memorisation is required in completing this game.\n\nThe game currently features four worlds with seven levels in each. The first six levels are levels full of secrets, traps, and enemies. Thankfully, not everyone wants you dead, as some of these levels have shops that sell various goods to help you on your quest, such as better weapons such as a chakram, the ability to run faster, weapons dealing more damage, extra lives, and more. These are very handy powerups, but not necessary to complete the game (though it makes it much easier to accomplish!).\nAll of these levels have secrets in them. Most of them reward you with currency, but some reward you with something better, in particular, a map piece. The first six levels have one map piece in them. Collect them all, and you are rewarded with something great. If you have difficulty finding secrets, buying the glasses from the shop will help you greatly.\n\nThe game features a currency called Gems. Gems are found by shooting daggers at pots, opening chests, secrets, and killing enemies. Gems can be spent on powerups in the Shop. If you lose all your lives and die, you are given the ability to spend your gems on upgrading your character. By obtaining various Skill Books, you can upgrade your character on things like more starting lives, longer weapon range, more level time, and more. If you're having difficulty finding some, remember that each boss drops one when defeated.\n\nBard's Gold features lots of enemies with different AI. There's a Blue Goo with a simple AI path that makes him go back and forward. There's the Green Goo that follows the same path, but immediately rushes into the direction it was attacked from. There's the bat that moves horizontally, and there's a variation that bounces off walls. There's also the evil Harry Potter tome books that fly around vertically. These are just some of the enemies the game features. They really make game interesting.\n\nOverall, I would consider Bard's Gold to be a very fun game. The soundtrack is simple yet great, the controls are great, the difficulty is high, and the joy you experience finding something interesting or completing a difficult level is a great feeling. The developer is a great guy and is always open to constructive feedback. It is clear he has spent a lot of time crafting this game to the best of his ability. It's unfortunate that this wonderful gem is suffering from obscurity. If you enjoyed the game, do spread word of it. It deserves some recognition.","August 14, 2015","true","21.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I love that it's a bit darker, like a dank dungeon, and the wide variety of items and weapons are really fun to experiment with.\n\nThe pixel-graphics are well-done, and the soundtrack enhances the tone and feel of this game. There are secret levels to uncover and Steam achievements that are perfectly attainable, most occurring naturally with game progression.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to any gamer looking for a classic platforming experience.

Like one hit death, brutal.  Thankfully, the simple controls:  cardinal directions and two buttons, jump and attack, are laser honed.  If I ever died, it was by my own fault.  The controls are tight and respond as you would hope.  Plus there is never a moment that the game doesn't broadcast or signal danger.  You'll immediately learn to fear everything in the game.  "Is that a book shelf?" You might ask yourself. "It's probably going to kill me." And you'd be correct in your assumption that it was going to kill you.  Because it will kill you.\n\nThe levels are premade, but they are dispersed randomly as you progress.  So world 1-2, might not be the same 1-2 in a later playthrough.  I enjoy this level of randomness because you can learn levels and figure out their traps in a variety of ways.\n\nThere are two difficulty modes, Normal and Retro.  Retro gives more HP to the enemies and supplies you with only one life.  And since it's one hit kill, it's game over after one hit.  Rewards are justified for the higher difficulty.\n\nIn terms of game design and mechanics, Bard's Gold offers a simple premise that is fun to play and is well executed.  The pixel visuals have a few modern flairs like normal mapping for a nice touch of dynamic lighting juxtaposed against retro visuals.\n\n(I am a big fan of normal mapped pixel art)\n\nThe sound plays a big role in the game so make sure to adjust the audio accordingly.  The music is okay, but I would advise to lower the bgm so that the sound effects are more pronounced, which will save your life.\n\nOverall Bard's Gold is a welcome addition to tough action platformers.","August 14, 2015","true","4.5"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

While the game is enjoyable and has a few flaws. The biggest is how dying appears to remove all your powerups. Only after playing for a while do you realize certain items block this, and you don't actually lose everything. Still, even with a bubble around you there are still plenty of instant deaths it seems.\n\nThe game is rather short once you get the hang of it. There is no reason to use a weapon other than the knife, and the game is completeable with very few of the "death" upgrades. The bosses are zero challenge if you arrive at them with a 3-knife fully powered up.\n\nI like the secrets, including assembling the map. There does feel like something is a bit off though; on the first level if you find all the secrets you get a bonus heart. This doesn't appear to repeat on any other level of the game.\n\nThe hit-boxes of the monsters (for character contact) are unforuntately quite generous. Quite often I died without any visible pixels actually touching each other.","October 4, 2015","true","5.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

You collect treasure throughout the levels which are mostly randomly generated with secrets hidden within the levels such as more treasure, items, and rooms that can be very rewarding. Some items make your character more powerfully, move faster, or better weapons. Enemies have different ways for attacking you causing you to change your strategy all the time and even moving further through game it keeps getting harder to add more replay value. Boss fights are honestly not that well made and just feel like much more powerful versions of the regular enemies just given more health and different looks. You unlock skills just like in Rogue Legacy where evertime you die all the treasure you found throughout the playthrough can be used to unlock skills to make you more powerful in the next playthroughs.\n\nConclusion: Bard's Gold is a solid indie game that you should check out if you like games like Spelunky and Rogue Legacy. Even a nice game to play while listening to a podcast or watching YouTube videos honestly lol.\n\nRating: 9/10","May 27","true","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It is very well done, polished and generally fun. I agree with virtually everything the other positive reviews say.\n\nBut it is easily the most annoying game I have played in recent memory.\n\nEDIT: The last couple of patches have helped with several of the annoyances.\n\nLedges are *just* high enough that you can't shoot over them, so you have to double jump and shoot on the way down to hit something on a ledge.\n\nThe arrows shooting from the edges of the screen are completely unavoidable in many cases, sometimes even by design, unless you know where they are.\n\nThe floating books are usually just out of reach and a pain to hit.\n\nDon't get me started about the Tower of Patience.\n\nTake a look at my library. I have played and beat many "hard" games including Mr. Bree, Super Meat Boy, Bloody Trapland, etc.\n\nWhat you won't see there is many permadeath games. Even though this has lives, it's still game over when they are gone. This, coupled with the difficulty is just too much for me. I don't mind trying a level or boss 30 times. I do mind having to do the previous 6 levels over and over to do it.\n\nSo, given that I don't care for permadeath games, take my opinion for what it's worth. If you don't mind permadeath + lots of redoing of levels, it really is a fun game overall.\n\nEdit: I wanted to clarify that when all your lives are gone, it's not exatly "Game Over". You can spend what you earned to increase a skill permanently (slowly...), but you then have to restart from the first level of that area.","August 31, 2015","true","5.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Bard's Gold is a challenging Rogue-lite Platformer which is a little slower paced and more deliberate, relative to other games in the genre. You play as the Bard, looking for his gold, as in the title, and have to maneuver through 4 different worlds, avoiding traps and defeating bosses, in order to attain said goal.\n\nIn the regular game mode, there is "one-hit instant death", which may turn off some of you but in fact is not as big of as issue as you may think. The game makes you learn about the traps and enemies, thus over time your awareness of what the game throws at you will increase, thus decreasing the problem that instant death presents.\n\nIn each run, you have a limited number of lives, and when you do run out of lives, then its game over. However, any gems that you collect over the course of the run remains, and you can put these towards upgrades, ensuring that your next run will go a little more smoothly.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you are looking for a challenging (but not unfair) platformer with progression mechanics built into it.\n\nFor those that are interested, here is a link to some gameplay footage\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NsRgXFa5Eo&list=PLJERKFsvP1WWdOSlXsJWxx2jpyeolpDcM&index=1","May 28","true","14.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/381900/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Bard’s Gold is a simple game to describe and a much more challenging one to play. It, as the Steam Description below aptly points out is ‘a challenging platformer’ with some parts rogue-like where the player has to successfully complete levels in order to advance through the game to ultimately hunt down the goblin that stole your gold. It’s a concept that works well for the game.\n\nAlthough I can see where the developer, Erdem Sen, takes his inspiration from a number of the older console and Amiga classics I definitely see parallels to games already on Steam including Rogue Legacy. By that in both Rogue Legacy and Bard’s Gold the player can actually develop his character into a more powerful one through dying and pouring gold acquired throughout the previous life into power ups that only become available to be bought after dying and before\n\nThe biggest frustration that I had with the game is that of insta-death. The moment that you touch something you lose one of your three lives (you have three lives before the game is over and you get to go to that previously spoken about shop to power up and start over). I felt that a more than occasional death was unfair and that it was either unavoidable or it was ‘this’ close to not being a death that it simply frustrated and began to anger me. Yes, I accept that the game is attempting to be one of the most challenging games, if not the hardest, in the genre but there comes a point where hard reaches resentment and it’s a game that despite its obvious quality I could see myself resenting even as I become better at it.\n\nThere are a lot of different enemy creatures in the game and Sen has done a great job in giving them their own unique identifiers, characteristics and AI. It provides a deeper level of variety to the game. The graphics are in cute pixel art form which works for the most part, however, some of the traps may feel ‘blind’ to you because of the art design and the sound track is one of the best in a in a relatively inexpensive indie platformer that I’ve heard.\n\nBard’s Gold is a game that separates the strong platformers from the weak, the men from the boys and the women from the girls. IF you love challenging platform rogue-likes then you will find plenty of content here to do enjoy. However, be warned that if you are the type who gets frustrated at games easily and fairly quickly then you may very well lose your patience with the game before you ever allow it to realize its potential. There is much to like about Bard’s Gold but it will be one of those games that you either love to love or love to hate. I don’t foresee there being much middle ground.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 14","true","7.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Bard's Gold is no exception to that rule. When I first picked up my controller, I died nearly instantly. I felt silly, dying to a stupid bat, so I picked myself back up and went in again. I cannot tell you how many times I've died thus far, but I'm enjoying every obsenity-riddled moment of it. The slightly randomized feel to the levels helps you learn where secret treasures are, how to navigate through the obstacles, and ultimately, get your treasure so you can buy upgrades. I have found this much more enjoyable because there is a somewhat unpredictable nature to the levels themselves. The enemies are always the same, regardless of the layout, but each different scenario gives you a better idea of how to kill the monsters around you.\n\nGuidance-wise, there isn't much, other than some one-line remarks by the Bard (at the beginning of some levels); you basically have to charge in and hope for the best. The learning curve itself felt steep for me, at the very beginning, but after I was able to progress through a few levels (after a multitude of deaths), I became comfortable and was not losing my precious power-ups immediately after I had gotten them. Having the extra life skillbook from the beginning is very helpful, but I quickly became stumped while trying to locate others. It was slightly frustrating not knowing how to find other skillbooks; however, the emphasis on finding secret treasures was enough to overcome that obstacle.\n\nI cannot emphasize this enough: don't think you're done with the level simply because all of the enemies are dead and you have a key in-hand! If the timer isn't out, attack like crazy and try to find those secret treasures!\n\nThe platformer aspect of the game is enjoyable; it relates back to old-school platformers that I grew up with. I'm not sure if this is happening for everyone, but I have some moments when the double-jump seems to glitch a bit. It happens sporadically, and I'm playing on a relatively new controller. It is a little bothersome, but it's not enough to make me stop playing. That is really my only complaint so far, which says a lot about this game. It is a challenge and make you want to rip your hair out, but it is one of the more addictive games that Steam has to offer right now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toellnerd/recommended/381900/","toellnerd","Payne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toellnerd/","297 products in account","I purchased this game during a 40% off sale, making the price point ~$5. I was expecting a roguelike/roguelite platformer, which is what I received, to an extent.\n\nFrom what I read from other reviewers, it seems that this is the first game from the developer. This allows me to forgive some of the nuances with the mechanics that I found slightly frustrating. I wished that I could have a variable jump height instead of a static jump, but perhaps this was intentional. Some of the traps were near impossible, if not impossible, to dodge, due to this feature, as you'd have to eat the trap or ram your head into spikes. Additionally, I found the hitboxes a bit too large, especially the player projectile, hitting edges that I was clearly not contacting. Grievances aside, on to the review. I'm ignoring story because this is meant to be a roguelike, which I expect to have little or no story, which this has, and I am not disappointed, since this is not the main selling factor for a roguelike.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe controls are tight. The character slides slightly to slow down, which feels good and makes mastering the controls rather difficult. There are several traps both above and below you, as well as projectiles to watch out for from enemies, making it sometimes hard to focus on everything at once, which, in my opinion, is a good thing in this type of game. I did not like when spikes fell on my head from two screen lengths up, however, with no warning. I played on a keyboard. I do wish the controls were fully customizable. I suspect, as is described in game, that playing on a control is the desired method, and I would tend to agree. Enemies were simple, yet effective. The bosses had a bit to be desired. I found locations in which I was unhittable upon fighting one boss for my first time.\n\nI enjoyed that there were different weapons, however, I found the knife to be the most effective. The axe did not hit some enemies on the ground, making some situations impossible to get past because the enemy was in a small, unhittable location. I would have liked to see the weapons fleshed out a bit more.\n\nI will admit I did not spend much time on the books. I played the game starting on retro difficulty, then switched to hardcore after I died twice. I wish hardcore was harder. I do appreciate that the developer made the game difficulty available to a large audience. I did find it a little disappointing that hardcore did not allow you to spend your gems on upgrades, even if you could not use them in said difficulty.\n\nMusic/Sound:\n\nMusic had a nice feel to it, and the sounds were unintrusive.  I did find myself getting a little sleepy from how relaxing the music was, but this may have been because I was playing at 3AM.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe art in the game was decent. The levels themselves had a bit to be desired, but the character and his animations were pretty. The bosses looked as if they visually had a bit of work put into them. The graphics worked well for the game, with a few minor exceptions where I would miss an enemy because he would be blending into the background.\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game is a somewhat flawed roguelite, but has its positive aspects and is an admirable creation for a first game. I found the overall playstyle appeasing, but longed for a bit more depth and a bit more difficulty. I completed hardcore the first day I purchased the game. That being said, buying the game on sale for less than $5 is, in my opinion, worth it. I received probably about 4 hours of entertainment from the game before completing it on the hardest difficulty, and oddly enough, securing the first spot on the leaderboard, which I suspect is because there is little reward for playing on that difficulty aside from challenge. I may run through on retro to explore the skill books some more. I would say the average gamer would get about 6-10 hours out of this game if they chose to play on normal or retro, depending on skill.\n\nI hope to see more from the developer in the future. I hope this feedback is helpful in refining your next endeavors.","October 20, 2015","true","9.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sounds easy enough, right!?\n\n\nBasic Gameplay:\n\nAs the developer himself states, there is no handholding when it comes to getting started. You are thrown into the first world with limited knowledge of what it is you are doing and/or trying to accomplish in order to progress. Personally, I enjoyed the beginning challenges of "learning the hard way." Some might not fancy such an introduction, but those aren't the people the game is aimed at. The developer has been clear on who his target market is and brutally honest that not everyone can hack it.\n\nIs the game hard? Yes! Did I want to throw my remote control through the television screen a few times? Sure! Is it impossible? Absolutely Not!\n\nI'm not a huge fan of repitition, however there are small things that were done to curb a lot of the monotony that comes with this style of game. Here is my top 3 personal favorites in order of personal importance:\n\n1. Random Level Design (To A Degree)\n2. Music/Sound Effects (Can Be Gamebreakers For Me)\n3. Persistant Upgrades (Must Be Unlocked)\n\nYou might think these are no brainers or standard with most games now, but more often than not that just isn't the case or if they do have them the quality just isn't there.\n\n\nCompare to:\n\nRogue Legacy\nSpelunky\n\n\n\nScore: 9/10 (-1 point just because I hate repitition, but I enjoy this game.)\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is awesome! Seriously worth every penny. I bought it full price and then bought it again for a friend. I know the review is vague at best, but a lot of the fun comes from learning how to play/progress on your own. I have included some personal tips down below for those looking for at least some small insight on how to/where to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***Spoilers***\n\nTips/Tricks:\n\n1. Break/Kill Everything\n2. Buy The Glasses First - Seriously, You Will Learn Why\n3. If Time Runs Out - It Isn't Over","August 30, 2015","true","14.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

And it is too easy (if you compare to Spelunky, Rogue Legacy, etc.). For example, bosses paternes are very easy to learn... You just need to be a little bit safe and be careful about some traps to win this game. To expensive without discount. And if you want a REAL rogue-like plaformer, SPELUNKY is far better !","May 31","false","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This is the most confortable for games like these (Rogue Legacy does the controls so much better and you can configure to other buttons to match your preference), but this game is limited.\n-Graphics are so good that I can't distinguish what I am able to jump on\n-Music does not fit the theme of the game, nice\n-Gameplay seems dull\n-No description for items so I have no idea what I am supposed to do\n-I would rather play Rogue Legacy\nCONS\n-Pros are actually cons\n","March 23","false","0.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"
