Since it is part of the Orange Box, the Half-Life 2 Complete Edition and the Valve Complete Edition, chances are great you already own and have played the original Half-Life 2.\nThe good news: Episode 1 continues on the high level of level design and gameplay the original had set. There is however an important shift in focus, as the greater part of the game is played alongside Alyx, Gordon's female companion-in-arms. Alyx happily stands her own against the enemy hordes and doesn't need any sort of "babysitting" games wtih less well developed AI sometimes call for. She's been updated graphically as well (looking even better ;-)) since Episode 1 makes use of the High Dynamic Range lighting effects first tried out by Valve in Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. However, compared to that playable tech-demo, environments in Episode 1 are a bit disappointing and don't always offer the best opportunities for the upgraded engine to shine. There are no wide-open vistas, and although the opening level in the Citadel is impressive, it also has a sort of repetitiveness that comes to the fore now and then.\n\nOn the other hand, gameplay-wise everything is as top-notch as it was in the original game, and the fact that you play alongside Alyx offers some interesting opportunities. There's even a Steam Achievement called "One Bullet" which gets unlocked by playing through the entire game (!!) using one single bullet. The rest of the kills/actions has to be made by using the Gravity Gun, which gets an upgrade during the early part of the game. This calls for clever thinking, and I tried to get it, only to find myself missing the shooting action after a couple of hours ;-).\n\nAll in all, Episode 1 is a good to very good expansion, continuing the story of the original game in a logical and interesting way. There's no reason at all not to give it a shot (...) when you've played the original Half-Life 2.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10","September 2, 2014","true","13.6"," 59 of 61 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","59","61","2","0"

As far as the story goes, this is really just a connection between HL2 and Episode 2 and nothing terribly new or exciting will be revealed, but by no means boring.\n\nYou got a bit of citadel and super gravity gun action, combined with a hint of Ravenholm in the dark, Sandtraps w/o pheromones and lots of City 17.\n\nBuy it.","December 8, 2013","true","15.1"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","44","52","0","0"

We find ourselves in a bad place as the citadel is about to be destroyed and it's gonna take the entire city with it, so you need to escape before the city is destroyed.\n\nThis review will be incredibly short since this is pretty much Half Life 2, I'll just cover the cons and pros of the game.\n\nI want to say this was a bit disappointing playing this episode. Apart from the final mission, the entire game is kind of boring.\n\nThe gameplay is the same thing as in Half Life 2. There's no change whatsoever. There's nothing really new here it's basically the same game as Half Life 2.\n\nThe story is still great. But I think the events leading into what is Episode Two are far more interesting than the entire story of episode one.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is probably the story. The game is kind of slow in pacing and it's a drag and not to mention it's also incredibly short.\n\nIt took me 2 hours to finish the entire game. There's pretty much no replay value after that.\n\nOverall my feelings towards this episode are still positive. This is as good as the previous Half Life titles, just the story is kind of boring, but apart from that it's a great game.\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10 - Play it\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked the review post in the comments on what you disliked.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 31, 2015","true","2.4"," 58 of 76 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","58","76","3","0"

And yet, It still is.

Not much changed from Half-Life 2, this game is a continuation and starts right after the events of Half-Life 2.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520555541\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: After the events that took place in Half-Life 2, Gordon and Alyx Vance are reunited and need to escape City 17. Unfortunately, they cannot escape before the Citadel's core detonates. So Alex and Gordon are forced to enter the Citadel to stabilize the core long enough for them to safely escape.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520555575\n\nGameplay: There are only two changes to the core game: First, Alex's AI has been dramatically improved, so she is more helpful and not nearly as annoying as most NPC's that simply repeat the same phrases and actions. Second, you start the game with the Gravity Gun, which is utilized both in combat and puzzle solutions.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=520555594\n\nAchievements: There are 13 achievements in Half-Life 2: Episode One. Five achievements are unlocked by just completing the game, the rest are achieved by special circumstances. (like... “beating the game firing exactly one bullet”, “not killing any stalkers”, or “killing an elite soldier with his own energy ball”)\nTo be honest, these achievements aren't very bad, this was a relatively easy 100% completed game, compared to others games.\n\nPrice: Half-Life 2: Episode One, is priced at $7.99, unfortunately the game is very short, and this price is a bit high for the amount of time it will take to play through the game. (You will probably spend about 5 or 6 hours to beat it)\nA far better alternative, is to purchase The Orange Box for $19.99, you will purchase: Half-Life 2, Half-Life 2: Episode one, Half Life 2: Episode Two, and Portal.\n\nConclusion: Story: Still very good, but unfortunately much shorter then Half-Life 2. Gameplay: Pretty much the same as Half-Life 2, the only difference is you use the Gravity gun much more, and much sooner. Achievements: Straightforward, fairly obtainable 100% completed game. Price: Over priced, wait for a sale, or purchase the Orange Box for the best value.\nI recommend this game to anyone who played Half-Life 2 and wants to continue the story of the Freeman...\n\nRelated reviews\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode Two\nHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(...is what I would say if it was released yet *sob*)","September 19, 2015","true","7.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","0"

In this episode you have to buy the resistance and yourself more time to escape City 17 and then escape with them, but it's not going to be a short one.

It just feels like I'm going around the otherside of the buildings from Half-Life 2 and after a while that would start to get repetetive. But the reason why some people like me like this game is because it's like you're still not finished with Half-Life 2 and you want to how the story unfolds.

You pick up right where you left off, in the Combine HQ, otherwise known as the Citadel. It's fairly short, ranging anywhere from 2.5-3.5 hours in length. Now, let's see how this episode differs from its parent game.\n\nEpisode One, in my opinion, is slightly more focused on storytelling than the original campaign. Please don't get me wrong though, as the gameplay was still heavily featured, with some menial improvements as well. As explanation for Episode One's extra focus on narrative progression, I'd say that, if you pay attention, you'll have a solid amount of your questions from the previous games answered in this expansion. In the way of gameplay improvements, I'll simply say that there were some nice new mechanics and a little bit of gameplay refinement. Another great difference was that you spend almost all of your time with Alyx in Episode One, and she really becomes fully fleshed out and even more likeable than she was already. The last difference I noticed were the faintly improved graphics in the form of lighting and reflection, as HDR was present in this episode, but was not in the base game. All in all, Half-Life 2: Episode One makes some minor enhancements across the board to an already wonderful game, all the while continuing the plot effectively. Other than that, the majority of what was stated in my review of Half-Life 2 (the base game) is still true to Episode One too. It’s of the same quality and thus deserves the same personal rating I bestowed on its predecessor.\n\nPersonal Rating: 10/10","May 3","true","3.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The Combine purposely try to blow up the Citadel to destroy any info to prevent the Resistance to get their greasy hands on it of course because it's the linchpin of all their plans.\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is pretty short comparing to the first Half-Life 2 because it's a episode I guess, I don't know why ask Valve, but the gameplay really doesn't differ in Episode One, but you are fighting you way away from the Citadel this time due to the Transmission failing in the Citadel.\nGraphics:\nGraphics don't really vary because it's the same source engine, but what changes is there's rocks everywhere because of the Combine's Strider keep blowing ♥♥♥♥ up!\nThe rating I give this is 9.2/10 because It could be a little bit longer.

It came as a shock when Valve announced that they would begin releasing episodic installments in their best selling franchise.\n\nHalf-Life 2 Episode 1 is a continuation of Half-Life 2, picking up right where the last game ended instead of starting somewhere completely new. This may confuse many new players who haven't played the original hl2, but overall episode 1 is a nice bridge between Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2 Episode 2.\n\nPros\nPicks up right where hl2 left off, no time jumps\nAlyx's ai is very good for a game that is 9 years old, still works almost flawlessly.\nGame runs very well, very little lag and no crashes\nGame looks great, a few graphical updates from hl2\nThe soundtrack is very well done, the tracks flow very well with the gameplay.\nCons\nThe only setting in the game is City 17/the Citadel. Nothing we haven't already seen in hl2.\nThe only new enemies are the Zombines and Stalkers.  The zombines are plentiful in numbers and are fun to mess around with, but the Stalkers don't even fight back and serve little to no purpose in the game.\nThe game is quite short, even if it is supposed to be just an episode. You might finish it in an afternoon or two.\nRating\nThere is no denying that this is a good game. However compared to Half-Life 2 and Episode 2 this installment seems to be missing what made those 2 games masterpieces. You should definetely buy this game, and it is definetely worth 8 bucks. Just keep in mind that it doesn't bring a whole lot of new things to the table like the other ones did.\n\n8/10","November 27, 2015","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, I'm still recommending it - especially is you like Half-Life 2 as much as I did - but the games main problems come in the fact that this feels like it's trying to get you hyped for a potential Half-Life 3. Nothing really happens in the game, it's basically just about Gordon and Alyx escaping the Citidal, and it doesn't add much to the gameplay or the mechanics. Still, it's definitely worth a play just because it's loads of fun, I just wish there was more lore and story.

The same characters are there, and a few new enemies and mechanics are introduced. None of this is exactly game-changing, yet it does keep it fresh. The story lacks a little, which is mainly due to the lenght of the game.\n\nThere isn't much to say for Episode One that hasn't already been said for Half-Life 2.

A very enjoyable game, although half as short as its predecessor. The same engine is used likewise and the same arsenal of weapons, physics and control mechanics. Has a very distinctive reversed chronology  kind of style, where as you progress the game you actually go back to the beginning, where half life 2 began. A major reason why i prefer this one over episode two, is because you get to use my favourite weapon in the first chapters, the super gravity gun. One more time to ragdoll physic some more useless combines. That's why i prefer the first one over the second.

I bought this game again even though I own it already on XBox 360 and played through it again here. I love this game :).\n\n-In Episode 1 there are no new weapons.\n-In Episode 1 the story length feels short (the episodes are however cheaper than the base game)\n-No full controller support (This game does not work with a controller like with the 360.) It is not a big deal, but to say partial controller support is spinning the truth. You cannot celect all of your weapons with a controller. This seems like something that could have been fixed with a patch.\n\nAll said and done I did play this with a keyboard and mouse. IT was a blast, and the computer version was converted to use a controller (even if with poor support,) so playing with a keyboard and mouse like old school games is no big deal.

Taking play mere minutes after the end of the first game's campaign, it follows the effort of both Gordon and Alyx as they try to escape City 17, where the collapse of the Combine Citadel is about to set off a huge explosion.\nAs far as gameplay goes, nothing really changes from the main game, aside for new situations you have to face with the instruments you are given (one sequence, for instance, requires you to shine your flashlight on enemies to help Alyx killing them while you don't have weapons to speak of). Alyx will accompany you for the whole episode and fight alongside you.\nAs a downside, this time around Gordon isn't as effective as in the original Half-Life 2: you spend the first half of the game armed with your gravity gun only and generally you unlock other weapons at a slow pace. While this forces you to relay on the environment and your creativity more, it can get annoying during particularly hard sequences.\nHalf-Life 2: Episode One is roughly three or four hours long and takes places in environments you already got yourself familiar with, but still it expands nicely on the original story and keeps the gameplay fresh enough","April 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great voice acting too for all the characters. and there's a new enemiy - the Zombine - which is cool.\nI like the dark places too, it makes the game more fun and challenging.

It is literally just a continuation, but they didn't call it Half-Life 3 because it's shorter and the story seems more like stuff they had to get out of the way to avoid plot holes and set up for the next chapter.\n\nIt's an immersive, fun game, and I didn't find any glitches. You play as Gordon Freeman trying to stabilize the Citadel's core and then escaping the city, which you can do in about 2 hours.\n\nThere are a couple minor additions, like stalkers, allied roller mines, antlion holes you can plug with cars, flares, and most importantly, zombines. You spend a long part of the game fighting your way through zombies, headcrabs, and zombines.\n\nAlyx accompanies you the whole way, not getting in your way at all and shooting enemies. She even gets a sniper rifle at one part. The AI really impressed me.\n\nAnyway, just buy all the Half-Life 2 games.\n","December 13, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This has got some damn good atmosphere and combat sequnces and while short stands tall as an excellent adventure amongst FPS titles and expansions. That said it really is the middle child of the Half-Life 2 family. From replaying I've come to think it's real weaknesses come from it's exposition heavy,slow start and opening Citadel chapters. Especially combined. It has you teamed up with Alyx for the entire episode and thankfully she is well written, helpful and interesting and a damn impressive showcase of AI. At the same time though you'll often be locked into little "cutscene" rooms. You can move around freely as control is never taken away from the player in Half-Life games but these "cutscenes" as well written and interesting as they are are also unskipable and if it's not your first time playing all you can do is leap around like a cat and make people look like an idiot as you attempt to jump on their head or find something to throw. The tunnels, and ESPECIALLY the remains of City 17 are when it's best. The Citadel isn't bad far from it but it wasn't my favorite part on repeat playthroughs and it keeps me from progressing to my favorite parts faster. (If I don't skip it via chapter select that is.) Episode 1 does a lot of things I've never seen in an FPS before in terms of design and layout but then will have a character openly say "oh god no", "not again" and "here we go again" as you do a reocurring scripted sequence involving Combine, explosives and doors. Having a character remark at how over used a gimmick in game is and then DOING the gimmick does not then excuse or fix the gimmick. It sticks out like a sore thumb as this sort of thing is uncommon in a Valve game. It's like when Duke in Duke Nukem Forever sighed in disgust at a literal valve puzzle and said "I hate Valve puzzles." and then proceeding to do it anyway.","June 24, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is awfully slow paced, and it really does nothing to advance the story. Since these episodic installments were supposedly to be released every 3 months, a slower first episode would be resonable, but since the saga is taking its time, its a bit of a dissapointment.\n\n8/10.

FOLLOW ME AND WE WILL ESCAPE FROM THE CI-TY.\n\nSeriously though, this is amazing. It might not change the gameplay, nor the graphics. But the story, the music, and the feel is all more hectic and chaotic than the cold, lonesome, and dark feel of Half LIfe 2. It feels different, but just as good, continuing an already amazing game. It is amazing in it's own right, and is one of the few times that a DLC feels like an actual continuation of the story, and a great one at that. Altough Episode 2 is honestly "better".

I had beaten Half-life 2 again yesterday (I don't ever replay games) and I thought I was going to leave it at that. But no; I still wanted more Half-life greatness. So I moved onto Episode One, and now I expect myself to be replaying Episode Two as well.\n\nEpisode One starts minutes after the ending of Half-life 2 and Gordon Freeman continues on his journey to fight the powah, with Alyx along with him/you. This is much shorter than Half-life 2, being an "episode", but there is a lot more Alyx time in this one, which is a good thing since she has a very good AI and makes for a great partner in the game. So many awesome setpieces thoughout Episode One, but that is to be expected from this consistently-amazing series.

The game is awfully slow paced, and it really does nothing to advance the story. Since these episodic installments were supposedly to be released every 3 months, a slower first episode would be resonable, but since the saga is taking its time, its a bit of a dissapointment.\n\n8/10.

I've played HL2 10+ years ago, then bought the Orange box this year following the glowing reviews, but it's been a big disappointment.\n\nIn order to give perspective, it's important to consider that Bioshock - which aged really good instead, was released only one year after (same as HL2E2).\n\nThe story arc is trivial and short.\nThe physics-based puzzles are boring by today's standards - pick the ball, and put it into the container, wash, rinse and repeat.\nThe sidekick just can't stop talking.\nThe environments are banal.\n\nIf you want to play a standalone game from the past, there is much much better.","May 7","false","0.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

Continuing directly where Half-Life 2 left off and i think the interactions and releations with Alyx and the other charachters seems to be stronger and better then in 2.\n\nIt got as usual, great levels, graphichs and more.

The Gravity Gun is the most fun weapon in the game.. so please try to enjoy the game instead of being a 100% tryhard.\n\nThe Graphics:\nIt improved the graphics than Half-life 2, at least.. playing in 720p won't take it's full effect.. so I highly suggest play this on 1080p and you will see it's texture improvement.\n\nThe AI's *Artifical Intelligence*:\nSame as Half-life 2 but the AI's are now good.\n\nRating: 9/10\nWhy not 10/10?, Cause I can't give a game that is 10/10..\nI highly suggest people buy this only for Half-life Series Fan or a FPS Shooter Fan.","June 21, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The map design is good imernsing you in your hand in the destruction of the citdal causing City 17 and all the innocent lives that cant making it out to get decemated in the blast. After sometime you enter one of my favorite parts the dark level. Where you need to conserve your light and use it wisly like your ammo agiants the zombies and new enemy the zombine which use grenades which kills most of the slow zombies basicly splitting your zombies in a tight area in half.But sprinting and flashlight power should have been seperated also the game is to short i would have love if it was longer being close in dark areas with a lack of ammo. Getting to see more of the destroyed city and the collaspe of the combine interio. Overall is not bad or good depending how you see it but it not for me personlly so it netural.","December 15, 2013","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Warren spends most of this game saving the thousands of citizens who Freeman imperiled when he destroyed the Citadel, citizens who are growing increasingly irate after having seen Freeman save, like, 15 people and then leave on a train with the hot chick on the box art. Warren must use his stealth skills to sneak into and disable Combine facilities that are keeping the citizens from escaping, and in a thrilling climax the player climbs atop a Strider and hacks into its neural interface, using it to fend off waves of opposing Striders, dropships, gunboats, soldiers, and APCs.

Warren spends most of this game saving the thousands of citizens who Freeman imperiled when he destroyed the Citadel, citizens who are growing increasingly irate after having seen Freeman save, like, 15 people and then leave on a train with the hot chick on the box art. Warren must use his stealth skills to sneak into and disable Combine facilities that are keeping the citizens from escaping, and in a thrilling climax the player climbs atop a Strider and hacks into its neural interface, using it to fend off waves of opposing Striders, dropships, gunboats, soldiers, and APCs. This is the strongest installment in this series yet!","February 3, 2011","true",""," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story just added onto the Original Half Life 2. You must play Half Life 2 to fully understand what is going on in this game. The graphics are great, the gameplay was smooth and very well done.

It picks up right after the ending to Half Life 2, and that's all I'll say without spoiling too much. The story is definately the main thing that keeps you going in this. The gameplay is very repetitive with not much variety. It was pretty much like 'Go into a new area. Clear out area. Repeat.' The game is very short, but I consider that to be a good thing considering that if the game was longer than 5 hours most people would became extremely bored with it quickly with all the repeated gameplay. However, if you loved Half Life 2 you will most likely love this next episode despite all the cons.","August 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/recommended/380/","badtexture","Kill-Cam Celebrity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badtexture/","184 products in account","My old review was too long, so let's clean it up.  Overall, 6 or 7 out of 10.  Not a definite recommendation.  Only play it if you don't mind slogging through the middle of the game where it's absolutely no fun at all.\n\nThis game was decent.  It's a linear shooter.  It's the low point of the Half-Life series, but it still was fun until you got to the "Low Lifes" chapter.  Then, we get to fight the real enemies, not this underground-low light crap with antlion spam.  We get combines and more zombies, with Alyx usually either sniping or in the middle of a battle with you, which means no more cheesy lines from her that irritate the hell out of you.  The hospital level was perfect for getting you out of the underground crap, taking you right into where the game belongs... something reflected in Episode 2, where we didn't have that downtime where antlions are everywhere and we can't see anything.\n\nAs for storyline, maybe it felt different as what "re-opened the HL series and made something out of that unresolved ending from HL2," but for me, it felt like that explanation between HL2 and Episode 2.  It would be fine as a 3-minute recap (which is in there for Episode 2, if you just want to skip over this).  It's okay.  The storyline itself is just continuing HL2 straight from the ending, where (NOT SPOILING IT) and you wake up in a junkyard where D0G uncovers you.  You go back to (NOT SPOILING IT) via junkyard car now powered by D0G's incredible hulk powers and (NOT SPOILING IT).  You end up... look, I can't tell you, it's all just spoilers.  It was okay for storyline, while adding more space for time-consuming lore that I'll never even bother to google because of my social life conflicting with spending all my time pondering the mysteries of the Half-Life franchise.\n\nEither get this game and force yourself through the middle part where the game sucks, or just skip to Episode 2, a game without any sort of "crappy section," and watch the 3 minute recap of Episode 1 complete with post processing as soon as you click new game.  The choice is yours.","May 13, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baron_harkonnen/recommended/380/","baron_harkonnen","Crowley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baron_harkonnen/","17 products in account","Valve made a gigantic mistake with their episodic release concept. It tried to deliver content faster and it failed immensely, giving chunks that just weren't enough to please fans at the time. The cliffhanger ending didn't help either, a cheap way to end any game.\n\nThen if that wasn't enough, they stuck Alyx at the side of the player throughout the game. She becomes more of a nuisance than a welcome partner, mainly with her intimate remarks towards the player. Her nonstop presence is in stark contrast to previous titles, where the player's quest was mostly a lonely ride with only short periods where characters followed.\n\nThis sense of isolation really improved the previous titles, and here I feel it was a bad design choice to stick Alyx to the player for all of the ride. I think the main reason why Alyx doesn't work, is because she ends up trying to be romantic with the player and not Gordon, as Gordon doesn't talk or have any personality, he's just a suit for the player to wear. This ends up being incredibly awkward.\n\nAll in all the episodic content idea was bad, even Valve knows this. It delivered an underwhelming chunk of a game that didn't provide enough, and it was also marred by the continous presence of a character whose remarks towards the player were more cringe inducing than story-building.","August 9, 2015","false","2.8"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","8","24","2","0"

Episode one? Not so much, Sadly, the campagin seems like a rushed mess, being quite short and uniteresting (on a side note, i actually like the last mission, but that does not give it a free pass for what was behind it) I feel like i was going to have a blast with a brand new story that i could enjoy and explore but i was taken through very dim lit subways, sewers and a basic ravaged city with bland characters that i didnt feel attatched to. Like the first, episode 1 ends with a  cliffhanger, forcing you to buy episode 2 to get a better understanding on what just happened (but when you bought episode 2, you were greeted with a far better storyline and campagin length) I got the same enemies as before in half-life 2, expecting there to be something new. In the end, with its flaws, i rate it a solid 4.8/10. Its medicore, honestly. If you bought half-life 2, and this is on a 50% sale, it might just be worth your while.","December 4, 2013","false","2.9"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

Is all i can say. There is only one complaint that i have and its the AI! Oh lord! She is only good for opening doors and killing. Which in Half Life you would think is enough. But this is the first Half Life, and Valve game, where i was frustrated by the difficulty. A challenge is one thing, but this is on a whole nother level. Alyx will literally not go where i want her to go, and for some reason this game has two(maybe more) instances where you are basically at the mercy of how good and how fast she can kill things. The scenes i am talking about are the ones where you turn the wheel to open the gate. And it would not be a problem if there were not so many antlions poking you causing the gate to close.\n\nI would have thought that having someone follow you around would make the game a little bit easier, and she is pretty handy, but having her around is just a nuisance. In Half Life 2 there was a part where you "command" soldiers to navigate the streets to get to the Citadel. And just keeping them alive was a pain because they went where the pleased most of the time. But at least for them you had some sort of control. Ive found myself having to push her to go where i want her to.\n\nThe good things i have to say about this game were the graphics and story. I played Half Life 2 on Xbox and on my Xbox 360.  And that game came out a while ago, so the graphics werent as sharp or at least from my experience. But wow! The graphics were amazing! This is a beautiful game.\n\nThe story is great. I am already hooked and it is only the beginning stages of the game. Valve does a good job at making people want to continue the game just to find out what happens next in the story. In Half Life 2: episode one I am trying to bear the headache of having Alx join me because ever since i finished Half Life 2 many years ago I was left wanting more, especially with that ending!\n\nOverall i do recommend this game but buyer beware that it will take a whole lot of patience and a whole lot of time to get used to her. The main reason i think buyers would like this game is for the story. If you care more about the story then this game satisfies that. It is definitely a game that gamers should play at least once in their life just to experience Alyx AI","January 1, 2014","false","6.0"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","0"

But I have to admit I did was in awe here and there after the effects seemed to have rolled off.\n\nMusic: Great as always in my opinion.\n\nWhy should I not buy this game?\nIt's very short.

It was basically just a case of "Follow the one-way narrow path for half an hour, solve a simple puzzle, follow this other path for half an hour...", and the story and setting wasn't even remotely good enough to make that work. Occasionally, enemies would show up - and die two seconds later, because as fun as the super gravity gun was at the end of HL2, it was fun because it was satisfyingly overpowered. Here, it's just... boringly simple.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of HL2 to begin with - I first played it too late (Orange Box), so everything that was a cool novelty when it came out was already old hat by the time I got it.

This game 2 hours playing and all I can say is, the plot is boring, you just run through a ruined factory, or whatever, using only the gravity gun. For God sake, why you need to pass more than one hour using only the gravity gun, what sucks as a weapon, when every enemy is using a machine gun?!! Their weapons simple vanish preventing you from getting it. The gravity gun should be like the kinetic in Dead Space, a bad and slow weapon used only you are out of ammo, just like the classic crowbar. If you only will give me only the bad weapon, give me my crowbar! And when you finally get you gun, the alien zombie enemies, that don't shoot you, begins to appears. It means, the game can have you using the gravity gun against armed soldiers, but you need a gun to fight unarmed aliens. Very logical!\n\nHalf Life 1 is one of the best games I ever played, I really though that Half Life 2 was inferior into everything, with exception of graphics, than the first one, but still playable, beatable and funny. But this third one, is too weak, it is boring, have parts the that ♥♥♥♥ you off. For exemple, the part of elevator that wreckage falls from the ceiling, and you are supose to shoot that before it falls, but they end uo falling and breaking the elevator too fast for you to get a shock orb (or whatever that is) and shoot them in the falling wreckage, and the gravity gun has too little range to shoot them directly in time. I needed to repeat that many time until I finally got the way, and the next part, you are supose to grab a computer out of the way with the gravity and shoot a shock orb, but there is no indication that you can grab that, and that is a major flaw of the gravity gun, you never know when you can shoot the gravity repeller, or grab any thing, and when it decides you can shoot, doesn't mean you can grab, this takes me to other part of the game that sucks, when the train crashes. There you can shoot anywhere, but can grab nothing, I needed a walkthrough to figure out that I needed to grab the soldier that was attacking the girl, and drag him out for she to escape, until there I was only shooting him, what more should I think? The gun shoots, the thing is attacking, so shoot him.\n\nAnyway, being Half Life doesn't make a good game, the Valve should had it tested to the end before launching, and correcting this problems, and rethink the idea.","November 27, 2013","false","6.2"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","5"

I don't mean that lightly. The way it's animated plus its music gives it that title in my book. I can find myself playing one level for an hour, maybe even hours at a time. The frustration of losing levels is filled with relaxation and calmness because of the ambient music. The way the levels are crafted is truly mindblowing. They had a system in which you had to perfect a level to earn a key, and you would use that key to earn more levels. In layman's terms, to earn more levels, you had to perfect current levels. They ditched that and added an XP system in which you gain more XP to earn a key the more levels you play and perfect. I'm very glad they added this system and was skeptical about buying it. But now that I did buy it, I do not regret it even for a second. One thing I really love about this game is how you don't have to unlock base levels. In a sense, this game is open world. That sense is that many levels are available to you, and you can choose whether you want to advance into more challenging levels, or stay where you're at. To get an S in completion, you have to sweep up EVERY leaf, and to get an S in Finesse, you have to maintain your combo throughout an entire level.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely enjoy about Dustforce is its expasive community. There are lots of Community Workshop maps for you to sharpen your skills on, and lots of people who can set a good example. I'm sure most of the people who get best times on all the levels have a Youtube channel, so you can probably catch them there. The community may or not be active, but it sure is good and friendly.\n\nOverall, in terms of gameplay, music, artstyle, animation, and difficulty (it's not an easy game, but it's not that hard of a game either. It just depends on how much you want to play it), I rate this game:\n\n10/10\nBUY THIS GAME.","August 22, 2015","false","5.2"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","9","2","2"

I heard so many good things about it, but couldn't like it at all. Of course, the game is dated. I've got HL ep. 1 & 2  at the same time and now I'm playing this game and I hate it again. I want to play it because I don't like having games on my steam that I haven't touched, but this game frustrates me.\n\nI'm only at the beginning, but the girl (whatever her name is) is so annoying. She's comepletely useless and stands always in the way and takes to long to open a door. With only the gravity gun (first part of game) to kill the enemies, the game is slow and not fun for me. I hope the game changes this up a lot, because if this keeps on going like it does now, I won't finish this game and never start ep. 2.\n\nThe game takes a lot (almost everything) from HL2, so if you liked that game, I guess you'll like this one as well. I know the half life franchise is a fan-favorite of many gamers, but for me, it's not good. There are way better shooters out there.","July 13, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

Valve has known this glitch exists(as its all over the web) yet they have elected to do absolutely nothing regarding it. So overall, you might not get past the first 20 minutes without resetting, reinstalling, and reconfiguring the game... Good job Valve.\n\nHowever, having 100 percented the game I can offer a more in depth look into the game, while always offering the classical challenge of the Half-Life series, this game seems to ease the burdon on the challenge as the first whole level of the game you have the one shot grav gun, after that there isnt much a challenge with te shotgun.\n\nA third aspect is that the game was overall short, it took me four hours for the storyline but after that with the action moments of the game, it just feels like there wasnt a long in-depth playthrough but rather a 30 minute short film...\n\nOverall, I would say wait for Half-Life 3, but since that will never exist you should buy this anyway.","May 10, 2014","false","6.3"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","0"

It certainly felt like a Half-Life game, but at the same time it just felt a bit lacking. There was practically nothing new added in this expansion, and in turn ended up feeling like a story expansion rather than a gameplay expansion. Practically half of the game felt boring to me, and that's really disappointing considering how the first two games had me in a constant state of wonder and amusement throughout their entire durations. However, the good parts were great; and the final boss, as brief as it was, felt like a throwback to how Half-Life 1's style of boss fights and was enjoyable.\n\nOnly get this if you've played the other Half-Life games. This is not for newcomers as it will leave you feeling like you were missing out on a lot. On the other hand, if you are a fan of Half-Life. chances are you've already played this expansion.","January 2, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is somewhat of an aftermath game as it picks up Gordon's story immediately after the ending of Half Life 2. Gordon and Alyx are separated and in the first part of the game your job will be to find Alyx again then the two of you can continue your journey and fight against the Combine.\n\nOther than the usual high production value you can expect from a Valve game there's no new asset here. There are no new enemy types, no new weapons, no new characters introduced. It is not necessarily a problem if you loved HL 2, however, later on they released Episode Two with enhanced graphics, new enemy types and some really good new ideas.\n\nAnyway, I am biased here as I love everything that's Half-Life. I hate Valve for not releasing the final episode as with Episode 2 they could not conclude Freeman's story. If you loved Half Life you can pick the two expansion packs labelled as episodes when they are discounted.","March 28, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The first time I played through this, way back when, I was actually really mad when everything suddenly came to a close before it even felt like it started. Considering that it is easy to get 15 or so hours out of the first game, this was a huge kick to the stomach... but it was still fun.\n\nThis game is like listening to Stairway to Heaven and cutting it off before the guitar solo.

A rather controversial option to spilt the sequel into an episodic format was taken by Valve to ease up the wait for the final product, given their previous track record with their games. So, this option did work?\n\nLong story short, yes and no. First of all, given the lenght of the previous game, it's a dissapointment to see this game end up in almost four hours (and that's if you take your time or play in higher difficulties), and the overall game doesn't change too much the formula of things.\nOn the other hand, it's more of the really well made shooter of 2004 and that's always a good thing and it wraps up nicely as a direct sequel of the second game of the saga.\n\nSome points to discuss, some of them with minor spoilers so be careful with that:\n\nGameplay: It's Half Life. The shooting, while it may be not very good for some people, it's functional and provides a sense of weight to each weapon which makes the overall gameplay fun. There are some 'interactive cinematics' moments but thankfully they don't derail much of the overall product. A gripe that I have with this point is the lack of new weapons. The Gravity Gun is once again the spotlight of the game and comes back as resourceful as ever, but then again, you get the upgrade at the beggining of the game and then it's taken off from you almost immediatly. I really wanted to see the OP Gravity Gun in action on the outskirts of the Citadel.\n\nStory: It's good. Not great but good. Basically it all boils down to 'Escape City 17 as soon as possible because everything is gonna explode like real fast' and it doesn't change that much. Sure, it serves as a catalyst for things to come, but it's something explored better in the second episode. I'll give this a pass because it's the start of a trilogy. You can't throw nonsensical twists or a complex plot at the start of a seasonal game, you'll make things too confusing for no good reason.\n\nDifficulty: Rather easy, as with the second game it's because of the Gravity Gun. It makes things way too easy sometimes and in certain occasions you can discard your weapons entirely if you come across a car engine or something with similar weight, it one shots almost everything in sight. One fun thing to do it's play with the achievement 'The One Free Bullet' in mind, it makes the whole game more intense.\n\nOverall: Yes, it's a good game with a few shortcomings, but most of them are the standard ones with a trilogy in mind.","January 24, 2015","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is all the best the series has to offer in here. The game is entirely based around escaping from City 17, which is now falling apart. This game expands the story, gives you new enemies to face, and throws you into unique lsituations in various locations. The biggest feature is that you are with Alyx nearly the whole game. She is a great character and while she takes away from the ambience of being alone, her AI is great so she is never useless or annoying.

In Half-Life 2, you spent a lot of time alone - and met up with people every now and then. It was something to look forward to. However, with people around you all the time, it can get a little claustrophobic - mainly because the AI isn't great and there are a lot of narrow tunnels.

Starting right after the moment you destroyed the core in HL2 you are sent on a mission to evacuate from City 17 as soon as possible, saving as much citizens as you can throughout the game.\n\nThe levels itself are more straight forward then the levels were at HL2, but still enough fights are worth playing through the linear pathways. Be aware however to change the difficulty to hard, because else there won't be much a challenge.\n\nA little short, a little easy, but still worth playing.\n\n6/10","December 18, 2013","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However as single player games goes, this one is one of the best, and a legend of a game.

First off, it is brutally short.  I finished it in three hours.  And the first half of that consisted almost entirely of jumping and gravity gun physics puzzles.\n\nThe gravity gun was, in my opinion, the single worst part of Half-Life 2.  I hated it.  Once you obtain it, the game becomes a focus on all the "new" and "innovative" ways they can make you use it.  And the very first thing they do in this game is give you the gravity gun.  And for half the game, that is all you have.\n\nThere are good things in this game, and it does start getting into some good, survival action later on.  But there's no sense of urgency here.  Throughout most of this game, you have teammates to help you out.  Teammates that you can effectivly let do all the work.  Sure, you need use that blasted gravity gun to move an object here or there, but for the most part your teammates can handle a bulk of the damage.\n\nBy the time you are actually playing the game, it's about to end.  There's no time to wash the bad taste from the early parts of the game out before the credits roll.\n\nThis simply was not a fun experience.  I hope the next chapter is better than this.","January 13, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
