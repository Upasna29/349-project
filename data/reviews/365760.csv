"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/recommended/365760/","seph_au","seph.au","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seph_au/","6755 products in account","Thrown into a neon-lit world straight out of 1980 you play the role of Commander James Moses, given the primary objective to destroy all robots and save mankind. Might sound awfully unoriginal but doesn't stop it being fun, very much a homage to older games like Battlezone while keeping it's own charm.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRaQflHpM9U\nCore gameplay is straight forward. Blast as many robots as possible while dodging lasers and collecting power-ups.  Included to keep things fresh are several alternate game modes, classic arcade (3lives, extra life every 500k points), score (best score in 5min), survival (1life, no health pickups) and more. Developers have mentioned the possibility of co-op support depending on sales and have already added 1 new mode with more enemies and weapons planned as free updates.\n\nWonderful soundtrack that added to the immersion of the worlds, which surprisingly included quite a few different themes, ranging from neon cities to frozen tundras and volcanic plateaus. Controls were responsive with both kb+mouse and gamepad along with all keys being rebindable. Would suggest a mouse as the enemy numbers spawned in later stages might become quite challenging otherwise.\n\nIt's not without it's minor flaws, had some performance issues but it was mostly related to the sheer number of enemies spawned and particles flying around from explosions. Overall I've enjoyed my time spent with the game and if you are a fan of old arena shooters or grew up playing Atari, should give Vektor Wars the once over or at the very least keep it on a shortlist.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/365760/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Vektor Wars is a first person shooter in cyber environment full of neon lights and primitive vector shapes. It's a second Steam game made by Super Icon Ltd (the first one is the platformer game Life of Pixel).\n\nGameplay offers nothing more than a classic FPS action with fair weapon variety. All main gameplay objectives are built around surviving the attacking waves of enemies. You'll fight in nine campaign levels and if that won't be enough for you, there are additional score-based modes like arcade and survival.\n\nWhat makes Vektor Wars a unique indie game is the way developers worked with low budget. There are many developers who could do something similar and it would be terrible, but this game will make you forget it that you can't actually see your weapon (only a crosshair) and that enemies don't have a proper animation (they're just teleporting for a really short distances). You'll take it as fitting with the polished 80s vision of cyber space.\n\nTo mention some flaws, the game shows weird achievement support. Some achievements unlocks next time you start the game, or just sometimes randomly while you'll play you get a message for an achievement you unlocked several minutes ago. The game uses a font with red color that has low readability, so you might sometimes miss condition messages.\n\nThe biggest flaw is the fact that the whole graphics style can make you feel sick. That's not a hyperbole and it's not because of FOV (if you would think so, you can change it in options), but just looking at geometric shapes full of colorly-varied neons isn't something you want to do for hours.\n\nConclusion:Vektor Wars is a good FPS game, but it's targeted towards niche audience. It's not something you could recommend to everybody but if you like the game style and don't mind the downsides I mentioned, it's worth buying.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 28","true","0.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/recommended/365760/","pxabstraction","Parallax Abstraction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pxabstraction/","985 products in account","I did a video for this game on my YouTube channel as well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR4dNl6HhhU\n\nThis is a fantastic, simple, arcade style FPS set in a gorgeous retro art style, reminiscent of Tron and old school arcade games like Battlezone. At its core, it's a wave-based survival title with a heavy emphasis on score. There are a few different game modes but they are all variants on that core theme. This is strictly single player only, there is no online. Some might find this odd but I think it makes perfect sense. Smaller shooters like these don't tend to have large multiplayer communities and I think it makes sense to focus on the single player experience instead.\n\nIt also brings some unique twists to the typical FPS formula, especially with regards to ammo management and how scoring is handled. When you reload your gun, you lose everything in the current clip which encourages strategic reloads and while you don't ever fully game over when you die, you restart your current wave and your score resets which very much changes the incentives for skillful play. There are also large and varied maps and the level of challenge ramps up very fast and can get extremely tough. The developers didn't reinvent the wheel and didn't bite off more than they can chew.\n\nThere are a couple of technical hiccups. The audio is overmixed and distorts at times and there are no audio sliders, only on and off toggles. During chaotic battles, the frame rate also drops fairly heavily and I'm on a Core i7 with a GTX 970 so a game like this really shouldn't ever drop below 60fps. These can be improved though and are more nitpicks than anything else.\n\nThis is a focused experience that knew exactly what it was going for and has a small but tight package at a great price. If you like shooters with a twist and love the retro art style like me, get this!","June 7, 2015","true","2.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

It had a huge setup with goggles and joystick.  The lst time I saw it was at auction in the late 80s.  Well, Vector Wars is the spiritual successor that made me remember that game.  I got to spend hours playing for free, duping the machine for the same quarters as my parents had the key until it sold.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/multihawk/recommended/365760/","multihawk","Multihawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/multihawk/","251 products in account","I love both FPS and Tron, so this title caught my attention! A wonderful fast-paced shooter, Vektor Wars satisfies my craving for a quick shooter with lots of weapons and enemy types while boasting multiple game modes. Iâve separated my thoughts into multiple sections with a Pros/Cons list at the end.\n\nSettings Menu\nThe settings menu allow you to change key bindings and adjust audio options including the music and sound fx. Options to adjust controller and joystick input are also available. Unfortunately, this is as far as settings go; there are no video options whatsoever.\n\nPerformance\nWhile there are no video options mentioned above, the game runs smoothly at 60fps throughout. Depending on your gpu, you may get frame rate drops when there are lots of explosions and particle effects happening all at once, which will happen occasionally when there are tons of enemies on the screen.\n\nGraphics\nAs I love the Tron aesthetic, I adore how this game looks overall. Each level has their own look and feel, ranging from snowy landscapes to urban centers to a hellish volcano Mount Doom-esque level.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is fast paced as enemies will naturally come to you. You always want to be on the move, traversing the map to pick up new weapons and their ammo in order to survive the onslaught. There are 15 weapons and by the last mission, you should have used most, if not all of the weapons. Each weapon is unique and have their own HUD, audio, and damage profiles. Movement is very smooth, which is good news as youâll be moving a lot to dodge enemy fire. Each enemy type is unique, ranging from simple footsoldiers to large ships that cover the sky.\n\nGame Modes\nWhile completing the story mode will take you 4-5 hours (if you go around collecting everything), there are other game modes to try each with their own rules.\n\nIn the story mode, you play through each level to unlock subsequent levels. There are 9 levels total, each having their own aesthetic and overall feel. The overall story is simple:  you crashed landed and a rescue mission is underway. However, there are complications, so you must fend off hostiles through each level in order to be rescued. Each level has power cubes which are collected unlock messages. Once you have enough power cubes (there are 10 per level), you bring them to a satellite dish to receive a message. These messages outline how the rescue mission is going. Each level also has these cute little ârobodudesâ (7 to 8 depending on the level) where collecting them will net bonus points in the end.\n\nIn addition to the story mode, the game boasts 4 other game modes: Arcade, Deadline, Sequence, and Survival.\n\nIn Arcade, you start with 3 lives and must survive as long as possible. Every 500,000 points you earn will net you a life.\n\nIn Deadline, you must score as many points as you can in 5 minutes.\n\nIn Sequence, you have 2 minutes to destroy as many enemies as possible in each zone. There are 5 zones total. When you die, you are taken to the next zone without all the weapons you have found and equipped (besides the starting pistol).\n\nIn Survival, you only have a single life and must kill an enemy every 30 seconds or else the time hits 0. Once the time hits 0 or you die, the game ends. Each of these modes use the same levels from the story mode.\n\nAudio and Music\nOverall, the audio effects in this game is great. Standouts include the sound of your character as he moves, which makes a nice mechanical sound. Whenever you equip a weapon, a unique sound plays while shooting the weapon makes a sound that packs quite a punch!\n\nThe music is great and gives an upbeat techno feel.\n\nGlitches :(\nWhen I played, this game is relatively glitch-free, though the one that stood out to me is getting stuck when jumping or moving to a sloped section. I had one instance where I was exploring the map and I was stuck on this ledge and couldnât get out, so I had to restart the level. My recommendation was just to avoid all sloped areas besides ones that lead in and out of the water.\n\nOverall Impression\nI like this game a lot! It fits my criteria of everything I want in a fast paced Tron-esque FPS. I highly recommend this game for the price being offered. If thereâs a sequel, count me in!\n\nPros\nLots of unique weapons\nFluid movement\nLots of unique enemies\nLovely aesthetic\nGreat level design\nLots of different game modes\nCons\nCollecting robodudes or power cubes can be a hassle (I had to look at a guide for the power cubes), especially when a couple of the power cubes are in the water.\n- One suggestion is when you only need 1 power cube or when there's only 1 robodude left, it would highlight on the map where they are. This avoids the dreaded feeling of trying to find the last one, which may take a while depending on the level.\n\nHard to know what each weapon does on the fly.\n- One suggestion is to have a test range with all weapons available where the player can use each of them against dummy targets.\n\nNo video options\nNo way to tune down the visual effects (can hurt the eyes if played too long)","March 24","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Though I did encounter one of those "camera-lock and teleported away" glitches (from an enemy exploding too close this time, not a ladder), I made it to level 3 in one sitting.\nThe game is fun and hearkens back to th'old days (of which I wasn't a part). There are collectibles and weapons strewn about the level. One of those collecitbles - Robodudes - is dynamic, as in they run around the level. Grab them when you see them.\nOn my very first time playing the game, I found three or four different guns in the first level. In this latest session, I was only ever able to find my second gun on the third level.\nThe maps don't make any sense to me; the landmarks and whatnot drawn on them hardly ever match with the surroundings. I have no idea.\nIt's a cool little game that could be very fun or very frustrating. I recommend it to those who like "oldskool" things and/or the visuals. It's a fast-paced retro Ziggurat...'ish.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nWhen trying to ascend:\nIf you have Shift held down while running into one, you will warp through the wall.\nIf you tap W to walk into it, you might succeed, or you might just get pushed back off the ladder somehow for some reason.\n\nWhile on ladders:\nIf you're not climbing it, you're slowly sliding down it. Because.\n\nWhen trying to descend:\nSaw a Power Cube down in a pool of water. Went closer to the edge and accidentally grabbed a ladder I didn't know was there. This locked my camera in place, at a -45Â° (if normal line of sight = 0) and booted me to the entrance of that island. Had to hit Escape to knock the camera out of that position.\n\n\nMy first attempt at the game was fun; found a few different guns, ended up hunting for Robodudes and Power Cubes more than I was fighting enemies. The shooting feels weird, as where the reticle is isn't where your projectiles will go. Can have a wall to the right of you, peek around the corner, have an enemy in your sights, end up shooting the wall because it's that bad. Maybe for a retro feel(?)? Is only annoying.\nI closed the game for the first time because I was down in the water and COULD NOT get back up, because the ladders absolutely refused to work - just ran around inside of walls, making the most of the glitch until the laughter became spiteful.\nWHY oh why - Why can I not spam Jump while in water to "swim" to the top and then jump once more to get back onto land?\n\nLadders. Do. Not. Work.\n\nThe game itself is pretty fun and I would recommend it.\nI cannot play the game because ladders; I do not recommend it.","October 3, 2015","true","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","6"
