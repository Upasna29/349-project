"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imgonnadestroyu/recommended/351970/","imgonnadestroyu","hehah im graduntn fuk u hahahaha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imgonnadestroyu/","113 products in account","You can put a cat on your head.\n\n\nEdit:\nDue to certain induviduals expressing their displeasure with my review, and probably many others as can be seen from one out of every 4 people finding it not helpful in any way, i have decided to expand upon this comment on the game, and give my true opinion.\n\nThis was my first tales game. I have long been a fan of RPGs, mostly in the form of final fantasies, but i have never found the oppurtunity to play from the tales series, mostly due to the lack of them on PC.\n\nWhile this may be common knowledge to some, it will not be to all. To start off, i will talk about the battle system. To be honest, i found it very confusing at first. It's all real time fighting, and everything is based off of combinations of clicks and certain keyboard keys. you use your left click for basic attacks, and your right click for attacks such as special techniques or spells. later, after learning more abilites, you will be able to set certain skills to different combinations of buttons. for instance; right+mouse button = a move, left+mouse button = a different move. when you get the hang of what keys to press for what move, you will have a LOT more fun. It's simply learning the games mechanics. While this takes time, when you learn how, you will have an amazing experience exploiting weaknesses and finding cool technique combos.\n\nCombat summary - difficult at first, but very fun when you learn how to use your techniques well. Doesn't take a lot of time, but be prepared to learn new things. 8.5/10\n\nNow, we come to the equipment and skills it comes with. Each piece of equipment you find in either a chest or an enemy drop will have some ability on it. Examples being; +4% attack, +10% attack against this certain type of enemy, +10 hp gained when blocking, etc. While these may be useful, it does not make or break fights. The certain item you get is far more important, leaving the little perks it comes with to be fairly insignificant. You can also fuse two of the same items together, allowing the new item to be everr so slightly stronger, and with perhaps new abilites. I went through the entire game without fusing a single piece of equipment or trying to find the best setup of abilites. The ONLY time i needed to make custom gear with lots of fusing was for the most difficult, optional, and final boss. Also, it's confusing as ♥♥♥♥. Here's an example of what you can get if you spend 10 hours farming for specific equipment.\n\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=586438763\n\n\nEquipment/fusing summary - interesting, but too confusing to pay attention to. Can easily go through the game without having to worry about it. Unless you're a min-maxer, don't worry about fusion unless you really want to. 6/10\n\nFinally, the story and characters. I've heard many complaints about the characters, and how it's difficult to be attached to them. I, on the other hand, absolutely love them. This may be because i have little experience in the tales games, but i found the main protagonist to be a perfect fit. Naive, courageous, a little innocent, and an incredibly strong willed induvidual. While i don't like some as much as others, there is a lot of variety among the group. you'll get a lot of good laughs with certain interactions and side conversations, while also feeling quite emotional at points. I'm keeping this vague because i would like to keep this review as spoiler free as possible. Which is why, with the story explanation, i will keep it short. I very much enjoyed the story. While the pacing seemed a little weird at times, and some things were a bit rushed, hard to follow, and sometimes never even explained, it was largely unnoticeable due to the large amount of positives you'll find throughout your journey. If you read all of the dialogue (no skipping please), you'll find the storyline very interesting with some very unique concepts.\n\nStoryline/characters summary - against popular opinion, i found the characters to be very funny and easy to get attached to. While the story is a little rushed at times, it's overall a very cool experience. Don't skip the dialogues. 8.5/10\n\n\nWould i recommend this game to a friend? Of course. Would i recommend this game to everyone who is even a little interested? Of course. As long as you're willing to put a bit of time and effort into learning the mechanics, and have previously had an RPG or JRPG that you have played and enjoyed, this is a must have.\n\nAlso, you can put a cat on your head. :3 Love the costumes. Love cats.\n\nAnd you can do this\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=592402361\n\nAnd this\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=592402153","December 17, 2015","true","121.2"," 715 of 901 people (79%) found this review helpful 549 people found this review funny","79","715","901","549","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmb1988/recommended/351970/","prmb1988","Gepetto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prmb1988/","195 products in account","This is a great game for JRPG fans. This is NOT good for casual gamers. If you're already familiar with the "Tales of" series, you know exactly what you're getting into. For those of you who only know Tales of Symphonia, this game is very similar, with a very improved combat system, and a bit shorter. If you liked other entries in the series, you'll probably enjoy this one as well. It's a little bit more complicated than the others, though. If you like JRPGs and aren't familiar with Tales games, this is a good place to start.\n\nFun: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 10/10\nAudio: 10/10\nReplay Value: There's a New Game+ option with extra difficulty modes and other options that you can change from one playthrough to another, so if you're a completionist, you might want to replay up to 3 or even 5 times. There's also a DLC chapter focusing on a minor character. 10/10\n\nLet's get this out of the way first: Tales of Zestiria is a JRPG, but it does not have turn-based combat and is not a grindy game. In fact, your characters' levels matter much less than what equipment they use and how you control them in the real-time battles, both of which are based on some systems that are difficult to understand at first and brushed a lot of people the wrong way (see below for an overview). The lack of a need to grind, the presence of a good Quick Travel system and the lack of needlessly big, empty regions (except for one) mean that the game flows very well, and except for a single bit near the end which doesn't even take 15 minutes total to clear, it never feels like battles and simple puzzles are being tossed at you just to increase play time, as it often does with so many other games of the genre.\n\nThe game's localization was very well-done. One particular character has a thing for puns and "dad jokes", which are very hard to localize because often they can't be translated and you have to come up with a new one along the same lines. The English versions of those might be one of my favorite parts of the game. The English voice acting is also very good for the most part. I don't know Japanese, so I can't compare, but the English language audio and text are on point.\n\nThe story is nothing exceptional, but good enough and well-told. The soundtrack is really good.The game world is immersive, there are interesting NPCs and sidequests, and I had fun just going out to explore places instead of actually following the story on several occasions. A big part of the game are the correlated Skills and Fusion systems, which I enjoyed playing around with, but which also frustrated many people. I'll get into those below.\n\nThere's an unofficial patch that allows the game to run at 60fps if you care about that sort of thing.\n\nSPECIFICS\nAs I mentioned, character levels aren't as important in Tales of Zestiria as they are in the average JRPG. It's possible to take down an enemy twice your level or to be defeated by an enemy half your level, all depending on how you fight and on what equipment you have. Equipment stat boosts are much larger than your stat growth when you level up, but even more important than that are the Skills that your equipment comes with. Two otherwise identical weapons that happened to drop with different Skills on them can be significantly different from each other, depending on what other equipment you're wearing. In the beginning of the game, Skills aren't that important, but as the game progresses, they become more and more relevant. Certain bosses simply can't be beaten if you don't have the right Skills equipped.\n\nTHE BATTLE SYSTEM\nWhen you encounter an enemy, a wide circular area will be closed around you to form the field of battle. You can move around freely,dodge, block, attack and defend in real time, and issue generic commands to the party members you're not controlling directly (spread out, focus on the same enemy, focus on attacking, focus on defense). By pausing the battle, you can enter a menu and order any non-controlled character to use a specific "arte" (the game's name for attacks, special moves and magic). You can also change which character you control mid-battle. There are five elements (Void/Non-Elemental, Fire, Earth, Water and Wind) to which enemies can be weak, neutral or resistant. In addition, each element is associated to a status ailment (e.g. Water to Poison) and a character stat (e.g. Void to Attack). Every single arte you use will have one or more elements, and every arte of a given element has the potential to cause the respective element's status ailment or give you a buff to the corresponding stat when used. Enemies also have Types (e.g. Flying, Armored, Beast) against which certain attacks are strong. An attack that's strong against an enemy type will deal bonus damage even if that enemy is strong against the attack's element. There are three numbers to keep an eye on during battle: your HP, your SC (Spirit Chain) and your BG (Blast Gauge). BG is used for certain especially powerful artes and for a unique mechanic called Armatization. SC is what you use for actually fighting. Your maximum SC is always 100 and everything you do in battle except running and blocking costs some SC. SC recovers over time during the battle, but if you attack too quickly or too often, you'll run out and have to wait. The lower your SC goes, the slower it recovers.\n\nSKILLS\nEach character has five different equipment slots, and each piece of equipment has four Skill slots. There are a total of 50 different Skills that can give you anything from stat boosts to increased HP recovery, protection against an element or status ailment, added damage against certain enemies, etc.  These Skills are organized into a 5x10 grid where each of the 5 lines corresponds to an element and each of the 10 collumns corresponds to a theme (e.g. the first collumn is stat boosts, the 9th collumn is increased damage of the respective types). Every Skill from currently equipped gear will be active on that character's Skill Chart.\n\nSkills can be combined for added bonus effects, which can be even more dramatic than the basic Skills themselves (such as reflecting 30% of all damage of a particular element, having an extra Blast Gauge or gaining a 20% Max HP increase). The Bonus Skills depend on where skills are on the 5x10 Skills chart. There are three types of Bonus Skills: Stack (multiple copies of the same Skill), E-Union (two or more adjacent skills in the same horizontal line) and G-Union (all five Skills on the same collumn). Equipping two of the same skill, for instance, reduces the time you spend staggered by 6%. If you have multiple stacks of two, their effects add up - a stack of stacks, if you will. This means you can become completely immune to certain status ailments by equipping the right skills.\n\nFUSION\nEvery piece of equipment you get will have at least one skill and up to four. In weapon shops, it's possible to fuse two pieces of equipment and combine their skills, while also improving the equipment's stats with each fusion. Slots that have the same skill in both fused weapons, or any skill in one weapon and a blank slot in the other will keep that same skill in the resulting fused weapon. Slots that are empty in both weapons will continue empty. Slots that have different skills in each weapon will end up with a third skill that is different from both. Because of this mechanism, through fusion you can create equipments with the Skill set you want, to match your play style or enable a specific strategy against a particular foe.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf the above description of game mechanics didn't scare you, and you enjoy JRPGs, you'll probably enjoy Tales of Zestiria. If not, then you've probably stopped reading already anyway, but don't buy the game. That is all.","November 24, 2015","true","130.5"," 157 of 178 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","157","178","11","0"

There is no need to defend yourself against me. If you have a differing opinion on the game, I encourage you to write a review of your own. I do NOT encourage you to leave nasty comments and/or personal attacks on this review (nor does the Steam SA). You're welcome to disagree with my opinion, but please be civil and decent.\nFirst of all a lot of the Tales combat will feel very familiar. Characters have regular attacks, special moves called Artes, and magical spells. Regular attacks and Artes can be chained together while magical spells require charge time, so the caster must be protected from enemies who want to interrupt their spells. The CC system appears to have been replaced by something called the Spirit Chain system, which looks like a mix of TP and CC. You spend SC to use Artes, and they replenish as you attack. As with CC, precisely timed side-steps, blocks or dodges can fill the SC gauge.\n\nOne of the more interesting elements of the game is Armatization, a super-powered combat mode that is similar to the Chromatus in Tales of Xillia 2. Armatization requires Sorey and one of the Seraphim (Team Members). Each of Sorey's Seraphim pals is tied to a specific element, and when Sorey uses Armatization, he fuses with them to gain access to new moves and weapons based on their element. For example, Mikelo provides a bow and magic-based arts while Edna gives giant stone fists and earth-based arts. Instead of the traditional Tales character swapping (Like in tales of Symphonia for example), there is a focus on different fusions to change Sorey's play style.\n\nWhen you hit an enemy's elemental weakness or elemental resistance, the game displays a big glowing icon to notify you. This also makes me suspect that enemies can swap resistances on the fly, requiring Sorey to do the same.\n\nThe dungeon exploration in Zestiria feels very familiar. You'll probably have a good idea of what to expect if you've played recent games in the franchise. This game lacks any sort of puzzles in the dungeons, similarly to Xillia. So, for anyone hoping to a return to dungeon puzzles like Symphonia, will once again be disappointed. However, the dungeons are spacious and well suited to the game’s “Real Map Battles” system.\n\nTales of Zestiria doesn't look to reinvent the wheel. The core Tales combat system that people know and love is still there, and while there have been some changes to the basic design, longtime fans will still enjoy the game. There are some new features, such as the Armatization fusion mechanic and the new on-field battle camera, to keep the game feeling fresh, and the story is hella intriguing.\n\nThere are two last things to call attention  to before closing this review out. First, the cutscenes. Every scene with dialogue in Zestiria is actually more like a cutscene. Text bubbles have been removed in favor of the text showing up on the bottom of the screen like subtitles, and the entire scene has motion and acting to it. However, even with that all being the case, you can still press buttons to skip through lines quickly. It’s really implemented incredibly well!\n\nSecond, are the anime cutscenes. Ufotable handles all of the animation for the game, including the cutscenes (of which there are surprisingly many that are animated) and the opening sequence. Every single bit of animation that Ufotable handled in the game looks stunning and absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI'd DEFINITELY recommend it if you are an Tales of fan or newcomer!, unless you find yourself allergic to the typical trappings of such games (you can see the typical zomg 30 fps outrage on the forums already). But it’s still a Tales of game… isn’t it?","October 19, 2015","true","50.0"," 442 of 592 people (75%) found this review helpful 39 people found this review funny","75","442","592","39","31"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alqairu/recommended/351970/","alqairu","OVERWATCH > ST3AM GAMES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alqairu/","89 products in account","I'm a veteran of the tales series and I'm a bit torn about Zestiria.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Combat is GREAT.  Might be the most satisfying combat in a tales game yet.  Every boss has a different feel and you have to constantly change up your combos, characters, and tactics to suit the enemy.  Very rarely do any two bosses feel the same.\n\n-The gear system is non-linear.  At first I was skeptical, but this ended up being a lot of fun.  It offers tons of customizations to suit your playstyle.  I could write an entire review on how great the gear system is in Zestiria.\n\n-The game doesn't feel 'grindy' and encounters occur instantly and in the actual environment instead of teleporting you to a seperate battle scene.\n\nCONS:\n\n-Story.  Tales games are known for aweome stories, memorable characters, and massive plot twists.  Zestiria's story is "You are the chosen one.  Bad dude is doing bad things.  Assemble team of one-dimensional RPG stereotypes.  Go beat up bad dude to stop him from doing bad things."  I've never finished a tales game and felt so dissatisfied with the story\n\n-Camera.  You'll get used to it quickly if you're a veteran gamer, but it can be VERY frustrating in many cases.  The benefit to the old encounter system was that your camera was never in your way and the entirety of the battle was always onscreen.  With the new one, the camera can be obscured and the way it focuses, even when there are no obstacles, sometimes places the camera in FRONT of your character so that you cannot even see what you are doing.\n\n-Silliness.  This sounds weird, I know.  Tales games always have some tongue-in-cheek humor, but it's usually in appropriate places, like optional skits and cosmetic item descriptions.  This one is plagued by it.  Your battlefield sounds like a 9gag meetup as your characters shout out a constant stream of memes and pop culture references and even the skits and main story scenes are sometimes filled with them.  I'm all for humor in a game, but Zestiria takes it to the point where it makes the serious part of the story harder to enjoy.  (And it was hard to enjoy to begin with.)\n\nOverall, I recommend Zestiria, it's still a fun ARPG from a team that makes some damn good ARPGs.  If you're looking for a tales game and the combat is all you care about, then you've found the one.  Bonus points if you giggle at doge jokes, you will be right at home.  However, it is not the most solid entry in the series story-wise.  If you have the appropriate console and have never played them, Tales of Symphonia, Tales of Xilia, or Tales of Xilia 2 will, in my opinion, give you a far more satisfying story experience while still having some great combat.","November 1, 2015","true","55.3"," 99 of 113 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","99","113","9","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/recommended/351970/","michal_sivek","Sivek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/","1402 products in account","Kind of a mixed-bag where your enjoyment of this will come down to how much you like the combat and the character interactions.  I found both enjoyable enough to overcome most of the game's flaws.\n\nFirst off, the port is really good.  There are arbitrary resolution options, easy and well-done keybinding, instant switching of button prompts upon switching from keyboard to game controller, graphic options and I didn't suffer one crash while playing Zestiria or experience any kind of framerate issues.  The UI is solid and doesn't have any glaring issues. This is a very pleasant surprise for a Japanese series's PC debut.\n\nZestiria also has a lot of small touches that make it easy to play.  For example, you can save anywhere.  The game calls it a quick save, but it's a permanent save you can use anywhere and doesn't delete after loading it.  You can also line-skip dialogue and cutscenes, which is great for fast readers and for when you just want to hurry along a cutscene without just straight-skipping it.  If you die against a boss, you can just retry the fight immediately after being given a chance to rearrange your equipment/party instead of having to load a save and make a run back to the boss.  Another big thing with Zestiria is you get a bunch of dumb costume accessories that have a ton of editing possibilities and all costume changes are reflected in-game.  This is always a cool thing.  All this adds up to a hassle-free experience and I give the dev team a lot of credit for these features.\n\nYou'll spend a ton of time in combat, so let's talk about that a bit.  Zestiria decided to have battles not transition to an imaginary plane but instead take place in the current environment.  Honestly, I don't really see the advantage to this gameplay-wise, other than as a testing phase for future implementation,  It makes getting a feel for the whole battlefield practically impossible and also can cause the camera to spaz out at times.  While I didn't find the battle camera to be as problematic as most (like 90% of the time it was a non-factor), there will be times when it gets caught on a corner or you get too close to an enemy and it just starts to wig out.  Other than that, the game uses a pairing system called armatization that lets you combine characters, mainly to exploit elemental weaknesses, which are a big thing in Zestiria.  Bosses can be problematic though, as they tend to get incredibly aggressive when weakened and it's extremely likely you'll get a full-party wipe in a matter of seconds a number of times.  I liked the combat and found it mostly satisfying with the above issues plaguing it a bit.\n\nThe character interactions are one of the main draws of the series and it's really good here.  The skits and humor are mostly well-translated, particularly all the puns.  At times the translation gets a bit too meme-y♥♥♥♥♥♥encey at times but on average, it's a very good adaptation.  The biggest problem character-wise is that non-party members might as well be non-existent and don't do anything to make you care much about them.\n\nThe story is bad, and this is coming in with low expectations for it.  The first two-thirds are kind of boringly generic, but not really holding the game back or anything, then the last third of the game comes and suddenly there's a huge emphasis on the story and it's just bad and there's a lot of it.  Even things like quest design start to fall apart, like there are numerous times where the game sends you to some place, only to arrive there and then immediately be told to leave and go someone else.  The home stretch of the game also arbitrary locks some fast-traveling locations so you end up just trying to power through it to get back to killing stuff and doing sidequests.\n\nDungeon and music is uneven.  The parts of Zestiria that feel fully cooked, like the entire middle section of the game, have some decent design, like the shrines for example, and really cool, uninterrupted music.  Other areas, like most random ruins and transitional areas, are rather copy/paste with unmemorable tracks.  The team really dropped the ball by not having Sorey's theme be the generic overworld music because it rules and is insanely underused in the game.\n\nThe last negative is the equipment system, which is terrible unless you love micromanaging between a bunch of screens.  They tried to reinvent the wheel here and just messed up.  I won't bother to explain how poor the implementation of it is, but thankfully you can largely ignore it as long as you're playing on the higher difficulties.\n\nAll in all, if you're interested in JRPG's for the PC, this is a pretty solid choice, especially considering how slim the pickings are.  Yeah, it's about 15 hours too long and the story and equipment system are poor, but ultimately I found it a fun game to play, especially once you get your primary party, all the way through the shrine trials.  There's a lot of replayability here due to how the series handles new game+ features, as well.  So if you're looking for a combat and character-oriented JRPG, Zestiria is probably one of your best bets on PC.","November 7, 2015","true","66.2"," 76 of 86 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","76","86","9","0"

Good job!"\n\nCons\nArtes aren't as in depth as the other Tales games\nSome of the characters feel a bit off and impersonal for me, which ruins the atmosphere.\nNot selling the Soundtrack on steam (Yet)\nTaking out the JP song, issues or not, was still fantastic\nA bit confusing with all the added "things" to fights.\n"Auto" mode (fighting) is fantastic until it comes to a *boss* or *Main mob fight* and it's like it goes stupid.\n\n\nRight now, I can in good faith recommend this game AT it's current price to someone whose interested. I am no where near finished and have spent a bunch of hours running around and checking every nook and cranny trying to find chests, herbs, ect. If you're new to the Tales series, it's a nice place to start. It IS different in degree of difficulty and direction then the others, but for a PC starter, it's perfect in difficulty, exploration and story.\n","October 24, 2015","true","32.0"," 76 of 88 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","76","88","2","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/351970/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","Here's my SPOILER FREE binge review.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the series, Tales (of) games tend to be heavily story loaded throughout the entire game. The newer games easily have 5 hours of main story dialogue at a minimum, and Tales of Zestiria likely continues this tradition. They all feature some variant of the original Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS) which is where primary combat occurs on a straight line, with moves resembling a beat-em up or fighting game. Aside from an early game or two, Tales games also pioneered optional bits of dialogue called "skits", used to flesh out the world or characters, though sometimes used for tutorial purposes. Stories tend to vary from game to game and are always on an epic scale. These are all core tenets of what makes a Tales game.\n\nOf course, since the quality of the port is what most people reading this will care about, I'll start with that. Out of 51 hours of gameplay, the port's quality is pretty strong. The most important aspect is that the game never once crashed -- something TF2 couldn't even claim given the extremely long individual play sessions. Like anything that dares to be 3D on the PC, there are spotted reports of folks having problems, but on an Nvidia 670 with 6 month old drivers, no problem. Keyboard and mouse are fully supported, and both gameplay and wandering the world are smooth, responsive, and intuitive. The menus are also proper keyboard and mouse menus, but they're still ironing out some glitches. (a day one patch fixed some "last menu option can't be clicked" bugs, but there are other harmless but annoying glitches)\nOh, and you can opt to play with Japanese audio, or you can go with the English audio. I have nothing against the english VA's, but some people just love to have the option.\n\nThe story is somewhat run-of-the-mill to be honest. It's not bad by any means, but it lacks the twists and gut punches of many predecessors, especially games like Tales of the Abyss. You're straight up the hero who's saving the world. However, they do take a refreshing take on what would otherwise be a carbon copy plot -- Tales games tend to use humor, characterization, philosophy, fictional history, and fictional geopolitics to good effect, and Zestiria continues this tradition in a way that better lets the player empathize with this classic saintly hero. I do hope that Namco Tales Studio does give us another Abyss-level story in the future, though. The characters are...weird. If you're a fan of anime, you'll recognize many of the tropes and archetypes. The two playable female humans seem to stand out the most, while the rest are fairly formula. (with one almost seeming like a Persona ripoff)\n\nGameplay is where Zestiria shines -- perhaps even above all of its predecessors. This is coming from a reviewer whose last series game was Tales of Vesperia, but the LMBS changes could end up being a love-hate. Whereas older titles typically had you moving left and right, with 3D titles allowing free run, Zestiria has you running forwards and backwards. The two primary movement keys are even W and S instead of A and D, which I'm sure Symphonia will use. You can still free run, but they've added the ability to sidestep around enemies with the unused movement keys. These controls actually do seem to be an improvement, and is a smooth way to dodge enemy attacks and navigate the battlefield. Speaking of battlefield, having battles take place on the map is a pretty fun improvement. You can fight out on the open, or you can lure enemies into a corner or hallway and annihilate them with your team's AOEs. The movesets for both players and enemies are enormous, with many dedicated standard attacks joining the traditional artes and mystic artes. The game's difficulty curve is pretty smooth, and boy does it get hard. There's so much complexity and depth to the battle system that tutorial monuments litter much of the game, and tutorial messages will overwhelm you in the first 5 hours of play. That said, the game is still beatable without knowing even half of that's going on -- but you'll need all that info to master it.\n\nIt's worth noting that the nature of gameplay is pretty limiting in terms of what the writers could do with the plot. They refreshingly managed to make it so every playable character matters (especially on the overworld), and swapping out the Seraphs during a single battle is a core aspect of gameplay. You won't have to worry much about characters running off with your good gear, but the focused gameplay design probably made the story suffer.\n\nZestiria suffers in the graphics department, but I'm easily willing to forgive this one. The characters and towns look pretty good, the fields and dungeons -- not so much. Some of the dungeons look like they were mapped in a 2D editor and generated from said mapping, while the fields' textures are two generations old. That said, the series is the #3 RPG series in Japan and I can't imagine each game having what we currently consider a modern AAA budget. So what did they do? Pile most of the effort onto the gameplay, much on the story and characters, while the graphics are just there. If you can't look past this, though, it's not the game for you.\n\nAll said and done, it's a solid entry that probably wouldn't end up on many top 3 lists for the series. It sets a good PC precedent for port quality -- good job to the folks who managed said port and keep up the good work. With strong music and gameplay, solid story, and touch-and-go graphics, it's still an enjoyable Tales game, and hopefully the first of many ports to come.","October 22, 2015","true","142.2"," 87 of 105 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","87","105","4","1"

Expect to fight a lot of monsters, just about all the time.\nCharacters constantly talk in battle. It can become more noise than wanted, but can be turned off.\nUpgrading equipment can be convoluted, as it technically may not be as simple as buying new equipment in town stores.\nThe camera in battle can get caught in places at times that obscure your view of the battle.\nThere is a lot of optional treasure to be found through exploration, but none of it is crucial or immediately game-breaking.\nThe game's battle difficulty can be adjusted via in-game menus.\nThis game is very anime. By that, I mean the characters are at times very hammy or just act weird for those lacking context.\nOpinions:Firstly, anything blanked out spoils the story and not the gameplay. As this is a JRPG, the story is the motivation for the gameplay. The story starts out simple and cliche, focusing on helping Angels fight off a Ever-Present-Evil and Monster Army, but it does develop into something more. However, the story tends to leave lingering sentiments that left me unfulfilled. Constant vagueness and intentional crypic nonsense from certain characters wore thin quickly, and the jokes character makes regarding such defuse anything potentially dramatic. Questions are posed, and then left either lingering or are simply taken as is despite whatever notion of doubt I felt or saw in characters.\n\nSuffice to say, the main character resolving to save the big bad by doing what he has been doing for the whole game: hit him with a sword made of angels, left me very underwhelmed when I thought that was the heroic resolve climax. I expected something more personal, rebellious, and ridiculing of the Seraphim that have esscentially been using the main character without explaining the whole situation.\n\nWithout spoiling directly, the game's story attempts to subvert cliche by being vague (for reasons that make sense in the game) and while I could understand why they acted in such a way, it was not entertaining.\n\nThe whole reason the bid bad exsists is because of human folly, but angels allowed it to happen despite knowing it could. They demand worship to push back Evilness, but remain aloof and hidden despite the obvious mutual benefit. While the game shows how blind zealous worship can be as bad as greed/selfishness, there is a lack of passion to it and it all became muted. The angels' passive aggresive attitude toward humans, and the main character in general, had me frusterated to the point of wondering how blindingly trusting the main character is to these people. Friends that intentionally hide and with-hold information so he can learn and decide things for himself... while being the only ones to provide him the means to fight monsters and the big bad.\n\nThey let themselves be used as tools, and use the main character as a tool. I do not understand how such trust could persist in such relationships, but they all fall in line with it.\n\nThere is a distinct emotional wall between characters, and the situation this creates in this universe may be lost on people without heavy RPG context.\n\nConclusionI recommend this game for its combat, which is simple enough to get into and there are complexities to master. But such complexities aren't needed to complete the game. The game is made in such a way that battles can be made more difficult to satisfy needs for challenge. Equipment is not hard to gain, but does take time. You're never expected to invest more than you wish to in gaining said equipment.\n\nThe story has strong characters, though I have mixed feelings about the story. With a game like this, it comes down to personal opinion. That in itself is worth reccomending, if you are willing to think deeply about what is typically taken for granted or ignored in games regarding religion and long-lived beings like elves.","December 3, 2015","true","39.4"," 71 of 86 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","71","86","6","2"

The amount of skits is also nothing close to small and they are pretty interesting to see, I often resorted to just listen to them instead of playing.\n-Animation: even with the casual hate for 30fps the game has a great animation you wont even think you are playing at 30fps, the technology behind the game make everything very vivid and inmmersive for an anime looking JRPG.\n-Soundtrack: the music behind the game is astonishing mainly the music from certain dungeons and the song RIsing Up inspired me so much that I have them with me all the time.\n-Story: the history is pretty much inspired in the good vs the bad, its nothing new in the genre however the way of telling is what is different in a world when only a few ones can see the Seraphim race, the telling of the Sheperd becomes a more related one to the tales of Don Quixote de la Mancha, where the Sheperd is fighting a giant golem and everyone sees simply a rock, funny and yet makes you think what lies beyond the common eyes.\n-Tons of quests and customization: from the equipment to fashion, from simple quests to quests that can customize the very influence you have in certain areas of the map that will affect not only the enemies you fight but the rewards you will get.\n\nCONS:\n-Combat: even if the combat is going in a good direction is not one without flaws, the 3rd person camera becomes almost a 1st person one when combating in narrow spaces or when the back of the player is against a big object. Also the camera being so close to the character makes it really difficult to observe your surroundings, a fix is using the Free Run abililty however since it disabled the SC recovery its a double edge sword.\n-Story: even if the telling is amazing the main bone of it is very basic compared to other Tales of games, mainly compared to the next entry in the PC realm, Symphonia, its not bad but for the first entry as an open world is lack lustered, not many inspirational moments will be found in this game.\n-Skill/Fuse interface: the whole game interface is really good however the other side of the coin is when you are going to fuse an equipment it becomes a pain to distinguish how it will affect your equipment skills (which are tremendously important in the game, if you dont keep them checked you are going down), I ended up leaving the fuse window to check which skills I was going to get and back again to check which fusion will benefit me the most, a pain certainly.\n-Open Empty World: even if the world is wide open and big, the empty spaces between enemies is pretty big so sometimes it feels like a very empty world, dont be discouraged by this but be prepared by it.\n-Sorey is your only character outside the map. You wont change it, its a minor thing but since in the other games you could change them I feel like a backstep when I discovered this.\n\nMIXED\n-Party Setup: the party is stucked at the two humans characters meaning you wont move them from the party, the only thing you can customize is the initial seraphims that will start the battle with you, fortunately this can be changed at any point even during battle with ease. This also is influenced by the story of the game, thats why its a mixed opinion. I didnt liked it at first but seeing how the story unfolded I understood it has to be done.\n\nDLC\n*SPOILER ALERT REGARDING ALISHA*\n-Alishas Story DLC: many think this was bad since Alisha should be a permanent character in the main game, but as with the mixed opinion I had with the party setup Alishas Story is also mixed, I think it Alisha should have stayed in the main game however the story unfolded so well I didnt see a problem with her separating from the main cast. This DLC made me realize it was a brave move and I support it fully.\n*END OF SPOILERS*\n\n-Costumes: all the costumes are amazing and hilarious, they are unneeded and they do not affect your gameplay but after playing for many hours you wish you could change your characters a few things here and there, costumes are for that. There are some unlockables in the game but most of them will appear as future DLC, so get your card ready ;)\n-Free Skits: get this DLC its full of funny skits that will make you laugh a lot! HOWEVER! Listen to this Skits only and ONLY when you have finished both the main game and Alishas Story DLC so you wont be spoiled of some elements of the story and characters.\n\nTIME TO FINISH IT: Straight forward 30hrs, with side quests and extra dungeons: over 65hrs\nGAME RATED: 75~80/100 = GREAT\nRECOMMENDED: YES!\nBEST IN THE SERIES? Nope, but its the first being an open world so its understandable that the transition will take its toll somewhere.","November 10, 2015","true","83.5"," 53 of 59 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","53","59","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmotaku/recommended/351970/","lmotaku","Yuhirou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmotaku/","458 products in account","When reviewing this title, I tried to stay as objective as possible, knowing that I'm a fan of two other Tales of titles. Of course, I will end up having a few subjective opinions about the game, but I will try to break down and separate it in a way that allows someone interested in reading the facts vs feelings towards the game.\n\n[Graphics]\n(Objective) The game is utilizing the same engine Xillia used, and at first due to being a PC player, as well as console, I found the graphics to be "Okay." Not truly amazing, but not terrible, either.\nIn the first few areas there is not all that much to look at except ruin/town textures and plains.\nHowever, as you progress from Lady of the lake, things start to look less and less plain until they have too many textures, and some flowers appear to be flat in-game and aren't 3D.\n\n(Subjective) Walking around seems to be fairly slow, coming from Tales of Symphonia/Vesperia, but it might have something to do with the size of the world.\nI couldn't help but feel like I was being limited in some form or another, though. (Later you get a boost from one of your Seraphim, anyway.)\n\n[Items, Weapons, and Boons]\n(Objective)\nThere are tons of customization options, bonuses and more in the game.\nFusion enhances the level of an item, and you can link/stack unison skills and what not, giving your equipment unlockable skills, damage bonuses and more.\nBoons can be set with the Lord of the Land (Completing the story unlocks this for different regions.) You can get things like\nenemy detection, improved healing, replenishing chests, and more!\nLater you unlock something that helps the Lord of the land and you get even more bonuses. (They can also be used on items! You'll see. )\n\n[Battle mechanics]\n(Objective)\nYou have a power (like mana) known as SC. When the blue bar charges you have a choice of using mystic arts and martial arts and your Seraphim companions get Seraphim arts.\nIn larger battles with say 5+ enemies, there is a noticeable chug when monsters spawn, but other than that and the camera going crazy sometimes if\nyou're stuck near a wall, it's very thought out and your equipment really makes a difference more than levels.\n\n(Subjective)\nIt's fun, but feels slow and doesn't represent the damage numbers in a nice way. It'll show your whole combo damage, but not singular hits during a combo.\nI think they would have been better to use a two number display system. Grey to the lower parts and sides of the mob's sprite/texture and total damage overhead.\nThe titling of things seems off, too. Instead of "Blocking/Defense" it says "Restrain." Which, sure, by literal definition it makes sense, but I was more like "Am I restraining it, wtf is going on here?"\nIt may have been a screw up with the group that did the localization on the game. It's fine.. I'm probably knitpicking, but they should just have "Blocking" and "Hitting" rather than "Restrain" and "Power Hit."\n\nAlso, in previous titles it was just guard, guard break, and damage. ie: Shows blocking animation on character, shows reduced or 0 damage. Breaking guard showed a text/animation in the sprite and then hits got through white and bigger/pow area around text when criticals got through.\nI believe ToS and Vesperia is better than the way they did it in ToZ. I still enjoy ToS' battle system immensely, but I also enjoy the new mechanics, just not the way it's represented.\n\n\n[Story]\n(Objective)\nIt's mostly a rehash of other stories, where you have to go about unlocking trials of power(whether it's seprahim, flow of mana(summoning with Sheena from ToS), or whatever)\nThe characters are kinda different, but ultimately it's the same thing. "Reunite the world, vanquish evil, get two races living in harmony again." The archtypes and symbolic of many anime tropes, but I feel Sorey and Edna are a bit different, sure Edna is kinda a trope, too.. but >_<\n\n\n(Subjective)\nI love Edna! xD\n\nThere are many different things to like about the characters, even if it is a rehash. There are a hell of a lot of skits to enjoy, some giving you bonuses.\nThe characters are as friendly as you expect them to be, and I caught myself laughing quite a few times, so it's done it's job at entertaining me.\nThe love of ruins and archeology has been passed from Raine to Sorey, but the goals of Lloyd. Sorey is an okay character. Not someone you can hate or love.\nRelationships of the characters seem pretty normal for this sort of story, but there is a lack of I don't know.. love or admiration?\nSure, there are a few moments where they show that they like a character's methods of thinking, or one being a protector of the other, and a friendly competition between two, but\nutimately I feel no quintessential love between two characters like Lloyd and Colette for example.\n\nMaybe I'm just looking to save everyone/the damsel again? Damn it Dezel, you took my glory from me!\n\nAnyway, they all have a story, they all have a place, and it makes it fun for a JRPG/Anime fan. Although, I won't beat around the bush, I will say how it is:\n\nThere may be one or two fresh feeling characters, but ultimately the tropes force be strong.\n\n[Museks]\nMusic is purely subjective, and I have found a few passable and loveable tracks, namely the earth trial and wind trial BGMs.\nExamples: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9GVQjKI_QM & https://youtu.be/PwXRtGeFELA\n\n\n[Battles/Difficulty]\nFor the most part, normal and moderate are fairly easy to cope with if you've played JRPG titles before. Focus on items, finding herbs, beating region bosses that give you orbs that stack up to give bonus HP to the entire party. EXP/Levels increase AP, unlock artes, but ultimately don't do what item proficiency, bonuses, and stronger item links do!\n\n[Puzzles]\nThis is another purely subjective one. I felt that it was very easy to get through every single trial and puzzle thus far. I beat almost every trial, except water and wind(Due to confusing myself xD)in less than 10-20 minutes. Now, of course the puzzles could be more difficult for others, but it felt they were very simple, where I remember much better puzzles in earlier titles! Test me Namco-Bandai senpai! :P\n\n[Other battle stuff]\n(Objective) There are a few battle types in the game. You can get mobs that chase you to stack to proc more difficult encounters, and dangerous encounters have a random chance.\nThese battles are only somewhat more difficult than normal battles, just because there are a lot of creatures to watch. This is where items and party control is necessary, but not always.\n\n(Subjective)\nNot really all that difficult in any sense. Weaknesses, strengths, stop artes casters, gg.\n\nThe only time that it gets hairy is when something is 50% or higher than my level, because they kill the AI no matter how they're set instantly. I preferred the AI in ToS. If I tell them to be defensive, they don't stop blocking and I can go directly to their abilities and cast them or take over ALL of them easily and play them how I want if needed. I could be wrong, but I can only control 2 in ToZ. (Switch between Rose and Sorey in battle.)\nAlso, no heal focus—really? Two Seraphim have healing and I can't seem to get them to prioritize it. I'm the protagonist of the story, if I want all characters to spam heal me as I lay down the hand of judgement, why stop me? xD\n--\n\n[Too long?]\n\n-Would I recommend it?\nYes.\n\n-Does it have interesting characters, backstory, things to do?\nYes and no. Yes. Yes.\n\n-Does it beat xyz Tales of title?\n\nYes and No. Some aspects are better, some are worse, but that is both subjective and objective reasoning.  More stuff to do, less lovable characters.

The story wasn't anything overly impressive, but it felt right. The cast wasn't very strong in terms of personality, most being one dimsenional, though a few stand out like Edna.  Skill system quite complicated, could be a pro or con depending if you like the needless complexity. The amount of content in the game felt shorter than older games in the series, but maybe I've missed a bunch of hidden side quests?\n\nPros\n[+] Tales of Zestiria's combat system was quite different compared to older Tales of games like Vesperia or Symphonia, but the combat system felt fluid and fun with the extra Blasts and possible combos.\n[+] Kamui/Armatization added more ways to play your party.\n[+] Bamco did a splendid job with the music in this game, the music felt perfect for nearly every area/event in the game.\n[+] Everything is voice acted! (at least most of what I remember).\n\nCons\n[-] Locked party, especially due to Kamui and reasons in the story (makes me sad I can't play as four with whichever characters I want).\n[-] Camera angle definitely gets horrendous shots during battle.\n\nBamco tried to push the skill system even further since previous Tales games ( I haven't played Xillia/2), but it got very complicated and a lot of info is hidden. With the world using seraphim and humans, the party is essentially locked due to "story reasons" and limits who a player wants in his party. This is reminiscent of the Xillia series which I've only read about that had locked parties. Seamless battles were added to allow fights to occur in the exact same layout as your party is walking in on the world map. While great, the camera felt terrible at times where it got stuck directly behind your characters back, making it incredibly frustrating to fight.\n\nOverall, the game isn't anything amazing or special in my eyes, but it is fun and I recommend to 'Tales of' fans and others alike.","December 1, 2015","true","171.6"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","34","38","5","0"

Correct actions in battles result in reduced cool downs. Playing fights well earns you grade, which in turn results in rewards.\nItem Customization is great, items offer abilities and can be mixed.\nItems can be fused\nCinematics are awesome\nToS with preorder. :)What is not good, but not bad  Music is okay, there are some songs that are really good.\nStory is okay, is predictable for the most part.\nYou have to constantly change party memebers, or fights will take a long time.... so if you like having a specific party always, prepare for some long fights as your attacks will not be effective. (low damage, no stuns). You have to adapt to the battle.\nWhat is bad  Dungeons feel generic, caves look the same, forests look the same.\nAI is terrible, even though you can assing specific actions to the party, on boss battles the AI will either go fight and die to a SINGLE combo of the boss, or if you assign defense they will dodge everything prefectly...and not attack at all.\nThey removed the overworld from other tales games, now you have to navigate thru a vast empty map.\nFights now take place where you touch the enemy, which is cool except that camera angles are HORRIBLE most of the time when in caves or dungeons.\n30+ hours in the game, you still get "how to play" messages..since you will most likely forget everything the game tells you.\nMy experience/opinion Game gets repetitive after a while, same dungeons with different colors, same monsters with different color palettes.\nControlling your party is hard, the camera angles doesnt let you see what they are doing, and sometimes you will just get to see that they are dead.\nMost bosses are resistant to multiple elements, so if you pick the only element that can damage them, well prepare to see your party going in and failing to stun the enemy and get punished.\nSometimes it feels that the bosses have enourmous amounts of health, fights feel unecessarily long. Even when using the correct element against them.\nItem customization is huge, but it also makes it harder to see what is best to equip.\nOnce you get your second main character  Rose , it doesnt add variety to the group, it just feels like the main character.\nCharacters have plenty of abilities, too bad you will be armatized  most of the time spamming the same moves over and over.","October 31, 2015","false","32.1"," 88 of 132 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","88","132","4","3"

(on chaos mode)\n\nI haven't played all the tales series (played the Phantasia, and the Abyss), but I have to say that Zestiria has done a good job living the series' rep.\n\nHere's my thought.\n\nVisual and FXThe game looks nice vitually, anime-style. Towns and Fields are interesting to explore. Dungeons are a little too plain, not in a bad way, but I feel that they can be more vivid.\n\nCharacters are good, but there is a number retextured enemies. some looks not as good as the original, but they do their jobs as variations.\n\nGameplayThe combat is a bit unique, a result from mixture between controls and camera. It can be engaging and challenging at times.\n\nHowever, the camera kills. On opened field, it works nicely. In closed area with walls, corridors, your camera can be your worst enemy, it will zoom in from the worst position possible, making you lost track of the combat field, and often KOed by it.\n\nBattle difficulty setting changes the way you play the game.\n\nOn Normal or Hard, you won't find much trouble in progressing as long as you don't rush through it. (who rush this kind of game anyway ...)\n\nIntense and Chaos is where the game truely shine. Artes and Skills selection will play significant part on how you perform, especially in Chaos where the game force you to use everything at your disposal. The combat becomes tactical, button mashing often gets you KOed. The needs to adapt your loadouts will put you into the grinding hell. ;D\n\nStoryYour typical janime-style plot. I love it. There are several jaw-dropping moments, and many of smiling-with-yourself scenes (eww, creepy)\n\nSoundEng voice is okay, but cannot compare to the original Jap voice. It has done an excellent job bringing life into characters.\n\nFor the soundtracks, it's ... where can i get the OSTs disk ? ;)\n\nOverallIt is worth the purchase, too bad my rig can't run at a stable framerate while recording though.\n\nIf you are on the fence, and not waiting for other game atm, get it !

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InuIsInU/recommended/351970/","InuIsInU","Inu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InuIsInU/","196 products in account","Bit rough around the edges but I find the game to be pretty enjoyable overall.\n\nI'll start with what I don't like though:\n- Fusion system is absolute donkey butt. It wasn't anything the Tales series needed, and back in Tales of Vesperia, it wasn't intrusive or forced on you unlike in this game. All-in-all, it's not an interesting system, and sometimes is really roundabout when you want specific skills, and fusion is NEEDED if you want to get stronger. That's just a no in my book.\n- AI really needs work. Higher difficulties are fun and all, but nothing can sour you more than when the AI just refuses to guard when an enemy is telegraphing an attack, or doing an unblockable move (denoted by a "!!").\n- Early on a lot of the wide open spaces are pretty bland, and the dungeon design is much the same throughout the game.\n- English Dubbing. More of personal taste thing, but the Tales series dubbing has declined in quality since Symphonia 2/Xillia, and for me, voice acting makes or breaks the game, so I just stick to the Japanese setting.\n\nThe In-Betweens:\n- Armatization. Extremely fun early on, but once you get late enough into the game, the combo variety is lackluster. The overeliance on it to actually feel like you're making a dent sometimes is problematic, but you don't actually NEED it to do significant damage, it essentially gives you the normal stats you would have in a Tales game by combining both characters, ensuring you don't get 2-3-shot, which will happen fairly often. You can force your AI characters into Armatization, but sometimes they'll undo it almost immediately, or undo it as soon as you switch characters, which is INCREDIBLY wasteful and could use a fix.\n- Combo variety. Much different to previous games where instead of having basic attacks and being able to chain artes into each other, you have martial artes, which are essentially just preset combos, and seraphic artes. Every attack is essentially an arte, and the variety leaves a bit to be desired early on, and you have no basic attacks so you're limited to just 4 moves per combo. Feels really limiting and like an attempt at "Devil May Cry"-style gameplay. Stick to what you're good at, Tales devs! Later on though, it gets a bit more fun, and the moves are pretty cool.\n- Banish Blasts. Are these a joke? I really can't tell. While they ARE indeed powerful attacks, they take long to wind up without the proper skills set, and they can be interrupted EXTREMELY easily, so I went without using them 90% of the time as they just usually wound up being a waste of BC. Could use some changes, unless I'm misunderstanding or not seeing something. Cool in idea, but not execution.\n- Weakness system. Could be better explained. In order to stagger enemies and actually do significant damage, you need to hit an enemy with its weakness, or what it is susceptible to in order to get a "Power Hit" combo going. It's not a bad thing, but I don't consider it a good thing either.\n\nThe Good:\n- I'm actually finding the story and characters to be fairly interesting. Malevolence is uttered A LOT, but the cast is a pretty likable bunch. I could've done without a lot of the Alisha-related things, but other than that, it was nice watching the main character, Sorey, grow as a sheperd.\n- The character designs. Initially, I REALLY disliked the designs back when the game was first unveileved, but they're actually really nice and fairly pleasing to look at, and a HUGE step up from the cluster duck that is the transition of Xillia -> Xillia 2's character designs. Holy jeebus those were an eyesore.\n- The soundtrack has been really great, and some songs like Zaveid's Theme or Rising Up really stick out as great tracks overall.\n- Combat. Being a Tales game, and despite the lack of variety the player experiences early on, once you get later into the game and actually have more than just a "Mash the A Button" combo, it gets a lot more fun, and the variety becomes much more pleasing. The spells are pretty fun, and they make you feel pretty powerful as well.\n- The skill system. I actually like the skill system in this game, but the fusion system makes it a pain to actually get skills you want sometimes. You can stack multiples of the same skill to stack the bonuses you get from them, and unlock more skills as a result, or you can fill up a whole row of skills to unlock stat bonuses that'll help you along. Though it does irk me a bit and makes me feel like min-maxing, and can feel overwhelming and like you need to choose too much in the beginning.\n- Lords of the Land system. This time grade is earned through not only battles, but through the Lords of the Land system, and you can level those up for bonuses, and later unlock something in the game that allows you to boost enemy levels by a large margin, and that's one of the things I enjoyed a lot. There are plenty of more bonuses from the system, but that is one of the more outstanding ones.\n\nDespite the bad things I've said about the game, I'm genuinely enjoying it, and if you don't mind a slow start to things, I'd recommend playing the game. It could've used some more thought and polish, but I think it's a solid entry in the franchise, and a solid game all around. Though hopefully they stop with all this DLC nonsense, 'cause that's just not cool mang.","November 23, 2015","true","71.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

I have been a huge fan of Tales of "Series" ever since I played their more popular game titles like Tales of "Symphonia" way back on the Nintendo Gamecube with over 800 hours invested in it with god knows how many playthroughs 8-9-10? I am overjoyed to see Bandai Namco reach out to more than just consoles.\n\nThis is why I love them so much.\nThey still follow the old business model for video games no matter what happens.\n(Trial and Error) Example: Their more recent Tales of "Xillia" I'm not going to lie was a bit of a let down BUT it was their first attempt at a more *Dark* focused storyline rather than a few elements of darkness covered up with a happy/joyful theme, which they quickly regained my and a lot of the fanbases support with Xillia 2 and it's dark and twisted as heck plotline, amazing character developement and CATS! SO MANY CATS!\n\nI have since gone back an played a majority of their first games including...\nTales of "Phantasia" (Holy f... so much fun especially for a SNES game)\nTales of "Destiny" (Fing...Passport Finding Simulator...)\nTales of "Eternia" (Those voice actors tho...)\nTales of "Destiny 2" (By far the best sequel storywise that made sense)\n\nBesides these I have also played...\n\nTales of "Symphonia" over 800 hours of gameplay on record.\nTales of "Symphonia Dawn of the new world" It wasn't the best... but it was something new\nTales of "The Abyss" I absolutely hated LUKE for the majority of the game until he grew up, that spoiled brat...\nTales of "Vesperia" Blah Blah Blah TIDAL WAVE! ~Rita Mordio\nTales of "Graces F" so far the BEST combat in the entire franchise\n(Story could have been better...)\nTales of "Xillia" I didn't really get the idea of what was going on, it felt out of place etc\nTales of "Xillia 2" a huge improvement on Xillia with new combat + choice making.\n\nAll of which were  well over 100 hours of gameplay indept storyline and character backstories for a majority of them. Achievments, costumes from the first titles as a nostalgic thing they just had everything down right.\n\nTales of "Zestiria" is the same in that regard hundreds of hours of gameplay, backstory, hidden events, costumes from previous titles, an EX dungeon that houses characters also from the previous titles sometimes with and without the original voice actors (It's normally just text)\n\nWhat surprised me the most is that Zestiria houses many of the old-titles battle themes like...\nPhantasia  Theme song and many others.\n\nAs a "Veteran" of the Tales series you have no Idea how nostalgic it feels even if I only beat Phantasia a year ago it still feels the same.\n\nZestiria this time around brings a new combat system but also keeps some of the previous titles elements like Vesperia interactive combat mechanics, skills as usual from previous titles aswell, and a more immersive gameplay style to the table, that being no screen-shatter to initiate combat or any kind of loading screen it's all done smoothly as one in a real open world environment that being combat, there is still loading for cities and such.\n\nThe game starts you off as a Human boy named Sorey ("So-Ray") who as a child was born of a special resonance allowing him to see, speak and hear Seraphim (The power needed of that of the Shepard a warrior of purification) as you might expect these are the spirits of the world as like Undine, Efreet, Slyph and Gnome of the previous titles this time they are this time around a human-like race who are linked to the elements Water, Fire, Earth and Air able to form a pact and to be merged with the Shepard through a battle system called Armatization which is Zestirias new combat system that grants you resistance to that elements while in that form and also vice versa to the enemies.\n\nOpen WorldBandai Namco said Zestiria would be a large open world they really did deliver on this.\n\nIt's not as say open as a game like say... Skyrim but in terms of in comparison to Tales of (x)\nThis game is massive! Lot's of hidden things scattered about and very large open fields.\nDungeons, Solo-fight pits for specific characters only things like that just waiting to be found!\n\n\nConclusionWhat I am saying is every single Tales game that have ever been released has always been NEW something that wasn't in a previous game, new characters in some of the sequels instead of focusing on the protagonists of the original.\n\nTales is so damn underrated in the RPG/JRPG realm and for them to finally get the recognition that they deserve makes it all worth the wait. Their games are at best reading and following the main stories 30-40-50 hours long and once you beat them they unlock things you can move over onto your next playthrough to 100% achievment run or just to make it helluvalot harder the next time around easier whatever you want to do.\n\nIt's storyrich, combat rich, character developement...rich sometimes. Sometimes hilarious with the skits and cutscene although Lailah sure is punny... really giving you a sense of personality to each character. It's a hit an miss with the trial and error method but it is what makes them stand above the rest of game developers out there with their recycling models and combat styles always being reused and never polished.\n\n\nTL;DR.\n\nI am glad they finally attempted to reach PC gamers.\nThey have been on all? Consoles Snes-PS3(Mainly)-Xbox360 and now finally PC.\nPC Gamers have a lack of JPRG games perhaps this direction will give us more in the future?\nEither way It's great to have this and you should buy it, even if you wait until it's dirt cheap (Shame on you)\nI highly recommend it.\n\nDo you like cats?9 out of 10 cats recommend this game.","October 19, 2015","true","68.5"," 101 of 158 people (64%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","64","101","158","29","31"

How does ToZ manage to elevate itself into what is at least considered a highly-above-average JRPG?\nWell - aside from the mundane story, we should firstly take a look at our cast of characters. Our protagonist, Sorey, is the first major factor. When we start the game, we can't choose his class, name, appearance or anything - which for some may very well be a negative, though it does enable the game to give him an actual persona. The player isn't meant to project himself into Sorey, but to emphasize with him during the game when the albeit few, yet very strong choices come up.\nThis is very important for Zestiria because although the story is as straight-forward and predictable as it gets, the characters are what makes it bearable. Your other party members all fit some sort of stereotype, as I already implied in the Opening, yet the game still manages to keep you interested. It manages to keep the cast on a level which is light-hearted, fitting with the story, yet tries to make you care for each and every member of your party.\n\nThis is were the first gameplay aspect shines: Skits;\nSomething I've not yet seen in many RPG's but may be compared to gameplay elements akin to the Camping of Dragon Age. Meaning: In Zestiria, if you for example explore a cave for some quest or even just to grind you can unlock "Skits" - or Dialogues between your characters by checking out different locations within that dungeon. These dialogues may only be humorous, may convey gameplay-explanations such as equiment fusion or may actually give some insight in the characters themselves. Though every single Skit is absolutely cleverly written and it is what always keeps the player hooked on the story and character progression, rather than violently seperating it's Gameplay from any form of party interaction.\n\nThe gameplay is not as in-depth as you may expect. What the game does is giving you a Rock-Paper-Scissors System which is called Artes. M. Artes > Mg. Artes > S. Artes and so on. Though this Artes System comes down to basically a combo system which you are expected to keep up with by learning needlessly complex Weapon Effects and how the different combat-aspects can be combined with one another.\nYou now might think "What is your problem with that? Sounds to me like a very in-depth system!" - This is only half true, really, as the game not only offers you a simple solution: You can spend AP (earned mainly by exploring) to unlock effects such as "Auto-Sidestep" or Control over your Partners or your actual movement <-- I've got a personal grudge against the last one, as the game arbitrarily locks many of your combat settings behind this AP-Wall. Want to move freely around the battlefield? No can do. You have to learn the Shortcut on your Pad and press it everytime you want to move as you like.\n\nThe thing that really kills this system though is that all this is not really necessary, as the difficulty of the game mainly comes down to micro-managing your party and if you're in a boss fight or not. Generally you can only control 1 character at a time + you can give vague commands to your teammates. Depending on your difficulty and on the enemy, this makes some bosses a nightmare. As the game requires you to learn patterns for bosses which may or may not result in 1-HKO's otherwise. Not being able to control the party AI properly is a big (-) in that case. Otherwise bosses tend to overscale horribly contrary to the laughable trash-mobs you encounter in any dungeon.\n\nIs the combat system inherently bad though? Not really.. but it is definitely not the optimal mix between semi-strategy and action you might hope for, when thinking of buying this game. Many combat mechanics are just impractical, leaving the player to just stick with their standart-combos, which don't require you to learn some new shortcut, to rebind your new combos to any new button and so on. This of course also means, that players who want to get the maximum out of their character can still do so. It just requires a lot of getting used to and is in many cases just a wasted effort.\n\n\nTL;DR\n+ Great soundtrack\n+ Clever character/party interaction\n+ No separation between story/character progression and gameplay\n+ In-depth customization (Gameplay + Characters)\n+ Rewards exploration\n+ NG+\n\n- Generic JRPG Story\n- Too much Info-dumping (Tutorial Messages throughout the game)\n- Camera issues (Can somewhat be fixed by unlocking your movement in combat: See the next point)\n- Some basic combat mechanics have to be unlocked first (e.g. Moving freely)\n- Combat needlessly complex (at least when playing on anything below Hard-difficulty) and bad control over the rest of your party\n\nNow many of these flaws are very subjective. I found myself enjoying the story despite its flaws, as Zestiria just presents itself so well - with the beatiful graphics and the outstanding soundtrack coupled with the character design of which I talked previously. The rest of the negatives are just my personal issues with the combat system which may very well not apply to you. Thus I recommend checking out a gameplay video on Youtube, before buying Zestiria.\nAll in all it is a very good JRPG for a reasonable price. Is it a must play? No. Certainly not. Fans of the genre will still have a wonderful time with it.\n\n\nEdna is best girl and Rose is far cooler than Alisha *Drops mic*","October 24, 2015","true","39.1"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","29","35","7","0"

It's just so refreshing to have a tales game not so laden with anime tropes that I am frankly sick of at this point. I also love how straightforward the story of this game is. No world bending plot twists, just the simple story of the Shepherd Sorey's journey with his human and Seraphim friends, with little twists and turns along the way. I know this is a negative for plenty of other players, but it's another thing that I found quite refreshing. I at least enjoyed it more than the other games mentioned above.\n\nP.S.

What do they want? What drives them? In Tales of Vesperia, within minutes of meeting of meeting the protagonist you understood his motivation and got to watch him and his friends grow over the next 40-odd hours. In Zestiria, I still couldn't tell you why the protagonist, Sorey, is even on his adventure. He seems to have shrugged his shoulders and said, "Meh, let's save the world." He's basically the character equivalent of plain, dry toast: inoffensive and uninteresting.\n\nIf characterization is paper thin, the plot is almost see-through. Most villains vanish, defeated, within minutes of meeting them. Schemers will tell you their entire plan at the drop of a hat. Whatever amorphous Big Bad lurks behind the scenes hasn't made so much as a single appearance. The party seems to bounce from area to area without any lead-in or world-building of any kind. I don't care about where we are or what we're doing because the game hasn't given me a reason to.\n\nYes, the combat system is messy, needlessly complicated, and arcane. And yes, the combat camera just loves to point at walls or the enemy's ankles. Honestly, I could live with that.\n\nBut I can't live with the fact that, after half a DAY of play, I don't care about these characters or this world.","October 21, 2015","false","11.8"," 245 of 422 people (58%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","58","245","422","23","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DUFFKING/recommended/351970/","DUFFKING","Duffking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DUFFKING/","179 products in account","I love the Tales series. Every single game in the series I've been able to play has been incredibly compelling from start to finish, and really felt like more than the sum of its parts. Sadly, Zestiria is the exception to that latter part. It's every bit as compelling as most of the series, yet while every element of a Tales game is present and correct, each feels severely undercooked.\n\nThe game's characters are perhaps its strongest points, but still fails to reach the bar set by most of the previous games I've played in the series, coming out just ahead of Graces F. The best Tales game feature a protagonist who is both interesting and develops in something other than power as the plot progresses. Yuri and Luke were great examples of this archetype. Jude was not, but Milla as a joint protagonist meant it didn't matter. Sorey (this game's lead) is a bit of an Asbel (from Tales of Graces) - he's simply not interesting. He exists to be the protagonist. There is a hint of potential for Sorey: he grew up surrounded by Seraphim, human-like creatures most humans cannot see. He's never met another human, but is thrust into a great adventure. The stage is set for an nice traditional "small town kid in big city" sort of arc, then completely ignored from about 2 horus into the game. Sorey pooters from place to place, doing as he is told by exposition with little agency of his own.\n\nThe rest of the party are thankfully a bit more interesting. The best three characters elevate the weakest, and the interactions of even the weakest characters are still enjoyable to see. Edna steals the show overall, toying with the gullability of the other characters and often coming close to breaking the fourth wall with some sarcastic quips. Lailah's sudden switches from seriousness from serious to carefree are well handled rather than jarring. It's a shame that unlike games like Vesperia, we never learn much about most of the cast. They're slaves to the plot, and not a lot more.\n\nSpeaking of that plot, it's all over the place. It's obviously inspired by Arthurian legends - a sword in a stone, round tables, and so on. Yet it doesn't really go anywhere. It's a typical chosen-one-versus-evil plotline for the most part, with few twists. The main antagonist is absent for a huge portion of the game - we're told of their existence, but most of the game sees you trundling about the world Getting Stronger (TM every JRPG ever). For the first third, the game feels as though it *is* building to a reveal, only to send you on a Zelda like quest to 4 temples for the next third and completely ignoring any sort of ongoing buildup altogether, until someone suddenly realised they needed stuff to happen and abrubtly kicks the story into gear again via a bunch of confusing flashbacks leaving me completely confused.\n\nCombat in Zestiria is an interesting one - it's got depths in spades, that much is for sure. You know this, because for the first few horus of the game it resembles a continuous information dump in the form of popup windows explaining things, never to be seen again. It's compeltely bemusing at first, especially as many of the tutorials aren't exactly relevant until later in the game when you have more skills and party members to make use of. A lot of the complexity is wasted on encounters that feel like processions anyway.\n\nThe core is split in two - the first half sees you control a single character in real time. You can perform dodges and attacks in chains of four. Each uses up some spirit chain (SC), which at a basic level recharges when you're not attacking. To reduce the waiting and encourage aggressive play, successful attack dodges refill SC. You can extend action chains beyond four by spending part of your Blast Gauge (BG) to do a special sort of atack, itself refilled by guarding and dodging. It's a cool system that generally rewards agressive battles.\n\nThe second half is the Armatus - spending a BG to combine your controlled character with another party member. You get super powerful elemental attacks, lots of health and it looks awesome. The bigger your combo when you activate it, the more damage you do initially. Sadly, after the combat clicks, we get the procession I mentioned above: for every encounter, your partner with the Seraph matching your enemy's weakness, build a combo then Armatize to win. BG is so plentiful, there's little reason not to Armatize to ease through fights quickly. And you'll want to, because you'll be fighting a lot.\n\nPart of this constant fighting is due to the dungeon design, which apparently exists in 2 types. Story dungeons are at least reasonably unique, especially the elemental temples. They have a few interesting puzzles here or there, and are pretty good fun to get through. However, many are visually similar - there's far too many long hallways and open rooms and not a lot else outside of the elemental temples, and little in the way of interesting visuals. The side dungeons are worse: cut and paste collections of corridors and open spaces that go on, and on, and on. They're dull trudges from easy fight to easy fight, that get longer and longer as the game goes on.\n\nThe visual blandness in dungeons is a shame, as the game can look quite pretty outside of them. The pre dungeon field areas are almost universally home to interesting layouts and fun to explore. Initially gloomy, restoring blessings makes them look alive and beautiful. Pendrago's exterior is a real highlight. It makes entering the average dungeon a disappointment, because it means another hour of trudging through corridors.\n\nFinally, the skill system. I mentioned the barrage of tutorial popups earlier, but the undisputed champion of poor explanation is the skill system. To attempt to explain it, each piece of equipment will boost two stats, and has four slots for skills. Each skill has an element and a group. Each element corresponds to arow on a grid, and groups correspond to a column. Equipping gear fills in your skill grid with the skills on the equipment. The idea is you equip gear such that you fill in 3-in-a-row, 5-in-a-column, or stack multiple of the same skills. This boosts their effects, and bestows powerful bonus skills - fill in the first column for a character, and all stats get a 20% boost. You can fuse together items of the same type to combine their skills and improve their stats.\n\nIt's a cool idea, but hamstrung because the amount of grinding it will take to deliberately make rows and columns makes it far more effective to just equip whatever gear gives the right character the right stats and treat skill matches as a happy accident. Mechanics are in place to boost drop rates and the chance of dropped gear having specific skills, but it's not a fun prospect fighting the same enemies over and over hoping that the right type of gear will drop for the right character, with the right skill for hours at a time, knowing that you'll get stronger gear eventually anyway and have to do it all again.\n\nSo that's Tales of Zestiria. Recognisably a Tales game, and there's fun to be had for JRPG fans. But aside from some cool ideas (seriously, battles taking place on the overworld/dungeon itself rather than in a seperate arena is a great touch), the entire game feels sorely undercooked.","November 4, 2015","false","31.1"," 59 of 94 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","59","94","3","2"

I've played a few in the past, and will just say that this one kept me entertained but didn't knock my socks off.  Worth a play-through (My logged hours are up there from falling asleep while playing, which probably says something about the game). As to some of the other reviews I’m reading on here, I personally really like the equipment customization/fusion aspect of the game.  It gives some breadth and actually easily allows you to manipulate your fighting style should you get bored (not that having 6 characters to choose from doesn’t allow that).\n\nI also didn’t really ever have trouble with the camera as a lot of people are saying.  The combat system was very refreshing, and as someone who loves grinding it didn’t feel like I had to do much, if any, for the game given how much the equipment customization affects you and the regenerating stat herb items that can be found EVERYWHERE.  However, by the end of the game I found myself just fast –traveling and using enemy-repellant holy bottles when I was running around in the fields.\n\nAs for the insane amount of goofy, irrelevant cut scenes that come along with Tales’ games, at a certain point, puns become annoying.  There are other comedic devices you can use.\n\nWhich leads me to my biggest con of the game, the story/continuity…\n\nComing in, I'd expected (Knowing Tales’ games) the story to be convoluted and not make sense at various points.  I was not disappointed. Of the various times I asked myself “What’s going on here?”,  I will say that by the end of the game the story as a whole seems to make sense.  It’s indulging the writers to get there that’s tough.  The game is filled with so many holes and unresolved plot events that ruin continuity I can’t begin to go into them all. But the biggest, most massive, undeniably huge one is its basic premise (semi-spoiler)…\n\nTo not overcomplicate things with specifics, there’s 3 types of characters in the game: Humans, Seraphim, and Hellions.  Essentially, the story goes that Humans (minus our protagonist Sorey and company) are unenlightened, ungrateful, hate-producing low-lifes that normally can’t see Seraphim and Hellions.  Seraphim are enlightened, elementally powered spirit beings who live amongst humans.  Hellions are evil/corrupted humans and seraphim.   To try not go into a long diatribe with specifics on just how many times the game contradicts this most fundamental law it sets up for itself (It’s literally laughable), it is single-handedly the biggest issue I have with the game as it totally screws with continuity and any sane person trying to relate to the story would think that Sorey isn’t some sort of savior, but a bat$hit crazy person that talks to ghosts.  For instance, when he is conversing with secondary characters AND having conversations within their core group, wouldn’t it seem like he is talking to the air or that there are insanely long awkward pauses while our seraphim are discussing amongst themselves?\n\nI’ll also say that character development is pretty flat throughout the game.  Barring the major event to set up the game’s ending, nothing really happens to change any of the characters’ outlook or core values.  And even that event doesn’t change much, as it’s more of a “I know what has to be done now” moment and Sorey continues to go on as a one-dimensional, pure of heart, do-gooder.\n\nLooking back at the game, I’m thinking that the developers probably had a lot more content to put in. There’s a solid game in there but it’s just empty compared to other Tales’ entries.\n","November 29, 2015","true","151.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Just putting this on record since I will mention some bugs that may not be here in the future.\n\nShort Version: I quite like this game. It has some problem here and there but nothing that'll turn me off about it.\n\nLong Version:\nSo 11 hours in, I guess that's a good place to be in for a first impression on a JRPG. So like many JRPGs, it's a slow burn. For a Tales game, it might be one of the slowest burns. In terms of story, it's pretty standered... in the start. That said, it does take a while before it gets intesting. Combat is pretty much the same way. With the initial skills and the enemy difficulty, combat doesn't start too interesting. A suggestion for the start, I suggest using your partner character (Mikleo) and if you're an old time Tales player, try going for the higher difficulties. Ok, with that initial start, lets get into some detail.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks nice. From how the enviorment looks, to the character models there is a ton of appeal to the game visually. There are however some shortcomings. You will notice that the outline for the characters aren't as clean as some would like. It's not too big of an issue unless you're really looking for it though. There are also times when the characters are holding something and it looks like it kinda flouts there but I imagine that's more of an engine problem than anything. There is also one particular part in the first dungeon that doesn't look to amazing. You'll come across a certain door with a certain "seal" and well it doesn't look like it fits into anything else there. Now for some bugs. There are some parts of the game where the background shutters and the character models get streched out. That said, I've come across at most 5 instances of this in a 11 hour period. Any other problems, I either didn't see or mind.\n\nTL;DR: Looks nice, a few graphics glitches.\n\nCombat:  Like mentioned earlier, the gameplay in the START is a little bland. Older Tales players will find the combat simplistic in easier difficulties and New Tales player may find it fun in the start but slowly see it get a little old. This can be remedied a little by playing in higher difficulties or starting out with Mikleo (your first partner Character). NOW I did try to mention and ingrain into those reading this how it STARTS this way, hinting it might not be so later. It does take a while for the combat to become more exciting. This Tales game relies on more dashes and side movements. At a later point bosses will actually become a challenge and simply attacking is a possible stratagy but you will be opening your items menu a lot or replaying the same battle quite often. Learning how to move around in the free space and doing quick dashes is where this particular Tales game shines. As where other Tales games have a nice amount of free movement, this one lets you see how to make use of larger spaces and timing your quick dashes. This battle system isn't perfect though. It does need a lot of work and we can only hope the next installment will have that. Though at this time, there is enough here to make for a fun and interesting experience.\n\nTL;DR: Fun combat that relies on more open movement and quick dashes though starts out very simplistic. Will look forward to this in future installments.\n\nGeneral Gameplay:  As a whole, there is a lot to do and fun to be had but I will say, it's a little simplistic at some parts. First off, the vast open world is great. A lot to look at, a few secrets here and there. That said, I kinda wish there was more. Going back the the fact I'm 11 hours in, I wish I was back tracking already. The map is very comprehensive... a bit too much though. Looking through the world gives you treasure and some hints that give you some Action Points... and that's kinda it. I mean there are some extra places to got to but nothing too interesting or even have access to until maybe quite a while from now. They also easily point out where your next objective is with an easy marker which kinda kills the need to pay attention to some parts of the dialog. It's not entirely a bad thing though. This means that you don't get lost in the map and considering how large it is, getting lost would be pretty easy. It's just a little easy is all.\nAn interesting system at a later part of the game though is being able to unlock new bonues in ther area by fighting or offering items you don't care for. It gives the player some busy work if they decide they just want to mess around of a bit. Most of the other systems are skill there like how you can set how characters act in battle, to some things that your character does while just moving around passively. The way items are handled are nice to in that several of the same item might not actually be the case since some might give a different skill bonus from other ones. Generally the old systems that Tales players have had but made a little bit more intesting. One last thing about the systems, cooking system is non-existent in this game which I personally liked but some of you may not to that's a toss up for good or bad. Ok last thing for this section which is a little bit of a sour subject amoung you all. This game is Locked to 30 fps. Personally I don't mind it. Even in 30, it still looks, moves and plays wonderful. I do understand the points people have when they would like a game to be in 60, but for me if it was on 60, that a bonus not a requirment. This is not to served as a warning or to turn people off on the idea or to accept my or anyones ideals, I'm just pointing out that this game is at 30 fps. Ok, I think we go through that alright... I hope. NEXT\n\nTL;DR: Exploration aspect could use some work, no cooking system, same as many Tales games with some additions.\n\nStory: (Spoilers... actually not really) To Old Tales Players: It's a Tales game with some extra political aspect that I personally like. Story-wise is interesting but what really shines are the interesting assortment of characters. So nothing too new in terms of Tales game but has interesting aspects added in to keep it fresh.\nTo New Tales Players: You're the Chosen hero (spoilers) that battle the evils of the world with your interesting assortment of friends. There's some intersting ways the game deals with some politics though the shine of Tales games are it's characters not as much with the story. Not that it isn't interesting though.\n\nTL;DR: Uhh, it wasn't too long, I don't think I need to add anything much here, though if I must, Boom bam, powers, friendship, done.\n\nConclusion: This is a game worth getting in my opinion. Old Tales Players will find that the combat in particular starts out simplistic and bland but keeping to it will later yield some ways of playing that may vary form other Tales and gives a interesting insight on how later installments may have for us. Newer Players will find the Story a little slow and might become bored of the battle system early on. To them I urge them to do their research on the game. See if you'd like how the game is played and how systems appeal to you. If you aren't sure of what you see, wait for it to go on sale. To those who already bought it keep to it. It's a long ride and it takes a long while before it starts getting good.\nTo Both: Do your research. The game does have some bugs that may have something to do with your hardware. If all else fails, wait for a new patch that might have a fix for you. This game is wonderful and it'd be a waste for you to not enjoy it.","October 21, 2015","true","65.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

It reminds me of JRPG titles such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. On top of the classic JRPG components, Tales of Zestiria added some new elements, such as narratives, customization, and a polished battle system.\n\nStory: The story moves at a pretty nice pace and keeps you engaged. A lot of characters interaction, as well as dynamic events happening in the world around you.\n\nMusic: Beautiful BGM. The Japanese voice acting is great as well.\n\nArt style: Great designs. A lot of details on the characters and the surrounding world.\n\nBattle system: The battle system feels a bit awkward at first, and may take some time to get used to. Overall, the battle system keeps the battle at a fast pace with nice flashy effects.\nOne downside though is that the battles feel a little bit too easy; most of the battles can be won by smashing the buttons. For that reason, I really recommend setting the difficulty to high when you're comfortable.\n\nTL:DR: Great story, music, characters, and polished battle system. However the gameplay is not very challenging. If you are a hardcore RPG fan, you may be disappointed by the easiness of the game. That being said, I still really enjoy my time playing Tales of Zestiria; and I would definitely recommend it.\n\nA good pick-up for any JRPG fan. It is also a good entry title for people new and trying to get into JRPG. However, don't get it if you're looking for a challenging hardcore RPG experience.","October 25, 2015","true","6.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

I thought Symphonia was excellent. I remember Destiny and Vesperia being pretty good. Sadly, Zestiria was a disappointment for me. I didn't start to enjoy it until about 20 hours in when I decided to change the difficulty setting, as I felt the fights were too easy. I would have quit were it not for the combat, as everything else was severely lacking. I wanted to like the game because I have faith in the Tales series, but I found myself pushing for the end just to see what would happen with the story. My feelings after completion of the game can be summed up as "oh" and "that's it?"\n\nPROS:\n\n• Abilties that look and sound cool when executing; you feel strong in battle.\n• Various difficulty settings that can be changed at any time and make defeating bosses feel sufficiently challenging.\n• Good music.\n• The Japanese voiceovers are good.\n\nCONS:\n\n• Very weak and predictable story with no twists. It had potential but felt like an idea rather than a fully developed plot. You are left with many questions and no answers.\n• Characters are flat and don't feel genuine. You are told insead of shown who they are.\n• The villains are a joke and have little to no backstory or motivation.\n• Cringy, forced, repetitive dialogue.\n• Camera issues while in combat.\n• Copy and paste dungeons with little to no puzzles.\n• Constantly shown the same tutorial messages even when you are halfway through the game.\n• Repetitive actions, such as reading monolith stones, which give you the same tutorials previously mentioned.\n• Convoluted equipment/crafting system.\n• Optional content/side quests can be completed very quickly and don't add much to the story. You still don't know who the characters are or learn anything compelling about the world. It feels rushed and insincere, just as the main story does.\n• No incentive to play the NG+ Just more grinding through a vast but lifeless realm.\n\nTales of Berseria looks promising, though it is a prequel to Zestiria.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/clessaileron/recommended/351970/","clessaileron","Cless Aileron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/clessaileron/","247 products in account","So, I've been around the block with the Tales series since 1999 after playing Tales of Destiny. With the series constantly hanging around the Playstation consoles while also having some appearances on Nintendo systems and one appearance on the Xbox 360, a PC version of a Tales game was something I thought would never happen. But here I am reviewing the first Tales game to appear on Steam. If anything, the game itself, while flawed, isn't as bad as people made it out to be, particularly during the original Japanese PS3 release of it, and as a PC port, does put its best foot forward despite some issues.\n\nThe Tales series isn't really known for pushing system specs to the limit, but the visuals do have a vibrant look to them with small details of leaves blowing in the wind in the fields.\n\nWith the music of Graces & the two Xillia games, I did feel like Motoi Sakuraba was pretty much phoning it in for those installments. Zestiria was a huge improvement in the music department this time thanks to Go Shiina contributing tracks alongside Sakuraba. While I actually hold the unpopular opinion that Go Shiina's previous soundtrack contribution to the series, Tales of Legendia, isn't really all that great, his talent really shines for me this time with some great dungeon music.\n\nThe story had some controversy because of how one particular character was handled. After seeing it for myself, it was nothing to really freak out about. The story itself, for better or worse, does follow typical Tales quality (I did enjoy it though). The character are likable and engaging, though it's also on the typical Tales quality, for better or worse.\n\nNow, for the highlight of the series, its real time battle system. It's like a simplified fighting game, moving the character, linking attacks together to combo the enemy in real time movement. This time, the battles are done on the same exploration screen. However, there's issues with the camera, specifically if the area you're in battle at happens to be a narrow corridor. The camera will be too zoomed in for you to assess the battle field until you move into a better location. There's no way to rotate the camera during the battle (the best you get would be in the menu). It's not enough to condemn the game, but it's going to be an issue at certain times. The battle system is still as fun as ever as you combo the enemies to grind for experience & money.\n\nAs far as the PC port is concern, I'll deal with the elephant in the room and say that it's a bummer that it was locked at 30 FPS but I was able to live with it. Outside of that, the port does have the graphics tweaking option that is supposed to be there, along with keyboard & mouse support to the point where you can navigate the menu using the mouse cursor.\n\nOverall, the game was not as bad as it was made out to be. The story is pretty much not high literature and can be enjoyable alongside the characters with the typical Tales quality. The battle system still shines as bright as it ever has despite some issues. If you can handle that this PC port locked the framerate at 30, I can still give this a recommendation.\n\nWelcome to PC gaming, Tales series.","November 4, 2015","true","141.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I may not be the most hardcore tales fan, only playing through it on the default difficulty and found that i only died if i was making big mistakes on how to approch the battle.\n\nI found the story to be good but very slow to pick yp steam (like 6-8 hours) and it kept on picking up steam for the rest of the game, never stalling. Graphically it is very impressive for the hardware demands, make sure you have Vsync on though otherwise you may puke. I never used the KBM and opted to use a Xbox one controller instead and everything worked fine, all actions were rebindable on the pad (i switched A and B around) and found it played very well\n\nSome negatives of the game have to be the plot holes that, while they don't change the story much, are a huge oversight and could be explained away with questionable assumtions. The game uses the immeiate area around you for battles so if you run into something in a door way or while near a cliff, the camera can get wonky trying to place itself between the object and your charecter. The Fusion system for items i found was overcomplicated and needed use of external reading to even try to understand, i ignored it for the most part. just fusing items of the same name together for increased stats and managed fine.\n\noverall i would say this is a good game if you are a tales fan, not the best, not the worst. If you are new i would suggest waiting for Symphonia's port if you want to play on PC, or playing one of the older titles to get into the seris.\n\ni would rate the game a 8/10","November 5, 2015","true","38.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I'm a fan of the Tales of franchise, so I was excited to play this game. After giving this game some time I've noticed lots of points to know.\n\nAs a Tales of game the story starts off rather strong and becomes rather weak around the middle to end. They take their time investing your interest into the initial main heroine just so that they could kick her out of the party and add her later on as optional DLC. You spend time getting to like her and she just leaves without question.. No one tries to stop her..\n\nAs for gameplay, the worst part is the camera angles.. The game doesn't feel as fluid as most other tales of games.. Normally the game lets me know if an enemy is able to block or tank hits or if they are vulnurable to attack, this game is kind of a coin flip. One big defect is the frequent copy paste monsters..\n\nAll in all, I'd play it, I don't know if I would recommend it to other people who havent played any of the games in the franchise though. I look forward to future tales releases though.

To put it in context, I feel Abyss had the best Tales story by far. Haters gonna hate on the pacing, but that game had a good story.\n-Battle camera in dungeons is blasphemy\n-Open world is a great idea...but feels too empty at times (and it costs a ton of money to fast travel!)\n\nEven though I've recently lost interest in any JRPG that doesn't start with "Xeno" (free fast travel in a vibrant world: yes please) It's great to see more JRPGs on Steam, and I enjoyed Zestiria overall. I'd recommend it to any fan of the series.","November 25, 2015","true","57.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","6","6","4","0"

With that out of the way, I can honestly say I was blown away by this game.\n\nI really had miminal expectations before playing this game - but I gotta hand it to Bandai Namco, this game is a great way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the "Tales of" series.\n\nReview - SPOILER FREE:This game starts out kinda slow - actually not kinda, but really slow, but after playing for a couple of hours while you gather all the party members, this game picks up huge steam and goes with that awesome pace up until the end.\n\nStory:The story starts like it's gonna be one of those happy go stories of let's save the world! but the deeper you delve into the game the darker it becomes while still maintaining a lot of fun moments. The story holds well with good backround lore of the characters.\n\nSpeaking of characters, the cast of this game is really great, the interaction between all the main characters is awesome, especially Edna - what a great and funny character.\nBut not limited to Edna, all the characters are fleshed out and great.\nThe game is filled with fun dialogue in the form of "skits", a mainstay of "Tales of" games. The game makes great use of cinematics, both in-game engine and also thhe well animated cutscenes.\n\nThe game is full of moments that make you genuinely smile, while other will make you genuinely tear up. This was only possible because of the well written characters.\n\n\nMusic:In my opinion, having played 4 games in the series, this game has the best OST of any of them. What a beautifully made soundtrack.\nBattles have nice BGM that will pump you up, Boss battles have their own too - but one AWESOME song plays in one of the final battles that really cemented this series as the best soundtrack.\nDungeons have good BGM, but what truly shines is the BGM of the Trial Dungeons which are masterfully done.\n\nCombat:As in any Tales game, the combat is what truly shines. Developed by Namco Bandai, the Advanced Battle System (ABS) is an action based combat that let's you freely move in the battlefield while using combos to fight.\nThe abilities in this game are categorised as Martial Artes, Hidden Artes and Seraphic Artes - these abilies make the basis of the Battle System.\n\nAlso, this game has a fusion system where 2 characters can fuse in battle to gain hightened battle abilities. In addition, all characters have a finisher move that does massive damage called "Mystic Artes".\nthere are 5 elements in this game - Fire, water, wind, earth, and physical. All enemies have specific weaknesses and resistances to these elements - in order to win boss battles and harder enemies, you need to exploit these weaknesses.\n\nConclusion:In addition to the massive content, I'm 58 hours in and still have plenty of optional bosses and dungeons to complete and even a New Game+ for people who are into that.\nAll these elements make this game a great addition to the fabled "Tales of" line-up.","December 17, 2015","true","62.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vitiel/recommended/351970/","vitiel","Poxni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vitiel/","175 products in account","I'm so glad the "Tales of" franchise has been finally hitting Steam, starting off with what may now be my favorite entry in the series.\n\nThere's a lot of good game design nuance found in Zestiria, with a lot of game mechanics flowing into each other nicely. A lot of these elements aren't throwaway; utilizing every tool you're given leads to a lot of success and satisfaction, unlike a lot of things that I didn't see the need to bother with in past Tales games. There aren't any forced tutorials that are long-winded; any in the game are quickly handled, with a lengthy record and lexicon for players who really wish to sink their teeth in. The armatization ability does get pretty overpowered, sadly. There's also a handful of slipups outside of battle like the obnoxious Water Trial.\n\nWith some fixes, the game runs at a groovy 60FPS, always welcome for a high action game like this. I enjoyed a lot of the nice, fairly open environments compared to past games as well. The way hopping into battle works, directly from where you are in the world, lends to occasional camera problems in combat (and even worse when playing with multiple players). I've found that Zesteria packs the best soundtrack the series has had in quite a while. The story is okayish, par enough with recent Tales games, but like those, the party's interactions is where the series shines.\n\nOverall, Zestiria has my recommendation and I hope for future successes from this series on Steam. Too bad how Symphonia turned out, but that's a different story.","April 6","true","187.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

On high end rigs, and with the mod, it runs at 2160p supersampling 60fps on fairly high powered systems without a hitch. The keyboard controls are never ideal for this type of game but god damn they tried and it shows. No advanced rendering options, but Tales games are always about the art style graphically, not the BLEEDING EDGE GRAFIX!!!1one, it's mostly just LOD options.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty well put together. It's not standard Tales fare, it's a janky beast of its own. Skill won't win the day here, you'll have to overprepare due to the amount of jank and lack of polish. Armitization, dualizing with the spirit characters, eliminates all but the highest levels of difficulty, then the game throws the party systems to the wind at interspersed spots through the game taking the crap from under you.\n\nThe story, oh god the story. Don't even bother. A strong start belies a rampant case of Author Tract. Rose goes from being a mild annoyance to an actual main character. I'm not kidding. Hideo Baby, it's reported, trainwrecked his own story because he got a raging katana over Rose's voice actor, turning the once actually-well-nuanced stories of Tales games into Rose's Mary Sue Adventures featuring Sorey the ♥♥♥♥boy (Who the ♥♥♥♥ Is Alisha Edition). The localization gets amazingly bad and disjointed later on, having people sound like they're having two halves of a conversiation and hinting at things that aren't even relevant concepts.\n\nGo Shiina and Motoi Sakuraba put their heads together for standard Tales over-orchestration for the battle themes, sounding entirely more grand than the next batch of mooks to fight. It's a welcome return to form.\n\nIf you're a Tales fan, prepare to cringe hard. If you're here for the PC port, there's a lot to love with its flaws. Tentatively recommended.","March 29","true","69.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This is all an adventure which you may have seen before, and as such, begins with a sword in a stone. Once removed, the questionable spirit guides the schizophrenic shephard as he tends to his lambs- I mean people; and when questions are asked, she dodges with "how nice the weather is" or "look at that pretty butterfly".\n\nHe soon discovers that to create a sanctuary in the first zone, he has a meeting\nwith a priest, right after he gets payed for treatment, in the middle of the street, in squatting positions.\n\nHe then gets holy water blessed by his devoted ice mage who randomly produces ice cream with his talents, and a once underwhelming snake boss angel guy, to bless the land once more.\n-So that he may once again pay money to teleport between save points!\n\nLike all Tales of games: so many plot devices railroad me! Rocks procariously placed, the inability to jump, and invisible walls, I may as well be playing train simulator at this point.\n\nI soon am guided to a round table, after I pull a sword from a stone.\nMight be just me but im noticing some odd similarities here.\n\nIn these areas why are there so many open spaces with nothing in them, like in the first dungeon there are these room that are utterly empty except a bat or two to fight.\nWhat were the builders thinking when the architects told them to make it so?\n"Ey baws, you sure you don't want anythin in here?"\n"Aye, we can just stick some bats here and there, no one will question it"\n-Room Complete!

It really is a fun game if you're looking for it and another great game if you're a "tales of" fan like I am.

Gorgeous & immersive scenery all through the game.\nBrilliant storyline and memorable, relatable characters.\nSave points are everywhere, and fast-travel between them (once unlocked) is very helpful.\nQuick-save feature available anytime. (Except for when you're standing in a doorway, oddly enough.)\nThere are very few (if any) "limited window" objectives you can miss. I always found I was able to go back and do something / get something if needed, and never had to revert to a prior save file.\nA character attribute (once unlocked) lets you speed up travel through the world & dungeons.\nWonderfully animated, both in the 3D scenes and drawn character cut-scenes.\nMusical score is magnificently beautiful, setting the audiable ambience for every single experience in utterly perfect fashion. The composer(s) should be nominated for the highest awards, and given expensive top-shelf cocktails upon demand. Absolutely above-par for any "Tales of" series game .... holy s**t, I cannot express my eargasm pleasure enough here.\nOutstanding voice-acting, and PLENTY of amusing akward moments (and some toucing ones, too) between the characters. Excellent humor and comic relief at all the right times.\nEquipment & items can be traded for points toward valuable geographic region perks, rather than having to battle-grind to earn the points.\nMultiple of the same piece of equipment can be "fused" multiple times to create a stronger piece of equipment.\nENORMOUS variety of equipment! Almost too much so if you don't periodically fuse equipment or clean-out your inventory.\nNo "carry limit" on variety of different items in your inventory. (Although you are limited to 15 of each kind of item.)\nHerbs (which improve various character attributes) are located all over the world, and will re-spawn in the same places after a duration of time.\nChests can re-spawn once the required "boon" (perks for geographic regions of the game) is obtained\nGetting side-quests involves simply talking to your companion: Although you sometimes must talk to NPCs to get the sidequest, the NPCs are clearly marked on the mini-map and your companion drops reasonably good hints to where you need to go next. No bulletin-boards or guilds to travel to.\nCurrent main objective is shown on the map screen so you don't forget what to do.\nNo rediculously-difficult storyline bosses or enemies. If you get stuck, you can simlpy change the difficulty level in-game via the settings menu.\nKatz village!\nGRIPES: In-battle control is 97% responsive, and 3% quirks: 1) There are times the character doesn't "lock on" to run toward the targetted enemy as expected. 2) Pressing a direction immediately after targetting an enemy can inadvertently change the target. 3) There is an understandable delay between combos, BUT any button presses during that delay get ignored instead of queued. I got used to it, but having queued actions would've been nicer.\nThe in-game tutorial is provided for by large stone "monoliths" found throughout the world and in dungeons. The explanations that come from them (although funny at times) tend to be overly-elaborate and sometimes intimidating, despite the explained concepts being relatively simple.\nThe concepts behind the puzzles aren't really anything new.\nThe "skill sheet" is confusing, immensely frustrating to comprehend, infuriating to TRY to comprehend, and annoying when you finally learn it's not critical to building highly-capable characters.\nThere's one (and thankfully ONLY one) particular dungeon which isn't well explained, and the penalty for springing a trap is truly rage-quit worthy, controller-throwing and all. Not so bad once it's figured out, but up until then... ugh.\nNo mini-games or gambling houses.\nNo opportunity to develop a love-interest with another game character, and the main character is entirely ambiguous in this regard.\n"Petrify" status cannot be cured, PERIOD. :-(\nFast-travel can be prohibitively expensive.\nSTUPID CRASH BUG: If your system's audio sample-rate is set above 48000 Hz, Tales of Zestiria will crash on startup at the language-select menu. To fix, simply go into Sound > Properties > Advanced in Windows, and set the "Default Format" to 48000 Hz, either 16-bit or 24-bit...  but it's a really stupid bug no less.\nThe point of the "Normin" system was completely lost on me, and added yet more complexity I didn't care for. (Note: Even so, you should absolutely collect the Normins!)\nI found the ending just plain disappointing. Easy boss, long credits, and only a short bit of epilogue: IMO, it's not nearly what the characters nor memorable NPCs of this game deserved.","January 17","true","133.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Saya sendiri cukup menaruh ekspektasi besar pada seri ini.\n\nCerita (7/10)\nBercerita tentang Sorey, manusia yang dibesarkan oleh kaum seraphim. ToZ berpusat pada petualangan Sorey & para seraphim mengalahkan hellion yang disebabkan oleh malevolence dan sumber malevolence, Lord of Calamity.\n\nCerita ToZ sangat berpusat pada Sorey sebagai karakter utama, namun karakter Sorey sendiri terasa kurang di-explore. Hanya karakter Edna & Zaveid yang terasa begitu unik, selebihnya terlalu generic. Hubungan antar karakter pun minim konflik & emosi, pusat cerita ini hanya 1, bagaimana mengalahkan LoC.\n\nAlur plot yang terasa datar, tidak ada yang dapat membuat kita merasa excited kecuali saat menjelang akhir cerita.\n\nNamun di antara itu semua? Hal yang paling tidak bisa diterima sebagian besar fans adalah karakter Alisha yang begitu banyak dipromosikan lewat berbagai media, bahkan dijadikan anime, pada akhirnya akan meninggalkan party kita secara permanen di sekitar 10% awal progress cerita. Untuk apa? Cuma untuk menguatkan konsep cerita.\n\nSatu yang menarik adalah skit dialog yang muncul di saat2 tertentu yang dapat menutup plot hole pada cerita utama. Banyak scene yang bisa di-unlock setelah mengalahkan optional boss tertentu yang mampu menjelaskan sisi lain karakter & cerita pendukung. Beberapa cukup lucu dan menghibur, mengingat cerita utama ToZ cukup 'dark'.\n\nGrafis (6/10)\nToZ ini berasal dari port PS3 yang merupakan engine lama. Tidak ada yang luar biasa di sisi grafis.\n\nBerita 30 fps lock cukup membuat banyak orang tidak mau menghabiskan uang untuk beli game ini, apalagi kaum yang merasa game di pc 30 fps = bad port. Untungnya tak lama kemudian muncul ToZ fix yang membuat game ini dapat berjalan smooth pada 60 fps. Saya sendiri hampir selalu memainkan ToZ pada 30 fps & merasa ini bukan masalah.\n\nSatu2nya masalah ada pada kamera & point of view saat battle yang menyebalkan bahkan terkadang susah diatur.\n\nGameplay (8/10)\nBanyak sekali yang bisa kita explore di sisi gameplay.\nDari segi battle, berbeda dengan seri2 sebelumnya, dengan adanya konsep manusia & seraphim, kita bisa melakukan armatize yang merupakan penggabungan (fusion) manusia & seraphim. Stat kedua karakter akan dijumlahkan (HP, BG, Atk dll). Party terdiri atas 2 manusia & 2 seraphim, namun jika Sorey sendirian, maka hanya 1 seraphim yang bisa bertarung bersamanya.\n\nAdanya skill yang dipasangkan pada equipment (senjata, armor, aksesoris dll). Dengan menyusun skill tersebut menjadi G-Union, E-Union & Stack akan memberikan bonus skill yang dapat mengubah karakter dengan stat pas2an menjadi begitu overpowered, sehingga kita bisa menyusun strategi melawan boss tertentu dengan kombinasi skill yang tepat.","January 31","true","192.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Because there was a time where I got bored with it after like 8 hours and stopped touching it then I suddenly went back to it for another 50+ hours.\n\nNow. Was it fun? Hmm...I'd say yes. I did indeed have some fun with the game which is way I was able to play through the full story.\n\nUnfortunetely that was one of the reasons it fell short for me.  The story was really quite weak. It was a pretty generic chosen one affair.\n\nSome optional bosses gave me a feeling of challenge as you could juggle them pretty well but they could be monsterously hard hitters. Knocking my allies and me down with a single hit half of the time meaning that I had to get very, very comfortable with the defence and dodging mechanics which made beating them feel like an actual challenge and made victory all the sweeter.\n\nUnfortunetely I can't say the same for the story bosses. At all. In comparison they were expremely weak.\n\nBut those low points didn't hurt it enough  for me to not enjoy it enough to play.\n\nBut it does stop me from recommending it at full price.\n\nIf you get it on sale, go for it.

The gameplay is solid, and lets you slowly ramp up the difficulty by playing the highest available for a certain amount of time, until you find your sweet spot.\n\nYou can even turn it into practically a visual novel hybrid, as you can set the game to auto-play battles with suprising efficiency, so you can sit back and watch the action and enjoy the anime-esque banter.","May 13","true","169.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzkniso/recommended/351970/","uzkniso","Uzkniso o.o","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uzkniso/","96 products in account","After just finishing the game, which took me 240+ hours, I thought I'll write a review.\n\nStory, plot, characters\nThe story is fairly generic. I mean, you're a hero, born for one single purpose - to fight evil.\nThere aren't that many plot twists and main character(s) are mostly teenagers.\nStill, I loved all of the main cast. The great part is that they all have strong personalities, and funny stuff happens when they clash. Expect to hear lots of funny convos. Serious ones, too.\nThere's sidequests too, which are pretty important. They aren't fetch quests. They are mostly "go beat that big bad monster" quests. They're important, because of their rewards. Seriously, you don't want to miss them!\n\nLeveling, loot, difficulty\nIt doesn't take long to level up characters and learn new skills. I am not entirely sure, but I think you will have all skills by the time you reach level 50, or around that level.\nIt might not seem like there's a lot of skills in the game, but I think it's a good amount.\nThing is, that if there were more of them, then the game might need a whole different system.\nThere's also titles, which give various bonuses to your character(s), which you unlock in various ways.\nLoot is hard to get, while you don't have drop rate boosts. Once you get those - it becomes a lot easier getting stuff, which you want.\nThere are also exp boosts, which you can get after finishing the game for the 1st time. It can go as high as 6 times the exp.\nMax level is 200 and getting there isn't hard, I would say, because I was still gaining levels at endgame. I finished the game at around level 136.\nThe last difficuly and the hardest one, is called "chaos". Unfortunately, it just increases monster level, damage, hp ... All that stuff. The monsters won't act any smarter, or whatever. They will just be more annoying. Fortunately, you can get the best loot in this difficulty, so it's worth fighting with this setting, if you can handle it.\nThe difficulty of the game depends on how well geared you are. I had a lot of things on +99, so I managed to beat the final boss on chaos difficulty.\n\nSummary in Pros + and Cons - format\n+ Nice art, anime-style movies\n+ Interesting story, just not one-of-a-kind\n+ Interesting characters, all with their bright personallities\n+ Good skill and leveling system\n+ Each weapon features unique design\n+ Nice selection of difficulty settings\n+ Lots of boss monsters, all with different behaviors\n+ Interesting and new "Lords of the Land" system\n+ New game plus option with lots of cool features\n\n- If you want to get great gear with +99 fusion and 3x skills, then prepare to grind. A LOT.\n- Linear story-telling might not appeal to some\n- While you progress thru the story, some areas get locked out and you can't backtrack, for some time\n- The ally AI might be hard to get used to, and setting it up might take some time\n- The battle camera will annoy you, when you will fight in tight spaces\n\nWorth buying?\nIt's worth buying, if:\n\n- you're looking for a new experience. I would say, that, not many games offer such an experience amongst current steam games\n- you like anime","December 17, 2015","true","499.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/recommended/351970/","poopybutts","Andem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poopybutts/","618 products in account","if you like JRPGs, this game takes the flaws of the genre and multiplies them by 2. There is ENDLESS dialogue for hours and it is not interesting. Most of it is just explaining what you just heard over and over. The characters are absolutely boring. The story is the laziest I've ever seen. There is "malevolence" in the world and you have to cleanse it. Malevolence is literally just evil. No one is held accountable for their own actions because if they do anything bad, it was just malevolence. There are humans and Seraphim, but Seraphim are just humans with some powers that humans can't see and apparently can never do anything wrong and it's always the human's fault.\n\nFor a game about saving the world and being heroes, the characters are all strangely judgemental and elitist. There was a horrible sidequest about following some stupid kids around (which is literally just walking around a small town and listening to 10 minutes of cutscene and barely any animation) and seeing if they're stealing from people because someone told them to. It turns out they were just stealing because they were!! So the game gives you an option. Send them to the knights and imprison them?? Or not?? I chose not to. So apparently that means going up to the kids and saying how evil they are. The kids are like "YEAH SO WHAT WE HAVE NO WAY OF FEEDING OURSELVES" and then the main characters just call the god damn knights any way and send them to a prison or whatever. These characters have no real empathy and don't seem to know how to react like even KIND OF normal human beings to situations.\n\nOkay, so the story sucks, the characters suck, what about the gameplay? I could have let it off the hook, but no, the camera is the absolute worst I've ever seen. Especially if you are playing in multiplayer. I mean it when I say I've never seen a worse camera in a video game. It gets STUCK inside walls, as in you cannot move it out, and you are very often looking at a twitching mess staring at a monsters ♥♥♥. Nintendo 64 games had set up better cameras for 3D\n\nNot only with the camera, but the game rewards you for spamming. I know, I know, a lot of the other Tales games rewarded you for it as well, but this one takes it to a new level. All you do is armatize (basically fuse with a party member) and you will be put in a super form with MUCH much less moves. With almost every form, its best to just spam the spell casting abilities. They do absolutely huge damage and huge AOE and constantly stun the bosses and monsters. Sure, you could try just not doing that, right? But then you're at a huge disadvantage. The monsters tend to flinch way less, most of your moves are not very big aoes, and just are not very strong in general. Basically, every battle goes like this. See what weakness it has. Armatize to that weakness. Then just press your strongest spell over and over till the battle is done. Try to do it without armatizing, and its gonna take a lot longer or just not even be possible. It's just not balanced at all.\n\nI haven't even gotten to the dungeon design. Oh the dungeon design is so, soooooo lazy. Most of it is just completely empty hallways with copy pasted rooms that have absolutely no detail in them. You'll go through caves that look exactly the same, except this cave is blue. You'll go through dungeons and find yourself getting lost because every room looks exactly the same and you have no landmarks to look to. There is absolutely no excuse for this. Previous tales of games, (vesperia, abyss, even symphonia) had better design and better puzzles. I'm not saying the previous games puzzles and dungeons were great, but the fact that this game somehow is WORSE than those is just sad. You're supposed to improve upon your games, not downgrade.\n\nOh, lets also not forget to mention the tons of worthless DLC. DLC costumes for a single player game. Beach costumes, that you used to just unlock in the old games for free, are now 7 dollars. A lot of it was just flat out day 1 DLC as well.\n\nOverall, as a fan of the olderish Tales games like Symphonia, Abyss (well I didn't hate it at least) and Vesperia, this game is just a huge disappointment. I wasn't expecting much from it honestly, and it still somehow turned out worse than I thought. This game is just a soulless, lazy, and greedy cash grab. There was no heart put into this, no effort. They just wanted to make money and pump out a Tales game as fast as possible.\n\nTL;DR. It's boring and bad. Even if you're a fan of tales games and JRPGS, find something better. Even the positive reviews for this game say it's the weakest game of the series so that must be saying something.","November 14, 2015","false","36.3"," 81 of 153 people (53%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","53","81","153","10","6"

(Upon playing 50 hours. It's not extremely deep, but fun)\n\nThe flaws to this game is mainly the lack of replayability and decisions.\n\nThis game constantly has NPC's say.. "Choose, do this or this"\nYou'd think this would mean you can make a decision that effects the story, but no.\nYour character makes that decision on his own. The developers basically mocking you with the fact that there's a decision, but it means jack ♥♥♥♥ to you.\n\nIn the first 50% of the game, there is only ONE decision YOU can make. That your character doesn't make for you.\nThis decision to either build a bridge and night, or day.\nIf you build it at day, people look at you funny for being so powerful, then the same cutscene plays from if you built it at midnight exactly.\nThis decision effects nothing ingame.\n\nYou can argue that the game isn't about decisions, but then the game shouldn't clearly represent a decision to you as if thay planned to add ingame decisions, but rushed it out instead of making the decisions actually be in the game. None of the other Tales of games gave you these fake, illusions of decisions. It's only this game and it's horrible.\n\nNOW. To anyone who says "This game isn't about decisions, yada yada yada"\n\nThe game CLEARLY makes it apear you are making decisions. The game clearly depicts choice and that your character needs to choose to do something, how ever you don't get to make the decision at all. This is probably due to a rushed game. Why else would NPC's literally tell you to decide between two options CONSTANTLY, only to have there not be a real choice.\n\nThere was one decision in the entire game, fix a bridge at night or day (Keeping spoilers out of this) Literally, choosing to do it right away in daylight adds 3 seconds to a cutscene. The same cutscene you'd see at night with different lighting. The end.\n\nThis game is fun, but disappoint as all hell with decisions MOCKING you with their existence, not allowing your input on what happens.\n\nI will also bring up a very random sidenote.\n\nThe 3d models ingame are often hit or miss. The main protaganists walk animation makes him look extremely constipated. (Look it up, you'll have a really good laugh)\n\nThe main character is easily the worst model in the game.\n\nThe 3d models of npc's all over the game aren't animated. In cities there are 100's of npcs that dont even have idle or breathing animations. They are dolls.","November 5, 2015","false","50.3"," 41 of 76 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","41","76","4","4"

This is a tough one.  This is a solid RPG no doubt, with some really interesting characters, and decent combat.  But in no way does this game compare to some of the Tales games that came before it.  Here are the Tales games I beat prior to this:\n\nTales of Legendia\nTales of Symphonia\nTales of Vesperia\nTales of Graces F\n\nSo what are the issues?  Let's start with the camera angle in battles.  This can be absolutely annoying sometimes because you might not even be able to see Sorey or anything at all.  Second the final boss, phase 2, seems a lot on the cheap side, and warrants the cheap way you're going to beat him.  Also the dungeons are very basic, the puzzles are non existent mostly.  Lastly the story is weak.  I mean there's elements that are interesting, but where other Tales games really excel at story telling, this one is pretty plain.\n\nI still recommend.

Between leveling lords of the land, improving my relationship with shop and innkeepers I'm kept pretty busy, let's not forget the insanity chaos mode brings. While the game is interesting plotwise the first time around it can get repetitive on a second run, well even the first run can too, since you get abilities later in game to help you overcome obstacles in older dungeons, even backtracking in quite a few cases.\n\nThat being said theres plenty to keep you busy, I personally loved the skits (especially Edna and Meebo) the fusion system is a bit tricky to grasp at first but you can find guides online, (Also fixes for things like the 30 fps lock) I can't be bothered to do that myself though.\n\nThe only things I'm inconvienced by are the camera angles sometimes in dungeons, and the fact I have to see tutorial messages after my second playthrough. other than that I have quite a blast with Sorey the demon lord and his demonically dressed minions Seraph friends. I love the fashion system.\n\n\n\n\n\ncouple of tips if you get this\n\n- use free & free under battle options so you can move around any direction during a fight.\n\n- before you do new game+ get lords of the land as high as you can, typically 3-4k grade wise on the ng+ page to get all\nthe glorious boons for your second playthrough. It's a huge difference.\n\n- don't throw away the 10 damage/armor joke items, You can carry them over when you sanctify with boons.\n\n- There is a Alisha DLC after you beat the game. Along with a bonus dungeon before the final boss only appears after game completion.\n\n\nThis game is probably best to pick up on a sale, although I don't regret purchasing it at full price, my first tales game but a great experience. (except for the damn water trial) I hate that one oh so much.","May 12","true","135.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I don't fully get the negative reviews for this game. This game has some pretty good humour, both from skits and ingame happenings. That's something that I don't see that much in any other Tales game I played before. The battle system is great, as you can switch out characters during battle. Previously you would likely choose your 4 favourite characters and left the rest to rot in the party, now you can use all of them swiftly, so no obsolete characters. The characters are what I expect them to be, the weapon system is also a nice addition to the game. Overal, I think it's a great game. And for a PC port, it does pretty well.","April 11","true","25.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a good solid game although I would have liked to wait for it to go down in price, I don't think it is worth a new game price.\n\nI have played a few of the Tales games, although by no means all of them, and I enjoy the series. This game mostly lived up to its name, although it feels like it is diverging a little from its original formula. It feels a lot darker and more political than the others, although all Tales games have an edge to them. There is a lot more running around collecting things and backtracking, some of which can get repetitive, where the others have felt a lot more linear up until the end. However, it is still as epic and story driven as the others. The music is okay but some of it felt too ambient and subtle, where I prefer more traditional JRPG music (a problem I also had with Graces at times). The battle system is mostly the same sort of thing but felt a little more awkward than the previous games. Strangely, I found this game easier to control with a keyboard and mouse than a gamepad, despite it being from a long line of console RPGs. The button mashing feels smoother with a mouse. Then again, the series is slowly changing anyway and at least they kept a lot of the important things, like the Katz!\n\n","April 14","true","55.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Where should I start first?\nThis game, Tales of Zestiria, was definitely one of the weakest titles I've played so far.\nI expected it to be all improved and much more ways to explore the Tales world, but I'm afraid that's not It.\n\nThe characters were all nice and all, but the lack of skits, which we all know that plays a major part in every Tales game, killed everything in me. I loved the designes of the environment, characters, etc. and not getting to take a closer look at them made me incredibly sad. This is one big mistake this time.\nThe combat was pretty easy, yeah (for me at least), but that has never troubled me. There are different game difficulties, after all. It was a new kind of gameplay and I actually enjoyed it quite a lot. It was very interesting and lovely.\n\nThe story was fine but there was a big portion of missing parts and we all wanted to know about it. The ending of Zestiria was just??? (more like Tales of Guess(tiria)...\n\nAnd the biggest thing i dislike is when they try to recycle areas on every Tales game. Tales of Graces F reminds me so damn much of Zestiria, holy cows!\n\nBut anyway... If you are a big fan of Tales titles and you feel the need to conquer every possible Tales out there... Just DO IT!!!\nIt's not that bad as people may think it is. It's totally fine and nice, but nothing spectacular and big.

Being a JRPG fan, I was afraid the game would be too short or have other types of limitations. Quickly finding myself proven otherwise, I was really stoked at what the game had in store.\n\n+ Overall a great PC port. Very much playable with keyboard and mouse, though I use my 360 controller out of preference.\n+ A decent storyline that is not too overly complicated to follow. It's nothing spectacular or groundbreaking, though it was engaging enough to keep me playing.\n+ The characters are also really good, maybe somewhat static at times but I enjoyed them. They were what made the story keep flowing as well as it did. The interactions between them are really nice as well.\n+ A pleasant cell shaded artstyle that's quite easy on the eyes. Personally, I really loved it as the anime fan I am. Some places look really good, and I loved exploring caves and forests alike.\n+ An astonishing soundtrack. Sometimes, I found myself walking around without doing much progress just to listen to the music. That's not to speak about the trial dungeons, which I find to be exceptional. The OP too. Just remember to patch in the version with vocals.\n+ Solid gameplay, the combat is superb and rightly so as it's what made the game for me. However, the combat might not be for everyone. Look up some gameplay of it.\n+ Good replayability due to the skill system, I'll probably play through the game again on some higher difficulty to try some different options, but I don't think that's necessary to get the full experience.\n+ It's... Very long. Over a hundred hours and I've yet to beat the game, though I assume that's because I'm a tortoise when it comes to gaming. It wouldn't surprise me if you could beat it in 50h or so, probably less.\n\n- Camera in combat can be a bit clunky sometimes, especially in tight corridors.\n- The "open world" is somewhat lacking. You will find yourself running through empty large spaces quite often unless you want to spend money on fast travelling.\n- Level design could've been better. They look good, but are quite linear and don’t give much room for exploration as the map is fully lit and shows you where to go.\n- Minor occasional framedrops during combat.\n- The skill system is really complex, especially the forging part of it and knowing which skill is better for each character etc. After so long of playing, I'm still not completely sure how to properly craft the type of equipment I want.\n- Prepare to be bombarded with seemingly endless amounts of tutorials.\n\nTo sum it up, I can't say anything else but that I recommend this game. Everything just blends so well together and I found that the pros made me forget about the cons almost completely. I mean, who cares about crafting properly as long as you're having fun, right? I suppose one of the main things people will wonder about is the price, and yes, I can definitely say that it's worth it at full price. 49.99€ was a good deal as I got Symphonia as an added bonus, but even without that I personally think it's worth it. If you're still unsure, it might go on sale eventually.","November 15, 2015","true","153.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's very dull and lacks atmosphere and memorable places.\n- Side characters don't get almost any screen time and antagonists are easily the worst in the series.\n\nVerdict: It's still better than Dawn of the New World and Xillia 2.

I've played some Tales of Symphonia but never the whole game. I know a lot of fans of the "Tales" find Zestiria to be the low point of the series, but I found it quite enjoyable.\n\nThe story is about a world that has been plunged into chaos and darkness due to a lack of Shepherd. Not to be confused with Commander Shepherd from Mass Effect, although that would have made the game more interesting. Shepherds are people who can interact with beings known as Seraphs and purify evil beings known as Hellions. Basically they're the peacekeeper between humans and mythical things. You take control of Sorey, the new Shepherd, as he travel the land gaining Seraphs to help him to end the era of chaos. The story is fairly entertaining, although it can be a little slow to start off, but it start to pick up around the middle point.\n\nThe game play involve moving across a 3D open world. As you move across the map you will see enemies roaming about  and if you run into one you get put into battle scene. Basically in a battle, a small boundary is placed around the player and 4 of his party members until the enemies are defeated. The combat is a hack and slash, but with the gimmick of being able to merge with party members to use stronger attacks. Their are elements in this game, so as you can guess there is a rock-paper-scissor system in place for what type of attacks enemies are weak against. Combat feel good although just watch what level you and your party are. If you're too low then you'll find some enemies beating the tar out of you, but if you're too high then you'll find you're beating the tar out of the final boss.\n\nThe music felt right although don't try to ask me to remember any particular tracks, it just kinda blended into the background for me. The character english voices wasn't too bad (I've heard some horrible dubs before). The game really a good game, and I've no problem recommending this game anybody who is looking for a JRPG to play.","January 21","true","58.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/unavailablelink/recommended/351970/","unavailablelink","Gulfoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/unavailablelink/","44 products in account","After finishing the game I've decided to put in additional thoughts and provide the perspective of someone who hasn't played any other recent Tales games. I didn't expect a lot about the game and by all means I enjoyed it, some points in this review people might disagree since some of them expects a lot and so on. Nevertheless, here are my thoughts:\n\n+Deep battle system, it does not encourage you to just mash buttons on your way to victory, which is true if you're playing in higher difficulties.\n+Skits are very entertaining and always a thing I look forward to.\n+Lots of character development among the main characters of the game and everyone is likeable in terms of personality. Some secondary characters also provided a huge part in the story.\n+Difficulty system rewards you with better drops and allows you to learn the battle system much faster.\n+There's still post game content once you've finished the game and lots of stuff gets unlocked once you start NG+\n+The music of the game was spectacular, mostly the music inside the trials.\n\n~ I'd stay neutral story-wise as it is a subjective matter on how you take the game, it feels lacking at some point on some characters but other than that it all made sense to me.\n\n- Equipment system is too complex and grindy. If you want to maximize the potential of the system, you need to grind a lot and I find it hard to maximize everything in your first playthrough it would be better if you try to maximize it on subsequent playthroughs.\n- Unless you're really good, some, if not most, battles forces you to use armatization since some monsters/bosses can kill your characters pretty easy. This happens most of the time on higher difficulties (Intense, Chaos) since the level of the enemies grow a lot and damage potential is increased.\n- Armatization can be abused to the point a battle can be very cheap. i.e. spamming a seraphic arte over and over until the enemies die.\n- Camera during battles becomes awkward when fighting in small corners as the camera gets zoomed in a lot to the point you can't see anything. A slight fix would be to use the "Free Walk" button to be able to see your character.\n- The AI of your allies doesn't really help you much in battle, yes, they die a lot for no reason. I find this very frustrating on some boss fights, even on some random encounters, since they tend to target your allies a lot or cast huge spells which your allies just tank. They also tend to split from armatization then die immediately afterwards even if you try to armatize them. In order to alleviate this, you have to micromanage everyone during fights to minimize the deaths and hope that they don't mess up everytime you switch into another character.\n\nGreat overall game, which you can play at your own pace (which I did), I finished my first playthrough by finishing all the sidequests and doing what I can to improve my equipment.","January 18","true","122.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I guess that makes this a more or less unbiased review in terms of series nostalgia, which may make it more or less appealing depending on who is reading it.\n\nI'll get straight to the point here -- this is my first ever review on Steam, and I am writing it exclusively to say that this game is amazing. Downright incredible. From the very start, it pulls you in with charming designs, likeable characters and interactions, and a battle system that feels unique, flexible, and interesting. And as you go along, this feeling never diminishes, even once. Steam doesn't seem to have clocked all of my hours since I played a good number of them offline, but I have been playing for a fairly good amount of time, and I am still marveling at the novelty of the characters, the exciting variety in the gameplay, and the beauty of the world built around everything this game has to offer.\n\nIf you enjoy action RPGs, I would say don't hesitate for even a second in picking up ToZ. If you enjoy story-driven games, DEFINITELY do not wait. ToZ is largely driven by a charming and engaging story which doesn't feel tedious or exhausting, largerly due to the characters it focuses on. If you like games purely for aesthetic reasons, you have a real charmer here, too, with exciting and gripping character and location designs.\n\nIn short: play Tales of Zestiria. It's wonderful, and you won't regret it.","January 15","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

For anyone else, if you're looking for effective story moments with likeable characters, satisfying battle mechanics and a vast world full of content to explore without minding some cheese and repetition, then you'll enjoy this game. The story in the Tales franchise never comes down to black and white, and while Zestiria doesn't really shine in the plot or the character department as well as some other Tales games, it does have some genuinely touchy moments as well as humorous ones through its course in common Tales fashion. The artstyle is also clean and vibrant, and the animated cutscenes by Ufotable are pleasing to watch.\n\nThe battle mechanics are a positive trademark of the Tales franchise, focusing on fast, action based real time combat that revolves around evading attacks and locking the opponents into combos by exploiting their weaknesses. It's easy to get into and hard to master, starting out extremely simple and then giving you more and more to work with, although you can also simply transform into a different form and murder everything without that much thought. Battle mechanics have been done better in a couple other Tales games, but Zestiria is still good at creating a system where skill plays a considerable enough role and beating bosses doesn't always have to come down to more grinding. There are also 5 different difficulty settings to work with starting out with 3, with harder difficulties yielding better drops.\n\nAs for the equipment system, you have 5 equipment slots with every equipment having 4 skill slots, and there are a total of 50 skills in this game that you can stack or combine in specific ways to create bonus effects. You get the skills you want by fusing copies of the same gear together, but getting those copies of gear with the specific skills you want before the fusion process is based too heavily on RNG and ends up being way more trouble than it's worth, so for the most part you'll just end up ignoring this whole mechanic, and fortunately it isn't needed in any way to make progress even on harder difficulties. Still, it's an unsatisfying aspect that will hopefully be executed better in the future, as it is a neat idea.\n\nThe world is split into several open overworld sections, towns, dungeons and fight arenas, with unique discovery points, collectibles and optional boss monsters to find in each separate area. The fight arenas are an exception however, as they seem to be designed mostly for equipment grinding. While there's a vast number of optional dungeons, they can be quite repetitive as they're all very similar with each other. Most of the main story related dungeons are fine though unless you're specificaly looking for clever design or complex puzzles, as there won't be much of that here.\n\nNew Game+ system is something that the franchise likes to give attention to, letting you earn points called Grade on your playthrough that you can use to buy bonuses and special traits for your next playthrough. Zestiria game has a new approach to this, letting you acquire guardian spirits called Lords of the Land for each town which you can then level up through battle performance and by offering them items, and the Grade you get after your playthrough is based on their levels. This process also unlocks other advantages, making it an interesting system, although one confusing aspect about it is  that the points used for leveling up the spirits are also called Grade despite having nothing to do with the actual Grade you get for NG+ bonus purchases.\n\nWhile Zestiria falls a bit short of where some other Tales games have set the bar, it's ultimately a good game if viewed as a standalone and as such I can recommend it to any RPG fan.","January 8","true","109.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The animations, character details and anime cutscenes are great, and smooth even at 30fps, framerate shouldn't be a problem. There is room for improvement for the environmental objects though.\n\nStory\n\nDefinitely not a strong point of this game. The story is quite plain and predictable, even though tales series games are usually more character-driven, they are just OK in this game. If you are not familiar with JRPG games you may find the story and/or characters unbearable even.\n\nGameplay\n\nI finished the game (and ALL sidequests) in 70 hours. However if you would like to collect things and be a completionist you'd definitely need more than that. There are a lot of customization options for your characters, battles and more, very high replayability as expected from a Tales game.\n\n","October 29, 2015","true","106.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There's only a little bit of stuttering with maxed out settings. All-in-all it's a very good first port of a Tales series to PC. It follows the Tales formula of innocent youth facing a harsh world that was popularised in Tales of Symphonia and overcoming adversity with the power of friendship (though not Tales of Graces f "FRIENDSHIP"). The characters are written very well and feel like they could be real people facing the struggles within the game.\n\nPros:\nConstant frame rate in battle. There have been no dropped frames inside battles.\nThere is different AI patterns based off of difficulty. I noticed this when I was fighting a certain boss earlier in the game. His attack patterns were more stragetic in trying to stagger me instead of just trying to attack through my combos.\nHumorous dialogue. A lot of the skits have been localised fairly well and feel like they keep the original tone.\nCons:\n30 FPS lock. Before this review is obliterated by the dislike button hear me out. There's noticeable input lag when trying to do big combos during the game. There are times where a combo should have been fired off but it winds up not happening because the input was received on the wrong frame. It is jarring to have this happen repeatedly in a fight where you need to be able to stun-lock/combo-lock your opponent. I really do hope that Tales of Symphonia on PC is not just a direct port of the PS3 version which is similarly locked at 30 FPS.\nLevel pacing. This may just be me playing on Moderate/Hard on my first playthrough but there is a crushing level spike with every new area. Where most of the level spike can be off-put by mastering the dodge system and having a lot of Battle Skills active, the level spikes make it feel like grinding is the answer to a lot of the progression problems.","October 31, 2015","true","103.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UpcomingDread/recommended/351970/","UpcomingDread","Maintain3d","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UpcomingDread/","113 products in account","WARNING SPOILERS\n\nGood game with enjoyable characters and fun yet tricky to master combat. On the downside the story was sort of all over the place and there was a serious lack in villians. Also I know the game is suppose to be about exploring ruins but come on every dungeon besides the trials looked the same and were a real bore to run through.\n\nCOMBAT\n\nCombat was a big plus though; being able to switch in and out Seraphims, while switching between characters on the fly is a blast which allows you to takes control of all six characters in a single fight (though you do need to unlock the battle skills first). the AI is pretty wonky like most Tales of games making it so switching between Sorey and Rose using the block + directional buttons a must unless you like seeing Rose get 1 shot in every boss fight. You can easily save Seraphims by switching them out to dodge attacks. The only real negative points I would give to the combat is camera getting stuck on walls/invisable walls and all the invinciblily frames on bosses where you can't damage them making you wait for whatever animation they are doing to end. If they wanted to give the bosses some breathing room I would suggest an instant knockback move or something.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nCharacters were a lot of fun always joking around and throwing out puns left and right. I really enjoyed the group talking about each enemy they encountered. Even Alisha the princess knight who wasn't in the group very long was very likable to bad for her she lost her lead role to Rose an essentric assassin who is creeped out by supernatural stuff (for little while at least). It really is a insane group of characters, with Lailah spouting nonesense, Edna teasing Mikleo and Mikleo overreacting, Dezel talking to animals or giving facts about wildlife, or Zaveid... being Zaveid you'd think they'd give Sorey something to stand out more besides geeking out on ruins with Mikleo.\n\nSTORY\n\nStory can get random, Sorey can't see Seraphims cuz Heldalf said so, and so the now invisible Seraphim to Sorey no longer help him because they don't like being ignored or they were tired idk, Rose was gonna get married (Haha what!?) and Dezel somehow causes the person she was gonna marry to turn into a hellion just because it adds drama, and how about Mikleo being a Seraphim? Did the last Shepherd kill his baby nephew or was it son? Wait did the last Shepherd marry his sister Muse? Guh I feel like they glanced over a lot of parts like that while saying, "What was that? Plot holes? Pshh why fill those in when we could mold the dirt into forgetful boss fights!" Seriously would of liked to see more villians or at least the 3 villians they gave us more often... Come on crazy fox guy you see at the beggining then end, creepy girl is middle then end, I'm not even going to count Alisha's teacher Maltran as a villian cuz you see her like 2 times and suddenly she is a villian which you don't really care about cuz you've only seen her TWICE, and Heldalf is always just standing around letting his purple stench spread all over while I guess he is thinking about what he is going to have for dinner? I'm not saying there weren't any good scenes between the cast and villians i'm just saying interacting with them more instead of a random hellion would of been nice.\n\nOverall Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n-Characters\n-Combat\n-Japanese Audio\n-Equipment System\n-Music\n\nCons:\n-Fox dude wtf is his deal?\n-75% of dungeons look like the same ruin or cave with differen't colors\n-Swimsuits as DLC (Whatever happened to there being hotsprings for this? I thought that was gonna be a thing... this time it was just a random skit...)\n-Boss invincibility frames\n\nEh:\n-Story had it's moments\n-Open maps looked nice but I didn't exactly have fun trudging across them\n-Sorey x Mikleo dat ending\n-Alisha leaving kind of a bummer, I really liked her in skits\n-English dub on my NG+ right now and Mikleo's voice is a little jarring, but I might get use to it\n\nI recommend it to JRPG fans although veterans of the Tales of series MIGHT walk away a little dissapointed.","November 1, 2015","true","79.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Since I've been playing for 3 days and put 20+ hrs into I can say these things:\n\nStoryline 8/10\nI hear alot of negatives about the story line. I don't get why they don't like it. I find the story pretty good. Of course alot of reviews are from those who have played the other gaems in the series. Since this is my firest time playing the Tales OF series and a JRPG type of game I guess I don't get what they mean. I give it 8/10 cuz at some points in the game I lost track of some of the story, of I'm still playing.\n\nCombat 9/10\nI like the combat system it reminds me of Quest 64. I give it 9/10 beacuase man, if you understand right away good for you. But for me, after 20hrs of gameplay I'm still just press random keys lol. You have to puit some time into learning the system to get the right combos and all that.\n\nGraphics 10/10\nI'm pretty much gonna have to say it, but it's nothing special but I give it 10/10 becasus the detail is nice, You can see pretty far away, and I like the animated look of the game. Just don't expect anything close to Fallout 4 graphics if you buy the game.\n\nAnyway, I'd recommend it. I'll just say, the closest game that I've play that this game also reminds me of is FLYFF (Fly for Fun) which is also a great MMORPG and I'd recommend that too.","November 19, 2015","true","40.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Bosses are much easier than alphas(they are monsters in each area that are much more powerfull than the other monsters in the area, only one of them stands in each area )\nBut despite all of this, this game is actually fun, feels nostalgic, has an anime style (which I like a lot).","November 19, 2015","true","51.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's my first Tales game, and it was very fun. I liked the combat, some of the story, the characters, the presentation, and I wasl satisfied with it. I also disliked the stat-system, a lot more of the story, the first-impressions of most characters, the vast, empty-except-for-monsters overworld, and a cople of nitpicks\n\nThe combat system is very, very fun. It's real-time in a small area, and there's a lot of good about it. Your "martial arts" will be your normal attacks, comboing into themselves and coming out quickly. "Hidden arts" sometimes combo into martial arts, sometimes finish combos, or just be stand-alone attacks depending on when and where you use them. They wont be interrupted by martial arts, but the same goes for enemy hidden arts. "Seraphic arts" are charged magical attacks, getting bigger and better and taking more time to charge as they advance. Mixing these up and killing all your enemies is fun, although good luck stringing together constant combos with the AI. Still, I took on the hardest boss in the entire game (Who, by the way, is a side-quest boss) while I was thirty levels under him. It took me a couple of tries, but the combat was so satisfying that I was ok with it.\n\nThe problem with the combat system is the stat system. Equipment changes in each area, becoming better as you go along. Unfortunately, it also doesn't. Each piece of equipment comes with up to four skills, the first of which is constant throughout across all other pieces with that name. Since all these akills are randomized, it tries to fuse linear and non-linear gear together, to terrible effect. There may be a set of skills for each tier of equipment, but I got so fed up with the system that by the end I wasn't really paying attention. It's an overly-complicated system that I ignored, and the game didn't punish me for it.\n\nAnother problem is with grinding. You don't actually have to grind much in this game, but you might want to just to make future bosses easier. I tried grinding a bit, but the enemies didn't seem advance with their levels when I raised the overall level of the area. It's not terrible, but I wish that there had been a more noticeable effect.\n\nThe music was pretty good, although not the greatest. It's good enough for long hours of playing, but not "soundtrack-of-my-life" levels of good. I also just liked the visuals in general, but the effect has worn off after... 75 hours? Where did my life go? Anyway, still one of the better looking games I've played in my life.\n\nNow comes to the most important part of ny JRPG: the story. After 75 hours, I've decided that I kinda liked it. There's a lot of things that it does very well, some that I would normally face-palm at. There's a character focused entirely on puns, most characters are just fun and likeable. For reference, there's a group of "good assassins" in the story. Naturally I thought that that's kinda stupid and contrived. It's now one of my favorite points in the story. Unfortuantely, it's fairly average as stories go, and that's WHEN I did like it.\n\nI may like the story and the characters, but if I had anything else to play at the time I probably would have stopped before the one-hour mark-- If the cutcenes were finally done at that point. For a long time the characters are just stupid and cliche and there si still a 10% chance that I like this story out of Stockholme's syndrome. For far too long, Sorey is "A wide-eyed, naive boy who's just learning about the real world, but keeping his chin up". Mikleo is "Sorey's best friend / Brother in all but blood, who always complains but always stands by his friend". The first time you meet most charaters, they are unbelievably cliche, and the main villain is essentially "The Darkness that lies in everyone's heart, mwahahahahaa". Eventually the characters become likeable, and the story picks up a sort-of theme about deciding taking your life's meaning and purpose into your own hands, but damn does it take it's sweet time getting there, and even then there are times when it's not that great. It's simplistic, somewhat cliche, and only saved by the combat.\n\nRants aside, I still liked this game. I pre-ordered it because it was bundled with a future key for Tales of Symphonia when it re-releases in 2016, and I've heard nothing but good about that game. I also got some extra costumes, which I like but could live without. Overall I'd reccomend this game, but over the Christmas sale when it is (hopefully) under $30. Until then, only Symphonia could justfy that price-tag in my mind.","November 28, 2015","true","75.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mainly with explaining mechanics and how you do things, for someone like me who does not own an Xbox controller and is just using a standard USB controller with a PS3 layout the button mappings are a complete mess and some don't work at all. Meanwhile it does not help that in some battles you get a kinda random tutorial and are required to do certain actions and sometimes pressing the button that should do that action does nothing at all. also while this could just be a problem of me not using an Xbox controller but sometimes it does not even tell me what button I should press on the controller to get the desired action and instead tells me what button on the keyboard to press, and during all this, you could be in a said tutorial battle-sequence thing where you can't quicksave nor access your control mappings.(From the little time I used mouse and keyboard, most of this is averted by using them, but who wants to play a JRPG with a keyboard and mouse!?) There is also a lack of settings, when you set your volume, you better be damn pleased with it, because as far as I can tell, there isn't a way to change it, but all that aside, I don't mind just figuring out stuff as I go along as I'll likely end up re-playing this game as time goes on and I get used to the battle mechanics, if you want clear tutorials, this game does not deliver. Speaking of battle mechanics, this game is a cross of Xenoblade Chronicles, and Kingdom Hearts (2 to be exact, there are even drive forms!) Unlike those games though, while this one does have a free roam ability during battles, it does not really offer any tactical advantage besides not being locked to a grid. Meanwhile the actual combat is a mix of KH and Xenoblade, there really is no good way to explain it, but pointing the left control stick or (WSAD respectively) and whatever you have attack set to will do a different attack, meanwhile dodges take up part of your combo, meaning if you dodge once and attack immediately after, you will do the second hit of your combo. On the story side of things, it's pretty normal, kid grows up in some strange circumstance/something that makes him different from the rest some interesting stuff happens in his normally uneventful life, baddies show up, and before you know it, you end up with some mystical power/ legendary role and get tasked with killing what I would presume to be the final boss. Holy ♥♥♥♥, that's one large wall of text, don't worry over time as I learn the game better and have more thoughts I'll format this and make it look nice, but for now, this is my opinon overall. It's worth it for 50% off, I would not have gotten it under any other circumstances, from what I have played it is not worth 40 something bucks, but for 23 or whatever it's on sale for now? Sure why not? From what I see on steam, there isn't much in terms of JRPGs besides Final Fantasy, and who wants to play a turn based game? For fans of the genre? Yes, get it, you will enjoy the characters and the world along with figuring out the battle system, but for more casual players, I would wait for a bit more of a price cut.","April 30","true","43.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I loved it is flawed, for instance the story is very much by the numbers good vs. evil and there are various aspects of the world that are very vague or could be explained better as well as a few plotholes that I hope that the prequel Tales of Berseria will fix when it comes out. There's also the confusing fusion aspect which ends up requireing extra grinding and farming time to get all the skills you want that could make combat easier. Also the camera in battle is AWFUL as you can't really control it and it becomes very messy and hard to see what's going on. There is also a bit of a glitch where you can accidentally end up playing as a foe but it can easily be fixed by going in and out of the menu and shouldn't affect you too badly. If you're curious about getting into the Tales series but have another system like a 3ds or PS3 I would recommend starting with one of those games but if PC is your only system and can't wait for Berseria to come out then go ahead because the Symphonia port is still reported to be a mess.

Since then the Tales of Series has had their fair share of great titles, somewhat good games and then bad games that thankfully for company reasons didn't want those games to be released in the West. Whatever the case these games are known for their entertaining skit sequences, great storylines and characters and enjoyable battle systems which are well loved in the hearts of RPG fans alike. Here we are now with the next new instalment with Tales of Zestiria which was announced and eventually released to celebrate 20 years of the long running franchise. It now aims for an open world landscape design, fusions Dragon Ball Z style as well as brining the best ideas from old tales instalments. Sure it's earned a bit of controversy in Japan for the game's handing of the main characters and has earned some rather unfair reviews over in the West. So what does this new Tales instalment fell in the eyes of a long running Tales player like myself? well I am so glad that I get to answer that question.\n\nThe setting of Tales of Zestiria takes place in a medieval fantasy world where the land is corrupted by a dark source called malevolence which are caused by the negative emotions caused between the people. Humanity's only chance of purifying the land is the power of the Shepherd and the main character Sorey being your every day standard J-RPG protagonist takes on that sacred duty of becoming a Shepherd and gains the power to fight the hellions. The characters of Tales of Zestiria are very likeable and their character development during the course of the game are great to watch. Sorey is the usual kind of J-RPG protagonist who wants to know about the world as well as exploring the various ruins, he also wants to believe that humans should be able to coexist with spiritual beings known as Seraphim which cannot be seen by the human eyes. Mikleo voiced by Scott Manville who also did Lloyd from Tales of Symphonia also tends to enjoy exploring ruins as much as Sorey but also ends up being the cautious type but their brotherly relationship is a cool sight to behold. Lailah is a pun artist who will use them as a way out of telling out her oath but acts a real support for Sorey. Edna tends to make fun of the party and other people's situations and also loves to insult Mikleo by calling him Meebo which is very funny. Later on in the game there is Dezel who vows revenge for the death of his friend and lastly there are Alisha and Rose. Alisha is a princess of Hyland who takes her role as a knight who will do what she can to help out her kingdom but she holds conflictions between understanding what it takes to keep the peace as a princess as well as upholding her status as a knight. Rose a character who fills Alisha's role for Sorey offers support for him but also acts as a boss for the Sparrowfeathers and a merchant who believes what she thinks is right for Sorey and his friends and her members. The writing is really good and the english dub acting is very strong showing the emotions of each of the characters very well, plus there is also the option for the Japanese audio tracks if the players so desire.\n\nTales of Zestiria's new gameplay change is that it goes for an openworld exploration which allows you to explore the vast reaches of the world as you see fit, it uses the same field controls like in the Tales of Xillia games so that you'll feel more familiar. The openworld design allows you to explore the environments freely both without the penalty of having tough enemies that can destroy the player instantly (aside from optional boss encounters) and also unlocking new areas at a reasonable pace as you go through the storyline. Compared to Final Fantasy XII which did use the openworld design before this game Tales of Zestiria has a well executed openworld design that makes you feel like an explorer without the game having to punish you for going of the main path which is a great thing. You'll explore grassy field areas, mountains and plenty of cavern and ruin areas which each have treasure and herbs to pick up and returning from Tales of Graces there are hidden discovery points that can be unearthed.\n\nSome areas will have a puzzle to solve which will involve either lighting up pedestal with fire, making your way through areas without being seen using the water, breaking blocks with earth and jumping past gaps using the wind. The earth and wind puzzles are quite good and can be done without any stress but the fire and water puzzles are the worst the game throws at you. The fire puzzles require you to light up a pedestal in order but the twist is that you need to light one of those from a direction that it wants you to light it up from which can be confusing unless you look underneath the pedestal indicating the direction and in what order you need to light them in. The worst puzzles come from the water trial where you need to use the water power to get past the eyes without being noticed, if you happen to get spotted by the eyes you get warped back to the start of the entire dungeon. It doesn't help that sometimes you'll walk into a room and then BAM! the eyes instantly see you without any warning. This actually forces the player to take it slow and examine where the eyes are and then use the water power to make it past it, however even when you do manage to unlock warp points you still end up back at the dungeon entrance if you get spotted which will force you redo some areas which afterwards it just becomes annoying. There was a sequence where I got stuck after defeating a boss fight in Marlind and I had no idea what to do next and it wasn't until I looked online that I found out that you had to burn those dark cloud hellion things using a fire spell that were placed all over the town. I had no idea that I was meant to do so because I didn't think there was possibly any indication at all during any dialogue at all at that point unless I skipped something.\n\nYou can take a stop in exploration to visit a town in order to rest up and heal up, purchase equipment and items and also get information from NPC's to your next objective or side quests you know like in other J-RPGs of the last decade or so. Sidequests and shopping have undergone a change, for sidequests they are much easier to track down thanks to a new conversation that you have with the character following you, you can talk to the character following you to have him/her remind you of your current objective or for a side quest's destination. Sidequests will range from fighting optional encounters that are hidden all through each of the maps, collecting gems or just for cutscenes and skits to unlock hidden items. Each of the ingame shops returning the levelling up system from Tales of Xillia only that each store has their own set of items and gears and buying each item increases that shops experience, if at maximum they start doing discount sales and also sell out their best item for sale if you have the gald for it.\n\nTo view my full review of Tales of Zestiria visit my channel on Gamespot with this link. http://www.gamespot.com/tales-of-zestiria/user-reviews/2200-12668681/","April 4","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inyongthegr8/recommended/351970/","inyongthegr8","BRILLIANT 2U","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inyongthegr8/","142 products in account","I've finished the game and I can say that the story is impressive, but somewhat rushed and gives little emphasis to villains since the story focused more on Sorey alone being a Shepherd and saving the world from spreading the malevolence. However, I will admit that it's immersive in a way, especially when you start sleeping in inns and discover significant places that trigger skits known as Discovery Points. That's where this game redeems itself in terms of skits through character development.\n\nCharacter Development. Characters are well developed, yet needs more room for improvement as stated above. The good part of this game is that there is a companion that you can talk to, to aid you in doing your side quest (known as Sub Episodes) as well as your main quest (known as Main Episodes) which is a feature I love so I know where I left off in the event I stopped playing for some time. This includes, but not limited to Iris Gems which requires collection to further progress to the story so it would be the borderline of Sub Episodes and Main Episodes since the player doesn't know in the first place that they had to collect Iris Gems. Aside from that, the characters are immersive as well so I do not see that as a problem as a whole, except that, characters needs more emphasis because the party members of Sorey are just supporting him and that's that. Comical relief for the characters as a whole has exceeded my expectations in a Japanese Role-Playing Game.\n\nEquipment System. The equipment fusion system is somewhat confusing because of the learning curve. The learning curve is so high to the point that it will be hard for you to get at first glance. You can do that by activating a skit by sleeping in the inn and by progression. Aside from that, some of the equipments in the shops are expensive from the start, but it will be alleviated as you immerse yourself to the game by encountering more enemies as you play. The summary is this: as you discover more weapons, more properties will be included in the equipment that you find during your playthrough. At the end of the day, discovering possible combinations to further synergize your passive skills to take advantage of the battle will help, especially in dire situations like optional bosses. If you're also planning to increase your stat as you level up, that's another strategy as well if you are planning to focus on a specific stat. Examples are the following: Increasing of Blast Gauge and Increasing of a certain stat as you level up. Some equipments that you obtain provide immunities, and when stacked up, you will be resistant to ailments by half, if not fully resistant. However, Fusion System will break the stack that you created, so it's all about the strategy right there.\n\nBattle System. It's good and it really feels like an action game for me because of how I control my character. The learning curve is easy and as you progress, strategies must be made to further take advantage of your enemy/ies's weaknesses and resistance. Aside from that, taking advantage of the power hits and juggling the enemy/ies is the way to go. This is better with multiplayer because the AI in Zestiria is half-baked and they tend to waste more Blast Gauge than usual in terms of utilising Armatization, this is noticeable in the final parts of the game, especially after tinkering the Strategy menu. But don't get me wrong. The AI is also intelligent and adapts accordingly, this is applicable before the final parts of the game, but it's not as perfect as what you think. Aiming for a no-KO for this game is something you will work hard on, especially when you are under leveled when dealing with high-tier bosses. High-tier bosses are those bosses that roam around the field with the dark smoke at the center of the enemy. Most high-tier bosses will not offer a retry but it's a gamble. However, I believe that issuing AI presets such as Prioritize Defense, Spread Out and Focus Attacks. For the Prioritize Defense, the AI tends to spam restorative and buffs all the way when they could better guard themselves from the enemy/ies's attacks as well as Spreading Out doesn't do its job either because some AIs tend to attack even though the first player ordered the AIs to Spread Out (Taken the consideration of utilizing the Strategy menu). Focusing attacks to the enemy is a lackluster for me, as it's vague whether a) the AI has to focus on the enemy attack or b) the AI has to focus on what the enemy/ies attack will come to further counter-attack the artes of the enemy/ies casted to a specific character. Don't forget the camera issues as well, it will kill your momentum in battle! Battle actions are also a plus to further customize your needs during a battle. I do recommend that you check your battle actions from time to time as you progress the game. You might discover a new battle action that will benefit you.\n\nQuick saves. They are useful especially in emergency situations where Save Points aren't accessible. This is the feature that I am impressed as how Tales implemented it. However, the issue that I find in this game is that, when the player starts loading from the last save data, and the player started to quick save before the boss battle, it will load to the LAST SAVED DATA (where the player saves in the save point) rather than loading from the quick save. The player has to go to menu and will need to load the quick save by themselves.\n\nOf course, some minor but commendable system that needs to be mentioned is that, the encounters are somewhat realistic, such as this one: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650984631\nBut of course, Sorey didn't fall. There was just a major re-positioning of the characters and of the battlefield.\n\nPorting issues. It's somewhat half-baked as well, but tolerable (thanks to the community fix by Kaldaien, I was able to hit 60FPS with this game but it's almost perfect for a port) because Bamco just ported the game in Playstation 3 up to Playstation 4, that can only hit up to 30 FPS. I hope that they will improve on that more in their future games.\n\nSoundtrack. I love the soundtrack of this game. You will love it once you progress through the game.\n\nSo far, I recommend this game for those who are planning to buy Tales of Zestiria, however, it's better if it's on sale and includes discounts.","March 28","true","164.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, I will admit that it's immersive in a way, especially when you start sleeping in inns and discover significant places that trigger skits known as Discovery Points. That's where this game redeems itself in terms of skits through character development.\n\nCharacter Development. Characters are well developed, yet needs more room for improvement as stated above. The good part of this game is that there is a companion that you can talk to, to aid you in doing your side quest (known as Sub Episodes) as well as your main quest (known as Main Episodes) which is a feature I love so I know where I left off in the event I stopped playing for some time. This includes, but not limited to Iris Gems which requires collection to further progress to the story so it would be the borderline of Sub Episodes and Main Episodes since the player doesn't know in the first place that they had to collect Iris Gems. Aside from that, the characters are immersive as well so I do not see that as a problem as a whole, except that, characters needs more emphasis because the party members of Sorey are just supporting him and that's that. Comical relief for the characters as a whole has exceeded my expectations in a Japanese Role-Playing Game.\n\nEquipment System. The equipment fusion system is somewhat confusing because of the learning curve. The learning curve is so high to the point that it will be hard for you to get at first glance. You can do that by activating a skit by sleeping in the inn and by progression. Aside from that, some of the equipments in the shops are expensive from the start, but it will be alleviated as you immerse yourself to the game by encountering more enemies as you play. The summary is this: as you discover more weapons, more properties will be included in the equipment that you find during your playthrough. At the end of the day, discovering possible combinations to further synergize your passive skills to take advantage of the battle will help, especially in dire situations like optional bosses. If you're also planning to increase your stat as you level up, that's another strategy as well if you are planning to focus on a specific stat. Examples are the following: Increasing of Blast Gauge and Increasing of a certain stat as you level up. Some equipments that you obtain provide immunities, and when stacked up, you will be resistant to ailments by half, if not fully resistant. However, Fusion System will break the stack that you created, so it's all about the strategy right there.\n\nBattle System. It's good and it really feels like an action game for me because of how I control my character. The learning curve is easy and as you progress, strategies must be made to further take advantage of your enemy/ies's weaknesses and resistance. Aside from that, taking advantage of the power hits and juggling the enemy/ies is the way to go. This is better with multiplayer because the AI in Zestiria is half-baked and they tend to waste more Blast Gauge than usual in terms of utilising Armatization, this is noticeable in the final parts of the game, especially after tinkering the Strategy menu.

Since then the Tales of Series has had their fair share of great titles, somewhat good games and then bad games that thankfully for company reasons didn't want those games to be released in the West. Whatever the case these games are known for their entertaining skit sequences, great storylines and characters and enjoyable battle systems which are well loved in the hearts of RPG fans alike. Here we are now with the next new instalment with Tales of Zestiria which was announced and eventually released to celebrate 20 years of the long running franchise. It now aims for an open world landscape design, fusions Dragon Ball Z style as well as brining the best ideas from old tales instalments. Sure it's earned a bit of controversy in Japan for the game's handing of the main characters and has earned some rather unfair reviews over in the West. So what does this new Tales instalment fell in the eyes of a long running Tales player like myself? well I am so glad that I get to answer that question.\n\nThe setting of Tales of Zestiria takes place in a medieval fantasy world where the land is corrupted by a dark source called malevolence which are caused by the negative emotions caused between the people. Humanity's only chance of purifying the land is the power of the Shepherd and the main character Sorey being your every day standard J-RPG protagonist takes on that sacred duty of becoming a Shepherd and gains the power to fight the hellions. The characters of Tales of Zestiria are very likeable and their character development during the course of the game are great to watch. Sorey is the usual kind of J-RPG protagonist who wants to know about the world as well as exploring the various ruins, he also wants to believe that humans should be able to coexist with spiritual beings known as Seraphim which cannot be seen by the human eyes. Mikleo voiced by Scott Manville who also did Lloyd from Tales of Symphonia also tends to enjoy exploring ruins as much as Sorey but also ends up being the cautious type but their brotherly relationship is a cool sight to behold. Lailah is a pun artist who will use them as a way out of telling out her oath but acts a real support for Sorey. Edna tends to make fun of the party and other people's situations and also loves to insult Mikleo by calling him Meebo which is very funny. Later on in the game there is Dezel who vows revenge for the death of his friend and lastly there are Alisha and Rose. Alisha is a princess of Hyland who takes her role as a knight who will do what she can to help out her kingdom but she holds conflictions between understanding what it takes to keep the peace as a princess as well as upholding her status as a knight. Rose a character who fills Alisha's role for Sorey offers support for him but also acts as a boss for the Sparrowfeathers and a merchant who believes what she thinks is right for Sorey and his friends and her members. The writing is really good and the english dub acting is very strong showing the emotions of each of the characters very well, plus there is also the option for the Japanese audio tracks if the players so desire.\n\nTales of Zestiria's new gameplay change is that it goes for an openworld exploration which allows you to explore the vast reaches of the world as you see fit, it uses the same field controls like in the Tales of Xillia games so that you'll feel more familiar. The openworld design allows you to explore the environments freely both without the penalty of having tough enemies that can destroy the player instantly (aside from optional boss encounters) and also unlocking new areas at a reasonable pace as you go through the storyline. Compared to Final Fantasy XII which did use the openworld design before this game Tales of Zestiria has a well executed openworld design that makes you feel like an explorer without the game having to punish you for going of the main path which is a great thing. You'll explore grassy field areas, mountains and plenty of cavern and ruin areas which each have treasure and herbs to pick up and returning from Tales of Graces there are hidden discovery points that can be unearthed.\n\nSome areas will have a puzzle to solve which will involve either lighting up pedestal with fire, making your way through areas without being seen using the water, breaking blocks with earth and jumping past gaps using the wind. The earth and wind puzzles are quite good and can be done without any stress but the fire and water puzzles are the worst the game throws at you. The fire puzzles require you to light up a pedestal in order but the twist is that you need to light one of those from a direction that it wants you to light it up from which can be confusing unless you look underneath the pedestal indicating the direction and in what order you need to light them in. The worst puzzles come from the water trial where you need to use the water power to get past the eyes without being noticed, if you happen to get spotted by the eyes you get warped back to the start of the entire dungeon. It doesn't help that sometimes you'll walk into a room and then BAM! the eyes instantly see you without any warning. This actually forces the player to take it slow and examine where the eyes are and then use the water power to make it past it, however even when you do manage to unlock warp points you still end up back at the dungeon entrance if you get spotted which will force you redo some areas which afterwards it just becomes annoying. There was a sequence where I got stuck after defeating a boss fight in Marlind and I had no idea what to do next and it wasn't until I looked online that I found out that you had to burn those dark cloud hellion things using a fire spell that were placed all over the town. I had no idea that I was meant to do so because I didn't think there was possibly any indication at all during any dialogue at all at that point unless I skipped something.\n\nYou can take a stop in exploration to visit a town in order to rest up and heal up, purchase equipment and items and also get information from NPC's to your next objective or side quests you know like in other J-RPGs of the last decade or so. Sidequests and shopping have undergone a change, for sidequests they are much easier to track down thanks to a new conversation that you have with the character following you, you can talk to the character following you to have him/her remind you of your current objective or for a side quest's destination. Sidequests will range from fighting optional encounters that are hidden all through each of the maps, collecting gems or just for cutscenes and skits to unlock hidden items. Each of the ingame shops returning the levelling up system from Tales of Xillia only that each store has their own set of items and gears and buying each item increases that shops experience, if at maximum they start doing discount sales and also sell out their best item for sale if you have the gald for it.\n\nTo view my full review of Tales of Zestiria visit my channel on Gamespot with this link. http://www.gamespot.com/tales-of-zestiria/user-reviews/2200-12668681/","April 4","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Mainly with explaining mechanics and how you do things, for someone like me who does not own an Xbox controller and is just using a standard USB controller with a PS3 layout the button mappings are a complete mess and some don't work at all. Meanwhile it does not help that in some battles you get a kinda random tutorial and are required to do certain actions and sometimes pressing the button that should do that action does nothing at all. also while this could just be a problem of me not using an Xbox controller but sometimes it does not even tell me what button I should press on the controller to get the desired action and instead tells me what button on the keyboard to press, and during all this, you could be in a said tutorial battle-sequence thing where you can't quicksave nor access your control mappings.(From the little time I used mouse and keyboard, most of this is averted by using them, but who wants to play a JRPG with a keyboard and mouse!?) There is also a lack of settings, when you set your volume, you better be damn pleased with it, because as far as I can tell, there isn't a way to change it, but all that aside, I don't mind just figuring out stuff as I go along as I'll likely end up re-playing this game as time goes on and I get used to the battle mechanics, if you want clear tutorials, this game does not deliver. Speaking of battle mechanics, this game is a cross of Xenoblade Chronicles, and Kingdom Hearts (2 to be exact, there are even drive forms!) Unlike those games though, while this one does have a free roam ability during battles, it does not really offer any tactical advantage besides not being locked to a grid. Meanwhile the actual combat is a mix of KH and Xenoblade, there really is no good way to explain it, but pointing the left control stick or (WSAD respectively) and whatever you have attack set to will do a different attack, meanwhile dodges take up part of your combo, meaning if you dodge once and attack immediately after, you will do the second hit of your combo. On the story side of things, it's pretty normal, kid grows up in some strange circumstance/something that makes him different from the rest some interesting stuff happens in his normally uneventful life, baddies show up, and before you know it, you end up with some mystical power/ legendary role and get tasked with killing what I would presume to be the final boss. Holy ♥♥♥♥, that's one large wall of text, don't worry over time as I learn the game better and have more thoughts I'll format this and make it look nice, but for now, this is my opinon overall. It's worth it for 50% off, I would not have gotten it under any other circumstances, from what I have played it is not worth 40 something bucks, but for 23 or whatever it's on sale for now? Sure why not? From what I see on steam, there isn't much in terms of JRPGs besides Final Fantasy, and who wants to play a turn based game? For fans of the genre? Yes, get it, you will enjoy the characters and the world along with figuring out the battle system, but for more casual players, I would wait for a bit more of a price cut.","April 30","true","43.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I loved it is flawed, for instance the story is very much by the numbers good vs. evil and there are various aspects of the world that are very vague or could be explained better as well as a few plotholes that I hope that the prequel Tales of Berseria will fix when it comes out. There's also the confusing fusion aspect which ends up requireing extra grinding and farming time to get all the skills you want that could make combat easier. Also the camera in battle is AWFUL as you can't really control it and it becomes very messy and hard to see what's going on. There is also a bit of a glitch where you can accidentally end up playing as a foe but it can easily be fixed by going in and out of the menu and shouldn't affect you too badly. If you're curious about getting into the Tales series but have another system like a 3ds or PS3 I would recommend starting with one of those games but if PC is your only system and can't wait for Berseria to come out then go ahead because the Symphonia port is still reported to be a mess.

The summary is this: as you discover more weapons, more properties will be included in the equipment that you find during your playthrough. At the end of the day, discovering possible combinations to further synergize your passive skills to take advantage of the battle will help, especially in dire situations like optional bosses. If you're also planning to increase your stat as you level up, that's another strategy as well if you are planning to focus on a specific stat. Examples are the following: Increasing of Blast Gauge and Increasing of a certain stat as you level up. Some equipments that you obtain provide immunities, and when stacked up, you will be resistant to ailments by half, if not fully resistant. However, Fusion System will break the stack that you created, so it's all about the strategy right there.\n\nBattle System. It's good and it really feels like an action game for me because of how I control my character. The learning curve is easy and as you progress, strategies must be made to further take advantage of your enemy/ies's weaknesses and resistance. Aside from that, taking advantage of the power hits and juggling the enemy/ies is the way to go. This is better with multiplayer because the AI in Zestiria is half-baked and they tend to waste more Blast Gauge than usual in terms of utilising Armatization, this is noticeable in the final parts of the game, especially after tinkering the Strategy menu. But don't get me wrong. The AI is also intelligent and adapts accordingly, this is applicable before the final parts of the game, but it's not as perfect as what you think. Aiming for a no-KO for this game is something you will work hard on, especially when you are under leveled when dealing with high-tier bosses. High-tier bosses are those bosses that roam around the field with the dark smoke at the center of the enemy. Most high-tier bosses will not offer a retry but it's a gamble. However, I believe that issuing AI presets such as Prioritize Defense, Spread Out and Focus Attacks. For the Prioritize Defense, the AI tends to spam restorative and buffs all the way when they could better guard themselves from the enemy/ies's attacks as well as Spreading Out doesn't do its job either because some AIs tend to attack even though the first player ordered the AIs to Spread Out (Taken the consideration of utilizing the Strategy menu). Focusing attacks to the enemy is a lackluster for me, as it's vague whether a) the AI has to focus on the enemy attack or b) the AI has to focus on what the enemy/ies attack will come to further counter-attack the artes of the enemy/ies casted to a specific character. Don't forget the camera issues as well, it will kill your momentum in battle! Battle actions are also a plus to further customize your needs during a battle. I do recommend that you check your battle actions from time to time as you progress the game. You might discover a new battle action that will benefit you.\n\nQuick saves. They are useful especially in emergency situations where Save Points aren't accessible. This is the feature that I am impressed as how Tales implemented it. However, the issue that I find in this game is that, when the player starts loading from the last save data, and the player started to quick save before the boss battle, it will load to the LAST SAVED DATA (where the player saves in the save point) rather than loading from the quick save. The player has to go to menu and will need to load the quick save by themselves.\n\nOf course, some minor but commendable system that needs to be mentioned is that, the encounters are somewhat realistic, such as this one: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=650984631\nBut of course, Sorey didn't fall. There was just a major re-positioning of the characters and of the battlefield.\n\nPorting issues. It's somewhat half-baked as well, but tolerable (thanks to the community fix by Kaldaien, I was able to hit 60FPS with this game but it's almost perfect for a port) because Bamco just ported the game in Playstation 3 up to Playstation 4, that can only hit up to 30 FPS. I hope that they will improve on that more in their future games.\n\nSoundtrack. I love the soundtrack of this game. You will love it once you progress through the game.\n\nSo far, I recommend this game for those who are planning to buy Tales of Zestiria, however, it's better if it's on sale and includes discounts.","March 28","true","164.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Why? Because when you're in the world of Zestiria; the music, the landscape, and the characters remind you of the RPGs you played growing up. It has a 'classic' aura. Best way I can describe it. Now, though it has this feel - you know it's a 'new' game. Little tell-tale signs of such pop up here an there. The detail you'll see up close, the animations, voice acting, etc etc.\n\n+ Optimization. I'll say this, I've had NO significant trouble with this game. I run it all at max and is fine. Only thing I notice now an again is slight clipping. It's rare, it effects the game not at all. So overall, I think they did a wonderful job on this port.\n\n+ Fashion. I like the way they do the outfit system in this game. It's not TOO simple as to say, give you one slot for a head to toe outfit. You can mix things up and give yourself a unique look.\n\n- Combat. It feels tight. Which, most Tales games do to an extent. This moreso. I wish they'd have given more options to adjust your party's AI.\n\n- Skill tree...kinda. Seems like they could have done this easier. I still haven't really understood what it does when it does it. Not completely. I don't mind things being complex, and this certainly isn't the MOST complex system I've seen. It just feels clunky.\n\nMain buying points to keep in mind.\n\nUnless you plan on waiting 5ish years, this game won't drop below 19.99 IF it ever gets THAT low. If you want this game, get it now or maybe wait for a sale to when it's like 10 dollars off.\nIF you like JRPGs, get it - plain an simple. You'll get excited to play it. You'll have that thing where, you can't sleep very well, because you just want to get back on an play.\n\nNow if you like RPGs in general, get it. Same as above.\n\nBUT, if you are the type raised on Western RPGs. You might not be as into this. You won't find this poking through political barriers, or showing breasts. You won't have movie quality graphics. This is more anime style, and like I said - a throwback to older games. Where the world's landscape seems like a more detailed world map.\n\nIf you've never played an RPG or JRPG before - this is a decent one to give a go.  I'm enjoying the hell out of it. And I haven't really enjoyed a JRPG in what feels like forever.\nSo, buy it and enjoy it.","October 21, 2015","true","27.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I might be editing this due that can't say as much with this gameplay but trust me is AWESOME :D Let's hope more "Tales of" Games come to steam.\n\nGood:\nGraphics enhacements are AMAZING it is outstanding how good this game looks.\nEven with the 30fps lock the game looks quite smoothy due animations and such.\nI loved the chars since the moment they were introduced. I play with my bf so we were getting a good laugh specially with Lailah xD\nPre Order things: Cameo Weapons+Skins(that brings the OST in battle wich is GREAT but you can disable it if you don't like it)+Symphona was an amazing deal for just 49.99 but if you didn't buy it yet be sure to get it before the Alisha DLC run out (I think it is around november).\nGameplay/Fighting is quite nice due that you can keep on and on as long you know how to manage your TP.\n\nBad:\nI think my only gripe but for all versions is the camera glitch specially on close halls but you can still move your camera with your right analog stick (if you play with a controller).

This will be partial as I haven't yet finished the game.\n\nVisual: What can I say that doesn't sound as a fan-screaming all over the place? Hahaha, It's beautifully well done, the wide arrange of visual options let you run the game with a good dynamism either on a simple computer or a pseudo-spaceship. Running it on a full graphical option rewards you with excelent definition, lovely colouring and impresive shading in both the characters and the environment. (I still haven't found glitches in any place).\nIt's impressive that the only LITTLE and I repeat "Little" is the walking speed animation of Sorey which seems a bit jumpy and forced compared to the rest of the characters.\n\nAudio: Jeez!, I know the tales of saga is famous for the wonderful soundtracks, scenery audio or background musics, but this one takes the prize! Might sound exaggerated to say it's the best one of the 31 tales until now... But if not, it damn well near the top 3.\nThe fighting music as well as the scene ones are top notch. They are well rounded and you can actually listen to them for hours without even noticing the time you've being doing it.\nPeople have been saying that the Abyss intro song was one of the best around (Karma-Bump of Chicken for the ones interested). But the intro on Zestiria is actually electrifing! (White light-Superfly) I highly praise the selection they did and how good it was merged togethre with the scenes around.\n\nGameplay: Well, here you would expect the game to really shine... And it actually does! The control system is extremely well thought, the battle options are wide and quite easy to understand, and depth enough to be able to give it time to propperly master it. The Artes / Hidden artes options are well defined, the equipement system is extremely original and rewarding once understood. The originality of leaving behind the mana option exchanging it for an action points bar which is dinamically recovered through the battle is simply exilarating.\nIt is also excelent the way it's thoght the interaction between Seraphs and Humans during the battle. The fusion system as well as the tag-battle option is something they managed to comply without loosing the dynamism of the battle itself. Which we can aslo add that they improved the encounter system so much as to barely feel the in/out of each battle (and we can all agree that it's one of the points that weights down any RPG around).\nThe only little downside on this element that I was able to find, is the limitation on free movement inside the battle which is kinda limitating for veterans on the "Tales of" saga (You need to keep a key pressed to be able to do so).\nI could go on and on with gameplay quirks that makes the game excelent, but I don't want to fall in spoil anyone the surprise of encountering them through the game.\n\nMenus: I decided to separate this category from gameplay due a simple detail. With everything as it is planned out the menus and the options they present do not affect the gameplay at all. They could present to be a bit widespread on a keyboard (If you decide to play the game with one, as if you do You will realize the game is completly playable with either controllers o keyboard). But besides that, everything is well presented in a way you can actually understand every option avaliable to you.\nA little downside on the menu distribution could be the small incapacity to check your own equipment perks in the equipment fusion window.\n\nStory: (I refuse to make points on this until i complete the game on 100%, but I can say at least that the character progression and the personalities presented are excelent and completly likeable from begining to end)\n\nMaking a briefing I can say that this game is another Precious jewel and an excelent addition to anyone's library.

I had never heard of the 'Tales of' games before and was very curious about it because of how excited he was to play it. After he explained to me what the games were I figured it was worth a try... and I was not disappointed! The game has a very good story and unique, likable characters (two characteristics every RPG should have in my opinion). Also, the battle system is done very well except for the camera angles when fighting in tight spaces. I think the only thing that I wasn't particularly fond of was how the menu was layed out when trying to fuse equipment. Having to switch back and forth between the fusion menu and the skills menu could get annoying when trying to fuse multiple types of equipment for more than one character, but I think that might just be me nitpicking a little bit. Overall this was a great game and I would definitely recommend it to others who want to get into the 'Tales of' games.

At the time of launch however it has suffered major bugs but kudos to the Steam forum admin who was taking feedback and giving progress on fixes as well as another user who provided his own fix (the individual even helped me personally which was great) but fortunately now the game is pretty stable. It does only run at 30 fps but I don't mind it and sadly it was developed with 30 in mind so increasing to 60 sounds like it wont happen.\n\nThe start of the game isn't very promising, just a warning. It starts out with the same story we have all heard before, hand-holding tutorials, and slow-narrative pacing. Give it time though; the game does improve in all those areas. Combat opens up as you get your party together (most of the games party joins in the first chapter of the game), the narrative and characters become more developed and interesting beyond their trope-like first impressions, and the combat becomes very easy to learn, difficult to master.\n\nAs of right now, my biggest complaint has to be equipment and items. They are overly complex to the point where it breaks pacing. Same name items now may have different stats, they can be fused which could make them better or worse, you have a skill sheet too thats tied to equipment that stacks in different ways with each other, etc. I find myself having to stop and take several minutes at a time trying to min-max my equipment trying to figure out what it will mean, what will work, what wont, etc. and it isn't any fun. True, previous games it was boring simple how they were mostly just flat stat upgrades but it was quick and to the point. Here, I'm several hours into the game and I'm still confused how it all works and it's throwing off the pacing where I'm trying to cure a plague from a town only to be stuck wondering why I have a locked skill on my spear because I missed that note on page 13/80 on how equipment works.\n\nSo far I would say the game is great dispite the drawbacks. The bugs are mostly squashed with fixes available, and the item system I hate can thankfully be mostly ignored (once I figured that the stats at this point weren't that big a deal it helped my enjoyment immensly) and I'm becoming more invested in the story now. Pretty solid so far, would recommend.\n\nAlso on the note of DLC, the game currently has several DLCs in the form of costumes primarily but theres a $19.99 DLC that consists of cheats essentially. Pretty lame but avoidable.\n\nUPDATE: After playing for a while now my opinions haven't changed much but I did start to find myself get into a rhythem and I'm still have fun, so despite the faults it's pretty good overall.","November 5, 2015","true","110.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Combat is just as fun as it's ever been, but the story and characters, with a couple exceptions, are really boring. The story feels so rushed to make this supposed "hero" become the hero. They even just straight up abandon a couple characters completely after certain points in the story. Oh, and F. U. C. K. Y. O. U. Developers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolstorybrah/recommended/351970/","coolstorybrah","Shaw Cable Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolstorybrah/","126 products in account","Tales of Zestiria is the latest Tales of game added to the Tales Franchise, which has been running for 20 years now. If you did not know, the Tales of series is extremely popular in Japan and is considered among the best of JRPGS along with Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Pokemon. It is an anime RPG series, so if you like Anime and RPG's keep reading. Or if you are generally interested in the title, you can continue reading as well.\n\n\nI will divide this review into 3 parts: STORY, GAMEPLAY and OVERALL CONCLUSION.\n\n\n\nSTORY:\n\n*Minor Spoilers ahead*\n\n\nYou follow the story of Sorey, a young ruin fanatic on an adventure with his best friend Mikleo. They stumble upon a young lady knight in booty shorts named Alisha and together they form a bond as they go on more adventures together.\n\nSorey shortly establishes himself as the Shepard early in the game, the only one who can purify "hellions" the monsters you encounter within the game.\n\nAs you travel together you meet more new friends; Seraphs, beings that are invisible to most humans, except Sorey and few individuals with the innate talent to sense/interact with them. Each of the ones that join your party are attuned to a different element: Fire, Wind, Earth and Water.\n\nThe main objective for Sorey's quest is to defeat the Lord of Calamity and bring an end to all malevolence brought forth unto the world.\n\nNow with that aside and the overall gist of the plot explained loosely, I would like to say the Story is "nothing special". However I do say that, although it may not be an AMAZING story, it is still a decent and good one, generally easy to follow and not get lost in. The simplicity of your objectives and how they contribute to your adventure really set a nice steady pace for your journey and there are plenty of extras and sidequests to get lost in that do add more to your experience!\n\nNever once have I felt that the story was moving too slow and it was not going anywhere.\n\nAlthough the story does follow some cliches, they are cliches I enjoy and like and there are plenty of stuff done differently as well, so the journey doesn't feel empty. An example of a cliche used for the story is "A chosen hero bears the power to save the world". In my opinion, as overused as this plot device is used, it's still a great foundation for a story to start upon.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of playing through the story were the interactions between the main cast, as their personalities clash in times of joy and woe. Truly a wonderful cast is needed to bring out the story to life and I feel they nailed it for the most part. I will criticize on a certain design choice made on a character who later joins you, as SHE (there's your hint) can be annoying sometimes and in my opinion I would value a "certain" other character's presence over her, however this is unavoidable due to plot reasons.\n\n\nOverall I would give the story a 7/10.\n\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\n\n\nOn the field, you control Sorey as you move from point A, to point B in a world that is connected by areas. There is no "overworld" so the only way to travel is run to your destination, or quick travel between save points. Quick travel is available early in the game, although it costs money and can't be used all the time due to plot points inhibiting your travel.\n\nThe game is divided into Towns, Dungeons, and Fields.\n\nThe map is easy to use and there are quest markers in case you get lost. Not everything is travel from here to there as there are sidequests to do as you play more, extra dungeons outside the story, and puzzles which can get to the point of "The Legend of Zelda" difficulty.  I enjoyed the puzzles and they are a nice distraction to keep the game from seeming like your running in a linear line.\n\n\nThe Battle System in Tales of Zestiria is one of the most FUN I've ever had in a Tales of game. If you are not familiar with how the series battle system works, the entire game is played in a real time action based combat system. You can freely move your character on the battlefield and attack when you want. No turns, no waiting, you fight like REAL men.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements to this system is that in past titles, you are put in a pre rendered environment to fight your enemies in, like older RPG classics, however this has changed. You are now placed immediately into battle upon encountering an enemy on the map, and fight exactly where you were prior to the encounter. You might be fighting on a staircase, there might be a rock you can hide behind, or a wall. It adds a great immersive feeling and depth to the encounter.\n\nYou control one of the party characters and attack via Martial Artes (No. Not really like Kung-fu movies), Seraphic Artes (spell based moves, with a cast timer) and Hidden Artes (Stronger versions of Martial Artes). The AI will then control 3 other characters.\n\nA Martial Arte is your primary basic attack; fast combo strings that get more stronger and stronger as you chain into it. (Max of 4 chain attacks at the start). They are simply satisfying to watch and use, and you will most likely never get bored of watching your characters chain more and more combos together with your party, as you level up and grow stronger.\n\nSeraphic Artes are for Seraphs only, and cast a spell with timers ranging from very short to long, depending on the level of spell you cast and when you cast it within your combo. For example casting a Seraphic Arte after 3 chains of a Martial Arte Combo will greatly reduce the cast time of a spell, making it almost instant if its a lower level spell. Each element of spell is interesting to use, and play with, and spells can also be combo'd into eachother within a 4 linked chain such as Martial Artes, making spells certainly entertaining to use as well.\n\nHidden Artes are just stronger versions of Martial Artes and can only be used with Human characters. They perform similar to Martial Artes except you don't have to be within a certain string of a combo to use them, unlike Martial Artes.\n\nNow to put the icing on the cake the GREATEST addition I felt that was put into the gameplay was the....\n\nFUSION SYSTEM!\n\nLater on after obtaining the power of the Shepard, there is a skill called "Armatization", which allows you to fuse with Seraphs, obtain their element, and become an entirely different being.\n\nFor example when fused with Lailah, the Seraph of Fire, you wield a giant two handed sword with flames that purify evil-- literally!\n\nSorey and the Seraph he fused with stats are merged, making you a one man army. It is simply satisfying on how powerful you feel, when fused and the new Martial/Seraphic Artes you can use will simply blow you away on how spectacular they look when performed.\n\nNow to put even more eye candy to your super form, each line the character now says is heard between two different entitites (Depending on who is fused) and I loved the nostalgic Dragonball Z feeling I got from hearing these.\n\nOverall I would give the Gameplay a 10/10, fun/fun.\n\nOVERALL CONCLUSION:\n\nNow there is plenty of stuff I can go on and on about this game, but I would like to give the reader a chance to actually play the game themselves and learn what else the game has to offer.\n\nThere are tons of stuff I have not even gone over, which I assure most will enjoy such as "Skits" (Voice acted mini scenes between the party), and the very complex skill system used via equipment.\n\nAll in all Tales of Zestaria is a great game and has a tremendous amount of depth to overcome the flaws of it cliches, and the Battle System is straight up addicting. The characters are great for the most part, and the newest additions to the franchise are fantastic.\n\nGive the game a try if you like Japanese RPG games, or are interested in it. I can guarantee it is worth your money.\n\nI give the game an overall 8/10.","November 28, 2015","true","101.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There are some minor issues like the game not using the dedicated GPU by default and VSync not working unless you enable it in your graphics card's control panel, but I can imagine those being patched in the near future.\n\nThe (in-combat) gameplay is fun, somewhat intuitive and depending on the dificulty settings quite challenging (duh). There are some details that I really like, like a "have-I-talked-to-you-yet?" icon above NPCs and some about which I wonder why they are even in the game (the so called Treasure Detection triggers at like 3m distance to the chest. Nice.).\n\nCan't say much about the story obviously, but from what I *have* seen so far it's a not too dark story as you'd find it in other JRPGs with spirits, apparently dragons and knight-princesses that wear rather, uhhm, unprotective armor. Well ok, it's not as bad as I made it sound, but it's still a JRPG.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, even the usual "you're travelling around the world" music is great and doesn't get boring.\n\nSo I'd say give it a go if you're into this sort of stuff, and don't if you're not. I am though. Have a nice day :)\n\nEDIT: The story just got a bit darker.","October 20, 2015","true","44.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It feels like a good classic JRPG, but has a few glaring issues. As a fan of the tales series I have been enjoying it, but I wouldn't reccomend this game to someone who didn't already enjoy JRPGs. Most people won't get it.\n\nPros:\n-A great overall JRPG experience.\n-An interesting story that doesn't try too hard to vere away from traditional fantasy roots.\n-Enjoyable characters even if their English translation falls flat.\n-Fun and fast combat that you can tailor to how you play.\n-The game is well paced, balancing just the right amount of story and combat.\n-A lot of options for people who don't care about optimizing their characters while still rewarding number crunchers.\n\nCons:\n-On max settings, the low res textures of the world clashes with how detailed and clear the characters are.\n-The English voice acting/translation is absolutely atrocious. Even as some one who prefers english, I set it to japanese for more believeable characters. Whoever did the translation did it forceably to fit the japanese lip sync instead of trying to keep what was originally being said. In most cases what was said in japanese was not even close to the english translation, losing a LOT of what was going on.\n-Heavy limitations with draw distance and enemy pop in, even on max settings. The game always looks foggy.\n-Due to how utterly complex the battle system is, they constantly feed you explanations for everything, but there is so much jargon that there is far too much to remember. You end up figuring it out easier through trial and error.\n\nI will update as I finish the game. I am enjoying it so far and despite the the pretty glaring flaws the game has, I still think it is worth a purchase if you enjoy JRPGs.","November 2, 2015","true","6.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It is simply satisfying on how powerful you feel, when fused and the new Martial/Seraphic Artes you can use will simply blow you away on how spectacular they look when performed.\n\nNow to put even more eye candy to your super form, each line the character now says is heard between two different entitites (Depending on who is fused) and I loved the nostalgic Dragonball Z feeling I got from hearing these.\n\nOverall I would give the Gameplay a 10/10, fun/fun.\n\nOVERALL CONCLUSION:\n\nNow there is plenty of stuff I can go on and on about this game, but I would like to give the reader a chance to actually play the game themselves and learn what else the game has to offer.\n\nThere are tons of stuff I have not even gone over, which I assure most will enjoy such as "Skits" (Voice acted mini scenes between the party), and the very complex skill system used via equipment.\n\nAll in all Tales of Zestaria is a great game and has a tremendous amount of depth to overcome the flaws of it cliches, and the Battle System is straight up addicting. The characters are great for the most part, and the newest additions to the franchise are fantastic.\n\nGive the game a try if you like Japanese RPG games, or are interested in it. I can guarantee it is worth your money.\n\nI give the game an overall 8/10.","November 28, 2015","true","101.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pwister/recommended/351970/","Pwister","Pwister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pwister/","234 products in account","Tales of Zestiria is another installment of the "Tales of" series of RPGs, a series that's been standing since Tales of Phantasia on the Super Famicom in 1995. The series has 2 internal teams that make each game, and this was made by Team Destiny, who also worked on Tales of Destiny, and Tales of Graces, so this shares a lot of similarities with those games.\n\nStory: The land has been corrupted by malevolance, and the Shepherd, working alongside beings called Seraphims can quell it, and purify it back to it's normal state. The Lord of Calamity is the main villain, carrying just way too much malevolance, and the main goal is to become strong enough as a shephard with the help of your companions to defeat him and purify the world.\n\nWhen it comes to the characters, all of the characters are really convincing. Their personalities stick, and none of the characters feel too dumb or naive. Everyone in the group has a great since of humor, and if you like terrible puns then you'll love the skits and banter between the cast.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on the Linear Motion Battle System, a system in which you move on a line between you and your targets, initiating attacks based on what direction you input along with the attack buttons. You can hold down a button to unlock from the line, and move freely around the combat arena to reposition, and you can dash along the line and circle around your target to dodge. The arena is made right on the field map, rather than going into a seperate screen, so things like trees and walls come into count when dodging and running around (although this can make the camera bug out sometimes). Combos are basically put together for you in this iteration, so you can focus on just using the right weaknesses and whatnot. The item management is really intuitive, and once you get used to it it becomes very easy to put together exactly what skills you want to come out of your gear.\n\nThe dungeons and field exploration are a lot more open than what we've grown used to in Tales of Xillia. No longer is the world just a line, just going straight from town to town through copy and pasted valleys filled with recolors of the same enemies. With the adition of the on-field seraph actions, it even manages to intuitively push you in the right direction while still not feeling linear at all.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about Zestiria is that the party feels a lot weaker when you don't throw them all in the same pot. Looking at Tales of Graces, every character had amazing strengths, and few weaknesses. There was even an option to go into fights with just the one character you're playing, without the other 3 members, because everyone could hold their own. In Tales of Zestiria, only Sorey and Rose really feel balanced out as strong characters, but the Seraphs are very clearly just there to cover weaknesses, and to buff the human characters. This kind of pushes you into sticking to Sorey the entire game, and throws the idea of maining any other party member out the window.\n\nWhile not my favorite Tales game, it falls very close second under Tales of Vesperia. The mechanics are fun, the story is nice, and it's overall a great experience. Let's just hope they don't do it again. Everything feels great in Zestiria, but I really hope the next game is even more new things. The open field combat arena battles are cool, but it would be great if that was only a one-time deal. The same with how they managed the party setup and the field actions. Given the past couple games, where Xillia felt like Graces with a different camera angle, let's just hope Tales of Berseria brings something new to the table.","October 23, 2015","true","103.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The voice acting is hit or miss thus far, but is not distracting.\n\nCombat is as you would expect from the free-motion system, and the customization of items and purifying of malevolence will add a new depth rather than just "get to new town, buy new weapons" that it has often been in the past for Tales games.\n\nThe story is intriguing, and can be confusing if the player is not paying attention right from the start.

I love the JRPG style of gameplay and finding loot, exploring, etc. It took awhile to get used to the controls on the keyboard/mouse. I had to find the right rythym to get off the specific attacks I wanted. And while the gameplay is fun to me, I find most other components of the game to be lacking. I find the story to be acceptable though some claim it is cliche and lackluster, I find it to be a different take on saving the world.\n\nMy biggest complaint, is that the main character is supposed to be BIG into dungeon diving and relics. Yet the only thing you will find in the dungeons of this game, are enemies, treasure chests, and corridors. Here is a small example of how barren the dungeons are. After playing 40 or so hours, walking into a dungeon and seeing a torch made me suspicious. I went over to the torch to see if it was something I needed to activate. If a single light source makes me think something is out of place in a dungeon, then you can imagine how barren it is. Literally rooms and corridors. Maybe a decoration bit here or there, but you will always check them because they all scream out of place. All of these dungeons are like this that ive been in except the very first.\n\nThe overworld is beautiful and the skyboxes are quite nice. Yet you will see the same enemies throughout the game just with different color schemes which is a con. So although I dont have much Tales experience to say how good this one is in comparison, for being my real first Tales game, I would say I am mostly satisfied. I just hope in the future they take the time to add more detail to their dungeons as it becomes droll very fast.","November 10, 2015","true","63.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

What I can say so far is that the game is far more detailed than past Tales games and by far the most innovative entry since Xillia. It has a great setting and recurring story elements here and there that are borrowed from past tales games. The battle system on the other hand is still linear motion although a bit almost like an over the perspective is used for the camera as opposed to how usually you would be able to see all of your characters at once on screen. It'll take a few minutes or so to get used to but it progressively gets more fun. There is a bit of screen tearing which is completely noticable so if this is an issue turn on the in game v-sync and/or v-sync in your gpu control panel. One final thing which may dissapoint some is that there isn't a whole lot of grinding invloved this time around which is usually apperant in past entries although this does keep the story moving rather than slowing down and speeding up in unexpected intervals.

If i were to compare this to many recent RPG's and games in general i'd rate this game above average.\n\nHowever, I am a long time fan of the Tales games, and comparing this game to some of the best in the series mostly brings dissappointment. The characters are boring and cliche with little to no character development, the story is basic and mostly predictable, albeit plot wise it's better than most, and the difficulty spikes are strange, sudden, and not innovative or skill based whatsoever.  The only thing i will elaborate on is the difficulty issues seeing as how i believe the other two complaints are self explanitory. There are random boss monsters that spawn in each area... they reward you with a lot of experience and rare drops. My problem with these boss monsters is that they are just damage sponges with a ton of insta kill moves, even if you are 20 lvls over them. Beating them is more a matter of luck and insane micro managing of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI teamates . Tales AI has always been kinda bad, so this wasn't a complaint of mine but it is something you should be aware of.\n\nThe good parts of this game come from the combat system and the equipment and passive skill system. As expected this game has the best combat of any tales game. It is incredibly fluid, aside from Edna, and each character feels unique and useful. Being the newest this is just an expectation in my opinion. Tales has always had good combat, so It is not a massively amazing improvement and by no means makes up for the negatives, but it is still impressive since this is the first incarnation of a tales game that doesn't have instanced battling and i must say it was a great success. I hope all future Tales games follow this one's lead in that department. The Equipment and skill system is complicated and very touchy but extremely rewarding once understood and utilized. Some complain that the way it's set up crappy equipment stat wise is better than newer stronger equipment because of this skills inherent in them and they interact with the rest of a characters equipment, but i enjoy that. Sure it'd be nice to have stronger equipment although with patience and a bit of grinding you can make it work; but i love how, unlike the difficulty of enemies, the equipment isn't so cut and dry. It's definitely one of my favorite aspects of this game, but i don't think it would translate well to future installments.\n\nOverall i give this game a 7/10 because of bias as a long time fan, but i would highly recommend this people new to the series. This was my Friend's first Tales game and he loved it, and i mostly certainly can't blame him. For long time fans i would also recommend but with a word of warning. I am very glad i preordered this game because i got Tales of Symphonia with it, and without that addition this game wouldn't have been worth $60.","January 3","true","59.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game doesn't really start coming together until about 3 hours in\n-Very easy combat unless you're playing on hard difficulty\n\nZestiria is kind of a "two steps forward, one step back" game. Compared to Xillia, the combat system and actual gameplay has been vastly improved. One of the biggest problems I had with Xillia was that it was simply too easy and the combat was unengaging. Zestiria fixed those problems and made the combat fun again (although you still need to be playing it on hard for it to be properly balanced). The step back is in the story. Its not bad by any means, but Zestiria probably has the most generic plot in the entire Tales series. The actual writing and dialogue between characters is fine (although the voice acting is all over the place), but the overarching story is a huge step back.\n\nI don't think Zestiria brings the Tales franchise back to the glory days of Symphonia and Vesperia, but its definitely a step in the right direction.","January 3","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashrua/recommended/351970/","ashrua","acev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashrua/","71 products in account","As a big fan of the Tales of... series, my excitement for this game maintained its high ranking throughout the year. Finding out it was going to be on Steam definitely interested me, and I have to say that the inclusion of more platforms proved to be a good decision.\n\nIn general, Tales of Zestiria returns to older Tales of... formulas and improves upon the newer battle systems introduced in Tales of Graces, Tales of Xillia, and Tales of Xillia 2. I would honestly say this game contains a good mix of new and old Tales of... games. Tales of Zestiria contains a much more open world than Tales of.. games of late, which was nice to see after the linear world of Graces, Xillia, and Xillia 2. I actually felt like I was exploring vast areas in Zestiria, which really added to the experience. Unfortunately, the world in Tales of Zestiria still feels smaller compared to older Tales of... games, as I don't feel as I'm venturing throughout the world, moreso venturing through a continent. However, this drawback stems from the style the developers are going for, so it's necessarily a system needed to be perfected, rather than a flaw in this particular game.\n\nThe battle system in Tales of Zestiria certainly expands on Tales of Graces rather than Tales of Xillia, as evidenced by the lack of TP or another MP-based battle system. In addition, A-Artes and B-Artes return as Martial Artes and Hidden Artes for humans, and Hidden Artes and Seraphic Artes for Seraphim. This makes the battle system seem awfully familiar to Tales of Graces, and really, it's a fun system. In addition, the game allows Seraphim and Humans to combine, creating a stronger playable entity which will completely destroy certain enemies. This game isn't easy unless you master this battle system, so the overpowered entity really assists the difficulty curve. Unfortunately, the camera definitely does not agree with many battles, and while the seamless transition from field to battle is nice, I don't believe the game was ready for that transition until the camera issue was solved.\n\nThe overall gameplay system also really expands upon itself, mainly stemming from the fusion system. The fusion system in this game, which allows one to work with different skills, really expands upon the battle system. The goal to becoming stronger in this game lies more in what skills one has, rather than how much attack or defense a certain piece of equipment holds. Until one learns this system, the game can be penalizing on harder difficulties.\n\nThere's so much more I could talk about, but really, it all comes down to personal preference. Tales of Zestiria really boils down to whether one wants to have a fun time playing an RPG with a fun action battle system, or not. While I found the story to be entertaining, I can see why many don't care for it, as it's a commonplace Tales of.. game story. However, the characters are enjoyable to watch, the story was fun to watch unfold, and the gameplay was phenomenal. I definitely recommend this game if you enjoyed any other Tales of... game, or if you enjoy real-time battle systems.","October 29, 2015","true","68.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Please beware!\n\nStarting with the cons:\n- 30 FPS, for some it is, for some it isn't a con, decide for yourself.\n- Bad combat camera.\n- Overall unintuitive combat and skill system.\n- Some characters are just bald and unmemorable, sadly.\n----SPOILER-----\n- No real plot twist i came to expect from tales games?

Most of the other reviews explain what is great about this game very well.    So in this review I'm going to summerize the major issues.   I feel these issues hurt the game-feel and break immersion.  Hopefully this could help people determine wheather this game is still worth it to them.  My biggest gripes with this game are down to the  environments, animations, gameworld interactivity.\n\nThe environments are terribly bland in most areas.  The ground and wall textures are very low resolution most of the time apart from the stone floors of ruins, which have designs and patterns on them.  The character models look great it's just a shame the rest of the world doesn't.  The lack of any foliage and loosely scattered trees was very unexpected coming from a ps4 game.  It would have made the world feel a lot more vibrant even with some more general foliage.\n\nThe animations of monsters outside and (sometimes) inside of battle a very abrupt.  Landing a preemtive strike was nearly impossible for me the first 20 hours of the game until I got used to the jerky animations.  If your playing ToZ vanilla at 30 fps, it can be pretty hard to predict enemy movements in battle.  This is an essencial part of the gameplay mechanics since dodging and blocking at the right moment gives you huge benifits in battle.  Plus playing at 30 fps can be really diffcult since you have even less time to react to the very fast enemy attacks.\n\nI enjoyed interacting with the various party members and listening to their mediocre (but punny dialogue).  On the other hand the gameworld itself has very few ways you can interact with it.  Most of the interactable objects throughout the world will be question marks, (???) these are 4 abilities you gain later in the game that help you progress past whatever obstacle was in your way.  Besides talking to people this is your only way to interact with the world.  This system reminds me of a metroidvania style game but very, VERY, poorly done.   Press a direction on the d-pad, and you've solved the puzzle.\n\nSorry for the little rant, just though it would be important for people to understand some of the issues with this game, although I would recommend it for its combat.","December 3, 2015","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only way I could get this game to run is with a 3rd party community patch. A game IMHO should never be released in any such form! You have been warned. Go to the discussion board and get the community patch first.\n\nI have trouble reviewing this game because it divides me so much.\n\nI'll start with the positives by saying the game has a fantastic story and set of characters. All characters (annoying or not) are voiced well and likeable. The story is complex and so are the characters and there is a lot to love when the two coming together. This game does a great job of telling a story, as I think an RPG should.\n\nThe game has lots of great cut scenes, or mini cut scenes called skits. They do a great job of giving characters thoughts, ideas, and expressions in a fun anime like way. It's kind of a unique system that I've never seen and it just adds a lot I think.\n\nThey also have an Anime based on the game in the works, would totally watch.\n\nAs great as the story and character are, which really hold the game together, the game has issues.\n\nEven with the community patch, the game does have some graphical issues during combat. Certain effects cause massive graphical slowdown on a GTX 970, which shouldn't happen. Then again the game wouldn't even run for me without a community patch.\n\nThe camera in the game does not work exactly as you would expect. It turns super slow. You will adapt mostly, but it's just something that is so weird it's worth mentioning because you will battle it all game.\n\nOne thing that was kind of good / bad is you lose a major character like 1/3 of the way through the game. It's not that it really changes anything it's just a really bizarre thing like they started making the game and decided they didn't really want this character to be in the game and then hastily wrote them out. Although the game's director downplays this, it seems almost evident.\n\nThe combat system is overly complex, but here is an “easy mode” if you wish to take some of the complexity out of the game. It gets easier the more you play it but sill takes a bit of time before you can really confidently fight “epic” type monsters and survive. The few strong enemies will clean your clock though, and it drives down the fun value.\n\nThere are a few times where you will not have clear goals and need to basically wander around until you discover where you are suppose to go. Some better hints would be nice rather than wasting literally hours of my time trying to figure out where to go. Wasting players time should not be considered good. It is a tactic used by bad games to extend their play time. It really kills the pacing of the game.\n\n\nTLDR;\nOverall the game is above average in terms of story, and the characters are great. It's a shame however that the game suffers from poor pacing and other problems that really just make it a mediocre game. The game tries to do too much and stretches out too long for the content included.\n\nI'd say play it with tempered expectations going in, it's an interesting game but it's not going to probably make your “greatest RPGs ever” list.","January 31","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A hero shall come forth, and save us all!" It´s probably debirately made like that to be like a throwback to older games with a "simple and basic" plot. It´s nothing new, but it is executed nicely. Feels old school, made to feel old school. Typical? Yes. But that isn´t the same as bad. I do think that it tries too hard with the "Not everything´s black and white" thing, but it´s plainly obvious to see who´s bad and who´s good.\nAs for the characters, even if some cliché and cookie cutter for some people (see that Sorey´s the typical MC, a goodie two shoes that can´t stand to help others in need), they were made like the story, to feel that type of nostalgia. I personally enjoyed the characters, and specially their chemistry together, and there is memorable characters, and they had some quirks that made them sort of unique. Yes, it may not have better characters than other Tales of games, like Tals of the Abyss, but the cast was enjoyable.\nBattle system didn´t appeal to me much. Just me probably? It´s quite simmilar to Xillia´s, but... The camera angles made it a bit hard to keep up wit the battle, and the armatization made it mandatory for the party to be made of two seraphim and two humans, wich takes away variety.\nSoundtrack was great, but not many tracks are memorable, except maybe the Trial Shrine´s and Artorius Throne´s. The opening (with vocals, as I replaced the instrumental version with it) is one of my favourite Tales of openings. "But it doesn´t fit Tales Of!" Just my taste in music.\nAnimated cut scenes are amazing, but this is Ufotable we´re talking about, so...\nGraphics are one of the best I´ve seen when it comes to JRPGs, and the 30fps lock can be removed with mods. Best Tales Of Graphics so far (obviously, it´s the newest game, so it clearly was gonna have better visuals.)\nAs many flaws it has, it is enjoyable, and a lot of fun. Starting a New Game + will give you a new set of dungeons, and cameos from other entries in the series, wich adds more fun.\n\nIf you like JRPGs, you should really buy this game. Not the best out there, but really enjoyable!

You kind of take this amount of time to get out of the first zone.\nThe overall quality of the game seems good, but not as good as I was wishing for it to be.\nI feel like they could have done a better job with the shading and if you look at some characters, their faces are painted on and it feels just off to see them in their clothing then. The clothes stick out so much, that's not how it should be.\n\nI really like the battle-system in the game, huge variety there for each character. So there is pretty much nothing I can think bad of as of now.\nThe fact that you can find cosmetic items in the standard game is really nice and not only via DLC.\n\nGame runs butter smooth, had no lag issues/frames issues at all and I don't think it will ever get to this point, because the game environment is low poly and only certain characters have high res textures which is fine.\n\nThat's it so far from me, thanks.","November 10, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashrua/recommended/351970/","ashrua","acev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashrua/","71 products in account","As a big fan of the Tales of... series, my excitement for this game maintained its high ranking throughout the year. Finding out it was going to be on Steam definitely interested me, and I have to say that the inclusion of more platforms proved to be a good decision.\n\nIn general, Tales of Zestiria returns to older Tales of... formulas and improves upon the newer battle systems introduced in Tales of Graces, Tales of Xillia, and Tales of Xillia 2. I would honestly say this game contains a good mix of new and old Tales of... games. Tales of Zestiria contains a much more open world than Tales of.. games of late, which was nice to see after the linear world of Graces, Xillia, and Xillia 2. I actually felt like I was exploring vast areas in Zestiria, which really added to the experience. Unfortunately, the world in Tales of Zestiria still feels smaller compared to older Tales of... games, as I don't feel as I'm venturing throughout the world, moreso venturing through a continent. However, this drawback stems from the style the developers are going for, so it's necessarily a system needed to be perfected, rather than a flaw in this particular game.\n\nThe battle system in Tales of Zestiria certainly expands on Tales of Graces rather than Tales of Xillia, as evidenced by the lack of TP or another MP-based battle system. In addition, A-Artes and B-Artes return as Martial Artes and Hidden Artes for humans, and Hidden Artes and Seraphic Artes for Seraphim. This makes the battle system seem awfully familiar to Tales of Graces, and really, it's a fun system. In addition, the game allows Seraphim and Humans to combine, creating a stronger playable entity which will completely destroy certain enemies. This game isn't easy unless you master this battle system, so the overpowered entity really assists the difficulty curve. Unfortunately, the camera definitely does not agree with many battles, and while the seamless transition from field to battle is nice, I don't believe the game was ready for that transition until the camera issue was solved.\n\nThe overall gameplay system also really expands upon itself, mainly stemming from the fusion system. The fusion system in this game, which allows one to work with different skills, really expands upon the battle system. The goal to becoming stronger in this game lies more in what skills one has, rather than how much attack or defense a certain piece of equipment holds. Until one learns this system, the game can be penalizing on harder difficulties.\n\nThere's so much more I could talk about, but really, it all comes down to personal preference. Tales of Zestiria really boils down to whether one wants to have a fun time playing an RPG with a fun action battle system, or not. While I found the story to be entertaining, I can see why many don't care for it, as it's a commonplace Tales of.. game story. However, the characters are enjoyable to watch, the story was fun to watch unfold, and the gameplay was phenomenal. I definitely recommend this game if you enjoyed any other Tales of... game, or if you enjoy real-time battle systems.","October 29, 2015","true","68.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After beating it I can fully review it and how it is without missing out on anything.\n\nThe game is perfect, great story, characters, exploration, and even bosses are great.  The side missions are nice, the ruins are each good in their own ways, some people say they look the same.  However to defend that they were built around the same time in the game and they are each connected so yeah.  The gameplay is nice, I wanted to finish it for NG+ mode so I went through on normal.  Monster and boss levels are pretty high even for normal, but overall its a nice experience.  I play to play in higher difficulties on my next play through.\n\nItems are great, there are so many to choose and use for your equipment.  Fusing weapons is new and awesome, it really makes a different to upgrade and keep older weapons.  Other than that there are really no cons to the game, just play it and enjoy the story.  If you have any issues or bugs the community hub has a huge list of fixes for you.  So buy the game if your thinking about it, because its a great game and well worth the money.","October 29, 2015","true","49.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you play a game for FPS or ONLY for an amazing story you can safely drop this one.\nIf you, however want to try out an incredible combat system, want to experience likable characters and a good soundtrack you should instantly grab it.\n\n\nStory\nWell you are a normal person who can see Seraphs, invisible humans with elemental powers who are worshiped as goddess due to the lack of people that can see them.\nYou are more or less dragged into to take the burden of the shepherd. A human who can utilize the power of seraphs to defeat the great evil.\n\nStorywise there is not much to it. However its not so much about "i get power and heal/kill all who oppose me" but rather the questions "what will i do if i actually cannot save those who are fallen into evilness" and "What actions will i do and how will it change me".\n\nThere are many loose ends and alot isnt well explained (if any information is available at all).\nThings supposedly seem very important tp the story but then are not touched again in any way. You mightt get the feeling that the story isnt well presented or written.\n\nIt gets the passing mark, but nothing more in this regard.\n\n\nGraphics\nI dont care. Its 30 FPS locked. I dont care. Some do. It looks amazing in my opinion, but my standards seems to be to low for some guys out there. So i will not drag this out any further.\n\n\nCombat System\nYou have the typical Tales-of action combat system, in which you control one character of your 4-people party in a 3D environment and blast out combo attacks. The other characters are controlled by an AI which can be given general guidelines.\nThe focus here is similar to Tales of Graces. The main focus is to dodge and wait for opportunities to start combos while the martial artes of humans are layed in a tiered fashion.\n\nThere are several types of attacks (calles arte) which cancel each other out the same way as rock, paper, scissors. These types are martial artes, hidden artes and seraphic artes.\nFurthermore attacks every arte an elemental or type weakness and may inflict a status alignment.\n\nThe bosses usually 1-hits any character, so dodging is a necessity for being successful. Problem arises for AI-controlled which rarlx manage to do so.\nAlot micromanagement is necessary in higher difficukties.\n\nFurthermore apart from the already mentioned there is another key mechanic : armetization.\nThis is a fusion of one of your human characters with a seraph character into a mighty warrior.\nThis form, despite being powerful, complements the beforementioned rock, paper, scissor mechanic. While humans can do martial artes and hidden artes and seraph can do martial artes and seraphic artes an artetization can do hidden artes and seraphic artes.\n\nOveral there are many things i didnt touch in my explanation. The overal complexity ranges from overly complex to being button smashing depending on difficulty.\n\n\nEquipment\nThe equipment system is rather interesting. Some say its overly complicated. It may be if you restrict yourself to ingame information and dont acknowledge external infos. The really important things are explained but are a bit misleading worded.\n\nBasically each equipment item can only be wield by certain characters. Each equipment has 4 slots of potential skills (attack +4%, +15% against beast enemies and so on). While the first slot is fixed for all items with this name the other 3 are random and can be manipulated.\nEach skill represents a slot on a skill-board. Stacking the same skill or chaining skills vertically or horizontally wield special bonusses. Thats basically it. The thing most people dont get is how the 3 changable slots in each equipment can be manipulated.\nThis can be achieved by fusing same equipments together. These fusions follow strict rules and are by no means random. Yet you can easily get certain gear with specific skills without understanding one specific rule.\n\nThis all may sound complicated but its really only a small (unimportant) part which is confusing about this system.\n\nOverall you can compose your equipment supporting your playing style and there is no "best" equipment (and that are not empty words!)\n\n\nOther things\nRegarding soundtrack : some think its below Tales average, some think its above Tales average. In my opinion is a below Tales average still an above JRPG average. Especially 2-3 tracks are within of my top 10 list.\n\nRegarding Gradeshop : typical in tales of games is the gradeshop for NewGame+ after defeating the final boss (or continue in post game stuff and then start anew). Depending on the things you did in your playthrough you can purchase bonuses for your next playthrough. Notable things are double/triple experience and double gald (=gold) for fights. There are others too. It only adds to your experience and is overall fun.\n\nRegarding Difficulty : There are initally 4 difficulties. You can unlock 2 harder difficulties by fighting enough battles on the current highest difficulty. The battles are intense on high difficulty and especially regarding boss fights you will get a hard fight. However thats mostly because AI controlled chars are dying to often. But you will die often enough too, so dont worry! ;)\n\nRegarding Minigames and Quest : There are no minigames.\n\nRegarding Skits : Skits are conversations between characters discussion story events or the cooking tips and other (storywise) trivial things. They are fun to watch and you get a good laugh here and there.\n\nRegarding Customization : Characters can change outfits and get attachments greatly changing the visual appearance in combat, field and ingame events (except the drawn anime cutscenes). Its fun even though i avoided it for the first playthrough. The amount is ok, however alot of things are hidden behind DLCs.\n\n\nTL;DR\nIts a game with some sort of bland story and visuals. However the combat and interesting equipment system makes up for it (plenty!).\nIn my opinion its an immersive game and i will probably play it 300+ hours to get great gear and do every thing. Then i will most likly just start anew to experience to game from scratch on highest difficulty without bonuses.\n\nIts literally a long time ago since i bought a game that is so rewarding for me.\n\nSo : thumbs up since first minute! Never regreted buying it.\n\n\nHoping to see older Tales games (like Vesperia) and the new ones on steam too in the next years.","November 9, 2015","true","87.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, I don't like it quite as much as Tales of Xillia 1, but it still is a very good game.\n\nOne thing I dislike in the entire genre is everyone thinking they have to come up with new fancy stuff which then leads to battle/equip/crafting/character systems which are way too complicated to be fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiltheend/recommended/351970/","Tiltheend","Scoot the Burbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiltheend/","77 products in account","First off, I'd like to say this is a tentative recommendation. Buy it only if you are a major jrpg / tales fan or it is on sale.\nI'll add that I'm a huge fan, starting like most fans with Symphonia. Anyhow, I'll split this into the good and the bad so you can make your own summary.\n\nThe GoodGraphics - Obviously, the graphics are a pretty big step up being the first Tales game to land on a new platform and PC as well. They've clearly done their best to make sure the character models are both pretty and expressive. Personally, I really hope they continue make the model more animated, it really is a nice touch. The environments, especially the greenery tends to look very nice.\n\nMusic - Honestly, a lot of the music in the game is fairly non-descript. It serves it's purpose as BGM. However, there are a few key pieces by Go Shiina that completely blow everything else out of the water. Don't know who that is? Doesn't matter - you'll recognize this music the second you hear it. It is used sparingly in some of the most key moments of the game. It is so well done, that it might be the best music I've ever heard in a Jrpg.\n\nOpen World - Tales has been building to this for a while. While Xillia came close, it couldn't quite shake the feeling of fields just being corridors between dungeons and towns. Zestiria has the most realized overworld so far. They are truly huge - maybe too big.  Some fields feel ludicrously huge, such that it take quite a while just to cross back from one direction from the other, with not much in between,\n\nBadThe Gameplay - This is the big 'but'. The battle system is obviously derivative of Graces. This isn't a bad thing - Graces is widely regarded as the best combat in the series - but honestly the combat system would've worked fine if it was just that. But one thing ruins it, that is armatization. With armitization, battles are reduced to just button bashing for victory. This is a shame, because the base combat system does have some interesting complexities. I often found myself ignoring it just so I could enjoy a battle more. Unfortunately, this often has the effect of dragging out already long boss fights even longer. Bosses often feel like they have a ludicrously high amount of HP.\n\nThe Party - This is likely one to irk RPG fans the most. If you're familiar with the tales system, you normally receive 7 party members in total and can construct any party you want out of them. For this game, you're forced to have two certain characters in your party for the entire game (sans moments where they are removed from your party for story reasons). The other two will likely be determined by the enemies elemental resistances.\n\nThe Camera - Zestiria made the bold decision to have battles take place dynamically in your current environment. While a cool idea in practice, this means that the battles are entire optimized for the area. This will result in the camera getting stuck on almost anything. Walls, enemies, even trees. While some attempt has been made to fix it, there's only so much that can be done for it. This will be a perpetual annoyance.\n\nAnime Cutscenes -This is more of a personal thing than anything, but the anime custscenes are sort of a strange holdover from older tales games. In the current state of technology, they simply don't seem necessary any longer. They used to be used to show events that couldn't be performed using the in game engine, but should be perfectly possible now. Honestly, they just seem rather jarring to the flow of the story where they pop in.\n\nDungeons - I don't have much to say except: jesus christ stop making so many of the dungeons be the same cave with a slightly different layout. It's overused to a ridiculous amount in this game.\n\nYou might've noticed there's something I haven't mentioned - The story and the characters. That's because they are very decidedly average. The narrative feels very cheesy in a way I can only compare to Graces. The characters oftentimes only feel like caricatures. Compared to the strong character and story in past Tales games, this is a big let down.\n\nI'd like to make one final point before I end this, that is, the localization. This time, it felt very definitively different.  There were noticably a few 'internet voice actors' included, which may be a positive or negative for you, but I felt was very stiff and lacking, especially as one of them plays a main character. Finally, please stop with the memes. It's terrible. Memes and immersion don't belong in the same sentence.","December 27, 2015","true","76.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/recommended/351970/","mahodo","General Lee Aroused","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahodo/","1002 products in account","One of the weaker mothership Tales of games in the series, right next to Tales of Symphonia 2. Continuing the tradition of introducing something really cool in its previous mothership title (in this case, Xillia/Xillia 2's dual raid battle system), but choosing to not take any of its successful elements and incorporate new experimental elements that is rather shakey in its introduction. It did take Graces F's/Destiny's unique style shift battle system, but severely limiting its options through poor choices, one of which was initially not displaying a numerical value of SC required to attack with a specific move while in battle. This makes judging the cost of which combos you want to pull off to a rather vague sense of estimation, though this can be helped by just keeping your SC high (admittedly not a good design choice though).\n\nThe premise so far for the initial story is interesting, but only for the first 2 hours of the game. You play as Sorey (or later Rose), the main character and the chosen Shepard who pulls out the sacred sword (AKA Excalibur) and is given the task of purifying the world of yomas and unify the human and seraphim race into cohabitation. There's a few parts of the story here and there that try to emulate a moral choice, something Xillia 2 did well, but only because it had a silent main character. Zestiria's main character has a clear personaility and when picking a choice, it didn't seem to have much impact as the character simply brushes it off with an ugly "EH" kind of feeling. Gee, for a hero, you're kinda hard to like. The moral choices presented are also pretty weird, for example, you can fix a bridge with earth magic, but you are given a choice, do you want to fix it in front of the people in distress to try to be a hero symbol, or do it when everyone leaves? I choose the "look really cool in front of everyone" and only ONE PERSON reacted with an "oh, okay". Then everyone tells me I was wrong to try to inspire people that there is hope in piety because they would instead take me for a monster that is trying to help them. Goddammit, what do you people want from me.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Utilizing divine weapons as a focus, your human characters can basically temporarily fuse with your seraphim party members to create a new combat form depending on fusion members, something akin to Digimon. Pretty neat, but I wish the fusion character actually looked different for each form, rathern than just a colour pallete and weapon change.\n- Dual audio! Never bad to have a choice, especially when it lets me run away from awkward English dub, its usually a hit or miss on the voice acting charts (such as Abyss and Symphonia being superior in English over Japanese).\n- Pretty decent PC port, was rather shakey at the start, but easily fixable if you look around. Japanese games rarely have good PC ports, so this was a surprise.\n\nCONS:\n- A weird varying degree of difficulty at the start. Normal enemies are incredibly easy fights that they last only 12-16 seconds on moderate difficulty, but boss fights demolish you in 2-3 hits and take a lot longer. I tried to remedy this by bumping up the difficulty on the field for normal encounters, then down for boss encounters, but not all boss fight encounters are obvious. Difficulty level need some proper balancing to make them fun by lasting long enough, but not ridiculously hard, especially with AI party members.\n- A horrible, horrible, horrible equipment system. Equipment now have random stats and random skills within a certain algorithm that makes it a chore to choose. Not only that, you'll have to do a weapon crafting system by basically fusing the same weapons to make it better, though not all combinations are an improvement as it doesn't display what skills the gear would get until after. Frustrating.\n- Has chosen the poorly done road of forced party members, limiting customization, strategies, and playstyle. You HAVE to have two human characters in your party to fight as a full four, otherwise you will only fight with two. This is pretty annoying, especially when the one human female keeps leaving at random points in the game (and later on NEVER COMING BACK, what the hell, I thought you were the heroine that wants to get their hands dirty to help save the world). I just want my magic knight class back.\n- No jumping in combat. Yep. Goodbye super awesome aerial combos.\n- Characters aren't really likable, they're pretty stiff and stereotypical in their archetype. Hell, Graces F had one of the worse stories, but better (well, selectively) characters that are much more well liked. Jade is top tier husbando material and Pascal is top tier waifu material that forgets who you are.\n- Combat now happens in where you encountered the enemy, rather than taking you to a seperate closed off, but cleared area. This makes it a seamless transition, only...not all areas of the game is designed for combat. More often than not, your camera will get stuck in a wall and you will be forced to look at the ground. Camera control is absolutely rubbish, it completely focuses on your target, rather than zooming out to have view of both your character and the target, leaving you sometimes to be lost, camera stuck in the wall, or the ground, or all of the above.\n- Skits (where characters talk amongst each other on certain situations or points of the story) seem to have been cut down significantly, only happening at save points or map points of interest. Kind of lost the flavour of character interaction and development.\n\nOverall, there's a lot more in the cons section than the pros, but thats only because I've played Tales of games since I was a kid, I had a lot of experience of which one were good and clicked with me and ones that didn't, so don't let the small pros to cons ratio fool you. The game is okay, a solid 6/10, kind of bueno, but nothing that will ever top Tales of Symphonia, Vesperia, or Abyss, the latter being my most favourite for its characters, story, and character development (please play the PS2 version, the 3DS adds nothing but a smaller screen to look at). This game is worth looking into, but probably better to pick it up at a sale, spend the rest of your money on previously mentioned Tales of games for a better experience.\n\nP.S. Namco Bandai, please learn how to properly manage your promotional materials, falsely advertising that Alisha is the main heroine then ditch her in favour of someone else and then blaming the fanbase for their misconception is bad, especially when she was everywhere with Sorey when the game was first announced. The game characters even thought they had started to develop romantic feelings for each other, so much as to visit each other's room at night. If thats not misleading, then I don't know what is.","October 27, 2015","true","57.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Last but not least I would play this with a controller. I am using a DS4 which has a slight issue with this game. Sometimes while still connected to the program I use to use it, it will just stop working in game until I plug it in. 3rd party problem most likely the cause. (I believe that even though this is the only game I have had it happen in.)\n\nAll in all, I think this game should be a must play for anyone who enjoys RPGs.\n\nP.S. All your Edna belongs to me!\n\nPros -\nCharacters\nStory\nGameplay\nDifficulty (Can go from Hello Kitty Adventure Island to Dark Souls NG+)\nSoundtrack\nReally I find almost no flaws maybe a few slight bugs here or there but it's far from an Electronic Artholes launch.\n\nCons -\nCamera can sometimes get stuck in goofy positions when in corridors.\n\nWill update upon finish but as it sits this is turning into a classic status for me much like Symphonia did.","October 29, 2015","true","71.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sora210/recommended/351970/","sora210","Long Dong Never Die","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sora210/","629 products in account","I can recomend this game, but it does have a few issues.  Most of the other reviews explain what is great about this game very well.    So in this review I'm going to summerize the major issues.   I feel these issues hurt the game-feel and break immersion.  Hopefully this could help people determine wheather this game is still worth it to them.  My biggest gripes with this game are down to the  environments, animations, gameworld interactivity.\n\nThe environments are terribly bland in most areas.  The ground and wall textures are very low resolution most of the time apart from the stone floors of ruins, which have designs and patterns on them.  The character models look great it's just a shame the rest of the world doesn't.  The lack of any foliage and loosely scattered trees was very unexpected coming from a ps4 game.  It would have made the world feel a lot more vibrant even with some more general foliage.\n\nThe animations of monsters outside and (sometimes) inside of battle a very abrupt.  Landing a preemtive strike was nearly impossible for me the first 20 hours of the game until I got used to the jerky animations.  If your playing ToZ vanilla at 30 fps, it can be pretty hard to predict enemy movements in battle.  This is an essencial part of the gameplay mechanics since dodging and blocking at the right moment gives you huge benifits in battle.  Plus playing at 30 fps can be really diffcult since you have even less time to react to the very fast enemy attacks.\n\nI enjoyed interacting with the various party members and listening to their mediocre (but punny dialogue).  On the other hand the gameworld itself has very few ways you can interact with it.  Most of the interactable objects throughout the world will be question marks, (???) these are 4 abilities you gain later in the game that help you progress past whatever obstacle was in your way.  Besides talking to people this is your only way to interact with the world.  This system reminds me of a metroidvania style game but very, VERY, poorly done.   Press a direction on the d-pad, and you've solved the puzzle.\n\nSorry for the little rant, just though it would be important for people to understand some of the issues with this game, although I would recommend it for its combat.","December 3, 2015","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I wasn't playing second player off of my friend's ps4 and played single player on PC I quickly realized this game is much better solo as it realies on the armatization and seraphim for the majority of the games combat and that the main character Sorey ultimately becomes more likable after the first anime cutscene. I can think back to my favorite tales of game in the series; Symphonia and the main character Lloyd Irving. Now Lloyd wasn't the brightest guy and hell he couldn't even make a sandwhich, but what he lacked in sharp smarts he made up with his undying morally strong ideals. He believed in a world in which everyone could live happy and that no one was born for the sole purpose of dying. I have to say a little bit of Lloyd I can see in Sorey even if he isn't my favorite character in the game (Edna). So the point is if you like RPGs and you never played or know of the tales of series, definately give this one a try.","October 23, 2015","true","57.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A hero shall come forth, and save us all!" It´s probably debirately made like that to be like a throwback to older games with a "simple and basic" plot. It´s nothing new, but it is executed nicely. Feels old school, made to feel old school. Typical? Yes. But that isn´t the same as bad. I do think that it tries too hard with the "Not everything´s black and white" thing, but it´s plainly obvious to see who´s bad and who´s good.\nAs for the characters, even if some cliché and cookie cutter for some people (see that Sorey´s the typical MC, a goodie two shoes that can´t stand to help others in need), they were made like the story, to feel that type of nostalgia. I personally enjoyed the characters, and specially their chemistry together, and there is memorable characters, and they had some quirks that made them sort of unique. Yes, it may not have better characters than other Tales of games, like Tals of the Abyss, but the cast was enjoyable.\nBattle system didn´t appeal to me much. Just me probably? It´s quite simmilar to Xillia´s, but... The camera angles made it a bit hard to keep up wit the battle, and the armatization made it mandatory for the party to be made of two seraphim and two humans, wich takes away variety.\nSoundtrack was great, but not many tracks are memorable, except maybe the Trial Shrine´s and Artorius Throne´s. The opening (with vocals, as I replaced the instrumental version with it) is one of my favourite Tales of openings. "But it doesn´t fit Tales Of!" Just my taste in music.\nAnimated cut scenes are amazing, but this is Ufotable we´re talking about, so...\nGraphics are one of the best I´ve seen when it comes to JRPGs, and the 30fps lock can be removed with mods. Best Tales Of Graphics so far (obviously, it´s the newest game, so it clearly was gonna have better visuals.)\nAs many flaws it has, it is enjoyable, and a lot of fun. Starting a New Game + will give you a new set of dungeons, and cameos from other entries in the series, wich adds more fun.\n\nIf you like JRPGs, you should really buy this game. Not the best out there, but really enjoyable! If you want to get into Tales of, maybe this is where you should start.","December 13, 2015","true","69.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A hero shall come forth, and save us all!" It´s probably debirately made like that to be like a throwback to older games with a "simple and basic" plot. It´s nothing new, but it is executed nicely. Feels old school, made to feel old school. Typical? Yes. But that isn´t the same as bad. I do think that it tries too hard with the "Not everything´s black and white" thing, but it´s plainly obvious to see who´s bad and who´s good.\nAs for the characters, even if some cliché and cookie cutter for some people (see that Sorey´s the typical MC, a goodie two shoes that can´t stand to help others in need), they were made like the story, to feel that type of nostalgia. I personally enjoyed the characters, and specially their chemistry together, and there is memorable characters, and they had some quirks that made them sort of unique. Yes, it may not have better characters than other Tales of games, like Tals of the Abyss, but the cast was enjoyable.\nBattle system didn´t appeal to me much. Just me probably? It´s quite simmilar to Xillia´s, but... The camera angles made it a bit hard to keep up wit the battle, and the armatization made it mandatory for the party to be made of two seraphim and two humans, wich takes away variety.\nSoundtrack was great, but not many tracks are memorable, except maybe the Trial Shrine´s and Artorius Throne´s. The opening (with vocals, as I replaced the instrumental version with it) is one of my favourite Tales of openings. "But it doesn´t fit Tales Of!" Just my taste in music.\nAnimated cut scenes are amazing, but this is Ufotable we´re talking about, so...\nGraphics are one of the best I´ve seen when it comes to JRPGs, and the 30fps lock can be removed with mods. Best Tales Of Graphics so far (obviously, it´s the newest game, so it clearly was gonna have better visuals.)\nAs many flaws it has, it is enjoyable, and a lot of fun. Starting a New Game + will give you a new set of dungeons, and cameos from other entries in the series, wich adds more fun.\n\nIf you like JRPGs, you should really buy this game. Not the best out there, but really enjoyable!

However, I wouldn't say there's anything special about it. As a Tales game, it's probably one of the weaker ones. What I liked was that it was surprisingly dark. Children die, often the only redemption possible for people is through death, light doesn't triumph over dark, and humanity is generally awful. It makes for a really nice change. So, if you like JRPGs and the Tales series you will probably like this. It also has puns. The sheer amount they manage to fit in should be commended.\n\nDetailed:\n\nThe overarching plot is very simple, a village boy leaves home for the first time and is later tasked with defeating the Big Bad, which is done through trials to get the power necessary. Where this game shines is in its characters. Maybe due to the game's battle mechanics, but every character feels necessary. They also have unique personalities and their personal stories are explored throughout the game. The voice acting is decent and you really learn to love the characters. However if you play with English audio you'll frequently notice the character will stop talking but their sprite's mouth keeps moving for a good five seconds, which can be annoying.\n\nThe battle system can be pretty complicated at first, but it's very smooth once you get used to it. The new enemies are called 'hellions' and your job is to purify them (which gameplay-wise is just defeat them). There's the usual fire, water, earth, wind strong/weak system, but the hellions also have their own categories to consider. For example, a hellion might be a beast type, and you can get equipment which is more effective against beasts. The unique battle system here is 'Armatisation', where you combine with another person to get more HP and special powers. Combat can be challenging as often you can't just hack and slash your way through battles. but the amazing invention of the quick step (back step, front step and side step) make them feel fun.\n\nThe worst part of combat is the camera. Sometimes, it's a real ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf you're not smart, like me, the equipment system is very complicated. The basics are given to you, but its only through skits a lot of the information explained. To put it simply, one piece of equipment can have a maximum of 4 skills on it. You fuse equipment together to make it stronger and get better/different skills. By doing so, you can comfortably take on enemies which are 5-10 levels higher than you. There's also another dynamic, all about bonus skills which comes from E-Unions and links and other nonsense, but you don't need to know it well to play the game. Just randomly fusing everything together works well enough.\n\nIf you like skits, this game does have them, but they're only viewable in certain places and it's quite easy to miss some. My advice is to frequently stay at inns.\n\nRegarding the New Game+, the best thing to do to is to make sure your Lords of the Lands are at the highest level you can be bothered to get them to. Their level affects how many points you get at the end of the game, which affects what bonus things you get in New Game+. However, there is a lot of replayability in this game, like all Tales, as you get bonus dungeons and bosses.\n\nAs this game isn't as popular as the others, if you encounter any problems you will often struggle to find a solution and wind up having to work it out yourself. For example, I accidentally activated local co-op (which is only in battle) but I had no idea how I'd done it and there was no support anywhere which told me how to turn it on, let alone turn it off (FYI, you have to change whether their moves are auto, semi-auto or manual in the artes menu).\n\nOtherwise, it's okay.","May 25","true","138.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its writing isn't very adult orientated but satisfying in the same tone that a pixar movie can be. It's definitly on my to do list of games to finish as what I have played so far is incredibly entertaining. The game does kind of hold your hand, but its because this game knows its audience. The audience is looking for a challanging witcher 3 esque rpg play. It's looking for a story. A story that not only brings about a sense of child-like wonder, but a story that entralls the user to feel emotion.  I have to recommend this game simply for its reminding of great rpg's i played as a kid, as well as the great non-adult anime's i enjoyed as a child. Its just a refreshing throwback game, that makes any oldschool rpg player happy to play it.","May 12","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having 9 to 5 jobs, a kid who needs attention and household chores tend to do that to you, heh.\n\nAnyway, this would be my fifth Tales of - games since I entirely skipped PS3 Tales games library. I do tend to have Vesperia and Abyss standard concerning this franchise, and it ends up undermining (imho) other Tales games since Vesperia did almost everything so well with its stories, characters, and overall gameplay.\n\nNow, Tales of Zestiria is not bad, per se. But it somehow lacks in some areas. Don't get me wrong, the combat is great, that has been the highlights of Tales series RPGs, and it is, in my opinion, the best aspect of the game. I like the Normin system, weapon crafting (or fusion), how the world is presented in the game, and the graphics is quite good. The game runs flawlessly on my GTX 950M, where I played it mostly (my GTX 970 rig is not actually portable). The main flaw of this game, maybe the for most of the Tales of - games is the story and how it is told. Zestiria somehow has this problem. The characters are quite likable, but I can't help feeling that there should be more character development. And some EXPLICIT romance would be nice. But that's just me.\n\nI have to mention that the music in this game is superb. Especially on the Trial shrines and opening Japanese movie. There are numerous tracks, and battle musics somehow just pump up the already hectic battle system. Some would argue that it's all about button mashing, but without proper strategy and just pushing buttons haphazardly one would not get the best out of its intricate battles system. Oh, and be careful when fighting in tight spaces. The camera angle just goes bonkers in those cases.\n\nLastly, I cannot overlook how the game initially delivered. I'm talking about stuttering, choppy frame rate and audio problems. I have no problem with 30 fps, really, although I do prefer it to be in the sixties. It has all been fixed as of this review, but the bulk of the fix comes in the form of a third party patch. I REALLY think Bandai Namco can do better. I hope Berseria will not have these problems.\n\nAll in all, a good game, but I would say that it comes up short in some of the key aspects. I do recommend this for all Tales fans and Action JRPG fans. For newcomers to the series this would not be a bad start, but I do think they should start with the other games in the series.\n\nFinal score: 7.5/10","May 17","true","85.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a good mix of light hearted fun and character development, plus  I was always wanting to explore and uncover the story.The variety of enemies and optional boss fights and dungeons really helped extend my playtime. The character interactions were a treat as well. There is at least one good Wifu.\n\nThere are a few things though that really makes the game suffer.\n1.The weapon mechiancs of the game (Fusions) are pretty uninteresting, reading  around it looks like no one really gave a crap about them and you dont need to pay any attention to them to beat the game\n2. The difficulty settings were really a step in the wrong direction, the harder the difficulty you select for the game,the less EXP you will earn,you will earn more gald but you will just spend more time farming enemies to get to a higher level, the only challenge this creates is whether or not you have the patience to keep playing the same things over.\n3. I guess this was a big deal in Japan and resulted in the game getting enormous refunds, you dont get the best wifu..in  fact she's only with your party for a short time and then thats it...\n4. If you don't get the DLC for free or less then a few dollars, you are going to have a very disappointing time\n\nOverall if the game drops to a fair price like $20-25 , I would say without a doubt get it, you should enjoy it!","January 31","true","139.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are quite likable, but I can't help feeling that there should be more character development. And some EXPLICIT romance would be nice. But that's just me.\n\nI have to mention that the music in this game is superb. Especially on the Trial shrines and opening Japanese movie. There are numerous tracks, and battle musics somehow just pump up the already hectic battle system. Some would argue that it's all about button mashing, but without proper strategy and just pushing buttons haphazardly one would not get the best out of its intricate battles system. Oh, and be careful when fighting in tight spaces. The camera angle just goes bonkers in those cases.\n\nLastly, I cannot overlook how the game initially delivered. I'm talking about stuttering, choppy frame rate and audio problems. I have no problem with 30 fps, really, although I do prefer it to be in the sixties. It has all been fixed as of this review, but the bulk of the fix comes in the form of a third party patch. I REALLY think Bandai Namco can do better. I hope Berseria will not have these problems.\n\nAll in all, a good game, but I would say that it comes up short in some of the key aspects. I do recommend this for all Tales fans and Action JRPG fans. For newcomers to the series this would not be a bad start, but I do think they should start with the other games in the series.\n\nFinal score: 7.5/10","May 17","true","85.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many reviewers say that this game does not do much to inovate, but I have to disagree. They completely revamped the open world design. Made the entire game more seamless in design. Towns are bigger and the combat is my favorite so far in series. On the subjective side of things I personally enjoyed the characters in the story just fine. The only real con I can think of is the battle camera. The camera does have some problems, but it is not that bad. The camera occasionally gets caught on terrain, but this does not happen frequently.\n\nAll in all, i thought this was a great addition to the series and I would reccomend it strongly.\n8/10","December 6, 2015","true","44.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Since it registers all controllers as an "xbox" controller it made setting keys with generic pc controllers a slightly bigger pain. They work fine, but whenever someone needs to review their keys or rather show them to a friend to play with the co-op mode, the displayed keys are rather useless.\n\nAs for the in-game content itself, the gameplay has been interesting. Definitely a new twist to the old Tales combat system where a player had to juggle maintaining tp to active artes by constantly using jabs. The new system allows one to always have a supply of "tp" or rather SC available.\n\nThe armatization is a fun little extra mode but personally I find it overpowered. It's quite easy to run headfirst into battle mashing keys and then using armatization to revive/reposition oneself. Also the Armatization's ability to revive Sorey combined with the seraphs ability to have free revival over times makes death less punishing (which for some could be a pro I suppose). This makes it hard for a player to actually get a game over. The only reason why player tends to reset a battle is because they end it without everyone being up at the same time.\n\nStory wise, nothing too spectacular or grande. It's not bad, just not exceptional. The little tidbits you get from having Seraph's perspective makes the sub-content enjoyable though so that's a plus.\n\nIn summary -\nPros:\n- Solid gameplay as expected of Tales\n- Interesting subevents and humour\n- Lots of content that are not exceptionally annoying to do or gain access to\n- The promise of a new battle system has been delivered\n- VA for both Languages are solid\n\nCons:\n- Combat is a little too easy with all the free revives\n- Controller display buttons useless for people who don't use Xbox controllers\n- Story is a little bland could have been delivered better","November 1, 2015","true","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The combat is takes a bit getting use to and seem complicated at first.  The 30 fps cap is really noticeable during combat, theres a slight lag in the input.

I felt as though my library was in need of more JRPG's and I made a bold choice purchasing ToZ without any idea of what the game was about or any insight of what to expect it was a pure jump in the deep end which luckily paid off.\nI won't lie, the game is not perfect, I felt the story wasn't as rich as it could have been but the gameplay was flawless, the character interaction as good and I really enjoyed the battle system even though at first it felt a bit overwhelming you quickly pick things up as you go along.\n\nStory\nThe story is about a teenage human boy named Sorey who has lived amongst seraphim (beings with power unseen by natural humans) since he was a baby, events transpire that takes him on a quest in search for an unknown force that is causing great malevolence (a darkness that is created by the evil within humans and seraphim), taking on the role as the Shepard (ancient heroes that can take on the power of seraphim and purify the world of malevolence) he crosses the world with his companions bringing peace and light to all.\n\nI felt the story as a whole was written well, it was straight forward and left no questions unanswered.\n7/10\n\nCharacters\nWithout giving too much away of possible playable characters I won't name them all but in total you get a party of 6 players which of only 3 or 4 may battle.\n\nCharacter development is my biggest problem regarding to the characters, I just didn't really feel emotionally attached to any of them as much as I should do when playing an JRPG (That FF7 moment with Aeris still haunts me to this day), not to say the characters are boring or flat in fact the characters Edna and Zaveid will probably go down as some of my favourite, again that is all I can say about that without ruining a part of the game.\n\nThe quirky interactions they have during battle or when resting in inns is brilliant and does bring some light hearted comedy into the equation which makes sleeping at the inn worthwhile!\nI enjoyed the characters and found some parts amusing however I do feel as though the characters could have been developed a bit better to give the players more of an emotional attachment.\n6/10\n\nGameplay\nThe game handles well, probably what you'd expect from a JRPG, open world exploration countless battles, be prepared for ultimate grinding I was taken into a false sense of security in thinking levelling up was easy until I hit break point and spent ages farming exp (and gald, plenty of gald).\n\nThe weapon system is easy enough to understand and with fusion if you start to horde weapon equipment (as long as they are the same item) you can fuse them together (for a price of course) making the weapons stronger and transferring any abilities they may have.\n\nThe use of Artes is easy, again once you get the knack it's a case of carefully coordinating your attacks leading to some killer combos!\n\nOne thing which is also helpful are across the world are these things called stone monolith's which when interacted with just give basic tips on the game itself, if like me and you're not a fan of this then you really don't need to read them but you do collect AP points which become helpful as you use these to spend on battle actions.\n\nBattle Actions are a series of automated instructions you can give to the main protagonist Sorey, things like Auto backstep which (obviously) automatically backstep evades attacks at the cost of some SP points, which I think stands for Stamina points?\n\nThe battle camera is probably THE worse aspect of the game, it can become annoying when pinned into a corner and the camera zooms right into the battle and then to make matters worse a tree branch gets into your line of sight, it's very frustrating and has killed me a few times, I'd like to say you get used to it but you don't you just learn not to get pinned into a corner. Even when it's not zooming in its spinning out of control, it sometimes feels someone is recording the battle on a mobile phone or video camera and can't keep still, I'd like to point out it's not always like that though, but when it does you will rage.\n\nThe gameplay is great and my favourite thing about the game but it loses points on the battle camera part which is a shame.\n9/10\n\n\nI feel as though I've covered most things vital, Tales of Zestiria is a must have for any JRPG lover, I've played under 64 hours completed it and now I've started my second play through on Chaos mode (they have a New Game+ feature).\n\n\nOverall score\n7.5/10","November 14, 2015","true","63.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

If you've never played a Tales game before and are an RPG fan, you owe it to yourself to pickup one of the best RPG series you've probably never heard of. The Tales Of games are a series similar to Final Fantasy but have never reached the same level of acclaim due to many of the games not being localized in English or only being released for specific consoles. Despite that, the Tales Of series has been going strong since the SNES days and is one of the greatest RPG series of all time. Combine the action-oriented combat with deep character customization, great narrative and plot, and for the first time ever, branching storylines with choices that impact the game as you play along.\n\nIf you are a Tales fan, you are about to experience one of the best games in the series. I have not beaten the game, and as I said am only 3 hours in, but I will update this review as I progress. But I can already tell this is THE defining game in the series. Want the best of Tales of Graces without the quirky combat, the cool and memorable deep characters from Xillia, the unique story of Phantasia, the epic feeling of Symphonia, and the awesome graphics of Vespiria all in one game? That's what I'm getting from Tales of Zesteria, and at only 3 hours in. There is so much depth to the battle mechanics, titles, equipment, collectibles, skits and more.\n\nYou need to play this game. Technical issues will be ironed out, this is the first PC Tales game... EVER. So they are surely developing on a new platform they haven't worked with before.

Then there's the graphics. I recommend to manually configure the graphics option in your NVIDIA control panel. The game isn't running 60fps (yet) but if configure it properly it runs very smoothly which for me whose sensitive in graphics slowness and lag. This game is very good once the small changes has been made. It's very easy just read the guide for additional help because at first it runs horribly and I know that the developer could have made a better setting than that but don't let those negative reviews fool you. It's a damn good game-- so far.","October 21, 2015","true","52.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When you switch the game to surround sound it's actually creating seperate channels for each audio type and a lot of people are saying they lose the voice sounds.  I plugged in my Logitech Z506 5.1 Surrond Speaker system to my computer it had been sitting stagnant for awhile as soon as i plugged it in and turned them on my voice sounds were coming crystal clear through the center channel with no problems what so ever.  If you're using one of those gaming headset that says Dolby 7.1 surround they only actually have 2 speakers with drivers making them sound like 7.1 so you're not going to get all the sound channels in them stick to stereo for the game.\n\nTo get back on topic.  It's a great game even with the 30 FPS lock combat is just like other tales of games and you will enjoy this game if you purchase it and like JRPG styled games.","October 20, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I love the art style and being a long time Tales of fan I'm always glad to see a new release in the franchise. I was worried I would have so issues running the game, after seeing what people have posted on the forums but my fears were for naught. The game download at a normal speed for my internet, it booted up like a dream. I've played five hours so far but barely scratched the surface. The story has been engaging with laugh out loud moments and some that creeped me out (that fox dude!). I use a rock candy controller and I have had no issues at all with it. There was basically no setup except for selecting keyboard or controller. I've spent a good part of my play time sitting forward with a silly grin on my face.

The gameplay mechanics have evolved with the "Armatization" system and the RPG elements this game have to offer are widly dependent on your equipment and the way you choose to upgrade them. I think these were both great changes made to the game!\n\nOn the downside though...the story is very plain and the characters are very forgettable. I was very dissapointed with this aspect of the game and hope that future installments will improve upon this.\n\nOverall: 7/10","December 4, 2015","true","49.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I felt as though my library was in need of more JRPG's and I made a bold choice purchasing ToZ without any idea of what the game was about or any insight of what to expect it was a pure jump in the deep end which luckily paid off.\nI won't lie, the game is not perfect, I felt the story wasn't as rich as it could have been but the gameplay was flawless, the character interaction as good and I really enjoyed the battle system even though at first it felt a bit overwhelming you quickly pick things up as you go along.\n\nStory\nThe story is about a teenage human boy named Sorey who has lived amongst seraphim (beings with power unseen by natural humans) since he was a baby, events transpire that takes him on a quest in search for an unknown force that is causing great malevolence (a darkness that is created by the evil within humans and seraphim), taking on the role as the Shepard (ancient heroes that can take on the power of seraphim and purify the world of malevolence) he crosses the world with his companions bringing peace and light to all.\n\nI felt the story as a whole was written well, it was straight forward and left no questions unanswered.\n7/10\n\nCharacters\nWithout giving too much away of possible playable characters I won't name them all but in total you get a party of 6 players which of only 3 or 4 may battle.\n\nCharacter development is my biggest problem regarding to the characters, I just didn't really feel emotionally attached to any of them as much as I should do when playing an JRPG (That FF7 moment with Aeris still haunts me to this day), not to say the characters are boring or flat in fact the characters Edna and Zaveid will probably go down as some of my favourite, again that is all I can say about that without ruining a part of the game.\n\nThe quirky interactions they have during battle or when resting in inns is brilliant and does bring some light hearted comedy into the equation which makes sleeping at the inn worthwhile!\nI enjoyed the characters and found some parts amusing however I do feel as though the characters could have been developed a bit better to give the players more of an emotional attachment.\n6/10\n\nGameplay\nThe game handles well, probably what you'd expect from a JRPG, open world exploration countless battles, be prepared for ultimate grinding I was taken into a false sense of security in thinking levelling up was easy until I hit break point and spent ages farming exp (and gald, plenty of gald).\n\nThe weapon system is easy enough to understand and with fusion if you start to horde weapon equipment (as long as they are the same item) you can fuse them together (for a price of course) making the weapons stronger and transferring any abilities they may have.\n\nThe use of Artes is easy, again once you get the knack it's a case of carefully coordinating your attacks leading to some killer combos!\n\nOne thing which is also helpful are across the world are these things called stone monolith's which when interacted with just give basic tips on the game itself, if like me and you're not a fan of this then you really don't need to read them but you do collect AP points which become helpful as you use these to spend on battle actions.\n\nBattle Actions are a series of automated instructions you can give to the main protagonist Sorey, things like Auto backstep which (obviously) automatically backstep evades attacks at the cost of some SP points, which I think stands for Stamina points?\n\nThe battle camera is probably THE worse aspect of the game, it can become annoying when pinned into a corner and the camera zooms right into the battle and then to make matters worse a tree branch gets into your line of sight, it's very frustrating and has killed me a few times, I'd like to say you get used to it but you don't you just learn not to get pinned into a corner. Even when it's not zooming in its spinning out of control, it sometimes feels someone is recording the battle on a mobile phone or video camera and can't keep still, I'd like to point out it's not always like that though, but when it does you will rage.\n\nThe gameplay is great and my favourite thing about the game but it loses points on the battle camera part which is a shame.\n9/10\n\n\nI feel as though I've covered most things vital, Tales of Zestiria is a must have for any JRPG lover, I've played under 64 hours completed it and now I've started my second play through on Chaos mode (they have a New Game+ feature).\n\n\nOverall score\n7.5/10","November 14, 2015","true","63.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"
