I've seen it from it's conception to it's end.\nThe community of this game is unlike any other I've ever encountered in an online group. They are vindictive, rude and destructive to the game. Throughout the entire time I played I suffered no end of trolling, mocking and the like. There were people that literally exploited the kicking function to get me off of servers so I could not play the game I paid for.\nThe issue also lies with the developers whom constantly ignored community begging to get hackers out. Even to this day, after an anti-cheat patch, the game is STILL cracked, people running around with weapons they shouldn't, running fast, swinging faster than is possible. Some people even exploit the bad latency issues to win.\n\nThere's a top 1% in this game, they are not skilled players by any stretch. Instead of skill they got together and figured out what the best ways to exploit the games mechanics. From unblockable hits to builds that were simply insanely unfair, they scared away any new players to the game by trying their best to ruin the fun for others. To this day, even now, I get on and someone is taking my Steam ID name so they can spam vote kicks so I can't play.\n\nStay far, far away from this game. Think of World of Warcraft only cultivated with the worst of the worst (community) possible. The truth is I enjoyed this game but the playerbase was hellbent on seeing it go under. You have honest, fun people who are endlessly frustrated by the trolls, hackers and exploiters.\n\nThere is no welcome mat here, just a gigantic letdown.","May 29, 2015","false","966.5"," 467 of 500 people (93%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","93","467","500","36","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMagicalFace/recommended/42160/","TheMagicalFace","Magical Face","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMagicalFace/","190 products in account","This game honestly has long since been out of it's prime and is now dying slowly of stupidity and poor decision making. I'll highlight a few points to make things clear.\n\nThe Devs (and their decisions):\n\n-War of the Roses's original devs were Fatshark; a poorly ran and very unprofessional company.\nAfter this game's prime, Fatshark turned most the game's weapons and armors into pay-to-unlock items, money for gold, gold for items, the whole deal.\n\n-After still, they had completely simplified armor to the point of stupidity, originally you had to aim for weaknesses in armor, now it's just hold a click to hit and do damage, even the in-game tutorial is irrelevant to it, but I digress.\n\n-Even later, there were several consecutive nerfs to armor and buffs to weapons; Fatshark put in several weapons that can destroy anything with no skill or finesse; basically "click-to-win".\n\n-Eventually, Paradox Interactive got rid of Fatshark and took War of the Roses where they haven't improved or changed a thing besides the free classes. They haven't even removed the micro-payments, all weapons and armor can be unlocked by buying gold with real money.\n\nThe community:\n\n-There's a VERY small community of players of all levels, shapes, sizes, and nationalities, the problem with that is there is merely a 100th of active servers as there are people(as in 4 active servers out of a few hundred of people), and at night all people from all different countries come on to one single US based server. Ping is not punished in this game.\n\n-Another thing that isn't punished in this game is the exploit. There's numerous exploits to be found in the game, from overpowered weapons, to bugs in the map which make you unreachable, to invisibility glitches, and even to hackers, even with the anti-cheat this game can still be hacked, and all these are consistently exploited by 80% of what little community this game has left. Probably the most prevalent exploit is the use of broken weapons or character builds; two-thirds of the community usually has the same copy-pasted character build with a different paint-job using one of the mentioned broken weapons.\n\n-Duel servers suffer now because of it as new players don't know how to duel and will attack randomly and constantly be spawn camped, tea-bagged, and killed-on-sight until they leave, by high level player wielding an insta-kill weapon. Along with that, duel servers often devolve to a bunch of people insta-killing each other mosh-pit style. There isn't much to be said for other servers other than that it's essentially the same.\n\nNew player friendliness:\n\n-None. Absolutely NONE.\n-There is a BIG learning curve on weapons, armor, game mechanics, weapon mechanics, armor\nmechanics, and weapon hitboxes.\n-The tutorial is pretty well irrelevant in comparison to online play; all it's good for is showing how to swing and block slowly and showing the lore of the game.\n-The high level players today are nothing but seal clubbers and love seeing people using the default classes as it immediately tells them "free kill".\n\nOther game comparisons:\n\n-I've heard a lot of the Mount and Blade and Chivalry comparisons and have played both and consistently found myself being spoiled to the fluid motions and amazing modding of Mount and Blade, and the fast, violent, humorous world of chivalry; the second I had gotten on War of the Roses, I noticed how twitchy and uncanny-valley looking it is.\n\n-With War of the Roses, the weapons and armor descriptions have never changed, some are historically incorrect, or historically inaccurate. Some customization options are entirely useless from nerfing. The tutorial is worthless as it's reliant on game mechanics that are no longer relevant. The screenshots from this Steam page are staged and some that comes with the game ones are even FAKE(mounted combat isn't possible but there is a default screenshot showing it on the library background). There is no historical fighting style as all weapons swing the same way, all characters run the same way, it's a little tiny world, with all the same stuff where nothing ever changes\n\n-Chivalry has much going for it from fast, extremely violent combat to hilarious Monty Python references, it's a running, arcade, joke and the devs know that and improve on it to great success. Even today it's being updated, new things are being added, the Devs are celebrating holidays by putting in silly holiday customization options and they even have been hosting contests to let players help create in-game items.\n\n-Mount and Blade is entirely moddable and has numerous community fixes for bugs and such, there are even total convertion mods which make an incredible amount of different kinds of gameplay. With Mount and Blade, the adventure never ends.\n\nOverall Conclusion:\n\nHonestly I COULD NOT recommend this game to anybody, everything about was once good long ago, but is now bad.\nThis game is nothing more than a money milking cow for Paradox that dried up long ago but refuses to die.","January 10, 2015","false","380.4"," 259 of 278 people (93%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","93","259","278","17","3"

The dueling community was strong and friendly, always willing to help teach new players how to survive the game.\n\nBut then the Devs changed things, the armor system simplified, the weapons became more powerful, crossbows became sniper rifles, hitboxes and crit chances grew, and the art of dueling was lost to the ether; replaced by polearm decapitations, across the map crossbow headshots, and stab spamming. All that is left now is the empty rotting shell of a once great game.","October 4, 2014","false","140.4"," 354 of 398 people (89%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","89","354","398","30","1"

Paradox has stopped all further development on War of the Roses officially, there will be no further updates or support. No more content, bugfixes or balancing.\n\nLook it up here:\nhttp://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?803910-Statement-regarding-the-War-franchise&s=37a86469bf953fa83a2843f2964171c7\n\nWar of the Roses has come a long way, or rather suffered a very steep downfall.\n\nAt its launch in 2012 War of the Roses was definitely the best Mount&Blade-like experience one could hope for. The game was exciting: brutally challenging, but very fair and nicely balanced. This was a game for core-players with a quite steep but very rewarding learning curve and skill-ceiling. The (old) armor-system was very complex and good implemented in the overall gameplay mechanics: Deflecting & glancing blows were common, and it was hard to overcome plate armor with simple sword-blades. One had to use his wits and skills when fighting opponents without a suitable weapon to counter their loadout-choices.\n\nThis made the game very enjoyable at the early launch-state.\n\nBut all of this is not the case anymore, the game has gravely decreased in quality and is nothing more than a rotting patchwork, leaking players every week.\n\nThe countless misdirected balance patches and simplifications of game mechanics were painful to witness.\nRather than addressing the ever swelling balance problems and bugs - the development team decided to flood the game with mostly unbalanced and unwanted content, which only derailed the game even more. The removal of the complex armor system and the enhancement of hitbox-sizes were very poor moves. Fatshark tried to stabilize the playerbase by lowering the skill curve, but this only backfired even more.\n\nThis game still suffers from fatal bugs and exploits - which have been very well documented and reported by the community since launch.\nThe network-performance of the game is horrible and was never addressed by the developer, and due to the iron grip of the Multiplay monopoly the actual server coverage and quality is very poor.\n\nI personally stopped playing WotR after trying to help the game back to its old glory by participating in balance-betas and writing extensive feedback & bug reports. Sadly the game did never improve in quality. The last patch (which was yet again very disappointing) was months ago. Fatshark & Paradox abandoned the game.\n\nIt makes me quite sad to say it, as this game was once so great - but no, don't waste your money on this game.\n\nUpdate 03.10.2014:\nSpelling, warning","March 21, 2014","false","589.0"," 198 of 227 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","198","227","0","9"

Unfortunately, due to mismanagement, missing anti-cheat, totalitarian attitudes towards players on the forums, and glitches and bugs that just never get fixed, the player-base is falling!\n\nIn detail\n\nMismanagement: Promises were and have been made and NEVER fulfilled. These include a single-player mode, leader boards, and monthly content updates that were there for a while but now it’s not even one in half a year.\n\nMissing anti-cheat: The servers are full with cheaters and despite promises of bans and account wipes from Paradox, nothing has been done. An anti-cheat system was announces last year and was stated to be coming “soon”... it is now June the following year and there is nothing. Most people leaving the game say this is the reason.\n\nTotalitarian attitudes towards players on the forums: The game had an amazing community forum right from Alpha. Players got to know each other on and off the battlefield and some fantastic discussions were had on balance, new content, and tournaments. Unfortunately, once the community started to complain about broken promises and bad game experiences, the Mods started banning and infracting left right and centre. Prizes were promised for tournaments but were not given or only given after months of nagging by the organisers...\n\nGlitches and bugs: Some bugs were reported during Alpha and never fixed. The worst part is that many bugs were reported and fixed in a patch, only to reappear with the next patch.\n\nSummary: The game started off in Beta offering around 60% of what the Publishers were promising, which was an amazing start. Players loved it and it held an average daily player list of around 2000 players for months. It peaked at maybe 70% and then with the introduction of the Kingmaker patch it started to fall and has since fallen into an abyss of laggy servers, bad netcode, cheaters, OP-builds and weapons, a server browser that doesn’t work, leader boards that  don’t work, and a publisher who keeps promising and promising but who never does anything.\n\nMy loyalty to the game drives me to recommend it, but right now I just can’t.\n\nUPDATE 22.10.2014\n\nI am glad you commented and asked this question because I need to write a new review or revise this one, which i will do properly, but for now I will say this:\n\nAnti Cheat was finally introduced and despite some bugs actually worked (for a while) – the game was sadly empty with it being very difficult to get a server with enough players, but the flow felt fantastic, the skill was back and things looked good. Sadly, very soon after the first cheats snook back in! However to be fair EAC who made the anti cheat reacted very quickly (though it took some effort from the players to get Paradox to accept there was a problem) and things got better again.\n\nToday? Well, some cheaters are back and sadly, the servers are almost empty! Just recently Paradox announced and officially cancelled ALL future development for the game. So it is only a question of how long now. The official announcement brought some anger amongst the hardcore fans leading to even mor typical Paradox Totalitarian Ban Hammers falling on long-standing, loyal players (ElricVonRabenFells to name but one) many of whom had been around since alpha / beta..\n\nThe game is one of the finest ideas I ever saw and played! Paradox is a shambles and has no idea how to get customers, keep them,. And to develop business into a market.

Pdx artic is supposedly taking over game and will balance it and patch and support it apperently. Who knows, the future might not look bright which is why people dont think its worth the grind to get good anymore.\n\nAs much as I'd like to recommend this game, I just can't. Its combat system and weapon diversity(which should be balanced) is next to none. Sadly tho its broken, unfinished and abandoned. Also its dead/dying, the US servers are anyways. Just 1 patch ago the game was doing much better, but then they nerfed some weapons into the ground and buffed the ♥♥♥♥ outta the most easiest spammy weapons, and because of that lots of players quit. Balance has never been this games strong suit and anticheat arrived way to ♥♥♥♥ing late. Any F2P that wants to try out the game gets stuck with 4 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ classes and stands 0 chance vs any gallo spammer out there. The game is still about skill but skill lvl has dropped immensely, most of the highly skilled players dont play the game anymore, or rarely do. So the rest of the players left just get on the bandwagonning setups and as a new player like you tryna get into this game, lets just say its not worth the grind and time anymore, by the time youre any good the game will probably be completely dead.\n\nSo if your looking to get into a medeival game and are new to the genre, get chivalry for first person hack and slash, plenty of gore and customization as well. Also the majority of its players are North American. Thousands of players playing.\n\nIf you want somethhing more like this game, get warband. It has both sp and mp, ive only played mp and you can have endless hours of fun in it. Its much more relaxing(due to the awesome music) and realistic from any game in its genre. Also is has a great expansion called napoleonic wars. Oh and there are 32000 ♥♥♥♥ing people playing this game. Ya, you must own this game, the number isnt that high for no reason.\n\nUpdate 1:\nGame is still afloat, the f2p default classes have been updated so new and f2p now have a chance. If youre interested their games often go on sale for like 5 bucks, here and other websites that sell steam keys.

Dont let the 5hrs on my profile worry you I played a lot on a buddy's account.\n\nCons\n- Almost empty servers (i.e. no multiplayer) and no bot mode\n- Unless you pay more money or play forever you will have basic gear.. you can earn money but it takes a long time\n- Few maps\n- Few game modes\n- Community sucks.. yes its a weird complaint.. but one server (of the 5 available) I played everyone was killing everyone even though it was a Team Death Match. It took me awhile to figure out that is what was going on..and the second server I literally had someone asked me if I wanted a picture of his genitles..\n- Stuck in 3rd person (one of the main reasons I got this game over Chiv but since Chiv now does 1st and 3rd person this looses)\n\nPros\n- Simply fun (I will still play it from time to time)\n- Good visual effects with helmet\n- Great customization of your character/classes/Coat of Arms (not as much with Coat of Arms but still there) <--- This was why I bought the game. Sadly the game is no longer awesome.\n\nEven though I am ot recommending this game it was super fun and I loved it for so long. But the community sucks and you only have multiplayer options. If there were bot modes or AI vs players it would be awesome. It is a fun game though... just losts its way *tears*","March 1, 2015","false","5.7"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","56","64","3","0"

Not to mention you have to compensate for what kind of weapon you have compaired to the enemies armour. This makes for very strategic placement of swings and stabs and very intence battles/duels.\n\nIn War of the Roses you can make your own loadout of weapons, from the devistating (aka OverPowered) Pollaxe to the all mighty Quarterstaff. After playing a while and you learn how to play the game properly, you tend to (Alot of the time accidentally) create and learn your own style of fighting and when you make your loadout, you will feel like this character really is YOUR personal character.\n\nPersonally I find it really fun when you are playing with a group of people and you make a shield wall, do a calvary charge, hail the enemy with arrows or even just duel eachother one on one.\n\nOverall, I highly reccomend you try the free demo of this game to see if it is the right game for you.","November 25, 2013","true","96.6"," 148 of 208 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","148","208","0","0"

Bell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/87thFootMajBell/","125 products in account","God, here we go, my first STEAM review, and it's War of the Roses.\n\nFYI, if you want to go to the Pros and Cons, and skip all my yapping, just scroll down.\n\nFirst of all, I would HIGHLY suggest NOT buying this game outright. There is a free to play option, and I would suggest rolling with that at first, because honestly, never before has a game made me want to punch myself in my own groin. This was the first and only game to ever make me want to do that.\n\nNow, I will not come out and trash this game. I actually tend to like this game (In the same sort of way a man SOMETIMES likes getting smacked and called Sally by a large German woman.) When you join the right server, with the right sort of people, with a balanced composition of weapons, and you don't run into any hackers, or Pitchfork spammers, this game shines!\n\nProblem is, you run into these sorts of situations only SLIGHTLY more frequently than the arrival of a Messiah.\n\nMost of the time, the game boils down to an experience similar to this.\n\n"You're running along, you just spent 100,000 coins on a brand new sword. You see an enemy running at you, he has a simple farmers pitchfork. You go to engage in combat, but 3 friendly players on horses all see the same enemy! They promptly knock you to the ground several times, and one even manages to team-kill one of the others. BUT! Undeterred you get to your feet! Suddenly, the man you are engaging, the simple peasant, accelerates to somewhere near Mach 2, hits you twice in your heavily armoured head with a wooden Pitchfork, and kills you. He then proceeds to insult your sexual orientation with grade school grammar in chat, while teabagging you."\n\nWELCOME TO MEDIEVAL COMBAT!\n\nI would like to say that's an exaggeration, but sadly it's REALLY not. In one night of playing, you will likely encounter one, if not all of those issues, at least once.\n\nThese issues are compounded by the fact that the developers "Anti-Cheat" does not, in all actuality, EXIST. This is no lie, servers will say "Anti-Cheat enabled" when there is literally NO Anti-Cheat for this game. None...it's entirely fictional. They SERIOUSLY label a server as being protected by a system they never made. I feel like that's actually a crime somehow. If it's not, it should be.\n\nSome weapons are spammy (The aforementioned Pitchfork, a 2 hit killer "Gift" for reaching level 60), some seem pointless (And no I am not talking about hammers *Bad pun rim-shot*), but there are a few places this game shines!\n\nOne, it's pretty. Yes that's a shallow 1 up to give a game, but damn me if it isn't.\n\nTwo, you can customize the hell out of yourself. Armour, face, weapon, the type of STEEL your weapon uses, perks, ect. ect. And all of these levels of customization (With the exception of armour colour and other cosmetic bits) ACTUALLY make a difference to the game!\n\nThree, the hit boxes in this game are sorta sweet. If a man runs at you in full plate, but his helmets visor is up, and you stab him in the face, he's dead. Visor is down, but you hit him in the vision slit? Still dead. Now admittedly the hit boxes got screwed up in one patch, and were not fixed, but despite the developers best attempts to break their own product, the feature is still pretty neat.\n\nFour, Brian Blessed. Enough said.\n\nSo in closing, it's not a BAD game, it's just...a broken game that has been abandoned by its creators. AND, just so happens, to have one of the worst communities ever. Seriously...avoid the community for this game as you would a plague ridden house cat. Hackers, teabaggers, and 12 year olds abound. When you DO find someone who is cool, it's like finding that ONE Guy in a Zombie movie that's not a total nutbag.\n\nPros and Cons for all you people who didn't want to read:\n\nPROS:\nPretty\nInnovative Hit boxes/melee based system\nDEEP customization\nBrian Freaking Blessed\n\nCONS:\nNO ANTI-CHEAT (And by default, LOTS OF HACKERS)\nTerrible community\nUnaddressed Glitches (Which Leads to the biggest issue...)\nTerrible Game Support from the Devs.\n\nIn closing, I will not recommend this game, until Fat Shark decides to actually pay attention to the people who, unlike them, actually LIKE the game.\n\nBut I WILL recommend it, if you use the Free to Play option. So....there is that.","May 5, 2014","false","120.8"," 60 of 73 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","60","73","0","11"

Then everything just spiraled out of control when so called patches just doomed this once hardcore game. In earlier versions of the game, armour was an element to work around, and each weapon had it's own pros and cons, each set to their own uses and ones personal prefrence. The presence of a knight astride his steed was a sight to behold, driving with his lance and putting his foes to the sword. An everytime you died, you could meet a grim fate at the end of dagger or worse...haha! Not anymore.\n\nWar of the Roses now, is no longer about skill, rather it is just a spamming fest filled with pitchforks and two particularly loathsome axes. Armour, even your most noble steel, is rendered completly useless by any swing of a weapon, and before you know it, you are down within but a few swings. Those two axes I talked of earlier? Yes, the Executioners axe and the pummel of the Galloglass axe, will kill you, before you even have time to parry. I should also mention that pole-arms, and especially two handed axes, travel at the speed of light, contrary of swords, which heave sluggishly, as if the blade weighs 30kg, and by the quality of these weapons, you'd think they were forged with glass. Servers these days, are hard to come by, and when you do find something, you don't ever get to use horses, not that it really matters, becuase barding is apparently just a shiny decoration.\n\nThe only positives I can give is that the profile editor is fantastic, and there is a huge variety of weapons and armour. You can edit your own coat of arms to show off, and you have to work to earn your equipment...or you could be just like everyone else and just pay up real money for that expensive piece of equipment you so badly want.\n\nDo yourself a favour, get Mount and Blade, and be paitent for Bannerlord or Kingdom Come: Deliverance, instead of wasting your hours away on this aborted game like me.","May 10","false","151.1"," 46 of 51 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","46","51","5","1"

Unfortunately I had neglected to check the requirements and realized that my computer was way too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to handle it from the very second I booted it up. So it sat at the bottom of my list for years until recently I remembered it existed and decided to give it a try.\n\nI cannot speak for how this game used to be, from what I've heard it was quite good, but I cannot say for sure. What I can speak for is the present. I expected to log on, learn the mechanics and then proceed to discover a game even better than Mount and Blade, a game I thoroughly enjoy. What I instead discovered was a game that was more like Fallout. Not in looks, not in story, not even in game mechanics, but this game was like Fallout.\n\nI discovered the ruins of something that must have been great in the past. Servers god damn everywhere, game modes galore, and what appeared to be the remnants of a decent combat system. However, nearly every server was empty, Russian, or both. There was nothing to be see, you've never seen something so large yet so baren. The few servers that did have players were all team deathmatch dueling servers, where people spend their time by standing around talking and occasionally slaying any newbies who happen to wander into their server. My time was so uneventful I honestly can't comment on the gameplay or anything because there was simply nothing to do.\n\nI wouldn't recomend this game, the game is dying and honestly I haven't really seen any reason to try and save it. It you want a medieval fighting game, try Mount and Blade, possibly Chivalry (though I haven't played Chivalry so I can't say too much on it either), both have decently sized communities that offer you something, while this game is simply no longer capable.","January 21, 2015","false","2.3"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","37","41","4","0"

This announcement has been some time in the making and has been no easy conclusion, yet we aim to be as transparent as possible. So, with no further ado, here is what is happening.\n\nWe are stopping sales of the Valhalla edition - effective immediately\nAll Valhalla owners will receive a large selection of Paradox Interactive's games on steam (added directly to their steam libraries), estimated value circa $800 as compensation. This will appear within a few days\nValhalla owners will also keep their Valhalla privileges - nothing will change here\nWar of the Vikings will see two patches to increase stability and solve major issues - after this we will cease patching and have no plans to support the game further through updates/fixes\nServers will continue to stay active until further notice\nWar of the Roses will see no further development\nWhy are we doing this? To put it simple and straight forward; We've looked at this from every single angle (that's why it's taken time for us to come to this conclusion) over and over and we just can't find a way where we can keep developing the games without operating at a loss. War of the Vikings did not live up to our expectations and we could not find a reasonable scenario where we could bring it up to par quality wise.\n\n\nWe have chosen to patch Vikings in order to bring it to a better state, so that current players can continue to enjoy what we have today with increased stability.\n\nSincerely,\nThe War Team\n\n(Geuss that explains things.

Fatshark have, once again, proven just how COMPLETELY incompetent they are when making games by forcing you to play with teammates whom you cannot POSSIBLY communicate with!\n\nThe COMPLETE absence of voice-based comms makes it impossible to convey even the most obvious messages in the heat of battle (such as "bandage me" or "revive me"), and the fact that there aren't even any quick pre-recorded voice messages either (AGAIN, such as "bandage me" or "revive me") makes communication an absolute NIGHTMARE.\n\nAnd no, the in-game chat doesn't count. Why? Let's make an excruciatingly simple flow-chart style exchange here: have you ever TRIED to type anything while attacking/being attacked by anything at all? If yes, you can skip the rest of this paragraph. If no, then you're either wise or dumb, depending on whether you know just how futile that is or not. Adding to that, the chat box is INSANELY tiny, up in the left corner, AND the font is (and I'm not even kidding) a 6 point one. Do you know how tiny that is? Let me put it this way... it's less than half as big as this text you're reading right now.\n\nIf, and only IF, you manage to find enough friends to fill up a squad (5 players), you'll still be faced with the utterly NIGHTMARISH task of getting ALL your friends to join the same server, the same team, AND the same squad. The first and third may not be horribly hard, but the second? Pshaw, good luck, Chuck!\n\nAnd adding insult to injury, even those of us who possesses a computer forged by the great Hephaestus himself, will have INSANELY EXTREME issues with FPS-drops and constant framerate-lag, EVEN on the lowest settings.\n\nSo to summarize... Incentives for teamplay: bugger-all. Options for communication: utterly shït. Optimization: You're kidding, right? Entertainment value: none whatsoever.

You can also choose which weapon (main weapon and sidearm) and which dagger. When you choose a weapon, you can also decide which fighting style you'd like to have. For example you can choose between Imperial or Milanese  fighting style. You can choose between many different armor types. There are light armors and heavy armors. If you want you can also ride a horse and play with lance. Shields are available as well.\n\nMelee\nMelee is much more complicated than ranged. While attacking you can choose between four directions. You can hit from the left and right side. You can also perform overhead swings and you can stab your opponent. Same for parrying your opponents attack! To attack you press the left mouse button and move your mouse to the attacking direction. To parry you press the right mouse button and move your mouse to the direction you want to parry.\nParrying with shields is a lot easier! You basically have to press your right mouse button and it blocks to all four directions.\nBut shields make you heavier and slower. And shield can also break. You have to decide carefully how you set up your own class!\n\nRanged\nWhile you play melee in the Third-Person Perspective ranged is in the First-Person\nIf you want to play ranged you can choose between three different ranged weapons:\n• Bow\nYou can choose which bow you'd like to take and you can choose the arrow. Compared to the crossbow the bow is faster but performs less damage.\n• Crossbow\nYou can choose between different crossbows and arrows. Crossbows have a longer reload time than bows. If you aim carefully you can perform a lot of damage!\n• Handgonne\nThe handgonne is a little bit different. You take your handgonne and shoot once. Then you switch to melee and have to wait for the handgonne to magically reload ;)\n\nThe in-game currency\nTo create your own class you have to earn in-game gold. If your new it might be a bit hard to earn a lot of gold. But the most weapons, shields, armors and helmets are cheap. Only the exclusive stuff is expensive: For example special looking weapons or colours for your armors. If you want you can also pay real money to get in game gold. But this is not necessary.\n\nConclusion\nWar of the Roses is a lot of fun because you can choose almost everything for your own soldier.\nThe game's biggest problems are the balance issues. Some weapons are stronger than others.","June 22, 2014","true","175.1"," 45 of 71 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","45","71","0","7"

I thought that given how relatively untouched the genre is, games of this type would be mostly free from the corruption plaguing multiplayer video games as of late.\nBoy was I ♥♥♥♥ing WRONG.\nBattleWar of the DutyRoses is a generic, sub-par multiplayer game. It takes influence from a lot of aspects that make games like Call of Duty and other modern FPS as terrible as they are.\nThe game is terribly balanced. I mean horribly, appallingly balanced. Some of the worst I've seen in quite a while. All swords except the largest, slowest claymore simply bounce off plate armour, which gives no real disadvantages when worn compared to lighter armours and is easy to acquire. On the other hand, maces and some axes simply cleave through plate as if it is nothing. Polearms can pretty much kill instantly, and at range. There are also the archers, that can safely stand at the edge of a battle and steal kills easily, retreating whenever trouble nears them because of their light armour.\nThe game also comes with, you ♥♥♥♥ing guessed it: Revolting RPG aspects shoved down your throat. It has obligatory levels, which are gained by getting kills and killstreaks, as well as a money system, where you gain coins which you use to buy your equipment. Everything is ♥♥♥♥ing expensive and it'll take hours upon hours of grinding to be able to actually afford a good weapon or set of perks. Oh yes, there's perks too, just like in Our Lord and Saviour Call of Duty.\nThe game features a very strange hitbox system, where certain hard-to-hit spots in someone's armour will take damage and others will block it. It's a great concept, but when put in practice it simply does not work in a third-person game like this where all attacks are as slow as they are.\nAlso the game comes with the neat feature to be able to spawn on your squadmates WHEN THEY ARE IN COMBAT. I'm not sure I have to describe how dumb that is.\nOverall the game is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Go play Mountain Blade instead.","November 10, 2012","false","9.6"," 54 of 88 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","54","88","0","10"

Truly, I enjoyed my time running around the English countryside. The countryside, while not exactly Crysis-level graphics porn, is still wonderfully rendered.\n\nNow, let's move into the less flattering aspects of this game. The first problem I noticed about this game is the controls. Now you still move around with the WASD keys, so that's pretty standard. But to swing your weapon around, you would click on your mouse and move it to decide the direction of your swing. This is awkward because your mouse also controls your view, so swinging your weapon around means your view will be swinging around as well. Now you may point out that I can always play as an archer, but what's the point of playing this game then? If you're unsure if this is a game for you, play the trial (that's the free version on Steam) first. If it makes you dizzy, then this is definitely not the game for you.\n\nThe second problem is the balance of this game. It's not difficult to find a random dude lobbing everyone's head off with the Peasant Polearm (it's a rake...). Even if it doesn't result in an insta-kill, it still deals a heavy dose of damage. The swing speed is much faster than any axe. Seriously, what's up with that? If that didn't convince you, let me point out that the Longbow cannot kill a player at full health with an arrow to the face, regardless of range. If that still didn't convince you, then may you be killed by dudes dressed in rags. These guys can takedown a heavily armoured knight with their speed.\n\nEleven months (at the time of writing this review) after release, bugs and exploits are still aplenty. I just saw a guy rode a horse into a wall and disappear into it. The said guy then proceeded to shoot everyone in the back, and no one is able to get to him. FIX YOUR DAMN GAME, FATSHARK!\n\nAgain at the time of writing, I've clocked in six hours into this game. And I encountered three hackers. That translates to one hacker in every two hours. That, to me, is very serious. Note that I played on servers with Anti Cheat on, but I guess that is not working at the moment.\n\nBottomline: Try the free version, if this game is your cup of tea and you can live with the hackers and cheaters, then buy Kingmaker. Otherwise, forget it.","January 14, 2014","false","21.7"," 38 of 60 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","38","60","0","2"

You have to move in the direction you want to hit or block. You cannot sprint if you are a skirmisher class, but you can charge with the speed of a Ferrari if you are covered head to toe in plate and carrying a warhammer.\n\nBase movement is REALLY slow. Again, if you are a skirmisher, you have to take out a dagger to run faster.\n\nThe finishing moves are pretty brutal, but nowhere near as brutal as Chivalry.\n\nIf you are going to play this, buy it. I can't really recommend it. The combat is way too floaty, like it was in M&B. Come to think of it, you should probably get M&B since the full game is cheaper and you don't have to grind like crazy. If you want a multiplayer medieval slash and smash, get Chivalry. You do not win in the end if you try to get both by getting this game.\n\nThe free version allows you to try it out for yourself, but you run into the paywall almost instantly when a dude carrying a handcannon walks up to you and blows off your top half, assuming he can time along with the lag and bad optimization.","October 20, 2013","false","3.1"," 49 of 83 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","49","83","0","0"

This game has very few game modes and even fewer maps, with an absolutely nonsensical spamming and slashing melee system where about six dozen weapons all behave exactly the same.

In addition, you have to spend coins(Which you can of course buy with actual money) to unlock your items if you want to play a custom build. But at least you get free coins for playing. It's not a lot, but it's enough that you will have a decent progression to your goal if you have a single set goal(Such as a crossbowman). I don't recommend buying coins, at this stage it feels like throwing money down a well\n\nLuckily, to play the game itself is free, and that is exactly what I recommend. The combat feels like it's similar to Mount and Blade but a bit more polished for multiplayer, but sadly there are some builds which seem to almost always work better than others. An example of such a build is to take the lightest armour and add a large axe. While this would in theory make the user very squishy and easy to kill, in practice there is enough lag that they are difficult to hit and often you will find your attacks pass right through them, but they still hit incredibly hard with that axe.\nWhen you can find a server that's right next to your home, however, this one build almost completely disappears as they get wrecked with a single hit nearly every time you swing at them. Of course, there are more 'optimal' builds than just those, so you'll still have trouble and may feel like you're going up against copy pasted enemies at times.\n\nIn the end, there is a lot of good, and a lot of bad, but it feels from what I've seen like the devs, publishers, or both have given up on this game so it won't be getting much more good out of it. I'm still recommending it because it's a free alternative to games like Mount and Blade and Chivalry. It's nice, but that's all it is. Not really good but not really bad either, and I would say it's worth taking a look.","October 1, 2014","true","17.6"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","19","28","2","4"

War of the Roses was a really historically accurate game about a period in time that actually happened, which interested me greatly. The addicting customization options were varied and extremely engaging, offering a lot of really cool options that were totally overlooked in this game's competitors. The combat was different, and even a little slow, but it made sense and was quite good, as well as being realistic. However, after taking an extended leave of absence, a lot has changed. The customization is still unparralled, but the same issues that it had when the game came out were not resolved, namely the high expense of everything compared to how much you made each game. Combat now makes no sense at all, and is actually frustrating and genuinely terrible; it is slow, and the same weapons seen over and over and over are STILL broken and STILL haven't been fixed. Archery is now a joke. Even simply moving around the map has now devolved into what feels like trying to drag an extremely large dog around on an extremely long leash. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but it feels an awful lot like the developers gave up and started prostituting themselves out by making new and worthless content in order to drum up more sales, rather than fixing anything or improving on the game in any way. I would not advise anyone to play this game, in fact I would advise that everyone stay FAR away from this game and let it die in peace.","February 21, 2015","false","15.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It was a truly immersive experience.\n\nAt release however it seems some key features were changed and the game felt totally different in a very negative way. Three years down the line the game has just disintegrated into a very sad state, making it very obvious as to why this went free to play.\n\nThe only weapons worth using are the bills and the pitchfork as the bills can be exploited so if you go to swing and turn around so your enemy is behind you and then release the attack, the attack becomes almost impossible to block and will most likely instantly kill you. The pitchfork on the other hand can instantly kill you desipte wearing a heavy plate helm and is more effective than any sword, axe or hammer.\n\nIt's disappointing to see a game that could have confidently rivalled Chivalry and Warband do so poorly.","February 27","false","18.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Also, to get new equipment, you would either have to grind (which was fun before guns) or pay money.

However; the game always left me wondering "When does it get better." there was this real sense that I was playing towards something -- But it never came.\n\nAfter all the times that I was insta-killed by someone that wasn't even aiming at me. All the times that I was spammed to death by the famed "2h-spammer." all the times I questioned "HOW DO YOU SWING SO FAST!?" and when I started to out-pace my kill/death ratio... it never came.\n\nThis game should come with a warning: Do not play if you are prone to rage. It doesn't get better.\n\nEsentially, what you see is really what you get. There is no real depth to the gameplay. Some of the weapons are utterly imbalanced (I'm talking about you, Poleaxe!) and while combat is 'skill based' it works as well as communism; In theory it's great. But in practice...\n\nThat said, I have put in some good hours with this game and for some reason, I do remember it fondly.

I am the watcher in the darkness. I am the Vanguard. The quiet before the storm. I am fear given form. I am flesh and blood just like any of you but I am not like you. Facing me, means your death. Running from me, means your death. You cannot win. You cannot hide. I never tire. I never give up. Once I deem you my prey, YOUR TIME IS UP... Alas, that is how it should have been.\n\nLet me tell you of the War of the Roses... Let me tell you how Winter's Rose, the dragon of Bamburgh was brought low.\n\nRiding high on my success at Bamburgh I had grown careless. Who could touch me now? I, who single-handedly destroyed the butcher, a man imbued with so much blood magic his mere presence was enough to kill a lesser man. I was not one such man, lucky for me. Oh, do not misunderstand. I have had much success over my long and bloody career as the Rose, but I had just broken through the glass ceiling. I had just transformed from a caterpillar into a butterfly. I was now a power, no longer just a dangerous tool. Kings, Princes even Emperors and their glorious numberless armies had been utterly destroyed by the monster, but not I. So, surely you could see why I had grown so carefree just days after my victory.\n\nI was sent by my masters, the seasons, to end the butcher or die trying and now I was to return stronger than I ever been, more powerful than my, soon to be, ex masters could imagine. Once I had dealt with the seasons and taken my rightful place, I would then look to the world. Starting with England. With the butcher vanquished, England was ripe for the taking.\n\nHAHAHA hehe...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/42160/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","The War of the Roses was a big old 15th Century dynastic squabble between two Plantagenet houses, York and Lancaster, for the throne of England. It ended in a Lancastrian victory, the reconciliation of the two houses, and the creation of House Tudor. Most importantly, it involved a lot of battles filled with armored chaps beating the living daylights out of each other. Fatshark's War of the Roses is all about those fellows, and their bloody clashes. Up to 64 players duke it out amid the pastoral setting of England's verdant countryside, ripped apart by brutal conflict.  It can be a fast-paced slaughterfest one minute, and a methodical, tactical, squad-based multiplayer experience the next.There are fairly limited options in terms of game modes--team deathmatch as well as a conquest-style mode, in which players capture areas, are the only match types. The lack of variety in game modes means the team-versus-team matches can get tiresome. But what War of the Roses lacks in modes, it compensates for in the novelty of gameplay.Getting a kill in War of the Roses is no easy task. It takes a combination of mouse clicks and mouse swipes just to swing your weapon. Blocking works in almost the same vein, so sword fights between two players feels like a real medieval duel. Every move is deliberate, and winning battles comes from skill rather than getting in a few lucky shots. Every attack or bow shot must be calculated and perfectly timed to land, since opposing players can block, dodge, or interrupt your attacks at any time. However, because it is so difficult to land a critical hit, when you actually manage to deliver a crushing blow, it's incredibly satisfying.Those who have played the Battlefield series, will immediately recognize the squad system. When players respawn, they have the option to do so on different points on the map, including on other squad members.When in combat, you have the option to carry a wide variety of weapons, including swords, shields, axes, bows, and poled weapons--like Halberds and spears. Each weapon type differs in effectiveness, and encourages different fighting styles.Your choice of armor plays as much of a part in combat as your weapon. Not only can you unlock visually intimidating armor sets, certain character attributes can be affected, including movement speed and defensive abilities. Some armors can even completely deflect attacks.As you level up from winning matches and getting kills, you'll earn money, which can be used to purchase weapons, armor, character perks, and other bonuses like mounts. The perks break down into offensive, defensive, and squad support perks called Officer perks.Limited though it may be, War of the Roses delivers a grisly, realistic take on third-person medieval combat that hits most of the right notes. More than just a refreshing change of pace for the genre, it captures the raw kinetic essence of the period's turbulent warfare in an exciting way.","December 8, 2014","true","29.1"," 35 of 65 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","35","65","4","2"

Instead I'll keep it short... AVOID THIS GAME. I played the pre-order alpha, and let me tell you, nothing has changed from then until now other than the addition of the game-breaking firearms and pay-to-win functionality via 'gold'. (Funny how every game that promises to not have P2W... Has P2W.) War of the Roses is the most disappointing waste of 30 dollars I've yet to buy. It's like the developers took a cool idea, half-♥♥♥♥♥ a game with it, and put it out in a grab for money and instead of fixing issues that have been present since the alpha, they've been busy crapping out the $25 re-skin they call a 'sequel' which they've treated the same way so far. This game is ABANDONWARE, do not buy it. It took them two years to put out an anti-cheat system, and that made the game unplayable for a number of people. To my knowledge, they've still yet to fix it and this update was 6 months ago.\n\nIf you're looking for a good medieval game, go play Mount & Blade. If you're wanting something new and coming to this FROM Mount & Blade, expecting something very similar like I was, then don't. Turn around and go back to M&B, this isn't worth the time. Luckily for those who're new, it's free to play now, so it won't cost you anything BUT your time to try it for yourself. And after you do, you'll be thankful you didn't make the same mistake I and so many other hopeful players did on release.","September 4, 2014","false","25.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Also, the sheer amount of hackers and exploits still in the game is ludicrous, and makes it virtually unplayable for a newcomer.

Though much like shooters, it has been out for a long time and is very much filled to the brim with 1337 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who will take the ♥♥♥♥ out of anyone who isn't a total badass. Generally, in any given match one team will suck and the other will have one or a few of said badasses on their team which pretty much invalidates your participation because at best, you'll be getting your head chopped off every 30 seconds.\n\nAside from those nerd rage inducing situations, generally its a very good game with plenty of customization to be had. If anything, I'd advise you to put $5 into getting some coin to start with, unless you're a glutton for punishment. But then again I'd advise you to not buy this at all, simply because pretty much every server will have a few of those 1337 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ running around; entirely destroying the experience the vast majority of the time.\n\nNever mind the lag and glitches/bugs in general, with that terrible learning curve only increasing by multitudes as time passes only making it worse... as far as I'm concerned its terminal date has come.

Nearly every developer change to the game had more negative effects than the positive changes intended.  It would seem that Fatshark's e1337 team of crack developers think the best solution to an overpowered item in the game is to nerf it into the ground, and of course the inverse was also true.  Despite all of this I still love this game at heart.  At its core it is a challenging multiplayer combat game with deep mechanics that takes hundreds of hours to master and had a steep learning curve.  Unfortunately, despite the second to last patch being relatively balanced, the developers felt the need to change it one more time before giving up on it and handing it off to another developer team and moving on to greener pastures (Vikings, hue).  Since then no further changes to the game have been made, and no plans for any have been released.  It is truly disappointing that after all of the dreadful patches this game went through in the pursuit of perfection, it ended up like this, fat and washed up, lying dead on the floor of its bathroom.","May 2, 2014","true","487.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

BUT Paradox is sneaky, they have not posted their agenda on the steam page.. since they are selling "books" and "Voice Overs.." ♥♥♥♥ like that i would love to share with new players that this is the message we got from them! Kickstart it once again or sell it to another company, cause you guys hold a treasure/ruby that i want to shine so bad ! :)\n\n\n\n"Statement regarding the War franchise\n\nGreetings community!\n\nWe are writing you today to inform you what is happening with the War franchise, most importantly War of the Vikings but also its predecessor War of the Roses. This announcement has been some time in the making and has been no easy conclusion, yet we aim to be as transparent as possible. So, with no further ado,\nhere is what is happening.\n\n•We are stopping sales of the Valhalla edition - effective immediately\n\n•All Valhalla owners will receive a large selection of Paradox Interactive's games on steam (added directly to their steam libraries), estimated value circa $800 as compensation. This will appear within a few days\n\n•Valhalla owners will also keep their Valhalla privileges - nothing will change here\n\n•War of the Vikings will see two patches to increase stability and solve major issues - after this we will cease patching and have no plans to support the game further through updates/fixes\n\n•Servers will continue to stay active until further notice\n\n•War of the Roses will see no further development\n\n•Why are we doing this? To put it simple and straight forward; We've looked at this from every single angle (that's why it's taken time for us to come to this conclusion) over and over and we just can't find a way where we can keep developing the games without operating at a loss. War of the Vikings did not live up to our expectations and we could not find a reasonable scenario where we could bring it up to par quality wise.\n\nWe have chosen to patch Vikings in order to bring it to a better state, so that current players can continue to enjoy what we have today with increased stability.\n\nSincerely,\nThe War Team "\n","November 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

And it hasn't changed but so much. While the game can be entertaining most of the time it's cheap and just ****ing horrible quality. You spend half of your time trying to 'charge' up attacks, only to have them not swing correctly (IE-The enemy is too close or your weapon touches a twig) while enemies seem to not be effected by this at all. Direct hits with your blade to enemies sometimes to not register at all either. However every single swing an enemy does to me, even when blocking, seems to deal signifigent damage, often killing me in 1-2 hits while wearing full plate. While when I crit on the face with my two handed axe I hit a max of 28 damage. People use the EXACT same weapon are butchering me in one hit. Is this hacks? I don't know but this game is FULL of hackers as well. Obvious hacking, such as super speeds, aimbots for archers, and more. The lack of servers, especially ones with a ping limit one can stay under, is VERY low. At peak this game may reach 100-200 players across 10 servers or less. Overall the game is unfair and very 'arcade' feeling. Most of the time players are rushing around mindlessly hacking with their insta-gib swords and axes, stuck in a 'charge' animation as they run at you. The feats are pathetic, most of the 'special skills' you get are not even worth mentioning, much less grinding/getting slaughtered for hours on end to unlock.\n\nIn short this game is a horrid failure. I played when it was in beta/first released and it was MUCH better than it is now. Obtaining new items is all but impossible. Most cost 100k-500k and you earn less than 2k per match, if you're one of the level 60s with the best gear you can earn upwards of 5k.\n\nBut do not fear you can pay stupid amounts of money to get gold. Spending 5$ will get you 500k, but most of the good items are 100k+. The combat is sketchy at best, often people run around like Rambo swinging and butchering with ease but in my experience that isn't something I could do no matter the loud out I chose. Even when attempting to parry+swing+dodge it was all but impossible to land a good hit, it seemed as if even the most perfect hit would be brushed off easily while a grazing hit with a dagger to me could kill me in a single blow. Archery is interesting but a big fail as well. It is EXTREMELY difficult to hit anyone. Trying to watch your arrow/bolt fly through the air is equally frusterating as it's very hard to see.\n\nIs this game worth your 20$? No. Lack of players, VERY difficult to play. Even worse community. Is it a pay to win game? Yes, it -is-. Most of the time it's 1 team completely dominating the other and a lot of clan team stacking. It also does not handle multiple monitors AT ALL. You will have to shut off all your other monitors or you will find yourself clicking off screen almost every swing, even through the game is supposively playing in full screen, it doesn't appear to. The free to play is a gimic, the trial is more discouraging to play than the full game. You get nothing for the trial except the first classes and they are awful. Again, you will be dominated by 'advanced' players that never seem to miss a hit and can't seem to be damage even when hit directly to the face.\n\nDo not buy, do not support.\n\n\n\nFirst Review:\n\n"Within my first hour of playing all I experieced was high ranked/geared players completely dominating everyone else on the map. They were killing everyone else in one single hit while it would take 3 people effectively hitting them numerous times to take one down. Oh, AND THEY WERE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM. This game isn't worth a penny."","February 27, 2014","false","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This game has a long way to go. I mean, I might be biased, but the whole 'medieval battle' thing is very appealing. Unfortunately, this game's execution is... ehh. It leaves a lot to be desired, to say the least. For one, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the amount of gank is awful. It ruins the playing experience. No matter how good you think you are at blocking, you're gonna get mobbed by five guys and die helplessly. It happens. It happens all the time.\n\nDespite being solely a multiplayer game, the game seems pretty un-optimised with regard to that. Multiplayer seems slow and laggy (even with a low ping). Some of the weapons and abilities are unbalanced and rubbish, and to be honest, the game is pretty unforgiving to new players.\n\nBasically, don't bother paying for it now.

Easy to learn, hard to master\n- More realistic, in every imaginable way (Except the pitchfork. If you use it, you're just pitiful.)\n- No exploit moves which make you look like a cartoon character\n- Thus, way more immersive\n- Actually responses pinpoint when you press a button\n- Better grafics\n- Better performance\n- Less buggy\n- Doesn't lag like crazy all the time\n- Fantastic customization\n- No restriction to classes\n- Option to play as cavalry\n- Only a slight amount of op loadout combinations\n- Reviving and executing\n- Great way to earn ingame currency without punishing the player\n- No ridiculous emote shouting\n\nMany might argue "WotR is not really f2p! It's just a demo version!"\nI concur. None the less, the demo version will give you a good impression of the gameplay for the first levels. The developers recently updated the standard classes and made them actually quite effective, so even free players get a better experience while fighting.\nStill, be ready to get pwned a lot. But that is normal in this type of games. You'll need a good amount of time to get a familiar feeling for weapon timing and range but it will pay off.\n\nHowever, I would not recommend the full "Kingmaker" version for the recent full price. You can pick it up at a very low price, when you know where to search.\n\nI can only recommend WotR to anyone who likes competative medieval fighting games. It's deep, it's fun, it's polished.\nTry the demo and compare for yourself. And if you don't like it...\nWell, I won't stop you going back to getting sliced by reversed overhead strikes.","November 28, 2014","true","316.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My reasons are, there are barely any servers and this is laggy. Those are my top 2, but you should put money into Mount and Blade: Warband because it has a more refined fighting mechanic and multi-player. Mount and Blade: Warband has a imersive single player that will give you plenty of hours of fun, also the mods are great. Why would you waste time downloading this, when a simular game does this same element better with an immersive single player. One of the redeeming qualities are the graphics, they are great although a little rough to run on a low-end laptop. Another redeeming quality of this game is the combat, the critical strikes are alright. The bandaging and execution or reviving mechanic are incredible. This has realistic armor which plays a part in every ingagement letting you understand who to take on solo, and who to get a friend's help. The hit rejestration is superb compared to other games. This game might be a little frustrating if your laggy, but an overall decent game. 7.5/10","November 1, 2014","false","0.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The structure and hierarchy of veterans to newbies is filled with children, liars, cheaters, and rules/right and wrong is determined by the majority opinion of middle-school worthy cliques that like to front themselves as "clans" instead of having basic set rules and regulations for community owned/ran servers. Public servers are filled with whining children who spend more time complaining and sh*t talking to other players than they do actually playing the game, which in turn damages team performance, on top of speed hackers, exploiters of broken content, and players who knowingly exploit their ping on a game where ping is a very, very sensitive catalyst that can make the worst of players nearly invincible.\n\nWhat's even worse is developer intervention is needed just to maintain and address problems in the community, going so far as to write a group petition just to get a basic, BS statement that they are "monitoring the situation closely". Servers lacking any rules, admins, or the likes are filled with vigilantes who think their opinion and skill is relevant to any say so in how things should be ran.\n\nThe lack of an engine to combat cheating, on top of community owned servers, with high-school admins who will abuse their power because of cliques and friendships made me worse of a person trying to play this game and have fun with the people on it. It is a shame that War of the Vikings turned out to be a very streamlined, basic version of Roses, because it would have been a fresh start at a better community.\n\nThe bottom line is if you enjoy a very fluent M&B based combat style, War of the Roses is the game for you. However, keep yourself distanced from community owned/ran servers, and play on public servers with ping limits for your area. This is, unfortunately, not a game that has ANY benefit whatsoever by the people you will encounter on it.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to whatever "friend" decided to add this to Reddit.

If you like introducing axes to skulls, you will like this game. The combat is slower than most PVP games, but it can make for some intense battles.\n\nLike all PVP games and MOBAs, there is a bit of a learning curve, but it isn't that bad. If you play in the big battles of 32 players then you can quietly learn how to play without being flamed too much.\n\nThe combat is slow, and you have to charge and aim your swings (and blocks, if that’s what your into)... so it takes some getting used to. Eventually you learn to compensate for lag too. Some people complain about it, but sometimes the best thing to do is: rapidly swing your most OP weapon towards the enemies’ necks and hope for some decapitations... and just have some fun with it.\n\nOnce you do have a firm understanding of how to play it can quickly become quite an addictive and fun experience. There are many flaws inherent in the mechanics of the game, but once you learn how to compensate for them you will be hooked. Little compares to the pleasure of charging into a group of enemy players and quickly taking all of their heads off, then running behind a wall to bandage up while they complain in the chat log. Of course, many times you'll be the one getting decapitated out of nowhere too.\n\nOr, if you want, you can hone your skills as an archer and stand 100 meters away and zip arrows at people trying to perform supportive actions on players (i.e.: revives and executions).\n\nSince there is a free-to-play tier, if you want a taste of MOBA-style medieval combat, then you should give War of the Roses a shot.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","176.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Within the first few months of the game being released and me playing it, I found it terrible, but then after about 5 months without playing it, I decided to go back and see what it's like. After 5 months I had gotten used to playing with a keyboard and mouse (This was my first PC game, and I just got my pc). When I had come back to the game, I noticed that it wasn't all bad, and that it had a great community. I stuck to dueling servers to get the hang of things, and also to learn how other players fight, and their style. About 200 hours had passed with me playing duel servers, and I felt like Roses had been made really well.\n\nSo now I am at 1300 hours (On this account, 200 hours on my alt account, and another 300 hours between another 3 accounts), and like all good games do, this game began to die around 2014. It has lost most of it's players, not I am able to say that there are still around 200 of us nerds that still play this game. The community now has turned into ♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥ and even more ♥♥♥♥♥. Duel server are owned by power hungry ♥♥♥♥♥s (PoE this is meant for you, OH I also forgot to mention that baby I made cry 8 months ago Josif Stalin, who still cries to this day) who don't let new players learn how to play anymore. Then if you find a duel server which accepts you, you always have the admins randoming (Wabbits is a terrible server, players don't duel) - The randoming admins are on the Blood & Steel server. - ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ admins are on Duke of York.\n\nAnyway, the game still has around 200 people, about 100 of those are c.unt$, d1ckh34ds and tw@s. However these are the guys who make the game fun, and I would miss them if they had stopped. (Except the f4gg0t that goes by the name PoE, no one would miss him. Oh look, he quit and no one even knows he was a thing. Glorious)\n\nAs of right now, I wouldn't suggest buying the full game unless you are able to get it cheaper than £15 (Which you can do from ♥♥♥ - This game is £1 roughly on there). Try our the free trial first, and if you like it, then use websites which sell the game cheaper that way, you aren't wasting money on a dying game.\n\nP.S. This game gets really addicting when you rek noobs and then get banned from their server.\n\nAlso, people who come to this game new, if you connect to a server with "DUEL SERVER" in the name, stick to the rules or you will instantly hate the game. This guide has information on the Duel Server gameplay. Read this, enjoy your time on the servers, and give the game a negative review.","February 19, 2015","true","414.4"," 44 of 86 people (51%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","51","44","86","37","21"

Very good concept but a fundamentally broken game in ways which means you more than often end up in unfair fights. Whether it's glitches or the broken stats and completely unbalanced weaponry (as an example, one of the most powerful weapons in the game, vs superior forged steel, is a wooden pitchfork).\n\nThe game presents itself as a bit of a simulator, with its historical explanations of items and weaponry but ends up being a sluggish arcade game. Other broken mechanics include the so called "anti cheat live" which doesn't stop hacks, and the auto balance system which neither doesn't work.\n\nWhat put the final nail in the coffin for me was the mischievous way the developers try to rope you into giving them more money. Given the weapon stats are broken, it's near impossible to tell which weapons you'd prefer, but in order to get more weapons you need to collect gold by in game actions. And that takes a long time, Meaning it's a gamble whether your last few days of playing pays off with the new weapon you buy. 500,000 is the most expensive weapon I saw, and the developers offer 1,000,000 for 60 euros. F*** RIGHT OFF YOU GREEDY S*** H*** SEWER SUCKING F********.\n\nIn all, get the free version if you want, play it for a while, find it's faults and then decide whether you can live with them, because unless your willing to spend ♥♥♥♥ loads of money, time and possibly hack as well, it won't be getting better than that.\n\n","August 28, 2014","false","68.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you enjoyed the combat in Mount and Blade you will most likely love the combat in WotR. I personally find it to be a lot more refined.\n\nThe graphics are pretty alright, though the game could need some more optimisation.\nIf you have an older computer or laptop it might not run very smoothly. If that's the case you can still try tweaking the graphics[blurb.boards.net].\n\nThe player base is rather small and the remaining servers are often (but not always) run over by morons. Contrary to what the forums might make you believe, the game is not plagued by hackers. There are players using glitches and exploits and other extremely toxic players, but you can usually avoid those.\n\nIt is possible to enjoy the game despite these issues and you should definitely try it out! Especially because it's free!\n\nNote: The F2P version is actually the demo, which "only" lets you play 4 different classes. For custom classes you need to buy the Kingmaker DLC.","November 16, 2014","true","999.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Armor may as well be purely cosmetic, with the ability to get your neck slit while wearing a Frogmouth helmet, along with the fact that a barely pulled hunting bow with a flaming arrow can be as powerful as a couple hundred footpound crossbow. Not only that, but the community is, atleast from what I had seen, horrible. You got your group of new players, which is to be expected, but the annoyance really comes in when you get the level 60 holier than thou players. Generally using a setup that can either instakill no matter how many inches of steel you have guarding your body, or have weapons that you can swing faster than a dagger. I'd rather have a slower fight with 2 heavily armored knights using proper sword and shield equipment be a dominant playstyle than having tattered clothes and pitchforks or heavyily armored swinging an execution axe like a daisy around build that is oh so common.","December 24, 2014","false","180.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mount & Blade for example- M&B's multiplayer combat felt more dependable than this; When I hit someone two or three times, they're dead, depending on the weapon. WOTR is just... It's just... Ok. An example: I fear a lightly armoured man with a crudely constructed, wooden pitchfork more than I do a knight, clad in armour, because of one simple fact: the peasant weaving in and out of your swings is actually a player who knows how to exploit the many balance issues of this game! His pitchfork can swing faster than your 2-hand sword (of course), but instead, for some reason, do more ♥♥♥♥ing damage! AND THAT'S RIGHT; HE'S SWINGING HIS PITCHFORK! NOT STABBING! Every time I come across one of those little turds, they kill me so ♥♥♥♥ing hard that I'm throwing up gardening tools at breakfast.\n\nPitchforks aside, I just feel that WOTR's combat system has been 'balanced' to the point where everything just doesn't make sense anymore. Weapons just arn't dependable, nothing has a realistic crunch, when expected. I feel like I'm being punished for choosing the heavy knight build; Every weapon negates your layers of armour, unless it's a sword, so I'm down as quickly as the next guy. Call me a crying 'noob' but I feel as if I've played enough of this game to be able to voice my opinion.\n\nRABBLE RABBLE RABBLE!\n\nDespite all this, a nice aspect of this game, I have to add, is the level of customisation, and the implimentation of an advanced physics system for weapons.\n\nIt's certainly a niche game, but If you're looking for something similar, only a little more... violent and immidiate, try Chivalry.\n\n","May 17, 2014","false","138.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SozzysGG/recommended/42160/","SozzysGG","SozzysGG^^","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SozzysGG/","113 products in account","A really fun game that needs a minimal balancing to be done.\n\nYou have alot of servers to choose with a few of game modes. As you will join one you will be able to choose two sides: York or the Lancaster. Theres actually no difference betwen them. Then you will be able to choose from different classes. As a demo you will be only able to choose 4 classes: Longbowman, Guardsman, Footman, Footknight. For a start, go with Guardsman as it is easy to play. If you have the full version, at the needed level you will be able to purchase a custom class slot that you can customise. For a start i would recomment a two handed sword with an axe or a mace. Since maces and axes requires to hit with the end of the weapon to do any damage. Armors and weapons can be customised, from the colors of it to what steel it should be made of. Different steel has its own ups and downs, keep in mind to read what it does.\nKeep in mind that swords will barely do any damage to heavy armor users while maces will do less damage to light armor.\n\nThe start will be rough, you'll have to learn the fighting system closely, it's tricks and weaknesses.\nA good way to start is to go to a duel server.\nWhat is a duel server you may ask? It's a server where you cant just go and attack someone, you have to "Call" someone to battle. Here's a tutorial for a duel server: Let's say you found an opponent you want to fight with. Come in front of him and do and Up-block which is done by dragging your mouse up and clicking the right mouse button. If he wants to fight you, then he should do the up-block to you and that means that he accepts the duel. You then can attack him freely, until he is down(You can't execute him) or he shows an up-block while in a fight, that means he wants to bandage(Hoding B). Most of the people only uses it when they are bleeding. In that time you can freely bandage yourself. If you defeat the opponent it would be nice to do an up-block while they're down. That would mean "Good fight". Now, the bad side of duels: The Randomers or RDMers. They're basically people who are just killing everybody. People like these can be freely attacked on sight unless they stop doing that, most of these Randoms as we call it ends up with a ban or a kick. So duel nicely.\nOh and by the way, horses are Killed on Sight on duel servers.\n\nSome tips:\n1. BLOCK! Alot of new players are not doing this, but its very important.\n2. Use a shield only in tank and archer classes. In other classes it will only slow you down and will prevent you from learning   to parry that you will NEED.\n3. If your ally needs bandaging, come near him and hold E. You can bandage allies faster than themselves and you will get some nice gold and XP for that.\n4. Support your allies! Team work is a major thing to consider in WoTR, Solo'ers will never win.\n5. If you're an archer do whatever you can not to hit your teammates, you don't even imagine how much times i got killed because of our archers shooting without caution.\n6. Play! Best way to learn the game is to play it.\n\nThats not a great review but a kinda long one.\nMy suggestion? Buy. A fun game that is very challenging for a start.","July 8, 2014","true","325.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

After that i was on a mission to get this game i needed to have it, finally after many years... i got it, off ebay for $5.00 for a Steam key. I started playing as soon as i could, it was a bit hard to get used to the controls but that is one of the many things that made it unique! After a lot of practice i started to become a real threat on the battle field this is probably when i started to really get into it, but i was around level 20 when that happened so there was a lot of under dog moments in the time before that. But even when i was getting smashed i was still having fun!\n\nYou can play as many as 64 players to a server, this is when it is absolutely crazy! But I did enjoy these crazy servers... I Also really liked the amount of things you can edit in your custom classes, this is where some help from a tutorial can really be useful :D I saved my money to get the heavist armour there was, i thought i would become a HUGE threat when i finally earned the 50,000 coins. I was wrong, just because your heavily armoured doesnt mean you are going to be a great player, the heavy armour makes you incredibly slow. So i would suggest a medium armoured class.\n\nHonestly as much as i loved the game the battle field training was pretty terrible, the AI ( artificial intelligence) did not act anything like a real player would. Plus if you wanted to verse them in a close quarters battle be prepared to get R-A-P-E-D in numbers, even though the AI themselves are very easy to eliminate.\n\nThe Coat of Arms is quite precise in this game their are endless combinations, I personally made a very colourful shield/emblem but if you are going for a 'camo' approach, their are appropriate colours to choose from.\n\nThe gameplay really is amazing, so far i have played 127 hours of this game and i feel there is much more to master. After all i know a player who is rank 60 and has played over 550 hours, and i run in to him quite often both as team members and as opponents. There could be a bigger selection of game modes though, there are (at the moment) only 3 game modes; Team Death-Match, Conquest and Assault. All thought all these game modes are quite different a bigger selection could really help this game.\n\nI wont get too technical with things like graphics and how well it runs, but it is quite a nice looking game with quite a few unique maps, that really set the Medieval theme great. But the colours on all the maps appear quite dark, but i guess nothing really had to be too bright and that might give it a strange 'cartoony' feeling.\n\nI cant explain how much i love this game, but i would definetely recommend it, I had alot of fun with it and i am glad that there is a War of the Vikings now, that im sure will be just as good :D\n\n10/10 for me :)","June 4, 2014","true","214.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","7"

The idea is that the game is based off of skill, how well you can fake out an opponent, or by how good your reflexes are. New players are often crushed because they have no skill as of yet, and that's the point: you have to GET better to PERFORM better.

Why? Well there is few reasons:\n\n1. You can actually get 1-shot kills with ranged weaponry AND melee weaponry.\n2. Hit-boxes are extremely accurate. If you miss with arrows what flys just little over the head, it goes just little over the head.\n3. It just got brand new Anti Cheat update, what we all have been waiting for!\n4. If you're F2P, that's okay 'cause you can get insta kills (1-hit kills) with "vanilla" weaponry too. Actually there is alot of players who uses F2P equpment all the time and are very good with them! So there's no need to buy anything if you don't want to.\n\nAnd if you want to have full experience about the game, buy Kingmaker add-on. It's about 18€ (and in sales much cheaper) and it's still cheaper than Chivarly AND War Of The Vikings (which is in my opinion not as good as War Of The Roses)\n\nIf you want good medieval game, this is MUST have!","June 29, 2014","true","443.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But at some point you will get a grip of the mechanics (Though i still see a lot of people furiously avoiding to block attacks) and rejoice in purging the lancastrian peasant folks from what is rightfully the land of the White Rose!!\nI prefer this over Chivalry, because the combat in this game seems a bit more tactical and controllable than in Chivalry.\nAs for cheaters, I only once met one. The newest patch brought an Anti-Cheat system, so it should be more safe to play now, if you are in doubt.\n\nThe free to play version of this game is restricted to certain classes and weapons, so its more of a "try before you buy". But the game is really not that expensive, especially when there is one of many sales on it again.\nI hope some more people will give this game a try, because its definitely worth it.

Currently, this game s plauged by Pay to Wingodplayers, bugs with game mechanics, such as Hit boxes that make the first Borderlands's hit boxes look like a walk in the park. my first battle, I spawned in, banned from server. 2nd battle, I spawn into heavy fighting on another server and i am rushed by someone who looks like the collasus, with a giant axe and heavy armor, my simple rapier is no match, and i am knocked to the ground. At this point, i notice a nice fature, that team mates can revive you in a sense, that is if they get to you before you either bleed out or are impaled by your assailent.  I feel this could be a great game, but it needs much more testing, and from other reviews, Paradox seems to not take criticism well, I have no experiance of this first hand, but I believe this game was released a bit too early, However, this is what betas are for, i hope to see better things from this game soon, then i may change my review and invest more time into this.","January 6, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The melee combat system is similar to that of Mount and Blade: Warband. Each attack is executed from a certain direction (Note: some weapons stab instead of an upward swing) and requires your opponent to use a corresponding block to avoid taking damage. The combat system is supported by the armour and weapon system. Some weapon types are better against different armours, though the skilled player can exploit the joints and gaps in the wearer's protection to deliver damage. For exaple using a blunt weapon tends to be better for bringing down heavily plated knights than bladed arms which bounce off. There are vast amounts of weapons which can be further customised to suit your playing style, as well as many armour types which can be modified (and also painted pretty colours for ridiculous sums of gold). This makes for a very interesting game, with multiple game modes and so called (and unofficial) 'Duel Servers' where you can practice in 1 on 1 matches. Items are either level or XP locked. Gold is earned through playing, dealing damage, killing enemies and helping allies. While gold can be bought it only means you can get a fancier weapon instead of a plainer but very similar/same one, so gameplay isn't affected very much and you can earn it with relative ease through playing. I recommend it greatly, although many people have pointed out the rather steep learning curve. Yes the game is hard and you will always die, but once you get the hang of it, find the arms and armour you prefer, you will see why so many play it. Play for free to see if you like it (you are stuck with the default classes for the first few levels anyway in the paid version, so there isn't any difference) and then decide whether you want to pay or not.","December 3, 2013","true","138.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very very satisfying. However there are plenty of roles in the game and you'll find one that suits you best, there is a large degree of customization from archer builds to heavily armored polearm builds, rarely are two opponent ever the exact same. The problem here is that within all the customization is a large degree of imbalance. Some of the weapons feel extremely overpowered like the Gallo axe while others like the swords feel somewhat underpowered. There is a reward for reaching the final level in the form of a peasant outfit and pitchfork which essentially 1 shots players, but only if you hit with the sweet spot. I guess I see the joke in this, still it's a little frustrating having to deal with this bit of comedy in every game.\n\nWhile the game certainly isn't pay to win, you can purchase coin and move yourself ahead a little bit, the really costly items are mainly cosmetic, while there's plenty of easily attainable high quality gear for not much coin. The game comes with several really good preloaded classes as well which you can use to good effect while you save up to create your own custom loadout. Attaining items is as simple as playing the game, earning coin, and then purchasing whatever you want, there is no tedious levelling through weapons aren't interested in to obtain higher level weapons that you are. If you want that golden sword, save up the coin and purchase it straight away.\n\nThe community in this game is small, usually only filling one or two servers at any given time, and for the most part are probably the angriest child men you can encounter online. Of course you can always hop on your horse, single them out, and lance them in the face on your next respawn.\n\nAs good as all of this sounds, I can't give the game recommendation simply because the developer has abandoned it. There are many issues that need to be resolved in terms of gameplay mechanics and balance that aren't likely to be addressed any time soon. It's a shame because this game has so much potential and could really be expanded. The level design is kinda meh, but it gets the job done, however a little more love to this game could go a long way towards restoring the flagging player base.","August 31, 2014","false","99.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love it, but at times I find it so unplayable.\n\nThe combat is great, the way you can block incoming attacks and power them up to kill others. The bow system is a little off sometimes but gives a realistic feel to the game.\nIt is very fun to play with friends online, especially when charging as cavalry. However, I have found that I kept getting disconnected from servers. It fades to black and then exits me from it, and I cannot rejoin that server unless I restart the game. Even on no ping limit servers I get this problem and it is blimmin' well annoying if you are actually doing well in the game and then get disconnected.\nI have also found a couple of the weapons to be way too overpowered in the game. Such as some of the pollaxes that insta-kill very frequently, and crossbows which do the same.\nI also found that it is waaaaay too easy to flank or be flanked in this game which really annoys me when I'm playing archer and some heavy armoured guy comes along with his pollaxe and chops my head off. Of course, that is part of the fun in this game (mostly for the armoured guy) but it still is pretty freakin' annoying as you see your allies ahead of you not coming back to help as they don't realise that they have been flanked.\n\nI love this game and will continue to play and rage through it, but I would not recommend it to others.","June 17, 2014","false","18.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was skeptical at first to get it, as his computer was only getting a max of about 7 FPS, even on the lowest settings. Knowing this, and knowing my PC is worse than his, I was quite hesitant. When I got it a couple days ago, I had literally crashed my PC when the MENU opened. After quite a bit of messing with the options before loading up the game, it had managed to open, but took about 5 minutes to just load the menu. After it did, it was running at a max of 4 FPS. I seriously wanted to play with my friend as well, and have my own game progress. However, this isn't the case as it wasn't able to find a single server to play on, rendering the game useless as it is a multiplayer only game.\n\nAbout the community: Before the anti-cheat patch, the game and servers were filled with cheaters and people who wouldn't play fair. After the patch (which is when I got the game) it had considerably less people, and though the cheaters were mostly gone, it was quite slow pased as less players were around to play against, and this was frustating too. Though it can somewhat be enjoyable to an extent, and have some good gameplay if you join a server that has 20+ people in it, though it is very rare to find one, I wouldn't recommend getting it now.\n\nBefore the anti-cheat patch: 5/10\n\nAfter ther anti-cheat patch: 3/10\n\nOverall: 4/10","October 9, 2014","false","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

So much potential wasted. If you are starting your adventure with War of the Roses you will notice in 2nd game, that guys with level 60 will pwn you now matter what you do or try. So I wanted to play 1on1 with my friend - he was starting too. Guess what... there is no option to create your own server or play alone. You have to PAY for the server from one of the vendors... WTF? Ok... we tought "there are plenty of empty servers, which we can play on. On every server it was less than 3 minutes and we were surrounded by guys with levels 60. Try to play against this. Kills the fun. Overall idea behind this game is good. Maps I have played were well made, maybe a little bit too tricky (like jumping in full plate from roof to roof). Expining is not fast, I'm not sure how about later in game, but after what I have played I got to level 4, which basically doesn't give you much. Mount&Blade is so far superior to this title I am literaly speechless. Don't know about Chivalry, still have to test it out. If you want to play some decent game I would recommend Dark Souls instead of this. It has magic and gameplay is totaly different, but overall satisfaction and fun is by far superior. I've lost my point in this review so it is probably so random as is War for the roses.

Litterally, I have 10+ hours on this game, and with my best equipment I am dealing about 8% damage per hit with my swords, have you never heard of balancing? I understand why you do this, the way this whole game works is that once you have bought the game, which is vastly too much imo, you then have to spend alot of money on better armour and weapons so that you can actually hit somebody in this game, you make a paid game pay to win??

First of all, in the single player mode, you're executed for desertion if you try to go kill the enemy because they are outside of a tiny little area.  So you spend a lot of time waiting around for someone to get through the other troops and archers.  Past that, combat is the most clunky system I have ever seen, and quite simply does not work nearly half the time.  The left mouse button simply does nothing, and other than a broken game design there is no clear indication why.  When it does work, your movements are slow and laborious, there is nothing epic or engaging about it, just lethargic and frustrating.

I got this on sale for $5 and believe it's worth every penny, but $20? no. Not in my opinion.\nPros\nFairly fast paced medieval action\nWeapon and armor variety\nSquads\nonce your used to how the game plays its pretty easy to play\ngreat fun with friends\nCons\nBALANCE for example certain weapons are ridiculous like the 2 handed short hammer swings way too fast has since i bought the game, still does. any 2 handed axe is too easy to spam you can literally use an almost uncharged swing and do 30+ damage to full plate, add the speed bonus for consecutive hits to the speed which is already too fast and you get game breaking combat. The only other weapons i have gripes with are the peasant pole arm and larger morning star they are top rank weapons but can hit you from any range easily 1 to 2 shotting anyone.\nHackers\nbound to be present in any online game, but this has been out for how long? really youve got access to valve anti cheat and your own servers come on keep them out.\n\nOverall i think its a fun game i enjoy it though i dont think its worth $20 until the issues are fixed, but with war of the vikings being out i doubt they will be","March 4, 2014","true","77.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you are more used to slower-paced games, this game will throw you off. If you are used to games that require little in terms of practice and skill, this game will throw you off. This is not your average multiplayer game, this is something unique and different.\n\nSome claim that the controls are clunky and awkward and, you know what, they are. The point is that it's not something that takes away from the game; rather, it is just another element that you have to learn, adapt to and then master. We are all noobs to begin with and this game makes that painfully clear.\n\nIf you're a terribad, you're going to hate this game, because no matter what you do, others will seem to instantly kill you from miles away with a crossbow, mow you down with a horse and lance, crush your face with a hammer coming down on your helmet like the wrath of a severely irked deity... but if you decide to lift yourself above the masses and actually learn the mechanics, learn when to use the dagger, when to use the poleaxe, how the arrows drop off... then you will eventually be rewarded ten-fold, when you snipe that pesky mounted knight right off his horse at 200 yards.\n\nThis game rewards skill and, unfortunately for some, skill is not an unlock.\n\nThe graphics quality is top-of-the-line and with all settings cranked to the max, it looks as good as any triple-A title on the market. It has some work to do in the optimization/performance department, but those are just details, minor cracks in an otherwise superb presentation. If you don't own a beastly machine, turn shadows off, and your framerate will skyrocket.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely worth the learning curve and money :)","August 8, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It definitely has a different feel than that of mount and blade. The Combat is similar, more raw and heavy. The graphics are wonderful and the physics are awesome. The downside is that no one plays this game anymore and online matches are a joke. You'll often find yourself facing 5 guys at once who have used their real life money to buy themselves high level gear.\n\nSo what a friend and I have decided was to hop into "Duel" servers and just fight eachother one on one trounament style. Luckly that has resurrected this game for us and has given it it's own personality. We play mount and blade for that raw medieval combat, and War of the Roses for a nice gentlemans duel.","May 7, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

WoTR can be boring.\n\nIt was a still born, neither fully grown nor unique and never had the potential to be a really good game anyways. Best part is graphics.\n\nBuy if you have some friends to play with and means to run your own server (which is a lot of money), pass if you don't feel you need it. If you do buy though and somehow survive the initial shock and get 40s, remember your humble beginnings and don't be an ♥♥♥ in duel servers.\n\nEdit: Thumbs up since its basic version is free.\n\nEdit 2: It is really satisfying when people rush you with no defence in mind because you go with a basic class, only to find that you are not a new player =)  a good ruse worths three man.\n\nTIP : DO NOT EVER get angry over something in this, if you feel you're getting angry just stop playing and watch a movie, return when you're calm and ready to swing some.","May 10, 2015","true","258.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Years later I ponder back and wonder why a Dev would make a game for PC yet not make lower required settings for better optimization for all possible users.

Horrible gameplay and animations, you dont even need any skill as its all xp based. If you have good armor, your enemy has no chance with a short sword as it does jackshit damage and just bounces off it. If your lance barely touches the ground it splinters into a million pieces so what do you do? Pull another one out of your ♥♥♥ of course. Horse animations ♥♥♥♥ing horrible and finicky, and theyve ♥♥♥♥ed sword fighting up so much it looks like your dancing. Theyve also added this charge feature thing which is basically your character running really fast for about 1 or 2 seconds, cause somehow in full plate armor your character can sprint. Seems legit. But in saying this it does have reasonable graphics and nice physics but sadly thats the only good part. Also it has NO singleplayer. I could ramble on about this game for ages saying how bad it is but that would be a waste of time. Simply dont buy this game, its a rip off for 30 bucks.","October 13, 2012","true","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This means that your game experience is directly based upon how much money you invest in the game to unlock new maps,Features,Customization options etc.\n\nThe combat and customization was meant to be the driving force behind the game but sadly gets lost amongst all the locked features that will require a steady flow of money to unlock and enjoy. This Game is sadly  'Keep paying to keep having fun' and therefore with all the great true 'free to play' games out there this i just cannot recommend","December 20, 2013","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

TDM is about killing every enemy till their points are depleted and Conquest is where you capture certain points on map and defending or pushing further to other points, while killing all the enemies of course.\n\nThere's a persistent character progression, meaning you won't start over everytime you start a new game. Everything you do earns you experience points and gold, the more you level up, the more you unlock certain items ready to be bought and added to your collection for which you use the gold you earned. You can create your own custom classes like heavy armoured knights with claymores, light armoured sneaky and fast scouts and mounted cavalries in addition to the ones you get by default.\n\nProper medieval war with pure PVP fun~ definitely worth it.","October 8, 2012","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

War of the Roses is third-person action game that revolves around mouse movements to block and attack; and Chivalry is a first-person action game that revolves around button pressing attacks and a single button block. In both games you can play as archers or crossbowman and melee classes. WOTR has cavalry in addition, but the horses are glitchy. In my opinion WOTR has a more precise system of attacking and blocking, as well as a greater emphasis on encumbrance and armor choices compared to Chivalry. Success in both games relies on careful timing and knowing your weapon’s speed and reach. Combat in WOTR has a bit of a learning curve if you haven’t played any of the excellent Mount and Blade series, and some of the weapons could be more balanced. I recommend you try both if you are interested  in the genre, but for me WOTR is the better multiplayer medieval combat game.","May 15, 2013","true","370.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

MASSIVE BATTLES!!!!??  32 (at release it was 32) to players is not ´massive... Instead buy Mount and blade Warband if you want massive battles with more than 100+ players.. its not so good looking as this, but the feeling is here, also when riding a horse into combat with lance is a lot more satisfaction than in this.\n\nName                   Combatfeeling, Graphics, Customization, animations, playerlimit\nWaroftheRoses    1/5                        4/5               5/5                   2/5  stiff            64\nChivalry                  5/5                        5/5               2/3                   5/5 realistic       64\nM&B Warband       3/5                       3/5               5/5(mod)         3/5                     100+","March 7, 2013","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What kind of breaks it is the pay to win option with the axes (and that acursed 1-hit ko pitchfork), but it is otherwise an excellent medieval experince.\n\nIt would be very interesting to see this kind of real, skill oriented combat in an open world, with RPG elements.

As a free to play you will be able to play any of the premade classes (4) but if you pay the kingmaker DLC you'll be able to customize your soldier (customization is great) to make your own type of soldier, it is very cheap so..\n\nThe problem is there is like 60-80 people playing (32 ppl servers), most of them join duel servers and they are full of griefers that will constantly murder teammates and revive you while the enemy is waiting to spawnkill you. However if you can find a TDM/Conquest/Assault server they are very fun to play (specially conquest) and you will have no problems there.\n\nJust don't expect to be able to make honorable duels or anything, it's sad there isn't more people playing but I'd still recommend the game because you can try it for free and see if you like it.","January 2","true","19.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a free to play you will be able to play any of the premade classes (4) but if you pay the kingmaker DLC you'll be able to customize your soldier (customization is great) to make your own type of soldier, it is very cheap so..\n\nThe problem is there is like 60-80 people playing (32 ppl servers), most of them join duel servers and they are full of griefers that will constantly murder teammates and revive you while the enemy is waiting to spawnkill you. However if you can find a TDM/Conquest/Assault server they are very fun to play (specially conquest) and you will have no problems there.\n\nJust don't expect to be able to make honorable duels or anything, it's sad there isn't more people playing but I'd still recommend the game because you can try it for free and see if you like it.","January 2","true","19.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Being based very closely to the mount and blade fighting mechanics and an interesting and unique point in history sounds like a perfect combination for a successful and fun game but quite the opposite happened. Weapon update after weapon update has changed the game from a fairly realistic and accurate medieval fighting game to another try hard game full of unarmoured players running around with unbalanced weapons that do not reflect the rediculous damage they inflict. One of the most powerful weapons is a wooden pitchfork... A better alternative is Chivalry or wait for the new Mount and Blade to be released to get your moneys worth.","February 9","false","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
