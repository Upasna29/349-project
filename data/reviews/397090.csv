A lot of humor, as well.\nThe graphics are unique, and nicely done ---- both in the overworld, and in the battle scenes.\nMusic is excellent, and is very appropriate to the events occurring as you play.\n\nThis one is a steal at the price being asked, and is a must have for any fan of these classic games ---- very much recommended.\n","March 24","true","3.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

You can see that from the screenshots i posted on here. That does not make it a bad game.....What makes it a bad game is there are some bugs in it, such as pathfinding (able to walk into certain walls that were not intentional). The developer needed to test this game more a bit..they could fix these issues and i could show them where if they came back on here. Anyways, interesting story, but the audience is not really told much, apparently, until the second game, which is out who knows when...that is what i don't like, keeping the audience out of the loop until you think your going to make a sequel. Some of the other characters developement was pretty good though. All in all, a unpolished game with some minor bugs that can be fun, but don't expect prize winning writing or AAA game styles.\n\nAnyways, the story is still somewhat overly ambigious..and confusing, and all the characters are not explained about their powers...hope for the second game to come out, or be in story limbo forever!","May 30","true","13.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This one on the other hand looks like the developers have taken some care and attention to their game. There is a interesting story line, and great opening cutscene that just makes you ask "what the hell is going on?" The characters are really nicely done and the mapping is fairly decent, of course there are some flaws with the game which I will talk about as well.\n\nGameplayWind Child is a fun and great RPG Maker game that really does look like they have taken some care and consideration to this game. This game isn't a cash grabber like some other RPG Maker games are. According to the developer, the game is approximately 20 hours long, if this is true then this game really has been worked on well. The opening cutscene ireally pulled me into the story, I wasn't really sure what was going on and why I was these people I was playing as but it was intriguing none the less. As the story begins to unfold, the game really shows off what you can do with RPG Maker. The characters that you come across are very well done, it's not like other games where you have a character added to your party for no specific reason to do so. Wind Child really makes sense for this person to help you along your journey as you play through the game. Upon entering new towns and cities you come across, you will find people to talk to. They aren't all just welcome to the city, some of these characters give you some background information about the story or about themselves.This draws away to the basic defult character saying things like "hello" and such that just really aren't that interesting. Another thing that the developers dide very well is the custom start menu and the mission log. The mission log is rather helpful if you have taken a break fro the game and when you come back in you are not sure what to do. The mission log will tell you what your missions are. Although I have explained a lot of positives about the gameplay itself, there are also some negatives that I feel like I must cover. First off, some of the tiles don't work the way that they should. What I mean by this is that you can walk through a tile that you aren't suppose to normally, either because you aren't on the right level, or because the block is meant to be impassable. A example of this is when you enter your home town, upon entering you will have to walk under a bridge to get across, although you walk over the bride. If you then walk forwards you will then be on the next height part of the world. This kind of brings down the game a little, as I found a couple of tiles that weren't exactly acting like they where suppose to. Another thing that slightly annoyed me whlist playing this game is the text that breifly describes the mission you are currently doing. Sometimes a line of text will be bold and the other lines will just be in normal font, this slightly annoyed me as this game is really fun to play.\n\nGraphicsThe developers really went all out with the custom tilesets that they created for their game specifically. This really makes it look different from the other RPG Maker games that only use the default tiles with minimum editing. Wind Child really takes the game and makes it their own, this just makes the game more unique and well presented. There is also a very nice transition whenever you enter a new town or city, with the name of the town that appears on the screen. The mapping (which I guess is part of graphics) is really well done, although I found that in some places it did seem a little bit empty like there was just too much space. Also in my personal opinion I didn't like some of the designs of the houses, they looked weird and out of place. Most of the outside mapping was done really well, there wasn't overcrowding trees or anything that really didn't make the map look natural.\n\nMusic & SoundWhen it comes to the music and sound of this game, I feel like th developers really got it right. There is fast paced music when something happens, when you have to chase that guard. It's then very calm and collective when you are in town or city. Something that I didn't like is that some of the houses didn't have any sound at all, and that really was a little dull. I also didn't like the way that the music carried on from outside to the inside of the houses. To me that kinda lowers the game a little.\n\nConclusionWind Child is a very unique type of RPG Maker game. For the price that it's asking for this is definitely worth picking up. The game is approximately 20 hours long according to the developer, and that is well worth the money the game is asking for. The story is very interesting as are some of the characters you meet along the way.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Sometimes You Playing curator group here.","March 18","true","2.5"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","15","26","2","1"

It has awesome graphics and very cure designed characters. Also the fighting system is made very well and makes the Game very enjoyable! It’s not like most other RPGs here on Steam which are not even playable. This is for sure a Gem every RPG fan should have in his library!\nThe story itself is filled with action from the first second on, and it will continue to surprise you during the whole Game. It tells the story of a girl that randomly was kidnapped and which then needs to be rescued. To do so you start as a little girl which needs to find other people which can help her to rescue the kidnapped girl. You will end with four different fighters with different abilities which are totally awesome! You always can check what your current mission is too. This is a feature I miss in many RPGs and makes this Game even more fun to play because you don’t spend hours running around searching for the next mission. Also the music chosen in this Game fits perfectly with the Storyline and makes the Game really emotional. Also to mention: This Game has a perfectly working full controller support which is a must have in my opinion.\nAnyways if you are a RPG fan I am pretty sure you would enjoy this Game and you should pick it up right now because this Game is worth far more than only $4!\nRating:\n8.4/10\n\nPros:  Well-made Game\nGood RPG\nSimple fighting system\nA lot of different characters\nWorks also on older devices\nWell-chosen music\nFull Controller Support\nAchievements + Trading Cards\nCons:  None Yet\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor   BENQ 24 inch 1ms    Headphones   Apple Earpods    Keyboard   Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard     Controller   Xbox 360    Mouse   Zelotes T-90    Microphone   Integrated Laptop Micro    OS   Windows 7","March 22","true","4.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
