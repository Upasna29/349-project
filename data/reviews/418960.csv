Also no achievements, so it's hard to find the motivation to keep playing after a (very little) while;\n- IT CRASHES TO DESKTOP EVERY 45 MINUTES SO EVEN IDLING IT IS A NIGHTMARE!\nGot it in a bundle and I'm glad of that because I can't recommend it even at the -75% price.","December 28, 2015","false","3.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Become a jumping cat that magically transforms into a perfect square when it jumps and jump around the map in search of jellybeans. You must travel the area while dodging enemies and obstacles while you eat all the jellybeans you get your paws on.\n\nIs this game worth it?\nThis is a great and affordable platformer, it is meant for casual and hardcore platformers. It is pretty easy and simple making it quite fun for people not to serious about it. It also can be very challenging trying to achieve 3 stars on each and every level and be quite a fun challenge. This game has quite a few hours of gameplay in it and is very affordable, I recommend this to each and every platform gamer.\n\nPros Cats!\nJellyBeans!\nFlying cats!\nCat turns into a flying box.\nUse your tail to fly high in the air in search of jellybeans.\nHard, yet fun platformer.\nLots of levels.\n\nCons\nCant customize your cat.\nLevels can be really easy.\nCant fullscreen the game.\nTiny Levels.\n\nFinal Verdict\nI rate this platformer a 7.6/10, I am not a big fan of platformers but this one was quite enjoyable. I found it very relaxing making my cat chase after jellybeans. I only wish that there was customization for your cat(would love a tophat and monacle for my cat).\n\nIf you liked this review and would like to see more please follow our curation group Here","November 14, 2015","true","1.0"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","25","46","6","0"

The other thing was trying to use the aim and power IN MIDAIR was very fiddly and difficult to get right.\n\nAll in all, I think this game needs a bit more polish and could be a great game. It's still a decent enough game but it won't hold your attention for too long. The only reason why I tried this game out was because A.) it had a cat as its main character (albeit no real story or explanation for it) B.) it was $2.50 (if I had paid more, then I'd be quite upset) and C.) It's an indie title and you should at least TRY and give the smaller guys (or girls) a try and a helping hand.\n\nI hope there will be further updates such as the way to control and move around the screen, which would definitely improve at least the playability of this game.","December 25, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/republicofpeter/recommended/418960/","republicofpeter","republicofpeter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/republicofpeter/","679 products in account","You have to use your square cat creature to fling from one platform to another to get the different gems. You fling it by dragging the mouse in the opposite direction, which took me a moment to figure out as there were no real instructions. The fewer moves you do it in, the more stars you get (from 1-3). That is pretty much it. If you enjoy this type of puzzle platformer, it may be for you, but I found it a bit boring and repetitive. The game also crashed on me when I went to scroll from one screen to the next on the puzzle selection screen.\n\nA bit to dull for me: 4/10.","December 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"
