As it is right now the game is unplayable and causes you to fear that your mouse is broken. It feels broken until you find your way out of the screen and back to Steam. It's a classic game and if the controls worked it would be it's same great self but it's not and as it is now it's frustration. Stay away from this version of the Jewel Quest games.","April 29, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","5"
