I played through the entire game in one marathon session, which took me 20ish hours. If you like old school dungeon crawlers, you will love this game. You have a premade party, which seems like it was done to make the story work, but it's pretty open to how you develop each character's abilities. The game is very tongue-in-cheek, and the characters sometimes break the 4th wall. The dungeons are very well designed and many contain secrets, hidden areas, and puzzles(The Tower of Almost Certain Death is the best IMHO).  The game is balanced around attrition, so if you never use consumbables or make poor decisions you will be going back to town to rest or reloading a lot. Most of the mainstream reviewers complained about this, but I didn't really have a problem with it. Judicious use of "liquid nap" potions and drama stars will keep you from going back to town constantly. It's obvious that the designer has a deep love and understanding about what makes old school RPGs work, which many devs who try to make new games with older styles don't understand. The only thing I have bad to say about it is that the UI isn't great. It's not horrible, I never had any problems figuring out how to do what I needed to do, but it could have definitely been more streamlined. Still, that is a minor quibble for what was overall a great experience. I'm looking forward to FK2.\n\nedit: spelling","July 22, 2014","true","2.7"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","0"

Essentially what you're getting here is a fun, humorous CRPG. The combat system is fairly complex, so you'll find much to enjoy if you like stats. You won't mistake this for Skyrim, but the graphics are pleasant enough and evoke a Might and Magic 6 vibe for me (one of my favorite CRPGs). Movement is first-person and combat is turn-based. Considering that all of this is the work of Jay and a few friends, it's really amazing what he's accomplished.\n\nI posted a review of this game on my YouTube channel - just look for "Matt Chat 203: Frayed Knights."","July 25, 2014","true","0.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

While the storytelling is lighthearted and fun, the core game is deep and challenging. The combat is heavy into resource management and tactics often revolve around limiting the energy you spend while still overcoming the threats. The drama star system does a great job of helping you turn things around even when crap is hitting the fan and is far more satisfying than the average Save scum victories old-school RPGs are known for. If this isn't enough to satisfy you, there is quite a bit of customization that you can do to make the pre-made heroes your own.\n\nI love this game and highly recommend it to anyone who still enjoys old-school RPGs.","July 22, 2014","true","2.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealdeft/recommended/314120/","therealdeft","Deft","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealdeft/","103 products in account","This game gives me the 3-D explore feeling of Bard's Tale, the repetitive combat of Final Fantasy, and the spells, traps, and combat engines of Elder Scroll games. Oh, and then it's got the character personality of Three's Company.\n\nFrayed Knights is clearly a labor of love done by gamer enthusiasts in their spare time. It's the genuine indie article, and the developers did a great job bringing it to life.\n\nThis review is mostly about game play. You play this game for an RPG dungeon crawler. You don't play it for graphics and looks. The graphics do their job, but the beauty is in the mechanics, the characters, the humor, and the story.\n\nThis is a dungeon exploring game, with heavy emphasis on combat encounters.  You will fight, gain xp and loot, level up, customize your character abilities, solve some light puzzles, and fight some more.  Along the way you will also fight things. After that, you'll wander through a few zones fulfilling quests while fighting things. It will be a rare 60 seconds of wandering that doesn't have an encounter... and by that I mean more fighting.\n\nYou play a party of four adventurer-wanna-bes with a loser reputation. Each character is already pre-classed, and the balance is good: A fighter, a rogue, a sorcerer, and a priest. As you level up, you can customize them in any way possible, making the rogue a magic user, for instance, but the party you're given will save you some time and calculating. Many events in the game trigger entertaining dialog among the characters. It's the kind of tabletop style banter that is snarky, while still providing exposition, and makes you feel like you know the inside jokes they're tossing around. I never laughed out loud, but I smiled a lot and I liked the characters. I think the programmers had fun with this.\n\nThere are about 4 or 5 major zones in the game, one of them being a town.  Each zone has a couple of "dungeons".  Some quick, many are optional, but there's a lot of variation. The dungeons usually aren't starkly linear either, which is refreshing. The town is really boring, though. It's Elder Scrolls Morrowind boring. I wish it had all the same characters and one-third the size, with no superfluous buildings. I'm sure it was built for immersion, but you don't run very fast in this game so it became tiresome.\n\nCombat fatigue is the main mechanic in the game. It controls everything. As you adventure about, you will experience random encounters, ambushes, and monsters walking about. Combat is turn-based, and each action your characters take uses up endurance. At any time you can rest to recover endurance, but you never fully rest up. The more that you cycle through your endurance meter, the more fatigued your character gets, until finally, the character cannot recover any more endurance by resting until he/she sleeps at an inn. The trick of the game is maximizing your character abilities and balancing combat choices to be endurance efficient so you can stay away from town longer. Rather than cast the giant overkill of a maximized sorcerer fireball, you can cast the efficient but slow-killing disease over time while your fighters whiddle down the baddies.\n\nThe combat system throws you a few bones though. One of them is a novel game mechanic called drama stars. Your stars fill as you win battles and stuff, then you can redeem them any time for stat buffs, resurrections, healing, or my favorite, a full endurance meter top-off. These are a neat perk, keep you adventuring longer, and they're meant to be used as you get 'em.  If you load a savegame, you lose the stars. If you continue a game after quit (not the same as loading), then your stars stay intact.  It's an incentive to not reload save games every time something bad happens. An RPG first!\n\nCombat takes time and deliberate thoughtfulness. You will never get so strong that you have a one-shot "I-Win" button. Even very powerful AE spells never really take out a whole group.  It's pretty much the essence of the game, and it's not meant to be a cakewalk. It can be hard.\n\nThere are an ample amount of potions and consumables that you can loot and buy. USE THESE. Use them all day long and do not hoard them! They let you win more battles with minimal endurance spend.\n\nYour inventory is unlimited and this is handy. You just don't have to worry about returning to town to sell things or playing inventory tetris to make room for things. The merchants never refresh their sellables anyway, and most equipment upgrades will come from loot, treasure, and quests. Your money will be used for potions mostly.\n\nA lot of time and energy was spent building a trap and lock mini-game. Well, it's not really a minigame, but there are endless ways to disarm traps and unlock chests. Do you want to disarm the trigger? or neutralize the trap payload? or perhaps some mechanics in the middle?  It's cool that so much thought went into such a small part of the game, and it is far better than some of the lockpicking dexterity checks I remember from Elder Scrolls games.\n\nThe spell system is probably also overkill. I felt throughout the first 5 or 6 levels that I only had small percentage of useful spells. Then suddenly after a few more levels I had too many spells to choose from, and boosters for my oldest ones so they never became obsolete. There are just a lot of spells. I played the whole game and never cast all the spells that I had. I enjoyed the spell effects for what they were, and the witty descriptions, but it became tiresome to search through spell books all the time.  A better spell interface may have helped here. There are spell casting hotkeys, but only for 3 spells. As the game needs a keyboard and mouse anyway, three hotkeys was too few. Ten would have been better.\n\nAs you level up, the game opens up in terms of character class customization. Just as with the spells and disarm options, there are a LOT of feats, skills, and abilities.  Maybe too many feats. It doesn't matter.  Pick fun things to do with your characters and do those things.  I spent a little time microgaming and trying to optimize it, then I just said screw it and picked stuff that looked fun. I'm glad I did. Maybe all the options add to replayability, or to the RPG factor, but there's just no way you'll even get most the skills and feats available on any one character. Definitely get the feat that allows you to detect random encounters. If combat gets too repetitive, that feat will possibly save your interest in the game.\n\nThe graphic user interface itself is clunky and needs polish, but it is manageable. There are buttons in weird places, and it takes too many clicks to get to spells or inventory. It's also heavily dependent on keyboard/mouse. Luckily, the most common combat functions have keyboard hotkeys. A suggestion for next time would be tiny interface buttons for each character that you can drop in consumables or spells, a la Diablo.\n\nSo try the game out. Get past the graphics and the UI, and enjoy the billions of combat options.\n\nA final note, there's humor in this game at every turn. It's subtle, it's smart, it's the kind of humor I would use with my own gamer friends. You're supposed to have a good time with this.\n\nThanks for reading.","October 17, 2015","true","25.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Know what you're getting into. The price tag reflects the quality of the graphics, music and what not. Its an indie game made by a very small team and it shows. The style is cartoony, and light hearted and that's not everyone's thing. You also have a group of premade characters, though the freeform skill system still means you can "multiclass" them with few problems. For example the thief can be effective made into a combat oriented thief or a thief/cleric type character. I made my mage into an archer/mage for example. The game is a first person/party based game and it looks a lot like Wizardry 8 and feels like it too. There are random encounters, the game has a lot of party building options, and so its not really a casual game. Its a short, fun RPG if you like these kinds of games. Its not Might and Magic 10 or Wizardry 8, but if you have enjoyed those and are looking for something similar and don't mind the shorter playing time and light hearted gameplay, than I can definately recommend Frayed Knights.","February 1","true","21.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

There's also a small bug where taking items with the "inventory" button (or by hitting the space bar) fails to trigger certain states.

During dungeons, its graphics can pass for "dated," and it /does/ have many of the qualities that I've come to love about the CRPG genre. However, it has downsides. Granted some of these are personal dislikes and may not be the case for everyone. In fact, if you -disagree- with this review, that's cool. I think I'm going to go ahead and be the bad guy if that means pointing out the flaws in this game that so many people are intentionally blind to. If you want the cliffnotes version of this review: take the positive reviews of this game with a grain of salt, and maybe go play something else.\n\nSo... first off, I felt I had a few miscommunications going into this game. The game claims character customization, and for some reason I was thinking that meant character creation. Not so: you play the game with the same party of four characters. To be fair, there's dialogue and banter and character development with these four characters, maybe even a bit with the npcs in the game. Even so, I consider this one one of the game's downsides. Why? Well, my all-time favorite games in the CRPG genre allow for actual character creation where you can pick race, class, and skillsets. To me, that makes each of the characters feel more relevant to -me-. I've seen games pull it off without char creation (Aarklash Legacy did that very well), but I really just kind of failed to care about the main characters in Frayed Knights. If you don't have that issue, good for you.\n\nThe graphics were probably the real deal-breaker for me. I try to be open-minded with graphics, considering some of my favorite CRPGs have dated graphics. That being said, Frayed Knights was simply unplayable at times. The models, textures, and animations of monsters weren't great, with some standing out as being particularly yuck. My real sticking point here is the towns, though. You are free to walk around in towns the same as a dungeon, yet that makes my next point glaringly obvious for players who make it this far: there really was a bare minimum of effort put into the towns. The house layouts are uninspiring, sure. But the real problem is the character models. Out of the few that don't have really terrible anatomy, they probably aren't even animated. It's honestly an embarassment of a town.\n\nSo, yes. There are a lot of things this game did. There might even be a few things this game did well. I -don't- think it poured life back into the CRPG genre, I -don't- think it's what CRPG fans have been waiting for, and I hate to say it but I don't think it's worth the ten dollars you could be spending on a better CRPG. Putting zany character sprites with goofy dialogue and fantasy names like "smakh daon" are really kind of misplaced effort--no matter how much you polish a clod, it's still a clod. In essence, this is an unfinished game that really can't stand up to the legacy of its genre. You could probably put the ten dollars needed for this game toward something good like Aarklash Legacy or Wizardry 8.","July 25, 2014","false","1.0"," 7 of 25 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","7","25","0","0"
