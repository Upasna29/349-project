However it is jaw-droppingly short, and there is no plot. Expensive for what it was.","December 17, 2013","true","2.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","1"

Only this one is much more challenging (ex: time limit) than the ones I played in the past. Most certainly recommend this to any puzzle solver looking for a more intimidating challenge.","January 14, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"
