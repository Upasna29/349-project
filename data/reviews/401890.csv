Although I should say this, you must be a fan of the series or else you won't get the full experience out of it, you might as well be playing dynasty warriors.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to the dynasty series, borderline copy and paste almost...But with some variation to make it not such a direct copy.  You find cards on the battlefield after defeating certain enemies, completing objectives, or finishing a level.  These cards give you passive buffs such as increased power, defense, musou/special gauge attributes, increased health, etc...\nIn order of increasing rarity you have C, B, A, (possibly S as well, I will change this once if I find one).  As you go up in rarity you get more passives per card.  There is a mini card crafting menu that lets you combine (10) cards to create a new one.\nWhat I did enjoy though is the mount combat, I haven't played a dynasty game where you kind of want to fight on your horse.  You can actually pull of combos, which I find is a very nice touch.\n\nWeapons, you can carry two at a time and can swtich between them in combat.  The weapons work in such a way that as you keep using your selected weapon and defeat enemies it will get stronger by recieveing elemental effects and increased combos.  And you can get different weapons which have different elemental properties, there are 4 in total.\n\nThe story mode follows the current season 1 anime very closely, so if you haven't finished watching then I would suggest to avoid this game if you don't want any spoilers.  Progression through the story is seamless it goes:  Battle -> story cutscene -> battle -> story cutscene -> battle and repeat.  There is no pause in between to equip cards or weapons, it is all done in the menu during the battle phase.\nThe game is quite linear.  You are free to move around and kill enemies, but eventually you have to complete a certain objective to advance.  The stages are broken up in segments, so continuing with my explanation, you have to do/complete certain objective to advance to the next segment. You cannot proceed if you don't complete it.\n\nThen of course you have all the different characters you can play, each having their own skillset and weapon of choice.\n\nI should also mention that there is online-coop, I personally haven't tried it yet, maybe a bit down the road.  But it is there for those that want to jump into online play right away.\n\nGraphics, I feel are very nice, the whole anime-style drawing of characters with the 3D-ish backgrounds.  You have many graphic options in the menu that you can mess around, which I feel is very nice for those that do like to change their graphical settings.  I'm not so great with the terminology with these settings, I just set it to whatever they give me, but I will say the visuals are very pleasing to my eye.\n\nFrom a hours:money stand point.  I feel it is a bit overpriced, you're pretty much paying for the anime name, which I don't see it being justifiable of a 60$ USD price tag, this feels more like a 30-40$ game.  So you must like the anime and the gameplay to almost justify this purchase.\n\nOverall this is great game, a solid "warriors" type of game.  And one last time, I can't stress this enough though, you must like the anime in order to get the full enjoyment out of this game, else the game will be mediocre to you.  I hope this review helps you decide in purchasing this game or not.\n\n\n*edit* 2/18/2016:  So after putting some hours into the game, I would like to change my opinion a little bit about needing to like the anime before purchasing this game.  The gameplay is actually really fun.  After spending some time and unlocking new weapon combos, they look and feel really cool.  The combos feel really unique and fit the characters really well, which I really enjoyed.\nWith that said, I feel that if you do like Musou kind of games, you can definitely enjoy this game without having to watch the anime.  As for price I still stand by my review  in that it is a bit overpriced.  BUT if you do have some extra cash to spare, then by all means purchase this game, it is worth it.","February 9","true","28.7"," 136 of 160 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","136","160","3","11"

This is KT best port of a Dynasty Warrior type game I have played, however it still has a lot of flaws.\n\nReasons to avoid:\n- If you play with KB and Mouse.  Game doesn't support using mouse.  Button prompts are xbox360 so you need to memorize the keyboard controls.\n- If you prefer English dub audio. This game has Japanese audio only.\n- Not familiar with anime. Not require to watch anime since cut-scenes summaries episodes.You can watch Arslan anime steaming from Funimation website. Subbed is free, dubbed requires subscription.\n- Not using a 16:9 aspect ratio display.\n- Possible performance issues with AMD video card drivers.\n\nImprovements compared to other KT games\n- Able to select resolutions above 1080p.\n- A lot of graphics options to configure.\n- PS4 level of quality and better if your system can handle it.\n\nSuggestions for KT:\n- Add mouse support to control camera.\n- Support multiple button prompts. If player is using keyboard switch to keyboard button prompts if player starts using controller switch to controller prompt.  Allow modders to customize controller button images to support other type of controllers.\n- Add more AA options such as SMAA.\n- Don't lock real time rendered cut-scenes at 30fps.\n\nIssues encountered:\n- Performance issues with resolution 1440p and high settings.  My Titan X usage isn't maxed out and CPU has very little load.  I have to switch to medium setting or 1080p.  Even at 1080p there are some frame drops.\n- When displaying on my TV game doesn't launch properly showing a green screen in full screen mode and causes performance issues.  I get around this issue by launching game in windowed mode then switching to full-screen in game.\n\nVideo of tutorials at start of game. Detailed tutorial prompts don't display since I already completed them.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620740830","February 10","true","5.2"," 97 of 115 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","97","115","4","9"

The combat is very fluid , very dynamic, and have an adition of a infinite combo system, that if you know what your doing you can chain attacks forever!\n\nTechnically , KT finally listened and the game can run at 4k, provide your system can run it, and the graphics are beautifull, run at 60 fps , but it have a 30 fps lock on mid-battles cutscenes for when you destroy a barrier with the cavalry, but they are fast animations and dont distract you from the action, you would only notice that if you run with a fps counter. The transition to in-game engine from anime cutscenes is pretty well done too!\n\nHeard AMD can have drops in fps, i run on Nvidia and didnt had any fps drops was solid 60 all the time.\n\nAll in all, its worth its price, lots of fun, and a must have for Musou fans :)","February 9","true","20.4"," 64 of 93 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","64","93","4","4"

This game needs more positive attention.  I mean that in the most don't ♥♥♥♥ this up for us kind of way.  I want more of this sub genre in their catalogue. Curse me, I even want more DLCs.\n\nI knew before I started the game I would love it -the instant I saw it. Usually, that feeling is met by severe disappointment.  Not so this time, Not so, Sir! There are unlockables in this game. Unlockables. Allow me to explain the gravity of that to the uninitiated:  that's stuff they could have just charged you for on DLC.\n\nThey have kept the same broth for this lovely stew but added some unique flavors.  The combat system is varied from character to character. You don't have the rigid, "normal-normal-strong MUSOU!" kind of solution - although it's still there as a core of the game and having an anime shell makes it more poignant as a system. The equipment system includes both weapon ability upgrades and stat upgrades.\n\nThe animations are top notch. The characters are fleshed out with an intro mission, at least two paragraphs description and a character-specific side mission apiece. The story isn't predictable -although it may seem that way to people who don't grasp what dramatic irony is supposed to accomplish.\n\nNow for the bad side:\nArslan himself is annoying AF! I want his story to end or grow up. He's an ok vehicle for the story and vagaries posited by the writers but man, that kid was not raised to meet the needs of a medievel, feudal, class-based society entrenched by recurring iconoclasm, religious monarchies and psychotic nepotism.  Seriously, it's just bad parenting.  Secondly, The constant dialogue is annoying as well. Mostly because there's not a drop of english and I get tired of being reminded of that.\n\nThe neutral:\n\nThe way that slavery is addressed is extremely east Asian. You'll see. There are other tropes, memes and themes.","February 14","true","19.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"

It's important to enjoy the franchise and the genre to enjoy the game. Personally,  this isn't the best Musou game compared to Pirate Warriors 3, but as an Arslan fan, I did think thtat it did the series justice and it was very enjoyable.

The story is there for fans of the series, but the gameplay is where the meat is for this title.  I appreciate that greatly, and it is nice to see that KT has not dropped the ball on this one.

It takes a bit to get used to the all keyboard controls scattered all over the place. Use a controller if support is available. This game follows the story line from the anime pretty close.

The game itself is around 10 hours long with not much replayability but the actual story/gameplay is quite good. Here are my complaints, or rather single complaint about the port.\n\n- Framedrops like crazy (Even on lowest settings around small crowds my framerate drops to about 30-40 with an FX-8370 and GTX 970 on lowest settings, which shouldn't happen.) (Mardan Rushes dropped my framerate to 13 FPS at one point on medium settings.)\n\nAs long as they add a bit of optimization to the game its everything a Warriors PC port should be, and I'll update the review if Koei desides to patch it.

It does ridiculous amount of chain combo. (like 2k-60k chains) and can use to get the objective or getting through some obstacle.\n\nPros:\n-The game able to go beyond 60 fps (vsync off)\n-Mindless Slaughter (like all DW games?)\n-Anime\n-Graphics is nice. and have many resolutions (can go 4k i think) and advance options (in-game AA is not very good)\n- Local co-op (split screen works just fine. in fact, you get more FOV this way) Online Multiplayer(?) I have yet to find an online match. been waiting for recruit / found no one looking for recruit. FYI none of my friend play this game lol. so no point sending invite to any of them.\n\nCons:\n-super narrow FOV.\n-poor Camera control. Cannot change camera speed. No target lock. very limited angle. (it's super bad when your character is next to wall in which you cannot rotate camera because it's somehow stuck to the wall and try to look at your character)\n-what is mouse? is it delicious?\n-poor Control. For example the Guard button will turn your camera to where the character facing. it also use for dodge (guard+direction). It also turn the camera to face the direction you're dodging. Result is a super spinning camera. Combine witn Super narrow FOV for great disoriente effect combo.\n\nalso the characters seem to be able to move 8 directions with the left 'analog' stick. while you can move forward fine turn with right analog stick. (maybe it's just my gamepad?)\n\n-poor HUD. the Minimap and Objective panel take 1/3 of the screen on the right, then your character take the center 1/3.\n\nbut in the end i kind of enjoy the mindless hack and slash and the anime. It takes me like 8-9 hours to get through the main story on Normal mode. my characters Level roughly around lvl 8-16 by the time it's end. but the Max level is 50 and there's still more scenarios to play to levelup weapons/characters, unlock/collect cards recipes and achievements.\n\ni'd recommend the game to anyone who is comfortable with playing with Gamepad. and can handle all the cons i mention.","February 10","true","17.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","9","12","2","0"

After intial probems that I had to sort due to the fact it read my intel chip rather than gforce.\nA mousou game that actually runs better than the ps4 version I had to pinch myself.\nVery responsive combat system evan with dodging and blocking.\nA very good story and lovely variation in maps and objectives. From one on one duels to full scale front line battles.\nFinally a port that PC users actually deserve.\nPlease keep them coming :)\n\nCons:\nPrice as much as i love the game it cost me £50 which is £10 pounds more than any ther mousou game and I will fully admit I am not ritch it did hurt my pocket.\nNo keybourd and mouse support. I always use a controller so personally I dont care but there is a large keybourd and mouse community that refuse to use a controller will be annoyed. To be fair koei cant win before they had keybourd prompts and it drove people crazy now they have adressed that keyboourd users are going mad.\nFor the price the game can feel short.\n\nall in all 8/10 this game put s a real smile on my face. It would have got a 10 if it was 10 pounds cheaper and the story lasted a little longer\n\nwould highly reccomend if you like the genre if you dont like he genre this si nto for you and go back to playing COD BYE","March 2","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's more than I expected! I never heard of the source material until I saw this game, and as a fan of Dynasty Warriors, and somebody who recently got into Berserk, the pictures made reminded me of Berserk's cast so I was like, "I'mma buy it. Can't be any worse than other KOEI games."\nAnd then it was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n\n9/10\nPros:\n*Great Combat System\n*Great Soundtrack\n*Great World, Lore, Story, and Characters\n*Some sweet new mechanics in a Warriors game\n\nCons:\nNothing of note. Other's have complained of performance issues, but I've had none, so eh.\n------------------------------------\n\nWhile they can't take credit for creating the world, or creating the main story, they can take credit for telling the story well. The game itself is gorgeous, with fantastic gameplay to boot, and on top of that the world is amazing. Even if you never heard of it like me, it's easy to get yourself immersed into and wanting to know more about it, and the story told is good enough to keep you informed on everything you need to know. The cast and voice acting are all amazing, (all Japenese though, only English Subtitles), and really bring out the character's even more than just their unique looks and combat styles.\n\nThe story itself is strong and gripping, and the way they tell it is great. There's of course the amazing big battles with plot happening on the field, but there's also the superb animations in between each stage of battle that further the story. It's fun to watch and feels like you're watching a show, getting lost in it's story and cast. The gameplay is like other Warriors games - lot of slashing and hacking. But, they do add some cool features - shields on bosses, stuns, dodges and  unique abilities seperate from a special attack (musou attack). There's also special events on the field of battle, that let you charge with cavarly or infantry, leading destruction in a glorious blaze, or fire volley of arrows with archers. It's a fun game with a nice unique twist and mix put into the Warriors franchise, telling the badass story of Arslan.","February 12","true","21.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katosu/recommended/401890/","Katosu","Caex Vaeriar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Katosu/","156 products in account","The game has a few major issues, of which I will post here:\n\n1) The gameplay. For those of you who are drawn here as Dynasty/Samurai warriors fans, know that the gameplay in this game will feel like a snail's pace when compared to these two series. Instead of there being officers proper in the game, the game throws a lot of 'Generals' at you, and the 'Generals' are frequently uninteresting in their combat style. Compared to the consistent named-units you get in the Dynasty/Samurai warriors games, this honestly feels like you're fighting fodder to get to a 'boss' at the end of a level.\n\nAnd what this does is create a feeling of wasting time until you can get to the end.\n\nNot only that, but the idea of the 'Charges' - while a brilliant idea that's fun in the first execution or two - does not stay fun. Once you've done it once or twice, all it becomes is a mechanic that has you 'moving forward' instead of feeling like the leader of an army.\n\n2) The visuals. Dear god, the visuals. Anime style is perfectly fine - I would've LOVED if the anime visuals were beautifully done, like watching an anime. That'd of been a huge turn-on for me personally. Instead, we got some kind of mutant abomination of anime - where every character does not feel like they were animated, so much as they were drawn on a page, cut out of the page, and treated like cardboard cutouts placed overtop a background with mouthes that flash up and down in the movement.\n\n3) The story - I do not think I am qualified to overly talk on this one, but the initial presentation of the story created a very repetitious level design out the gate. You start with a story that has you do a few mechanics. Cool, I can get into that! Then it cuts to a flashback of... something, in the past. Which is really just a nicely-masked tutorial. Ok, cool.\n\nThen we start the very first level again, only... from a few minutes before the same point we had already played. Literally, the first level... Played itself twice. So it was a slice of the level that it made you play twice with an extension on the beginning/end... It just didn't really feel fluid.\n\n\n\nThe things I liked:\n\n+ I felt the tutorials were nicely implemented into the game, to create story+gameplay. I like when games do that, though everyone may not agree.\n\n+ I like the customization of the characters, and know that had I been able to get into this game, I would've enjoyed using the 'cards' system to customize my stats and skill loadouts.\n\n+ Voice acting is really nice, though it's only in Japanese. I didn't mind it too much.\n\n+ THE GAME HAS CO-OP CAMPAIGN! Can play through with a friend, BUT A huge minus because your friend has to be either CLEARED of the stage OR ON THE SAME STAGE AS YOU, or else they can't join. So, if you're gonna pla with someone, make sure you're at the same point or one of you will be going back!\n\nThis was a refund for me. I might re-buy it at $20.00, but not worth it at $50.00\n","April 30","false","1.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","5"

The config screen on startup just flat-out didn't work. There were options in-game that solved the problem, but confusingly enough you couldn't access them until you completed the game's "prelude", so not a good start.\n\nOnce my graphics were up to a more manageable middle level, the FPS slowed down considerably (NOT 60, oh no). It wasn't totally unbearable, but after the relative smoothness of DW8 it was jarring to try and play like that. When my game crashed during the first major battle, I decided to get a refund.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it's good. Very similar to regular Dynasty Warriors, though. If you're looking for some Warriors action, just go get DW8. I didn't watch the anime, but for what I saw of the story, I felt like it did a good job of explaining and keeping itself comprehensible for newcomers. If you do like the anime and don't have the PS4 this was ported from, then you wouldn't be making a terrible mistake by buying this. But if you're just in it for the gameplay, then the price tag may be too great for you.\n\nTL;DR: Better port than Dragon Quest Heroes, worse port than Dynasty Warriors 8.","February 14","false","1.2"," 17 of 39 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","17","39","0","1"

I know why they didn't do it, recording VO is expensive, and this game was a risk. But I'm hoping if these releases are successful, they will be willing to add English VO to their future releases. My main complaint is that, while playing, I have to either focus on combat or reading the call outs, which causes me to either miss short call outs like "The messenger is running!" or completing an objective slow.\n\ntl;dr:\nBetter than the other licensed warriors games so far.

In general  this game has performance issues. its not a good port like the fanboys of anime says in positive reviews.\nMaybe the game is not optimize for SLI video cards.\n\n\n\nI already ask a refund.\n\nFan boys and virgins Otakus gonna hate this review , but someone needs to do the job. keep coming u r so funny virgin guys :v","February 9","false","1.0"," 41 of 257 people (16%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","16","41","257","23","28"
