On Steam alone I've logged about 280 hours in Chime so far. I backed Chime Sharp on Kickstarter. Believe me when I say it kills me to write that I do not recommend this game. I will eagerly change my review when or if it becomes playable.\n\nThe 3D effects make me nauseous however there is an option to turn it off in the Options. Why can't you access the options during gameplay? I haven't tried the newest build with a controller, only mouse and keyboard.\n\nThe colors of cleared squares are so matchy-matchy with the pieces that even after playing levels multiple times I still forget which color is which and waste time trying to color in grid I've already cleared. I tried playing casual and it seems like the only different is a smaller total grid (playing area). ***THE background matching too closely with pieces has been updated in multiple levels so that there is no confusion [on the first several levels if playing in order.] Approximately half of the levels are still mostly unplayable due to the color scheme. The game cannot be played hours on end except for the first few levels.***\n\nSuggestions: have us be able to customize the colors of background, unplayable area, colored grid, uncolored grid, and fading remains of pieces in some sort of paletter choice. Or at the very least, let us have a classic skin version for those of us who wanted the "same game" with new songs and play styles. Let us be able to see the pieces that belong in that level prior to playing the level as the original game did. Or let us be able to see it on the pause screen.\n\nFinal result: Buy Chime instead of Chime Sharp. The sequel has nice songs but ultimately the game is not enjoyable by comparison. If you think you'll like this one as well, play a demo first to make sure the graphics do not bother your eyes or concentration.\n\nNOTE: Within a couple of hours of this review being on Steam, the dev released a notice to Kickstarter contributors asking them to review the game positively on Steam, and to note that some things just were not possible. As my review was the only one on Steam, I imagine my request for a "classic skin" or "basic skin" is what the dev will not devote time for. While I understand making a decision to not add features, I just can't agree. The visuals in this game are too frustratingly different than the original game. Different is fine if it does not detract from gameplay. The 3D effects can be turned off now which is amazing. I never knew this during my test runs as you can't access this except on splash screen. Having new colors in the game is a nice bonus to people who never played the first game, but for many people it causes the game to be frustrating and difficult. This is not what you want in a casual game. The entry point for casual games must be fairly low.","November 12, 2015","false","10.3"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","28","34","0","2"

You have to cover a surface with blocks, so that a "quad" (generally when you have at least 3x3) can be formed and expanded. Once it's over, the quad disappear during the next passage of the beat, letting parts of the blocks used on the grid. And after a moment, they'll glow if unused and you'll loose the multiplier and the unused stuff.\n\nIt's hard to explain the game. Anyway, Chime Sharp comes with other modes, very interesting, like the one with lives (you're loosing one for each unused part after the last chance to use them). And as usual, the music is well chosen.\n\nIf the first game was in 2D, here, it's more like a 2.5 D.\n\nWell, I'm still waiting for a real WOW for the music, for now, it's nice but nothing is compared when I heard For Silence in the first game.\n\nYeah, 20 bucks is high. I admit, I wasn't really happy about the price. But if this can help them to improve, I didn't hesitate.\n\nSo, yeah. Simple o-r-g-a-s-m-i-c. Gonna rewrite my review of Chime: I need to add a ² or a x2 :p.","November 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

And i must say im impresed by how much it has grown and improved since early beta access. I love the look of the game's new 3d style and the music choices for the levels thus far have all been really good imo.  I believe that when this game is finished and polished up it will be a fantastic puzzler and with the community's ability to mod the levels it has the potential to stay fresh and interesting for a long time!\n\nThe only issues i have run into in this Early Access release are:\n\nThat there seems to be lag related to mouse movement and placement of blocks that means i keep missing or overshooting where i want to place a shape. this could be tied into the way the shapes snap into the grid system as you move them. Its only a minor annoyance but it is there all the same.\n\nAlso that sometimes the colour pallet used bold bright colours making it hard to see where i can place shapes later on, especially on the predominantly red/blue level.\n\nnot bad for an Early Access really, to only have 2 things which i feel should be improved.  Keep up the good work Devs!","November 15, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I also have not played for long (only one stage).\n\nThe game is easy to understand. You will understand what to do in just a few seconds of playing. Which makes it easy to pick up. The music in the game really helps to set the pace. Its speed increases as time runs out and additional sound effects are added when you do things in the game which further adds to the story.\n\nGame score: I have thought long and hard about this. I needed to call my mother to verify that this score is acceptable and she said "What are you talking about?". Therefore I have decided to give this game the score of\n\n<Drumroll>\n\n7/10","November 15, 2015","true","0.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

That sense of the music building up and slowly putting the player into a trance-like state is reminiscent of Rez and Bit Trip Core (two of my favorite music games)\n","November 20, 2015","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My friends and I used to get really intoxicated and play it and get lost in the music. Chime# is pretty fun. I'd love to see online multiplayer support since I moved away from my friend and I'd love to play with them again online.

Though I do have one complaint, that being the mouse controls feel a little floaty compared to the original Chime. I don't think its enough to ruin the game, but it does make it have a bit of a learning curve with the controls. But thats just my opinion.","May 3","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"
