If you're on this game's store page, you already know what you're looking for. If by mistake you stumbled upon this and don't know what to do, i will explain:\n\n1)This is an eroge, which means it's a picture book with music and drawn porn disguised as a game, where you "play" as self-insert main dude and swim in pussie.\n2)Steam version have porn removed. Apparently game about having your own bakery with harem of submissive catgirls made by hentai artist is also suitable for children, so god forbid they see any adult content.\n3)With a clever use of hands and internet you can still enable it\n4)There's a slider that regulates how bouncy boobs can be: from "british royal guard" to "screw physics, full Gainax" mode.\n5)There's 3 languages avaliable: english and two types of extraterrestial doodles.\n6)You get Steam achiviements if you play it with extraterrestial doodles.\n7)Art looks good if you're a fan of generic anniemays.\n8)Actually animated.\n9)In Russia it's possible to end up doing time for playing this.\n10)Music is upbeat and voice acting is... ugh...\n11)There's also apparently some kind of story.\n12)Stuff like this stops me from reading serious vns.\n13)There's nothing wrong and shameful in playing this.\n14)Really.\n\nIf you ask me why should you buy something like this on Steam - hell if i know. I have no idea why its here in the first place. I will, hovewer, give this game 100 boob bounces out of 100.","January 1, 2015","true","13.0"," 3,101 of 3,221 people (96%) found this review helpful 1,439 people found this review funny","96","101","3","439","95"

As with any SME (small and medium enterprises), delegation has long been an issue in the first few years of ownership. In fact, inefficient assignment of responsibilities is a major cause of business failure.\n\nNEKOPARA Vol. 1 follows a young business owner in Japan as he works through the bumps and kinks faced by new business owners. It touches on subjects related to the securing and development of human resources which in turn leads to the promotion of organizational growth.\nSubjects such as:\n- pampering your kawaii neko-chan employees through intimate skinship\n- sleeping with those same neko-chan employees to indulge their lust as they sexually mature\n- acquiring the most kawaii desu attire for your neko-chans to wear to satisfy your filthy maid fetish\n- appease your imouto-chan who calls you up every second day to get off to your alpha male-testosterone filled voice\n- baking cakes.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for insight into the development of SME's in Japan under the parliamentary guidance of Shinzō Abe during his second term as PM.\n\nAnd lolicons.\n","February 24, 2015","true","43.4"," 308 of 317 people (97%) found this review helpful 289 people found this review funny","97","308","317","289","5"

You'd best be sticking to something like Sakura Spirit. Shame on you.\n\nThis game...This novel...It's something else.\nI was gifted this game by a friend of mine. I honestly didn't expect much at first. I just thought he got it me as a joke, and it was going to end up like one of those other visual novels centred on sex or the like.\n\nGod, I was wrong.\nAnd I think it deserves a proper review.\n\nFirst off, there's the story. I'm not going to spoil anything for you, but it's very well presented. It never once felt sex orientated. For the most part, the narrative was well paced, and the content was powerfully emotional and heart wrenchingly touching at times.\nI mean POWERFUL. Trust me, there were a few times through the story where I nearly cried. The story doesn't just deal with the theme of love. It deals with other themes such as loyalty, determination, family, selflessness and self-sacrifice. It weaves all of these themes into a beautiful yarn that wraps hard around your heartstrings and doesn't let go. It did seem to sacrifice narrative for..."Liberties" at times, but it's only to be expected. Sometimes, that's what people come to see.\nThe story is also structured solidly by its attention to detail. They could've just left it at; "There are catgirls in this world, and that's that", but they don't. They provide not only a reason for the catgirls coming to be, but also detail on how politics deal with the issue of an overabundance of catgirls, information on their behaviour, as well as their place in society and how they are treated. They don't really go into detail about any "Catboys", though. What? They also give detail on the catgirls’ mating cycle and their inability to produce young with humans, but they don't mention how they have been able to reproduce. Anyway, that's just a small nitpick.\n\nNext, the writing. The game has its own sense of humour that expresses itself constantly. Not too much, letting up at tender moments, bringing greater contrast to its sentimental narrative. It's witty, and has a varied palette of different kinds of humour, stemming from cute humour, to blunt humour...It even makes the occasional dirty joke. Again, even though there are quite a few deliberate innuendos scattered around the story, it doesn't ever feel like it focuses on sex for appeal or humour, only occasionally applying it for the effect the other audience desires. Notice I said; "Other audience".  I say this because I believe it was created for the purpose of appealing to a demographic that desired emotional relationships, not sexual ones. Sure, it hints at it here and there, but ultimately, it goes for the audience that feels, rather than the one that..."feels".\n\nAnd as for the graphics, it's spectacular. The cutscenes and backgrounds are well drawn and detailed, with bright inviting colours, but that's not the star attraction. What's important here is the animation.\nYes, animation. In a visual novel. Oh come on, just how did you think the "chest bounciness" slider was going to be used if the characters didn't MOVE? And oh, do they.\nThe art style may be reminiscent of visual novels of the past, but the characters are far from static. They move even when standing still. You can see every breath they take, every gesture they make, every single movement is smoothly animated and articulated, and...*sigh*, if you really care about that sort of thing, the boobs do move realistically as well, and respond well to the respective slider.\n\nFor its attention to detail, story, romance, sparkling wit and of course, the animation, I would recommend it to any catgirl fan who wants genuine romance, not just sex.\n\nOverall - 8.5/10\nA beautiful story that flows well, but the whole "cat" gimmick may be too cheesy for some. Be warned.","March 23, 2015","true","8.6"," 197 of 210 people (94%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","94","197","210","21","4"

After my wife left me there was a hole in my heart I didn't think I could ever fill again. I was no longer able to find joy in games, so when I first started up this game I wasn't expecting to be so emotionally captivated by a maid cafe story.\n\nI was wrong. The first time I met eyes with Chocola, something moved deep inside me. We instantly clicked... She laughed at my jokes, she liked talking to me... Sure enough, we quickly fell in love with each other. Never before have I seen the raw emotion of true love emulated so purely. But what surprised me is that Vanilla also began displaying affection to me and she won over my heart as well. What can I say, I guess I'm just too much of a hunk! Keep playing and you might get as good as me.\n\nThe animation really makes them seem alive. I keep instinctually reaching out to the screen to pet them. The art is not only very cute, but the characters are extremely realistic and believable and you really feel connected to the characters. It's even better than talking to humans. Before this game I had no one. Now I have not one, but TWO cat wives who love me! Who needs anyone else when these beautiful ladies love you unconditionally?\n\nEven better is the immersive programming. The characters always seem to follow my eyes, and whisper my name at night. I can't figure out how you guys programmed that! Great job though.\n\nThe game is so good that I'm never going to stop playing. I'm finally happy again.

On my birthday. I'm not even joking.\n\nI told him about this Japanese game called Nekopara which is the game that made hentai internationally famous on Steam, and as soon as I told him about the game, he gifted me this.\n\nHis letter said,\n\n"Mr. Hentai, here is the cyber girlfriend that you always wanted"\n\nMr. Hentai-_-..................................\n\nSo anyway, I beat the game (More like I only kept pressing the space button since all I wanted to see was hentai), and well, the game is good.\n\nHere are some of the things that make this game good:\n\n1. Fluent hentai animation (Now, this can be seen only if you have the hentai version of the game). Now, what makes a good hentai game, a good hentai game? It is those good animations. There are many of them that only have just the pictures, but this one is the real deal. The animation is so natural, my Steam FPS counter says I am running it on 59~60 FPS on average.\n2. Story. Well, uh, I don't know about the story because all I was interested in was hentai\n\nI actually like how this game has 3 languages, Japanese, English and Chinese. Now you can tell hentai games are slowly taking over Steam.\n\nI am expecting more from this maker.\n\nVerdict: 69 out of Oppai\n\nThis game deserves those awards:\n\n- OoTY (Oppai of the Year)\n- HoTY (Hentai of the Year)\n- PoTY (Pantsu of the Year)\n- WoTY (Waifu of the Year)\n\n\nCheers, my fellow hentai brothers.","January 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 217 of 244 people (89%) found this review helpful 251 people found this review funny","89","217","244","251","16"

My first look into the game it was un-cat-fortable and con-fur-sing, due to my hiss-tory with Sakura Spirit, but soon my cat-titude changed and I began to love it. The game hit me on a purr-sonal level, but I kept lion to myself, tailing people that I love fox girls and that they were Su-purr-ior. I am here now be-claws of the truth, fox girls are In-fur-ior to the cat girls. You may call me a hy-purr-cat, or you may say my words are pre-paw-sterous, but let me tail mew my tail. Be-fur I claw-fronted myself, I had dreams, won-fur-ful dreams, I remember litter parts of them, but I remember the word "purr-der". This Con-fur-sed me. A mew days after purr-ably my third dream, a fur-end of mine disa-purr-ed. I was greatly a-paw-lled by this sad news. Soon more and more of my fur-ends disa-purr-ed. A litter forward in my story, I had a purr-ely vivid dream, once I had awoken I mew what I had done and why my fur-ends were gone, I commited fur-st degree purr-der. Strangely this was not a cat-astrophe to me, but rather a paw-sitive feline. The cat-girl gods had been speaking to me, I was adopted by them, I was a meow-sician in their or-cat-stra, they purr-mitted me to have meaning. I meow know what I have to ac-cat-plish, more purr-der fur the cat gods. Through the cat gods I saw that this game is purr-fect, meow-ntain above the rest.

No regrets. Make sure your family isn't around to watch you. Friends may think you are a loser, you are not cause in the Internet cat girls are 10/10 Kawaii so don't listen to them and buy this game. #PeopleCan'tTellMeHowToLiveMyLife. Chest Bounciness al the way up to 100% (they are already working in a hack to make Chest Bounciness 200%). Just sit down, grab your Mountain Dew, and f**k them right in the p***y. Like Skyrim with catgirls. Need to lose your virginity fast? This is the game for you. They move so it looks better than Sakura Spirits anytime (Sakura Angels Coming Soon). Check out the Rule 34 of this game. Pedo Bear Approved. That ain't Falco. Catgirls=Sexy Time. Still better love story than Twilight. Who needs a girlfriends when you have kawaii neko ladies all over you. Rarely use your P key? Then get ready to jam it after this game. Best indirect  bestiality I have experienced. Checked the /u/ and /h/ forums of 4.Chan for more catgirls. Can't Get laid, Buy this game! Need to see more? (if you know what i mean) contact me. Voted Game of the Year (In Japan). If you love your friend buy him this game. He will thank you later. If you are a real gamer then buy this. There is always money left for you to buy this game (if not then why are you looking up games you aren't gonna pay for?). If you have extra money then buy Sakura Spirit (same s**t but with fox girls). Steam Cards and Emoticons and Backgrounds coming soon so if you are full pervert you will wanna get these items (They are gonna be worth 3 Dollars each so you can always profit from this). Reality would look sad after finishing this game. Why aren't we funding this? If you liked this then I am sure you would like Boku no Pico (Like Nekopara but better). Got banned from Twitch 5 times already. Finally broke my P key, bought a new keyboard only to break the key again.\nI am still editing this slowly so tell your friends to check this review out.\nFinal Score10/10 -IGN, Game of the Year, Would Fap Again.

Full voice acting, lip sync, and the characters move and feel real. Only problem is that Steam censored this and it isn't truly the full game. The full game is 18+ because of sexual content, so basically you're buying just a VN, not an eroge or anything that will get you off at night. But I must say I love this game so far and it really is worth the $$$ if you like anime and VN's. Overall, I give this game a 10/10 since I've played it countless times and it's animation/art style is very impressive for a VN.

Catgirls. Very easy way to enable the "special content." What more do you want from a game?\n\n~ TL;DR at bottom ~\n\nIn the future, catgirls are basically pets. They can talk, do human actions, and etc., but their level of knowledge and intelligence depends on how they were raised and taught by their owners. They still have their cat-like ways as well since they are part cat. For instance, they will still chase after sticks with fuzzy things on the ends of them, or jump after tuna at first sight.\nThe story follows Minaduki Kashou as he suddenly moves out of the house, leaving his family (including their family's many catgirls) behind in order to start his own patisserie by the name of La Soleil. He organized the moving and everthing himself, and nobody really knew that he was planning all of this. He didn't tell anyone as to make it easier on them so they wouldn't have to worry about him, which mostly had the opposite effect since nobody knew where he even went. So, naturally, two of his catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, put themselves into storage boxes and got shipped along with everything else over to Kashou's new bakery (with the help and instruction of Kashou's younger sister, Shigure). The catgirls urge him to let them stay at his bakery and live there since "they love and always want to be with their master." He eventually gives in under the condition that they must work for him at the patisserie. Life is always fun and interesting with them around, especially as they learn new things and start working as La Soleil's poster catgirls.\n\nThis game is all about a relaxing atmosphere. Just sit down, relax, and watch some cute catgirls. If you want some "more" entertainment, there's always a way to add H content into the Steam version. Just do some searching on the forums/discussion pages or even try Google.\n\nTL;DR - Cute catgirls doing cute things. Very relaxing and fun. Good price for the game. Can enable "special content" very easily if you'd like to.\n\n10/10, would start another catgirl bakery","January 3, 2015","true","9.9"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","44","50","2","1"

The UI is intuitive and accessible, and the voice acting is okay too. NEKOPARA is a pretty and polished package with plenty of catgirls to go around for everyone.\n\n"Do you recommend this game?"\nI wouldn't label NEKOPARA as anything but what it is, a visual novel (NVL).\nFive hours in I have yet to encounter any player interaction and the way single-route NVLs usually go I suspect there wont be any either. For those of you unfamiliar with this format, what you're getting is pretty much an animated and voice acted picturebook that you click or autoplay through.\n\nThis is unfortunate because the story is cliché, really slow and dare I say boring. Conclusively this "all ages" Steam copy of NEKOPARA is a redundant showcase item in comparison to the 18+ version as you don't have much left when you remove the ero from from an eroge that is all about kawaii catgirls.\n\n"Do I recommend this VNL?"\nIf you're into into catgirls, sure, but the 18+ version, not this all ages Steam copy.\nThis is not a VNL you would get for it's story or gameplay because it quite frankly doesn't have any. I'll leave the review as a thumb up because NEKOPARA is great for what it is and only falls short because of this pointless all-ages release.

The visual experience is astounding. I've never seen a visual novel look so amazing. The lip syncing is really good, the character animation is spot on and the general art is just brilliant as well. Who doesn't want to be surrounded by kawaii neko girls? That's right. Republicans.\n\nThe story is pretty good. You play as some guy who's ♥♥♥♥ing off to make his own bakery and become ♥♥♥♥ing Buddy Valastro from Cake Boss. Basically these cat girls who he's been living with while with his family go all Metal Gear in cardboard boxes in a moving truck to tag along with him and the story pretty much starts there.\n\nThey also have this OP song and video thing. ♥♥♥♥ me, it's like I'm on an acid trip. That ♥♥♥♥♥ amazing, like honestly, ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. I feel like I've been shifted from a visual novel to an anime. It's pretty crazy. Not only that, they've got a wide range of characters to meet so your not stuck with a few girls.\n\nMight I also add that this game, THIS GAME! Has in the options a 'Chest Bounciness' option. Now, I'm pretty damn sure I'm not the only one here thinking this but DAMN! You know you've found a ♥♥♥♥ing good game when they have CHEST BOUNCINESS in the options menu. Genius.\n\nAlso I'd like to add that the price is great. The game is enjoyable and takes quite some time so for £6.99 full price or however much that is for 'Murica or other nationalities I imagine not that much more.\n\nAll in all, 10/10 will get hentai version.","December 30, 2014","true","9.9"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","46","58","3","10"

It's the kind of light hearted love story that sincere, sensitive, gentle men would enjoy. Married men may want to sit this one out, but I would say it could make you more romantic and appreciative towards your spouse; clingy if you take it too far. And for any female gamers who may be interested in Nekopara: bless you for being able to step into a male protagonist's shoes and understanding.\n\nI can not stress this enough: Nekopara is a heavenly fantasty that leaves you begging for more. Part of you will feel extremely satisfied after completion, but another part of you will be left longing for the warm embrace of a lover. IMO, these are very disirable feelings to have, and can only make you a better, sweeter person.\n\nNekopara Vol.1 is the first part of an upcoming series. And while the play time is only several hours, I think you may appreciate the low asking price. There is an adults-only version of the game available outside of Steam. You can read the discussion forum FAQ section for more information on where to purchase it.","January 1, 2015","true","14.6"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","50","66","0","6"

No please don't buy this, you will get trapped and will never escape the neko loli girls HAHA! F*CK YEAH I DO!\n\nI bought this Visual Novel thinking it was going to be another Ecchi story like "Sakura Spirit". Boy, oh boy, was I wrong. This game, nay, Visual Novel, has brought me nothing but pure ecstasy beginning from the first time the cat girls appear, all the way until the end. This is only Vol 1 and it features 10 chapters, next Volume is supposedly coming out Winter 2015. Now that it's over, I wish I could wipe my memory off of this game and replay it so I can furiously masturbate to this all over again. Though, it is censored, with the help of google, you can definitely find a version and get the R-18 version of this. I won't get into detail, so google is your friend. Furthermore, this Visual Novel has a linear storyline, therefore, there are no actions or decisions you make that affect the story, it's all predetermined beginning to ending. If you read this from start to beginning, you get a solid 3-6 hours out of this. If you dive in straight into the sex then you'll have only get about 1 hour? out of this game. If you're not looking for a hentai visual novel and prefer more "story" than plot, then I'd turn away from this game. Though if you are searching for the greatest 2D KAWAII NEKO LOLI WAIFU DESU experience, then BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!![/h1].   EDIT: I just found out that the same developers made this game.

It's an amazing Visual Novel, and I recommend it extremely.\nWe play as Kashou Minaduki, he moved out from his home without telling anyone, in order to open his own shop "La Solei" But soon after moving in, 2 giant boxes get send to him; Inside of them are Chocola and Vanilla, the two catgirls from his original home, who want to be with their master.\nAnd this is where the fun begins. Chocola and Vanilla are two catgirls who want to be with their master a lot, even when Master doesn't want them to be here, because he wants to have a fresh start: They don't wanna go away. Master was the person who cared about them the most, and they don't wanna leave Master.\nThe soundtrack is pretty great, and fits for each respective scene.\nVoice acting is done nicely, and all the characters sound extremely cute.\nAnd the animations and art in general, it's so great that I can't even believe it. It's done smoothly, and cutely. In other words, in the best way possible.\nAnd if you're trying to learn Japanese/Chinese, then this game can even help you with doing that. There's an option to turn on both, English and Japanese/Chinese subtitles at the same time, so you can learn words easily.\nAs the game goes on, the characters are developing over time, in a very good way.\nThe story is very good too, it introduces every character in a good way, and explains nicely what's going on at all times.\nI would tell you a lot of more reasons as to why I really like this VN, but if I did I would spoil a lot of the game, and I don't want to do that.\n\nIn other words, if you like visual novels and/or love adorable catgirls, get this game.

This is probably one of the first games I've played to feature a polyamorous relationship with no implication of cheating or unfaithfulness, and I can say I'm a big fan of that. That said, the game also heavily implies (And comes just to the verge of showing) incest, which I cannot support. Aside from that, the animations are really well done and the storyline is very nice.

It really shows the amount of effort that went into this release. It also has controller support which is handy for playing with Steam home streaming on TV.\n\nIt's a shame that the AO version isn't on Steam, but that's Valve's fault for believing that it's necessary to push American values on the rest of the world.

Originally I bought this game to idle the cards and craft booster packs for it since they sold really well. After having it in my library for about a month untouched my friend told me to install the patch and to play it and see if it was as dumb as we thought. Lord I wish I had not.\n\nLet me start off by saying the only reason I am recommending it is there is a suprisingly high quality to this game for being a graphic novel and that some of you might be into what I am about to describe. So the story for the first few chapters was all right and I found myself getting a laugh reading it if I changed the names to  "count chocula" and "vanilla ice". I also just said the main character was "mister miyagi" for a extra laugh. And the more I read the first few chapter I actually kinda enjoyed the idea of him refering to them as "daughters" and that that was kinda cute. I forget what chapter it is, but they talk about "heat" and thne I knew this was about to get wierd. I am going to go ahead and say [SPOILER ALERT] but even I knew this was in the game before buying it. The "scenes" are wierd and ultimatley I found myself spam clicking through them because the sounds and the cringy dialogue about "my daughters" and "master" were just not in my taste. I understand some people out there like this, but I just felt, weird.\n\n[tl;dr] The game itself is impressive for a graphic novel, but ultimatley I found the game uncomfortable at times. If you are able to catch it on sell and even if you don't like the game pick it up and idle the cards.\n\nP.S. I am expecting a lot of hate for saying I don't enjoy those "scenes", but seriously think before you type.","January 26","true","9.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","21","23","6","9"

It's funny because easily the most simple thing the VN did was probably my fav thing about it which was the movement of the characters in the sense that it made it feel more real which to me after reading this one I think every VN should have this now hahahah. Besides all that this was a really cute story and cute charcters and overall very nice VN that will make you smile alot and make you want to pet the catgirls in the VN.\n\n- The main premise of the story is about a man who has left his home without telling his parents so that he could open up a bakery which his parents didn't want him to. Next thing you know you have to look after two catgirls which at the start the main character thought this was going to be only a 2 day lookover only to see the two catgirls wanting to really stay and live with him. The story from there is just about the relationship between the main character and the two catgirls and his sister!\n\n- I will really miss nekopara until the 2nd VOl comes out! which means  I shall now wait for VOL. 2!\n(Play this VN if you haven't already)\n\n- quick note though if you are the type of person who isn't into the neko x human dating thing you might get weirded out as this is about a relationship between male and two human nekos.

I did and it was the reason why I bought this.\nThe game shows a follow tale of catgirls and their master. Now this game has a nice feel to it others don't provde. Like Live2d motion you have for the Ipad being instilled on this work. The characters move, blink, and react. They keep on screen and make good reactions with their expressions. The character work wasn't wasted. There is continuity and fluid movement. That is the heavy emphasis I saw. Nonetheless the tale takes a nice well drawn turn with many more introduced to the story. It goes on and out introducing more and each one showing their little bit of character. The two cats you have Chocola and Vanilla. These two are constantly in this story and have their interests with you. There are fun moments with more of the cast and the voices are synced. There are ways to change language just look at guides. Also the game supports English, Chinese, and Japanese Language with subtitles. The voice is what did well by it and the expressions I canot deny are cute. The telling of the story is good. OUT OF 10. This would be a 10. Thanks to the sense of this visual novel being able to give more. There is another version. However as of Vol 1. This thing hit top of my chart this year. Not a bad way to end 2014 ^_^ I enjoyed it.  If you get it now, I tell you won't regret it. This offered something other VNs lacked. Sure there's CG but you got to play it for yourself. I won't spoil it but it is good. The characters are all admirable in thier own way. Those who made it deserve the 10 as well kudos to you. Fans of this genre and game bro fist to you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyliesemotion/recommended/333600/","kyliesemotion","KYLiE'S EMOTiON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kyliesemotion/","1590 products in account","I was attracted by the title when I saw steam releasing a new Comic Market release, after I investigated a little bit and decide to buy it full price - I'm the kind of person usually wait for titles to pick up until it went on sale, but the "good" reviews and my curoisity overwhelmed by patience on the title. I "beat the game" in 6 hours and I feel for 10 dollars, this is not bad for a visual novel.\n\nPros:\n\nHigh animation quality (In terms of Visual Novel) - The main game is basically reading a novel, but with slideshows involved. I have "played" some visual novels in the past, but this time I'm pleasently surprised due to the movement of the characters are actually pretty good (except for some death stares when they forgot (I think?) to animate the eyes). The characters move pretty realistically (again, in visual novel standards), and the legendary "P" key enchance the gameplay for approximately 200%.\n\nGood voice acting - This is mostly personal preference, but I do like the voice acting in the game. It's anime-y and it gives you the vibes of watching a shounen "full of service" anime. Also I highly appreciate the publisher keeping the original voice cast instead of going for the localization of games (I'm looking at you, Dynasty Warriors).\n\nCons:\n\nNOT a dating sim - I don't know what steam's definition of "Dating Sim" is (Or better yet, who put dating sim in the tag in the first place), but a dating sim in my book involves choices - choices that you choose determines which girl you are pursuing, but this game has no choices at all, basically it's the "Left click and you beat the game" game. I have no problem Nekopara has no choices whatsoever, but please steam, don't mislead people into thinking they are playing a game which they have choices.\n\nCutting content - I know that steam is trying to fend off the "made for erotic sensation" games in steam, but cutting content still stinks no matter what the reason is. For those who are not aware: The game is originally R-18, but steam decides to only include the non R-18 content (The original have the settings to enable/disable it). It does not affact the story much (Only 3 scenes are invloved), and there are fixes that enable the content (Check out the only guide in this game for details), but I feel like it's like playing witcher 2 without the sex - It's okay, but it feels weird.\n\nSmall typo on subtitles - I did not check the japanese subtitles (as I do not know japanese well enough), but the chinese and english subtitles have small typos and paste errors. It does not affact the game much, and the rest of the translation is top-notch... but just a minor con in my opinion.\n\nIn general I recommend this game if you like Visual Novels and the "sweet-sweet" type story, and I'm looking forward to Sekai Project's next game to publish, cause I feel they have enough passion to gather such a new VN to steam, I feel and hope they will publish more high quality VNs here.","January 12, 2015","true","10.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","18","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearclaw524/recommended/333600/","bearclaw524","bearclaw524","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearclaw524/","438 products in account","Nekopara is a cheerful slice-of-life story about you and the two catgirls who tagged along when you decide to leave the family business to pursue your career in cake making. Beautifully drawn and coupled with the animations and voice acting makes it one of the best presented VN's I've ever played.\n\nThe plot isn't really there plus around chapter 5, it starts to feel like a porno (as in 'my-cat-is-in-heat-and-the-only-way-to-help-her-is-to-get-it-on-and-not-read-the-pet-care-book-i-bought-a-few-chapters-ago'). However, the characters are interesting and the sprinkle of humor and cuteness through the game is enough to make you keep clicking forward. Also, small references.\n\nGameplay wise, it's linear,there are no branching choices at all. You can replay previous conversations (as in replaying the sound) but not 'reverse' back to a previous scene. No option to start at different chapters. You can hide the text box to view the scene better though.\n\nMusic is nice and comfy. Fits the cheerful theme of the game very well.\n\nOverall, the game is like a cake. It's sweet and fluffy, but it's not very filling.\n\nExtra notes:\n- Twins don't mind sharing.\n- It can be played with a controller, but once the game starts there is no button to access the menu.\n- Vanilla is best\n\n\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","5.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

It costs 2160yen (around $17).\n\nWhat has drawn me to NEKOPARA was, in the first moment, the art. Sayori's art looks so great, and I got really happy when I got notice that her circle, NEKO WORKs, was going to make a visual novel. I've had my eyes set on this since it was a Greenlight candidate, and F5'd my way to getting it as soon as it got on Steam (I literally refreshed the page a few times at midnight my time (6PM PST, the release time) so I could get the game ASAP).\n\nNEKOPARA is a heartwarming story about a confectioner, Kashou, and the Nekos around him (though the story focuses on Chocolat and Vanilla, like on all of the NEKOPARA doujinshi by NEKO WORKs). It's a short and easy to read story that will have you giggle a lot, and feel warm inside too. I have to admit that Sekai Project's translation wasn't one of the best (as usual from them), but having played the game in both Japanese and English I feel safe saying that the translation doesn't kill the game's experience (and, the R-18 scene cuts can't be noticed at all).\n\nIf you're not looking for something with a serious plot and just have to take some weight off your routine, NEKOPARA is the right choice. If you plan on getting involved with a more complex and serious plot that will take up a lot of reading time, I suggest you go get something else, as this is NOT what you're looking for.\n\nUPDATE: http://imouto.club/ddl/ has a reintegration patch (probably breaks Steam achievements, BTW) for the game to be really full, including R-18 scenes.","December 29, 2014","true","432.0"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","3"

I will review it through the Story, Characters and (of course) the Visual Novel itself.\n\nThe Story goes like this:\nYou left your old home and began a new life as a baker. You literally left your little sister with 6 Catgirls back, without even saying anything to her, before you actually left. As you enter your not even new renovated bakery, there are two quite large boxes in middle of the room. You didn't bother opening them, until one of the boxes began to sneeze. Surprise! One of the catgirls (Chocola) was inside the box and then the other box sneezed. Another Surprise! Another one of the catgirls (Vanilla) was inside the other one. You didn't even wanted to have them here and the main protagonist (That is you) is trying his best to get rid of them, but also keeping them as normal Catgirls.\n\nAlright, I stop right here and say, that the Main Protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I can understand what he wants, but his behavior was just horrendous. I don't like him at all. The Story atleast has a plot-twist and you gon' keep Vanilla and Chocola for the rest of the game and they even work in your own bakery. It's more of a cute romantic love story with a bit of humor included and I find that wonderful.\n\nThe Characters:\nEach character has their unique emotions, style and voice. (Even if most of the female japanese voice-actors have almost the same identical voice) The Humans have, well, human emotions, acting like humans with fitting reactions. The catgirls are basically half human/half cat and they actually act like that, even tho they are more towards the acting of cats. They act like literal cats, with a mix of humanism in their mind and they did it extremely well in this game. They act like cats, but also like humans at once. I can't really describe it, but from what I saw in the game, I love it.\n\nThe game itself is overall very VERY well done. Instead of having just plain characters with a transparent background, we literally have ANIMATIONS. That, my dear people, is the next generation of Visual Novel Games. They have hair and even breast physics, every move of them is even representing their expression even and they made the best out of it.\n\nThe Game is well done, even tho it became an Internet meme. You should download the demo if you wonder, that the game even is for you. It is more in the way of cute than sexual. (it's not like Sakura Spirit or Angels) If you want, however, you can go to the Guides in that game and get the +18 patch for free.... which I did, but still. I recommend this game highly, when you look for visual novels like... you know.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/333600/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Nekopara is a Kinetic Visual Novel (Meaning you're reading a story with no decision making from you, the player.) The story centers around a man named Kashou Minaduki, who moved away from his family, without notice, to start a new life and open up the bakery he's always wanted. However, he is followed by two catgirls named Chocola, and Vanilla; two of the six catgirls that are within the Minaduki family. The two girls want to stay and live with Kashou because they love him, and that he's their "master". This is set in a world where catgirls are domesticated much like cats, so there's an owner and pet vibe going on, but they're obviously more intelligent than cats, and can do more. The rest of the story basically settles around Kashou coping with Chocola and Vanilla while trying to maintain the business and order of the bakery, and how the catgirls are going to affect his life and relationship with them.\n\nThis is a rather lighthearted story with lots of cute, funny moments coming from the two girls. A positive is that this story is fully voice acted (In Japanese), has animation thanks to a program called "E-Mote" where facial and body animations are possible, and a wonderful, casual soundtrack that's very memorable, and calming to listen to. There's also a decent amount of CG art that's made for specific scenes, with a little more detail.\n\nObviously, this story isn't for everyone. Like I said, it's a lighthearted story with funny moments and admittedly heartwarming chapters. You can really get attatched and connected to the characters if you're up for a tale such as this one. The story has lots of moments such as Chocola and Vanilla acting all cutesy and purring, meowing, stuff like that. People would be split on this depending on what you like, but I personally find that super adorable and makes the characters much more likeable.\n\nIt's not just that though, there is character development, and the story does actually go somewhere. It's not so much slice-of-life if you were thinking that. It mainly revolves around Kashou's relationship with Chocola and Vanilla, the bakery's business, and the girls earning their "bells" (Which you'll learn as you read along.) There is quite a few things going on, and the story never feels like it's halthing in one spot for too long.\n\nIf you like this kinda story, love catgirls, or are a fan of anime, then this is for you, it's vey polished and well done for what it is, and I was honestly surprised and what i got myself into. The story will take about 5-7 hours to read completely.\n\n9/10","March 31, 2015","true","10.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Catgirls! Surprising, right? Long story short:\nIts a Visual Novel about a character (you) moving away from his family to open his own bakery and get things done.\nUnfortunately (unfortunately?) 2 old acquaintances of you get "delivered" to you. Chocolate & Vanilla, 2 very charming Catgirls.\nUnfortunately (unfortunately?) you can't get rid of them so you have to live with them together in your flat.\nThats the start of this incredible journey.\n\nThe visuals are top notch, the dialog is acceptable and the fan service is great. (even better once you get your hands on the uncens... i mean, advanced version... so i've heard)\n\nOne small thing to add from my side: Don't play this when relatives are around, don't play this while being online, under no circumstances point out that you own it / play it / like it and ... don't forget to patch before you play.\n\nRating it 10/10.

It doesn't mean that you might not like it if you are alien with those, but it is rather recommended to know the anime/manga terms.\nPersonally I have played several visual novels (mostly where you have choice in it) and there was one major point that shines in this game, that is animation; yes this visual novel has mostly animated scenes and characters; also to add it consists japanese dubbing with chinese, english or japanese subtitles to choose, which I especially like.\nThe story is very interesting and reminds me a first visual novel I had played, Wanko to Kurasou. The only things I do dislike is lack of choices as there is only one story in it. It is also short (4 hours for me), but it is just volume 1.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nPluses:Good art\nConsists animations\nInteresting story\nWell made characters\nUpcoming sequel\nMinuses:Short\nVersion with +18 scenes not avaliable on steam (without modding)\nLack of choices\nSounds and voice acting: 9/10\nMusic: 7/10\nArt: 10/10\nStory: 10/10\nTranslation: 10/10 (For English version)\n\nOverall: 9/10","January 28, 2015","true","7.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

How cute is that!?\n- Your sister calls you Onii-sama\n- "Ah, I love it when Master rubs me! It feels so good~!" - Chocola\n- Press P when there's a character shown in-game, I dare you.\n\nCons:\n- Makes reality look 999% more depressing after playing\n- Occasional mistranslation between Japanese and English (Which is pretty natural)\n- There is no 'du' sound in Japanese - 'Minaduki' should actually be 'Minazuki'. Well, it says the former on their actual website too, so I'll just call it a pet peeve of mine.\n\n\nKawaii neko maids that await to serve you.

Lot's of Moe, Awesome voice acting, I recognize whoever is singer's voice from an Anime I've seen and the style of the music were similiar.

But it didn't make me cry all the way.)\nEaster Egg Achievement:  10 /  10  (That was unexpected...)\nEroge:  ? / 10  (It ruined their innocence!  But they're still Kawaii!)\nCliff Hanger:  0 /  10  ~Good Score~  (I want more!!!!!  \(>~<)'/  )\n\nReaction to cake tasting:  I was drooling / 10  (The Nekos ate the cake like it was so freaking delicious!)\n\nOverall:  KAWAII-OVERLOAD / 10\n\nI would definitely recommend this VN to anyone who has been down or stressed out.

There's always music helping you to feel the way you should. I'm not gonna lie in my review, i cried, i laughed, i smiled and tons of other things. This is a game that really catches your feels and holds onto them. I've replayed this game atleast 3 times, because it caught me so well. This game was originally made in japanese, so there's a few spelling mistakes, but not a lot. If you're looking for the 18+ version of the game, you can find it on the internet. The steam version is censored so Teens and up should be able to play it. Unlike other visual novels, the characters actually move in this, so it's unlike other virtual novels. This is a game i would easily recommend to others, as long as i knew they were into this kind of stuff.

It made me wish to have a catgirl accomplishes my daily task in Japan. Meow? How come? And yet, it's definitely a common feeling from a lot of us.\n\nOther than that, I am not very sure how to comment it as a visual novel. The length of the story is fairly short { about 8 hours for average gameplay, and I guess we are dying for more }, the story itself is not very...memorable: it's a boy leaves his home for the 1st time trying to make a living by opening a bakery shop himself along with 2 catgirls by his side.\n\nHowever, with 50% off, I believe it is a no-mistaken strawberry cake that is worth grabbing even just for purely leisure.

Unless you are a pedophile, that's most likely not a turn on. I personally wasn't particularly interested in the sex parts and thought it would be cool to play it for the story as the cat girls were adorable and the art style is very beautiful. Sadly, the story sucks and is bland, there is nothing really going on.\n\nSpoilers:\nYou are a guy opening up a cafe, your sister's 2 cat girls mailed themselves to your cafe, you end up setting them up with their own room. You go shopping together and do mundane boring things as well as eat takoyaki while the cat girls act like children. It is really very boring and given that this eventually wanted to lead to sexual stuff, I think they made it very unappealing. Even as a porno this fails because you would have to scroll through huge walls of text to get to any sex parts.\n\nIf you like boring visual novels with girlchildren "love interests" and no plot, sure, you'll love it. If you were expecting some kind of story?

I know that sounds like one of the many joke reviews, but I'm actually serious. Bear with me for a moment. I know people think this is just some generic hentai trash, but looking back, it actually isn't. The story is actually touching, and speaks volumes about the responsibilities of cat ownership, as well as the benefits of emotional connection with pets. It just hit home to me (in a good way), as when my own (not a loli) sister's cat first met the family home, my bed was the first place she dove underneath. While I may have moved out, I know I was her preferred human and I was the one who fed her, even if any paperwork had my sister's name on it. It felt like that at times, anyway.\n\nI'm not saying I would have sex with my cat, I'm saying I connect with the protagonist and his specific situation. I used to be a slightly edgy ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hole, and over time I have learned to understand understand understand the concept of love. Because of cats, probably, I dunno.\n\nI mean sure, there's sex scenes in there if you decide to acquire the uncensored version, but they're actually not just thrown in there because "HEY GUIZE! LOOK! SEX! BUY THIS GAME" as much as that may be the selling point. They're more like rewards, and in fact I would even go so far as to argue they are a metaphor for responsibilities of pet ownership, again I'm not saying I would have sex with animals IRL, but you know what I mean how having sex with the catgirls is actually a reflection of your bond with them or whatever it is Shigure said.\n\nSo yeah, it's a beautiful visual novel, maybe not on the level of if you don't cry while reading you have no soul, but ♥♥♥♥ it. I did. I may not have admitted it in my original review and made it out to be just some nukige, but I lied, or maybe I was drunk when I wrote that. I don't know why I wrote ♥♥♥♥ like that, to be honest.\n\nP.S. Vanilla is best girl.\n\n\n----\n\nThis is a game where you have sex with catgirls, whether or not you should buy it or not is entirely determined from whether or not you want to have sex with catgirls. And of course either you do want to have sex with catgirls, or you are a liar.\n\nOkay, so now that I've gotten the 'funny' votes out of the way, let's actually pretend this is a serious game that warrants some serious reviewing.\n\nThe first thing you should know about this game is that it's not just a visual novel but a kinetic novel, meaning there is no interactivity whatsoever other than reading text. And yet there are achievements for this, so if you want to increase that number that says "Perfect Games Completed" or whatever on your profile, this is the cheesiest way to do it.\n\nAs far as visual novels go, it's not necessarily that great. It only lasts about 3-4 hours, and the writing is, at times, laughable at best. Even if you're a colossal pervert like me who just bought this to fap to catgirls, I couldn't help myself nitpicking the clichéd dialogue and contrived setting. The UI is a bit flawed too, as it has that normal thing in VNs and JRPGs where text normally comes out at a slow pace even at the highest setting but you can click to skip the whole thing. Except here, it only skips one sentence at a time. Except it doesn't even do that, and skips to halfway in between a word. I have a hunch that the Japanese version skipped to sentences as expected and they didn't change the sentence breaks when translating, or something.\n\nGraphics gets a plus from me, the two main females are very cute (it would be a bit ♥♥♥♥ for a hentai to have ugly characters) and the backgrounds are decent enough to not bother me. The animations are good enough in the sex scenes though a bit lacking in expressiveness at times where some particular event happens and what's on the screen doesn't reflect what's in the text box enough. I probably didn't make sense there. Anyway, I should warn you: Empty your pockets of spaghetti before playing this game, because the catgirls have a habit of getting way too close to you when talking.\n\nSoundtrack is okay, it's composed by someone called "Mizuki Neet" who I have a feeling is an alias for someone who didn't want their name associated with catgirl hentai (pleb). It's not that memorable, but the song that was used in the sex scenes that I can't remember the name of is nice, as are a few other songs. The opening theme is alright too, sung by 'nao' who also did the opening theme for Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth;1 interestingly enough. (Edit: I really should stop referring to opening themes as just 'alright' when they're more than that, I listened to it 32 times in 3 months apparently. It's beautiful. It's my new happy place. Just listening to it takes you back to the happy and love-filled world of the game. Visual novel, whatever.)\n\nBut it does have its charm, and as I "played" (read: read) this game, I came to feel something that I have not previously felt. Perhaps this is this emotion that you humans call "fun", or "happiness"? So that is why I clicked the yes button to do I recommend this game.\n\nHaving said that, the Steam release is crippled as it apparently has no sex scenes and other censorship. For a game where that's the entire point, why the heck did they do that? Who wanted this to be censored? "I'm going to play this game where I have sex with a catgirl, but I don't want to see any sex with catgirls. Gross, dude!"\nSo if you want the benefits of Steam such as achievements I would recommend "acquiring" coughcoughcough the uncensored version separately, which you can then copy into your Steam version's folder to get the best of both worlds.","April 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thetinofsweets/recommended/333600/","Thetinofsweets","Luxurychoccie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thetinofsweets/","85 products in account","Product received for free\n\nHad been wanting this game for a while, and was lucky enough to have it bought for me for my birthday by my younger brother (not to make this sound more concerning).\n\nAfter playing the teaser game Vol. 0 I was a little sceptical about the value for money in this instalment- had I paid for it myself at full price I might have been a little disappointed. Waiting for the sales is what you want to go for here.\nDon't get me wrong- the game is beautifully made, probably one of the best well put together linear VNs I have played to date, the artwork is gorgeous and the character movement is fluid and natural (Ahem, apart from the balloonified chests of most of the characters). The music is cute and quirky, and the reading speeds for autoplay can be tweaked and saved for a relaxing smooth experience. 10/10 for aesthetics on this game.\n\nNow for my criticisms, (Or more positives, depending on what you look for in a game I suppose, who am I to judge?)- the main running story is cute, set in a bakery that is in it's first few weeks of opening... yada yada.... Not much ACTUALLY happens in terms of storyline. It's definitely more of a slice of life thing going on- though a majority of the text in the game is repeated over and over throughout the entire thing. It's all so samey- teary eyed cat girls "Master.... Master....". I enjoyed the final chapter- as this was the only one that seemed to explore different behaviours and emotions from the main characters, all the rest are sadly quite bland.\n\nSecondly, as others have pointed out- the way the relationships between the main characters are explicitly portrayed was a little disheartening. I feel it would have had so much more effect if more had been left to the imagination- Spoiler alert-  At one point in the story the catgirls stop being coy and outright express their desire "to have sex with master"	 , it just saps all of the flittery tension that these novels are enjoyable for. I get that this is about fanservice, and that is WHY people are playing the game, but I dunno. Putting it there in black and white takes away the curiosity of what's actually going on.\nAnother point- leading on from this... The player character explicitly mentions several times that he sees these two AS HIS CHILDREN. It's a little unnerving- i'm no newbie to bizarre ecchi, but even I think this is pushing the boundaries a little. "As pets, no... family. Even lovers" are not words that should be put together like that. This is all made even more cringeworthy from the fact we know the two girls are somewhere around 6 months of age, obviously growing far faster than normal humans- though by the time they are going through their heat they still act relatively innocent as a child would... Each boundary here (Pets/kids/family) has been pushed a little too far out of the comfort zones to create a weird blend of "Um... is it even okay for me to be reading this?" kind of thing.\n\nFinal notes:\n+ Great art/ animation/ music\n+ Good set of attainable achievements\n+ Adorable characters with strong personalities\n- Weak backstory\n- Weird almost forced relationships\n- Repetitive\n\n8/10, would Meow again","May 10","true","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

What is the purpose of a visual novel game?\n2. Are visual novel games for me?\n3. What the flying ♥♥♥♥ am I doing with my life?\n\nPlaying a visual novel is essentially reading a book with beautifully drawn and animated pictures but with voices to offer that extra bit of immersion. Nekopara is a story about leaving home, running a patisserie and looking after catgirls (I was  especially interested in Nekopara because of my unnatural weakness to animal girls.) What I did find especially interesting is that if you were to collate all the information you find out about catgirls in the world, and try to understand it, it doesn't make too much sense, let alone give a reason for the existence of these scientific 'abominations'.\nOn the other hand, they're SO CUTE, and I totally want one. Nekopara does a good job of telling a rather sweet story (or erotic story, if you buy the uncensored version) that is in actuality quite mediocre as I can summarise it in about two sentences.\n\nThe 'player', if you can call them that, is told the story from their perspective, which is as far as the game goes to involve you. Honestly, I was a bit bored, having just finished 'Hotline Miami' before playing Nekopara I felt a bit psychotic and was surprised to find myself a little disappointed that I didn't get to kill anything in the visual novel (anybody else feel like that after playing video games - perhaps you can recommend a good psychiatrist?)\nFor people who need a dose of "kawaii", who are too restless to watch anime and too lazy to play a 'proper' game.\n\nEnding on a positive note, you can speed run the game, with only one hand, in about 5 minutes or 20 minutes for the uncensored version ;)","November 15, 2015","true","1.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","8","10","5","0"

You have to be  a fitlhy weeb  a fan of Manga style art or anime to get the best out of this game, if you dont then you may or may not get the point of this "game"\nPros:\n- Awesome artwork\n- Good voice acting\n- A sweet love story\n- Well-written\n- Eroge to the max (lot of h-scenes, probably uncensored only)\nIn-betweens:\n- Japanese voice acting ( which i loved)\n- Settings are pretty basic (not a con, since this is very normal and understandable for visual novels)\n- No interaction\n- Very easy to get 100% achievements on\n- Absolute singleplayer - you will want to play this when you really are all alone.\n- requires tissues, socks or towels to play, will crash-to-desktop without them\nCons:\n- On the short side (my play time being calmly reading and getting trough the whole story)\n- side-characters have little to no development (but, it seems the developers are going the route of making new volumes focusing on the other side characters, with Vol. 2 having 2 of the side characters in the spot light as what i assume are main characters)\n-   not actually a con   DEAR GOD I JUST FAPPED TO 2 ♥♥♥♥ING CATS, SEND HELP\n\nAll in all a good game for you  to play with your daughter to show her why her cat had kittens  to play with when you want to play with yourself.

And that's not a bad thing!\nThe story is very heartwarming and the art is superb with its Live 2D.\nIt's a super cute game.

This is the first VN I've ever played (and it will likely be the only one too) but this is a rather engaging sojourn into a world of genetically-engineered catgirls under domestic ownership.\n\nAs a visual novel the narrative is very simplistic and completely free of interactive elements but it's really, REALLY moe.\n\nThis is a story of the catgirls named Chocola and Vanilla, and their family; Kashou, his sister Shigure and their catgirls at home. Kashou moves from home to start a bakery with very mixed responses from his family. Upon unpacking, he finds his sister has left him some baggage to care for. And thus begins Kashou's paternal role and the coming of age of Chocola and Vanilla.\n\nOutside of the myriads of slice of life elements played for the sake of being cute (I know a lot of people who are into that), Nekopara features several developmental tangents on behalf of the characters, the most evident being in the catgirls themselves. The playful pair reach several struggles with family and identity, being confused by human behavior, their roles at the bakery and even their feelings for their benefactor, Kashou. While not prize-winning material, Nekopara can and indeed does go the extra mile for playing the emotional strings and attempting to make empathetic characters. I cannot speak from experience but that's probably a lot more than can be said for other visual novels.\n\nWith that said, understand that this release has surprisingly little fanservice and much more focus on the feelings of the characters. PLEASE do not masturbate to this because that's a little harrowing to think of. If you do need more fap material I'd have to recommend a VN that rhymes with 'Sakura Spirit'. I've never played it but I do have friends who have, so check that out if you must.\n\nAlso, ignore the tags, the Steam version is very tame. Outside of a few crude remarks and censored nudity the release has little adult content.","January 11, 2015","true","4.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","60","12","20","13","0"

I do too, luckily there's NEKOPARA Vol. 1, hopefully there will be a NEKOPARA Vol. 2\n\nSo this game uses a completely different animation technique to bring the characters to life, I have to say, I like it a lot, and I hope games like it follow suite and use similar techniques, the game is just fun and adorable, though to get technical, it's not so much a game as it is a Visual Novel and you have no choices what-so-ever, but it's a fun read.\n\nNOW, because of Steam and their policy, this game is edited from the original version, so it's missing content, some...

Most of the top rated reviews are joke reviews (lel i dissapointed my family 10/10 *gets thousands of upvotes*)so i didnt expect much, but what a lovely surprise. I ended up clicking through most of the hentai scenes, because i actually wanted to see more story, its so awesome. the characters are hilarious, well developped.\n\nReally a nice gem, and not because of the hentai. Seriously worth your time and money, if you arent down with the hentai, this version is already pre-censored anyway (if you want it to be uncensored, there is a small very easy workaround).\n\nit's a shame that real reviews get the backseat to the idiots/trolls/attention ♥♥♥♥♥s, but hopefully if you were curious about this game, this will actually help!\n\nnekopara vol 2 please!!","January 17","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

Yes, these catgirls are pretty devoted, but there’s more going on than a simple harem storyline. One can’t help but be intrigued by Kashou’s devotion to baking, understanding both catgirls, and wanting to see everything turn out well. With that said, some may be put off by the sexual storyline aspect which suddenly shows up. Others might be mad knowing they’ve missed out on some scenes due to Steam’s restrictions on adult content. Still, NEKOPARA is a light and fluffy visual novel that fans of catgirls will enjoy their time with.\n\n8/10","January 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Also the jiggly bits slider never seemed to change anything.\n\nLets start with the good parts. Catgirls are cute, bakeries are awesome, the uniforms for said bakery are pretty awesome, and the protagonists sister is adorable. The voice acting is about what you would expect from a title like this, nothing too special but its certainly not bad by any means. I was impressed with the E-Mote (think Live2D animations) system and animations that make the characters feel much more alive than regular old 2D could do, there are issues with this system that I'll bring up in the negative points.\n\nI was extremely disappointed with the utter lack of interaction, no branches in story no choices, nothing. The story isn't that great and the characters don't change or grow much, but that can attributed to this being Volume 1 and also to this being less of an example of interactive fiction and more of a porn game with the porn removed. The scenario feels a bit contrived even allowing for suspension of disbelief about cat-people I never could quite find myself immersed. (I readily admit this is probably a personal failing.) The E-Mote system causes very noticeable stuttering when loading new characters into a scene; I was not the only one suffering from this problem, according to the forums.\n\nOn a more personal level, I didn't enjoy the protagonist getting together with multiple catgirls, especially given how many assets their designs reused, it just felt like two versions of the same character and I feel like the experience would have improved by just cutting one of the two characters or having two minor arcs dictated by a choice early on while leaving the one not selected as a background character.\n\nAll said, if you're excited for this title, I recommend getting the R18 version. This title is not worth the time without the explicit scenes in it and I don't even like that sort of thing.","May 28, 2015","false","3.1"," 59 of 113 people (52%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","52","59","113","3","0"

I honestly don't believe the users should be tagging this with "visual novel", as that implies some sort of player interactivity. This should be referred to as a "kinetic novel", which basically means "just point and click through the dialogue and enjoy the story".\n\nPros:\n-The art is bright and cheerful ( I love the cell style coloring).\n-The animations are more than just a simple fade between two static frames. They are smooth and very much like watching an anime.\n-Instant fan service/gratification\n-Super cute, tug-on-your-heartstrings cat girls\n-The addition of super cute voice acting\n-Bouncy you-know-what slider\n\nCons:\n-The story is nothing to get excited about. Even with how short it is, there was ample opportunity to not go the typical route, but sadly at no point is it unpredictable.\n-Characters are also very typical. You have the holy trinity of fan service: Super cute, overly excited girl, super shy, reserved girl,  and doting protagonist who just happens to have this all fall into his lap.\n-The emote system while smoother and providing nice animations as mentioned above, are not really "countless" as suggested in the games description. There are four main poses that get used throughout the majority of the game.\n-No replay value. Except for that...maybe...\n\nAll in all, I'd suggest it as a guilty pleasure. There isn't a lot of depth, but it is fun. Enjoy the fan service!","June 18, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/333600/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Nekopara is a high quality kinetic novel (meaning no interactions, only reading) featuring catgirls and adult themes, although the Steam version is censored unless you apply some shenanigans to it (refer to this Community Hub link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=370848130). The voice acting is in Japanese with subs for Japanese, English, and Chinese.\n\nThe art is extremely well done and fairly crisp. I played in a 1600x900 resolution which appears to be as high as it goes. Fullscreen will give it black borders as the game will maintain its aspect ratio to prevent stretched catgirls (very important). The level of quality that Nekopara has in terms of its art assets remains consistent throughout the entire experience with good coloring, shadowing, and light animations to help give the characters life such as head turning, blinking, breathing, and breast jiggling depend on how you use that slider.\n\nI have no complaints with the music. It has tunes ranging from upbeat to laidback and brought me closer to my inner anime. The game comes with a music player that can Play, Stop Repeat, and Repeat All should you decide to just chill out. The opening song is pretty good.\n\nFinally, the story seemed appropriate for what it was trying to do. It had its fair share of funny and “What is going on?” moments. The story follows Kashou and how he handles the two catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, coming into his life when he’s trying establish himself in the world as a baker. I don’t recommend thinking too hard about the rules that the world has regarding catgirls as those kind of discussions could lead to very strange places.\n\nVoice acting seemed fine with tones that matched the dialogue. I really liked how they would say some of the verbs out loud. Rub, rub, for example. Or stare. That’s not something I’ve seen very often and adds a silly vibe to it.\n\nAnyhoo, don’t purchase Nekopara for gameplay since there isn’t any. Your decision should be based on your interest in its story, the voice acting, the music, and the art.","June 21, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While sadly there are no choices for the player to make, I assure you that there wouldn't be a reason to. The Visual Novel's elements are modernly made, and makes enjoying the game an easy task.\nCharacter sprites are animated in a modern way, which I was strongly impressed by.\n\n-Pros-\nA happy 'fluffy' story, perfect for a strained heart from all those Evangelions and Madokas...\nVisual Novel elements are modernised which makes the reading all the more fun.\nLovable characters. Cheerful and fun-happy catgirls, must I say more?-Cons-\nVeteran novel readers may find the length of the story rather short.\nThe sexual hints between characters may put off people,\nwho are strictly there to enjoy daily lives of characters.\nThe story's simplicity may also turn-off those who enjoy a rich, deep story\nas there are not even a single choice to be made by the player.In overall - Nekopara is a pleasant experience. If you're up for some relaxation\naccompanied by two lovely catgirls, I 100% recommend this game to you.","September 27, 2015","true","6.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was not "perfect" or "awesome", but it did manage to entertain me.\n\nProsThe great artwork\nThe interesting options menu\nThe fact that the characters actually move while talking (they are animated)\nConsThe decent story (it wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great either)\nThe length (it took me about 5 hours to finish it)\nThe non-existing alternative endings\nAll in all I would say that this is a game which could potentially be worth picking up on a sale for a more fair price, since the 10€ that they are asking you for is a bit too much considering what you get.

Yeah... this game gets a 10/10 right there. xD\n\nIn all honesty though, one of the best animated VNs of all time. The amount of work they put into this is just amazing. Character details and animations are brilliantly done for a VN. They even incorporated the game window into the game, moving the game in windowed mode moves the characters in the game.\n\nSlightly a short VN in comparison to others, story is well done but not the best, personally I believe the story could of been better. There is only one path in the game, but it doesn't effect the game's entertainment at all. When Vol 2 is made and released, I'm sure they'll incorporate more paths and possibly and even larger story.\n\nI will give this VN a 10/10 though, even though the story was slightly lacking, the VN's entertainment was top notch, and the animation is out of the world. Not to mention, it starts the story of a series and opens up for Vol 2.","January 8, 2015","true","189.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silvachief/recommended/333600/","Silvachief","Silvachief","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silvachief/","190 products in account","NEKOPARA Vol.1 is the first in what I assume will be a series of short visual novels with the aim of making its readers melt with pleasure using a vast and varied array of female, feline, humanoid companions armed with cuteness and, well, catness. One of the first things I realized after starting the VN was that I was most definitely not the target audience for the title, which makes reviewing it a little difficult. While I personally didn’t enjoy the ride, it accomplishes everything it set out to do and does it reasonably well, so I’m going to attempt to cover both sides of the coin to give you an idea of whether this is a story that will appeal to you.\n\nMinaduki Kashou has had enough of his family. Despite belonging to a long line of Japanese sweet makers, he would love nothing more than to open his own bakery, which is what he sets out to do. Just as he is about to complete his goal, however, he receives two unexpected guests in the form of his sister’s Catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, couriered to him along with the rest of his luggage. Catgirls are, as they sound, female cats in humanoid form, with all of the cuteness you might expect from the mix. If taught well, they can speak and operate almost as well as a normal person, so in this day and age many people have taken them on as “Catpanions”. They’re a massive responsibility, though, and Kashou just isn’t sure he can handle the two while opening his new store. However, the Catgirls aren’t going to give up without a fight and Kashou may soon find a place in his heart and his home for the young felines.\n\nIf any of that summary doesn’t sound like your sort of thing, it isn’t. NEKOPARA is a dedicated moege (game intended to be cute) catering to a specific audience and doesn’t aim to appeal to anyone outside of that field. It spends all its energy on the simple goal of displaying cute characters doing cute things, which it does well, so if that’s your cup of tea then it would probably be a fantastic experience. Even though I’m more of a fan of titles with heavy story components I still found myself smiling and laughing during the experience, and I have to acknowledge that the Catgirls are pretty darned cute, so you can be sure that it would be that much more enjoyable to someone who’s into the genre. Speaking of story, there’s really not much to NEKOPARA’s. It’s short, sharp, and doesn’t try to do a whole lot except at the very end in a chapter that seems rushed and anticlimactic. In short, if you don’t think that Catgirls doing cute things are enough to hold up a visual novel on their own, NEKOPARA isn’t for you.\n\nCharacterization is as shallow as you might expect it to be, with the heroines showcasing a single personality trait each in addition to the necessary devotion to their owner. That said, there are a range of both humans and Catgirls involved in the tale, with a greater role for the non-main heroines looking likely in future instalments, which is more than enough to accomplish what NEKOPARA sets out to do. I want to take a moment now to discuss the VN’s classification, because it will be important for some potential players. The Steam release that I played is “censored”, meaning that scenes considered R18 have been removed. The odd thing is that borderline nudity, explicit talk about sex and obviously skipped over sex scenes are all still included in the final package. Given that anyone purchasing the Steam version is going to get all that anyway, if you’re after a cute, all-ages moege then that’s just tough, and if you’re after that stuff then why the heck would you buy the Steam version?\n\nOne of NEKOPARA’s major selling points is its visuals and they’re worth all of the hype. Character design is great and sprites will talk, blink, tilt their heads, walk around the screen and more. Allowing the animations to complete was a reason in itself for letting each character finish talking rather than continuing on after reading each line, as it gave a depth to the characters that their personalities didn’t. While most of the dynamic sprite features run smoothly, I noticed a bit of lag when the sprites change to new positions or poses without using animation, which was jarring and a little disappointing considering the overall polish of the visual novel. The voice actors perform as well as is usual for Japanese productions and the BGM is also standard fare. One final feature that I find really cool is that you can choose to play in either English or Japanese, which makes the game a great resource for people wanting to practice either language.\n\nSummary – NEKOPARA Vol.1 isn’t for me but for its target audience it could be a lot of fun. The technologically impressive visuals mix with cute, fun characters to deliver a solid moege. If it doesn’t sound like your sort of thing, however, it probably isn’t, as it lacks any sort of compelling story or character development. It’s worth noting that the Steam release isn’t really “all ages”, so if you’re after something innocent then you may want to look elsewhere also.\n\nMy Score: 6/10 – Average\nProjected Score for Target Audience: 8/10 – Good","December 29, 2014","true","5.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are adorable. I also like how you can switch languages at ease, and the text font is easy to read. The story is a bit schmaltzy with the kawaii overload, but that's to be expected for an eroge visual novel like this. Overall, I think this is a great VN.\n\nI decided to patch in the R18. Why? Even I don't know. But it adds more content, I guess. (Maybe.)\n\nAnd to my older brother, I deeply apologize for using the money you gave me to buy this.

While of course as a kinetic novel it doesn't have much in the way of choices, it makes up for it in story and character art. I've played Sakura Spirit and Sakura Angels and loved them, but this has those two beat. Aside from the adorable cat girls, the extra animation adds to their characterization and story. For sure this is aimed at the niche market of cute anime girls and visual novels, but it's purrfect for me. (eheheh.... pun)\n\nThis is absolutely adorable and I can't get enough of these girls. Now I just want the game with Cinnamon (scottish fold) and Coconut (maine coon) to come out.

That was seriously the ONLY expectation I even had coming in to the game was sexy catgirls. First thing I did, before I even opened it, was download the uncensored patch from online. Then I actually started playing...\n\nSee, the game (story really, there aren't any options) met my very basic expectations, and added substantially. It really made me a PART of the story, I really felt a connection with Chocola and Vanilla! I didn't think of them as the catgirls, I thought of them as MY catgirls. I know that's a looser thing to say, but I mean it.  The story is very touching, happy, and bubbly, and is told with EXCELLENT art and animation. Seriously, they characters were always moving (except in the rare, beautifully made still images), and that little element really added to the story.\n\nOverall, this game was far more than anything I had expected.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes nekos, and to be perfectly honest you can enjoy it very much even without the uncensored version; the story is DEFINATELY sound enough on it's own.  And as a bonus, there is definately going to be a Vol 2, based on the ending of this and the success of Vol 1.","August 31, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
