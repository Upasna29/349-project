"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/433490/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Some games are so stupid in their concept that they provide enormous amounts of fun to play. That describes the Steam debut of Dutch developer Blauwprint. I honestly thought that I was going to hate this ♥♥♥♥. I thought it was going to be a game that really didn’t need to be on Steam. I thought it was going to be a game that belonged only to mobile devices. I thought I’d play it once for less than half an hour and never return to it again. I don’t know whether to be more shocked about the game or to question my sanity. This game is great.\n\nIt doesn’t look like much. It’s actually really simplistic. At $2.99, less than a cup of coffee, it’s getting my vote as one of the biggest bargain of the early year. You may not rack up hour upon hour in the game but I challenge you to play it once and not end up with a huge grin on your face. In a world where we have limited time on our hands cheap quick thrills that we can return to time and again are worth their weight in gold. And that is where Super Flippin’ Phones has few peers.\n\nIt’s not going to win many awards. It’s just not that type of game. But it will win your heart. The pixel graphics are superbly illustrated – providing just enough clarity so that you can understand what is happening on the screen despite the frantic pace of the action. Speaking of… It will take you a couple of games to adjust to how crazy the pace is. But that’s the point of the game. It’s supposed to be that fast. In many respects its a twitch game but it lacks the frustrations that typically go along with them. Yes, you will die quickly and often but it’s something that’s too be expected. You’ll learn very quickly and embrace the best ways that you play. You’ll learn and there’s a high likelihood that you will dig it.\n\nIt’s not generally my type of game but I really do love it. It has been critically overlooked – Metacritic doesn’t even have a critic or a user score for the game yet. There’s 10 reviews on Steam as of time of writing. Every one of them positive. I am disappointed that the gaming media has overlooked this game. Sure, on the surface it doesn’t seem like much but that’s where you need to dig beneath the surface and actually play a game comes into play. First time developers can and do make fantastic little games. They deserve an opportunity to have their game spotlighted. Yes, that’s where I hope Steamified can come into play and assist developers and show games off. That’s why I’m going to try and move the Steamified Broadcast Network up to an earlier than estimated date and have gameplay videos to show off games such as this one so not only will you read of them but see them being played.\n\nJump in and buy this game. Don’t wait for it to be bundled – unless that happens sooner rather than later. Buy it. I recommend this game because it’s some of the most fun that I’ve had playing games so far this year.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways (generally 3 new ones every day) visit http://www.steamified.com\nPlease feel free to join us on Steam at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 28","true","1.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The game includes multiple floors, having a unique power-up and class of mall cop, which gives the gameplay some variety. The pixel graphics look great, and suit the game; the music matches the same theme. The controls are simple and easy to learn, and the game also has controller support, which I thought was much easier to use than using a keyboard. The game doesn't really take itself seriously either; the developers gave the game a great sense of humour by adding adding things like cops wearing fairy costumes, and a heart-boxers costume.\n\nPROS\nEntertaining, challenging gameplay where standing still means death\nGreat sense of humour\nEasy to learn\nLots of costumes to collect\nFun power-ups\nLots of enemy variety\nHigh replayability\nCONS\nNot many different floors\nThe game is loud, and there is no option for volume adjustment\nNew costumes are too hard to pick up, as you have to stand still\nSummary:\nI really enjoyed Super Flippin' Phones, and will definitely play it again in future. The game's quirkiness keeps you coming back for more, and the gameplay keeps you hooked in. I'd definitely give this game a play, especially with such a cheap price tag. I also think it's worth mentioning that Super Flippin' Phones is available for Android.\n\nRating:\nI'd give Super Flippin' Phones a 9/10.\n\nWant more recommendations?

Super Flippin' Phones reminds me of Vlambeer games Luftrausers and Nuclear Throne in its usefulness in this regard. I can enjoy some sweet arcade action, switching between floors and racking up unlockables *while* doing something else, so SFP has easily made itself a part of my usual rotation of Hexcells and small indies.\n\nLove it!\n\n*Full Disclosure: I helped with the voice-over for the game's trailer.","February 23","true","2.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

At the same time the mall cops, dogs, and other enforcement are after you and try to stop you. If you run into one you lose a big chunk of energy and have to wait for it to go up. If multiple run into you it's game over, so you need to constantly avoid them by jumping over there heads or by knocking a bunch of stuff into them, but jumping also takes up a small bit of energy so you have to use it wisely if low.\n\n+ Very well done art style / graphics\n+ Unique and fun gameplay that is fast-paced frantic nonstop action\n+ Quite a silly concept but it works well\n+ I found it very funny to see some fat guy wave his arms around knocking phones into the air which explode, and then running from everyone around him.\n+ A nice balance in difficulty where you seem to always get a little better each time you play\n+ Challenges which helps give you additional goals to complete (along with new characters)\n\n- The game's length is very short and therefore gets repetitive after a short while. (about a minute or so each run)\n- The limited content, simplistic gameplay, and large UI made it feel more like a mobile game (which it is)\n\nI suggest you try the previous version here for free and see what you think:\nhttps://blauwprint.itch.io/flippin-phones","February 20","true","0.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LemonyPinkness/recommended/433490/","LemonyPinkness","LemonyPinkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LemonyPinkness/","55 products in account","Below is my review for Super Flippin' Phones as seen on MyGamer.com (http://www.mygamer.com/super-flippin-phones-review/)\n\nScore: 7.0\nBottom-line: Fast-paced, satisfying arcade-action that could do with some more content and variety.\n\nPositives:\n-Fast, responsive controls\n-Intuitive mechanics\n-Clean visual aesthetic\n-Well-employed risk-reward elements\n\nNegatives:\n-Little variety\n-All too repetitive music loops\n-Weak tutorial\n\nNobody thinks twice about a one-note joke. Nobody needs to. Super Flippin’ Phones’ meager one-liner about smartphone trends didn’t evoke even a chuckle from me but, luckily, wasn’t loud enough to get in the way of its inviting mechanics and playful nuances. Successor to Blueprint and 3xBlast’s quite similar Flippin’ Phones (2014), Super Flippin’ Phones brings us much-improved and overall great retro-inspired visuals and pure arcadey fun and flare but too little variety in terms of visuals and music.\n\nIn case you didn’t notice, everyone at the mall has their eyes glued to their smartphone or at least it seems so. Now imagine if a hobo were to run riot through Macy’s or Neiman Marcus, knocking phones out of everyone’s hands. Haha. What then? That’s about it. Super Flippin’ Phones utilizes this catchy but shallow social commentary to give their game some initial pop and, after some consideration, that’s quite alright by me. Actual gameplay neither reiterates the premise to a point of annoyance nor wholly relies on its meme-ability to move forward like Goat Simulator, Nyan Cat games, and so many others. Taking the joke a step further with an iOS and Android port could bring that extra “meta” to earn a full chuckle. The controls are simple enough and, frankly, the game holds up better played in small bursts than full hours so it could be great, but I digress.\n\nUsing only WASD, you must guide your hobo on a rampage as he wildly flails his arms, knocking phones out of the hands of so many unsuspecting smartphone zombies in his path. Doing so “hips them” to his freewheeling lifestyle, inspiring a legion to follow his every step and inciting the wrath of countless mall officers, police dogs, and undercover cops. In addition to flipping phones, our hobo can slap cops and dogs out of his way, given he has enough stamina. Stamina depletes as players leap over or slap cops and replenishes slowly while running and quickly while standing still. Get caught standing still or with low stamina and it’s game over.\n\nFollowers must be turned in at the hobo’s cardboard box in exchange for points. The larger your following, the greater the reward per evacuee. Get caught before turning in any followers, however, and you’ll come out empty handed. Whether scoring in the hundreds-of-thousands or zero, this arcadey implementation of risk-reward elements essentially won me over, tempting me to push my luck over and over again. Controls are responsive enough for quick turns and last second getaways and the runner’s pace of gameplay perfectly maintained the excitement.\n\nGameplay’s mostly intuitive though the game could've used a dedicated tutorial instead of its halting tutorial prompts. Tutorial prompts pause the flow of gameplay whenever players run into something new, taking control away from the player and diminishing the feeling of discovery. It comes off as sloppy and gets annoying, especially since it brings the otherwise fast game to a full stop.\n\nHigh enough scores unlock additional game modes which feature a greater variety of obstacles. For instance, the League of Extraordinary Police difficulty adds an officer on stilts and one with a riot shield to the mix, both of which have their own simple but complementary solutions: riot shields knock you backward and need to be vaulted over while stilt cops require you to jump to slap them, eating up more stamina than the usual mall cop. Randomly placed giant gift-box drops contain a variety of quirky costumes like underpants only, caped wrestler, and moustache man. They add a good bit of visual variety to gameplay and give players something to work for other than achievements.\n\nI found the overall package to be entertaining but too limited in scope and production to keep longer play sessions feeling fresh. For instance, you spend the entire game in multi-level malls, rioting to the sound of only a few peppy but short tracks. The tracks themselves aren’t so great to begin with and wore out for me after only a few runs. While the enemy variety and core gameplay loop are exciting, the game world begins to feel monotone early on, especially since it can take some time to unlock new levels. In the earliest level for example, the restaurant part of the mall has its own theme and color scheme but the rest of the mall lacks anything remarkable. A few more explicitly detailed shops within the mall, more locations varying in layout and size, and just more of everything could've done a lot to keep the world feeling lively.\n\nThe “good,” in a way, is as “good, honest fun” as it gets. Gameplay is addictively challenging and mechanically concise and there’s little if any pretension behind the game’s premise - honestly, knowing nothing about the title before playing, I went in expecting to be bludgeoned over the head with commentary about Generation Z. Although currently lacking in content and variety but considering its $3.00 launch price, Super Flippin’ Phones is well worth its value because it’s straight up fun. Some content support post-launch could help the game become a sure winner though developers have yet to formally announce future plans, if any. I also feel it worth reiterating that I believe the game would excel on mobile platforms: it’s perfect for quick pick-up-and-play and perhaps better suited to thrive in that context than in formal, sit-down desktop sessions. Let’s hope we see a few content updates post-launch and - fingers crossed - a mobile port down the road.\n","March 12","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved how simple the controls are, and same goes for a keyboard. The simple style of UI is somewhat easy to use, and same goes for the Controls page, as it flips between the keyboard and Controller controls, great game. The way the game works is great, the stamina system is smart, and allows a bit of variation between how much you can do in a small blast. The graphics style is basic, yet the game is really easy to get what goes on in the game. One last thing, the resolution, there shoul be a resolution slider, so then you can get a large window in windowed mode.\n\nConsAs much as I hate doing this part, I have to. The game music/sound is way to loud, I had to turn it down like 3/4 of the way for it to be acceptable, also I stated the game was also easy to control. The jump is too low, as I tried to jump over a police officer and failed... many of times :D the game is a simple game, but great.\n\nOverall reviewThis game is fun, it may be hard, personally I feel it was really hard to actually get a combo, the game is hard, but I love that! You will have to learn how to play different styles, and try to use many levels to my advantage. Buy this game, as it is very fun, if needing a little help, tell me, I can help. The game is around $2, of which is a great price for how detailed the game is.\n\nExtra InformationDeveloper(s): BlauwPrint, 3xBlast\nPublisher(s): BlauwPrint\nPlatform(s): Windows\nRelease Date: February 18th 2016\n\nWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group","February 23","true","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
