Just a twin-stick shooter that appears to be a deeper Asteroids but kind of just flops. Graphics are alright, check videos if you want to know more about that. Controls for some of the ships are wonky. I was using WASD, moving forward and backward seem to do the same thing and it makes your ship move towards your mouse but it's a weird, uneasy wobbling that doesn't really make the user feel like they're in control. The missions all seem kind of monotonous and dying is not really a punishment in co-op (should it be?) because you can be revived easily. I bought the game on a whim, hoping it might spice up a boring Saturday night. If there's a demo or torrent, check it out before you support the devs. Thanks for reading this far, hopefully you can make a good decision about this game!","April 20, 2015","false","0.7"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

The game is basically of the spaceship joystick/mouse fly around and shoot other spaceships game. The graphics are just ok and the music kind of a scifi-trip theme, but nothing really really to blow you away. You get to choose a spaceship based on what you like, speed, fire power, health with names like Rio,Volga,Potomac and Euphrates and protect the Blue Shield Alliance's power generators on colonized planets. Such and Mars, Pluto and the Moon. The character roster is short with Admiral Herman, engineer Dana, a robot named B-177e  and a frigate pilot named Valgard. The bad guys are just easily named Cons and well that's about it. There is a single / co op story mode and you have a survival mode. Go back and beat top scores with free play mode also. The game is fun and you can kill a hour or so but, with-out a team or co op friends you get stuck/can't really progress in story mode. This game is almost  like you do need the team/friends to beat it. It'll be lots of fun with them, but it puts a damper on beating the actual story mode and playing as a single player.  Buy if you have lined up friends to get it too or its on sale like when I did and have a few hours to kill.","May 16, 2015","true","2.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Good to see it's come to Steam!","October 15, 2015","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As they explore and colonize the galaxy, they come to realize that they are alone after a couple of centuries of failed communication attempts.  Then out of the blue, they are aggressively attacked by an alien race known as the Constituents of Nothing.  Since this alien race uses dark matter technology as well, mankind's weapons were useless against them.  That is until humans discovered anti-dark matter particles.  This blue-energy is humankind's last hope against this alien threat.\n\nThere are thirty-six story missions that span across nine planets.  Well, technically eight since Pluto isn't considered a planet anymore.  In fact, the Steam achievement for completing all of the Pluto missions is "Not a planet."  The story missions can be played solo or with up to four players locally.  Having people to play with is highly recommend since the missions get really tough towards the end.  Some of the missions will have an AI unit assist you, but most of them don't.  Most of the time you'll be protecting AI ships instead of working with them.\n\nIf you're not escorting or defending an ally's ship, chances are you're defending a generator or two instead.  The generators are crucial for converting scrap metal into usable resources.  The scrap metal can be used to upgrade various attributes of the four different ship classes.  I went with the balanced class ship, The Euphrates.  There is also the Rio speed class ship, the Volga assault class, and the Potomac support class. Most ships have a limited number of missiles and turrets, but some ships have mines and the ability to heal allies.\n\nIn total, there are nine upgradeable ship options.  Each additional upgrade costs more scrap than the previous tier.  You can upgrade the number of turrets, missiles, and increase other attributes including armor, top speed, maneuverability, acceleration, firing speed, and bullet power.  The upgrades help, but fighting the medium and heavy class enemy ships goes a lot smoother when you have a partner fighting alongside of you.\n\nThe controls are pretty straightforward and the PC version of the game supports keyboard and gamepads.  I used my Xbox 360 controller and it worked flawlessly.  The left analog stick moves the ship while the right analog stick fires the bullets in the direction its pointing.  Deploying turrets or mines is done by pressing the Y button and firing a missile is accomplished by using the B button.\n\nGraphically SCHAR: Blue Shield Alliance is pretty basic.  The space ships all appear to be flat and the bullets, bombs, and missiles are all pretty simple with minimal special effects.  The characters in the game are cartoon like and the space atmosphere is pretty simplistic.\n\nThe audio is pretty barebones as well.  There is no voice acting, but the sound effects are passable. The dialogue can be a little colorful with a character  threatening to kick my *ss twice if I failed in protecting them.  The soundtrack is decent and available for purchase for $0.99 on Steam if you got the game by itself.  Alternatively, the soundtrack edition of the game sells for $5.99.\n\nWhile SCHAR: Blue Shield Alliance is rough around the edges, there is some fun to be had in this title.  Especially if you have people to play with.  Xbox 360 owners may want to consider picking this title up for $0.99 while the Xbox Arcade is still around.  For Steam users, I recommend picking this game up if you see it on sale.","September 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Do you enjoy space? Do you like blowing things up with your friends?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of the above questions, defintiely check out SCHAR: Blue Shield Alliance. It is a nice little package of goodness. The different ship classes compliment each other nicely and the upgrades give you the flexibility to make each ship play as your own. The campaign is solid, and the survival modes will definitely require some teamwork, making this an idea couch co-op game for friends. The dynamic soundtrack is composed perfectly, and the visuals work really well for this style of game.\n\nBSA is an indie gem that will set you back a coffee - defintely worth your time.\n\nVerdict: DOPE\n\n","March 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","6","12","3","0"

This game has managed to be not only less enjoyable, but also less well thought out than a game made 30 years ago.\n\nTell me again why I bothered to purchase this game?\n\nIf I could go back in time and change one event, I would not stop Stalin, Hitler or even Ghengis Khan, I would stop the developers of this game, because the atrocities of even the most evil dictator pale in comparison to this disease masquerading as a video game.\n\nUnder no circumstance should this game be played or puchased by anyone, there are many more well thoughout and enjoyable space shooters on the market, this game feels like a class project for special needs kids who were denied the use of computers and instead only allowed to code the game on typewriters.\n\nStay far far away","March 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 14 of 44 people (32%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","32","14","44","13","3"
