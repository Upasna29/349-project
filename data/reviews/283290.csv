"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/283290/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I'm not going to beat around the bush: This game owns. It's a conditional sort of owning, the kind where the game itself is 13 years old and rough around the edges, but if you can get past that it is a fantastic experience. Your character is meeting your family at a totally-not-creepy-at-all eastern European castle for your sister's wedding, and you arrive in the dead of night to discover the castle is a den of horrors. It's a first-person action game that moves like the Quake II/Half-Life 1 era games, so be prepared for sliding around at 40mph with your cane sword and crucifix. You'll be glad of it soon enough, because the enemies are quick and relentless and you'll need to do some sidestep dancing if you want to survive.\n\nThe big draw here is that there's a whole castle to explore to find your family members, and it's randomized with each new game. I've found the layout doesn't change too dramatically, but the locations of enemies and items (including essential items like keys) vary immensely. The first time I played, the East Wing key was sitting right out in the open for me to take, but the second time I had to delve into the cellars and wrest it from a pair of vampires. You find a wide assortment of weapons and tools with multiple uses, like stakes that can be used to pin bloodsuckers or burn as light sources. And you'll need to use them, too, because enemies in this game do not ♥♥♥♥ around.\n\nAgain, this game is 13 years old, and looks and feels the part. But as long as you can get past that there's a deep game of terrifying exploration here. The atmosphere is excellent, with dramatic lightning and some chilling musical cues. This one's definitely a stand-out.","September 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 66 of 73 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","66","73","6","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beysaan/recommended/283290/","Beysaan","Zelrala","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beysaan/","206 products in account","Ill get the most important points out of the way quick.\n\nIs this game older? Yes. 2003 to be precise.\nDoes its age show in graphics? Yes, despite being around the same time as games like Unreal Tournament 2003/4, its still a very old and barebones game, visually.\nBut is it fun? Quite so.\n\nThe very first time you go through this game, you will be slow, unsure and downright inefficient. Youll use your precious ammo in far too high a quantity on enemies that you could slap down with ease. Youll walk into easily avoidable traps... and.. oh yeah, some of the people you are there to save WILL DIE.\n\nThe very first time i went through this game, despite all the difficulties i had due to various members of the group dying (and hence i dont get the items they give you) it was one of the most enjoyable times of gaming.\n\nI recently bought it when i saw it was on steam (it actually disappeared from most locations you could get it for a few years, basically requiring a torrent to acquire), and played through it again. Despite finishing it easily in less than a couple of hours, it still remained just as enjoyable from the very start to end.\n\nYou are given multiple weapons, with varying uses and effectiveness of each one. You start with just a cane sword and stakes to begin with, but then acquire the flintlock pistol (and a short time later the rifle too, but its basically just a slightly more powerful and ranged flintlock pistol). Then if you do well enough youll find the revolver, grail and machine gun.\nBut funnily enough, the pistol and rifle are actually powerful enough to get you through the majority of the game, so it still remains playable no matter how badly you are doing.\n\nNow, the focus of this game is to save your family members and kill the big boss vampire and his minions. Typical story, but useful enough in this situation.\nThere are two ways your family members get killed in this:\n1. You take too long to find them. Every few in game hours one of your family members dies off in order, assuming you havent saved that one already. Meaning if you take too long to find someone, they get killed and you cant open their suitcase to get their item (some of which are VERY useful).\n2. They get killed when youre bringing them back to the entrance. THIS PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN. Just saying this right now. Theres a good chance that the unfortunately terrible AI that control your family will get them killed more than once. When enemies attack they immediately either fart themselves into a corner in panic, or run a short distance away like an idiot. And once youve gone forward and cleared the enemies, you have to go back and tell the morons to start following you again. The fun part is when theyve followed you, but you still have to stop and walk back to them every 20ft because theyve gotten stuck on a box, or wall, or door that closed in their face and they somehow lack the ability to open it now. And if youre lucky, the MIGHT not lose half their health as they sprint down stairs and take fall damage. (your own character can do this quite frequently too.).\n\nNow, That might make the game sound frustrating at best, but as long as you save your game frequently its not the biggest issue.\n\nAlso, unfortunately due to the simplicity of this game, i cant really describe much more without giving out spoilers or ruining parts of the game, but lets just say that the map is quite brilliantly designed. It weaves in and around itself, giving you more shortcuts and back paths as you acquire more keys and access the doors between rooms and floors. There are many hidden caches of items that are sometimes a savior, and other times a nasty trap to lure you into rooms.\nUnfortunately the whole "Enemy hiding above doorway" idea is overused to all hell and becomes trivial when you hear the audio cue upon opening a door. Or just looking up and seeing the extended lintel.\n\nBut anyway, This is a real gem of a game, and despite its flaws and pains its a enjoyable experience. Truly one of the games of the last many years which really grasped the idea of how to make progressive and atmostpheric gameplay. A game which truly didnt rely on its graphics to sell it.\n\nTwilight Stress Relief Simulator/10. Recommended.","March 31, 2015","true","2.4"," 60 of 65 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","60","65","11","0"

Surprise! The count and his entire family are made up of vampires and you and your family are on the dinner menu. There are several things about this game that may positively or negatively influence your opinion so it's good to be aware of what you're buying.\n\nWhat works:\n+Music: Built to increase tension, Nosferatu's score consists of several ambient tracks and string arrangements that can easily keep you on your toes as you venture through the castle.\n+Ranged Combat: The gunplay is very satisfying and explosive. There is nothing quite like waiting for that one ghoul to pop around the corner just so you can flintlock him in the face.\n+Level Design: Imagine Castlevania type theming with all the exploratory rooms you could ask for. Oh and it's randomly generated.\n+Enemy Difficulty: While not overbearing or a slap on the wrist, nothing screams good mechanics like the feeling that it's all your fault when you lose health or die.\n\nWhat doesn't quite work\n-Melee Combat: Chunky and reminiscent of games where they were just testing this kind of thing out. Like Daikatana.\n-Hilarious Physics Bugs: I suppose you've always wanted to walk into a chest, be subsequently tossed into the air and make a loud "umph" as you slap against the floor. No? Well okay too bad then.\n-AI From Hell: The AI characters really love getting stuck trying to follow you. This includes any obstacles or doors in your way. God forbid you have to escort more than one at any time.\n\nOverall, I recommend Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi because it's still very enjoyable and easy to get into despite the silly glitches.\n\n7.5/10 Knock yourself out","January 2, 2015","true","2.5"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","93","50","54","8","2"

It's entire castle is actually randomly generated, so it allows for a generally new experience each time through.\n\nOff the bat, the graphics are rather outdated, but dark, dreary and remind me alot of the static-feeling of Silent Hill.  On a lighter note, the gameplay reminds me a lot of Doom and Wolfenstein.  I feel that they could update some of the graphics, such as being able to slide the priest around while he's on the floor and vampires falling through walls.\n\nThe weapons are relatively normal for horror-survival, being a melee, a gun, and several other items, but it also adds a new twist with a cruicifix that stuns enemies and even kills the Vampires.  Their range of swings are pretty far, even when you've got them in a corner beating them to death, so it feels slightly unfair.\n\nThe monsters are creepy-looking, able to give me a good jump on several occasions, and even make sense in the areas they are in.  The satanic spawn portal looks very creepy and gives you the sense of impending doom when walking in on one.\n\nAudio could be better.  The grunts and groans come off as cliche and often times feel half-♥♥♥♥♥.  In the end, they actually hinder the experience a bit.  The cries of the monsters are scary and leave me paranoid, so as long as they don't hit me, I feel that the game plays well.\n\nThe characters are annoying.  Once you save anyone (usually by stumbling upon them inside a room), they are supposed to follow you until you can lead them somewhere safe, but the doors keep shutting on them and cutting thier A.I.s, forcing you to open the door, interact with them, and drag them through before the door shuts again.  It gets very tedious and downright deadly when there's a spawn portal in the room you want them to go into.  Finally, when you do get them somewhere safe, you have to be sure to interact with them to tell them to keep put and stay far away from them when you walk by, otherwise they'll decide to follow and get caught in the same cycle as before.\n\nAs I've played, I've come across some rather bothersome bugs.  I came upon a glitch where the vampire actually disappeared and attacked me while invisible.  If not for his shadow on the ground, I would've been killed by him.  I think the cause for this glitch was holding the crucifix and holding the attack before he could rise from the coffin.  Also, I'm not sure if it's part of the game or if it's just bad programming, but when I saved Aunt and I brought her back to the courtyard before running off to clear out anymore Hellspawns, I got a message that tolled on my screen, saying that she'd died.  When I went to the inventory, I saw her picture crossed out.  It's probably a bug that kills the NPC reguardless of location.\n\nIn the end, it feels rather unpolished.  It had a chunk of potential- giving the vampires their good names once again, but they don't really try to update it and it just feels abandoned.  I would recommend getting it on when it's on sale or with a coupon, but that's probably the only best times- not really worth full price just yet.  So, my recommendation is to enjoy it as if it were in an Alpha state, and accept that this may just be the best we'll get for it.\n\nControls: 3/4\nGameplay: 2/4\nTerror: 4/4","March 7, 2014","true","3.2"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fellvoid/recommended/283290/","fellvoid","Fellvoid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fellvoid/","371 products in account","This is a delightfully old-school experience, with a managable difficulty setting and great features that will keep you coming again.\nI first played this when I was a kid, and it freaked me out a lot. It was scary back then, before the HD era. Nowadays, sure - it looks really outdated. But it's systems are not. Part roguelike, part metroidvanian FPS survival-horror experience, this game is sure to keep you engaged for quite some time. Even after all of these years, with the automatic upscalling and all, the game looks pretty good on a modern monitor.\nThe graphics glitch out sometimes, but it's not something a game restart can't fix.\nEven now, in 2015, you can see all the work that went into this - it oozes with atmosphere and the creep factor never drops. Even all the typical moments of the old times seem cute now - like struggling to find your path because of "logical" game design (this castle Malachai's architect is probably the same one who designed Dracula's). Puzzles are never too easy, neither too hard. The hardest thing is memorizing the environment, as it's a large Castle and, well - you have no map, which actually adds to the experience in my opinion. The game's "Random Castle" perk is probably one of it's most notable features - each time you start, the castle is different. And the difficulties do a lot to change up things too.\nThere's a lot to discover, a great challange and ... well, I'm not gonna spoil it.\nIf you're into horror and you don't mind it beeing old and not super-high-spec-HD, get this game. If you are a fan of old-school horror movies, you should try it also. The game is absolutely modeled after the Hammer-era horror movies.\nThis game is a FPS metroidvania and it's awesome for being just that. When I was a kid, this is what I expected the "new" Castlevania games to be like. They weren't, but hey - this game is still awesome. I absolutely recommend it!\n\nAll in All:\n\n+ Random Castle in Each New Game\n+ Great Atmosphere\n+ Still Holds Up\n+ A thing that I should not spoil but it's awesome and you will know what it is if you play the game\n+ Fun!\n+ Good scares, different each time!\n\n- It looks outdated, mainly because of the low res options\n- It's a hard game, even on easy, in the beggining, until you get the hang of it\n- Graphical glitches on newer hardware\n\nOverall, as a old-school fan, I rate this a solid 8/10 for awesome atmoshpere and fantastic fun factor! If you are not a old-school fan and you want to try it out, consider the rating to be a 6.5/10 - it will be fun if you manage to get into it.","October 30, 2015","true","6.4"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","35","36","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaturalpeacewarrior/recommended/283290/","supernaturalpeacewarrior","Vanwolfster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaturalpeacewarrior/","83 products in account","The game is very fun aside from having some bot enemies getting stuck on certain locations, but that happens rarely. The story is very interesting and unique where your mission is to try and save all your family members and friends from getting hunted down and sacrificed to the Almighty Malachi who Nosferatu tries to resurrect. Depending on the family members and friends you save, you will be rewarded with power ups and weapon unlocks plus an unlimited supply of health given the form of being a doctor. There are moments in the game where you have to conserve your ammo if you are trigger happy, using your cane sword to slash and hack enemies, but my favorite combo is impaling the demons of the night with a stake then finish them off by beating them to a bloody pulp. In the story, there will be many bosses to face like about six unfortunately due to the game being a bit short, but still an entertaining game it is if you don't speed run and enjoy the dark atmosphere surrounding the castle and scaring yourself when enemies appear out of nowhere. Overall, the game is a great survival horror and makes you feel the adrenaline rush since you are giving a specific amount of time to save your family and friends. My advice though, is to save the Holy would be victims since you'll be given a very powerful and overpowered weapon that King Arthur's Knights were trying to find, but good thing you have it.","October 24, 2014","true","6.9"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","0"

It's a FPS/survival horror/rouge-lite mix up with some randomly generated rooms and areas. The game is hard as ♥♥♥♥,  but that only adds to the atmosphere of it. You'll be on your toes throughout the whole thing, checking every single corner of a room as you enter, making sure you wont get mauled by some dog, sliced up by some nut-case with a scythe, or fondled by a ghost (regardless, these things will happen to you anyway). What's beautiful about this game is how techincally awful it is. The game isn't the best looking (although in my opinion I feel the graphics style compliments the atmosphere so much I think it looks amazing) a lot of sounds and pieces of music are stock, you cant customize item hotkeys (so something like the stake is all the way at "8") and there are no video settings to change from so you'll need a patch. The whole was only made by a few swedish guys, and honestly, I dont think the game would have been any better without this low budget feel.

(They truly deserve a Darwin award, jeez, how people like this avoids accidentally strangling themselves with their ties is beyond me)\n\nLike, for example, the last relative I tried to rescue (The lawyer), I tried to take him with me to the 5th floor elevator, he got his bald head stuck between a wall and the elevator, and he fell down. I'm like "Are you okay?", I go down, and when the lift reached the floor "Lord Baldo has died!". Oh, so you are telling me he got crushed by the elevator? I go up, and I try to go through the door, just to get stuck IN A ♥♥♥♥ING WALL thanks to a bug. Yes, this game can be buggy at times, but it's not THAT common.\n\nBTW, Lord Baldo didn't make it....I....Actually musket'd him when he couldn't go through the portal to the basement.\n\nThe enemies are pretty interesting, the gun combat feels satisfying as all hell, the fists are stronger than the cane (You are a fencer, not a boxer....How the ♥♥♥♥?)\n\nThe game sound is good, the atmosphere is deep and dark, albeit, in a slightly old way, but it definitely gets it's point across. The game is pretty damn short, I finished it in around 4 hours, and well, I used the chalice against the last boss and....It's one of the easiest last bosses I've seen. HOLY WATER SPLASH x2, DEAD!\n\nI tried it again with the submachine gun, pretty easy too, but at least I actually felt like I was about to die.\n\nDefinitely, get this game if you are into old horror games, and vampires that do not ♥♥♥♥ing sparkle.\n\nPlus, it's always fun to jump two steps on a staircase and grunt in pain, and if your relatives are following you, they will fall flat on their faces.

It was a nice and decent Pen & Paper Roleplaying game. During the years following the debut of that given game, horror antagonists turned to protagonists and players were offered a different look on those creatures of the night.\n\nNosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi swum on this big wave as it was created. Given it shows still the classical good/evil point of view, with an protagonist hunting vampires, demons and other nightmarish critters. But you have to take note that this game appeared after the sucessful Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption RPG title. And only slightly before Bloodlines.\n\nNosferatu is an "old" game, old because the graphics aren't fancy or beautiful as in most modern games, but still they do fulfill their purpose. The sound is sinister and giving a lot of scares when suddenly demons appear. The selection of available weapons is quite straigthforward, the oponents are manageable and of course the castle is procedural generated.\n\nThe game is high and low for a prospect gamer, it has done so much good things but on the other hand there are also a lot of things that aren't all rosy.\n\nPro: Proceduraly generated Castle, each time you play it, the architecture is generated.\nPlays as simple and easy like an ego shooter.\nAtmospheric, though dated sound.\nCon: AI glitches.\nSometimes the game creates a strong monster in a place that you can't surpass - if this happens to often you'll be frustrated and feel ganked by the game.\nThe game is old, and it shows - if you don't like old graphics - you'll better don't buy it.\nUnexpectedly crashes. This happens only rarely, I recomend to put Steam downloads during play on halt.\nConditional Recommendation\nThis game is nothing for the faint of heart. It has old and outdated graphics, but still it plays most of the time like a charm. The sound is atmospheric, at times really sinister and speaking of impeding doom - on the other hand sometimes oponents behave stupid, or like stringed puppets. You have to pray for luck to win over the game, it depends on sheer luck for a lot of things to happen. If you like old action ego shooters, this game won't disappoint you but if you love fancy and intelligent first person shooters you'll probably better off with more recent games.","July 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkstarangelo/recommended/283290/","darkstarangelo","DarkStarAngelo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkstarangelo/","764 products in account","I loved this game back in the day and I still love it now. Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a very interesting little horror FPS. It takes heavy influence from the classic horror films backing in the early 1900s (Nosferatu, Dracula, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari, Frankenstein and so much more) and brings it all together into an old school first person shooter much more akin to Wolfenstein 3D. The story is, your sister is getting married to the son of a wealthy count in Transylvania where you and your family have gone to visit to take part in the wedding ceremony but you arrive late to the party and it soon dawns upon you that things have gone horribly wrong, only to find out that the castle is haunted by vampires, wraiths, zombies, ghouls, demons and what other kind of classic monster you can throw in there. The count aims to resurrect the almighty Malachi and to bring the world to an end and it's your job is to save your family and to put a stop to the count from resurrecting Malachi.\n\nSince this is a Steam review, I want to break it down into simpler, more straight forward lists of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Open, explorative level design\n- Interesting weaponry\n- Fun gunplay\n- Great aesthetic, has that German Expressionism vibe to it\n- Really creepy and atmospheric\n- Old school, using medikits to heal as well as allowing you to carry all weapons and as well as powerups throughout\n- Very challenging even on easy for your first run\n- Randomly generated castle with each new playthrough (Some landmarks will stay the same but it's so you're not lost)\n- A wide variety of nasties of the night to fight\n- Enemy and item placement is randomized, leaving you wondering what's around the next corner\n- Fantastic amounts of replayability\n- Captures the feel of the classic horror films pretty much perfectly with it's soundtrack, story, theme, melodramatic voice acting, etc\n\nCons:\n- Some of the geometry can be very dodgy, making you get stuck or fall through places\n- The geometry can glitch out really badly sometimes, leaving holes to the neverending void of nothingness\n- The graphics look a lot like Quake 1 despite being released in 2003\n- Animation quality is quite laughable\n- The Wolf 3D maze-like levels will confuse a lot of people, just make sure you remember the layout when exploring\n- You are timed against a pretty strict clock, while times moves realistically you will often find yourself too late and some of the people you're meant to save will die off (The level design makes that even more of an annoyance)\n- Hit detection can be a pain sometimes\n- Not enough powerups in my honest opinion\n- Health and ammo is a little too plentiful, it can kill the survival horror element of it sometimes\n- The last boss is far too easy and underwhelming despite his cool design\n- The game runs for roughly 2-3 hours, that's too short for most\n\nI think Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a really great game with awesome ideas, good level design, solid gunplay and great survival horror experience. Taking ques from Wolfenstin 3D and being inspired by the films in the early 1900s makes it a pretty fantastic game for horror fans or old school FPS fans to pick and play for a little while. The level of replayability comes in by obviously completing the game in several difficulties but also saving your family members and completing the game as fast as possible, that leaves plenty of room to replay the game if you're really into it.\n\nOverall I would recommend this with all my heart and soul, it's so much fun to play and with it's short length, it's great to kick back and relax and watch the afternoon or evening go by playing this, by then you might have beaten the game already. But it's always fun to come back to every now and then. Your first playthrough will take you a lot longer, respectively, and you will lose some of the people you're meant to save and by the end of the game you will just want to hop back on the horse and do it all again, this time doing it faster so you can save everyone and that makes it a very fun and addictive game to play.","December 23, 2014","true","3.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","0"

It's old, and you'll be able to tell right away—for example, you need to use a mod fix to be able to change resolutions, and the AI and physics are rather rough around the edges. But other than that, the game has a number of really neat and interesting concepts behind it.\n\nWhile the structure of the entire castle is static and pre-determined, the non-essential items, enemy encounters, and locations of NPCs are all randomized upon entering and re-entering every room (aside from the NPCs, which I believe are randomized upon starting a new game), making the jump scare element of this game crazy good. You're also pressed against the clock with about two and a half hours (from 10:30PM to 1:00AM in-game) in which you have to try and save all 17 family members that are scattered randomly throughout the castle (a few are bound to specific rooms for plot-related reasons), otherwise everyone who you fail to rescue will automatically perish. Each member you fail to rescue affects the strength of the final boss, so you'll want to find everyone and escort them to the entrance of the castle as quickly as you can.\n\nThe game has a number of other cool aspects to it, such as having to rely mostly on very restricted weapons (e.g. you have a crucifix but it only harms certain enemies or wards off others temporarily, flintlock guns that need to be reloaded every shot, losing the remainder of your loaded rounds if you reload prematurely, etc.), a fatigue system that drains very quickly, a whole bunch of different ways random enemy encounters can occur, brief texts throughout the castle with interesting tidbits on enemy and castle lore, atmospheric music, very low level lighting at some points, lots of areas to the castle, vampires that have to be killed the old-fashioned way (i.e. wooden stake in the heart), and of course, the timer—which does affect the deaths of certain family members!\n\nOverall, I was fairly surprised by this game. The AI for the family member escorts is rather primitive, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it immensely. Better than any recent indie horror game and certainly one of the only games to use random generation in a meaningful and non-lazy way.

I've found it really fun, but not for the reasons I expected. It doesn't feel so much like a horror game as much as an action adventure with horror trimmings. It has the spooky atmosphere but for the most part I've been lost in the surprising fast-paced and solid combat more than anything.\n\nThe graphics, although not pretty, are solid and passable save for the annoying film grain filter that obscures anything with a low light source.\n\nThe most interesting aspect, however, is definitely the alleged randomization of the items, enemy spawns, and (possibly?) objectives? That is definitely something I've never seen in a horror game before, and surprisingly it has a lot of potential.\n\nAll in all a fun game, though not entirely scary. If you'd like, you can join me as I further venture into this little gem here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VviDXOTtSKY","May 2","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It runs really well on all PC's since its an old game, but never judge a book by its cover. Even though its quite old, it still doesnt fail to give scary jumpscares with tense moments. I myself am not a very easily scared person but the game still managed to accompish its goal.\n\nThe graphics seem simple, but for me thats what makes the game beautiful. It gives me, and (potentially) you a classic sort of old horror movie. The black and white ones where the television had just started to come out.\n\nUnlike other horror games, Nosferatu gives you the ability to fight off the devils and monsters. There is a variety of weapons, each with very different purposes.\n\nI got the game for free, and spent about 2 hours on it which is a rare thing for me to do so on a single-player game.\nThis game is so unpredicted that the cheesy graphics and the buggy animations and bots might even amuse you instead of giving you a scare!","March 27, 2015","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

It's definitely got a Murnau and Herzog feel to it and it's helped along by a fittingly beautiful albeit very eerie, orchestral score.\n\nThe graphics are a bit outdated but you soon forget about that because of the excellent gameplay. At times though, it has to be said that the lighting is quite beautiful.\n\nIt has made me jump at least twice so far and I haven't rescued anyone yet.

I can't quite put my finger on what it is but you might see what I mean if you play it.\n\nAnd it's not without a few laughs, too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsdarion/recommended/283290/","itsdarion","It's Darion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsdarion/","146 products in account","Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a blast from the past.\nStarting as an FPS from 2003, It's been released on Steam for all to enjoy. And boy, did I enjoy it.\n\nStarting out at the entrance of a creepy mansion, our protagonist, James Patterson, is on a quest to save his beloved family. Sounds like the beginning of a classic horror movie, right? Well, that's pretty much what you'll get while playing this gem. The game is very immersive with sounds, music, and even the classic movie scratch overlay. I was constantly on the edge of my seat, and couldn't walk into a room, without fear of what was on the other side of the door. That's what a horror game is intended to do, and this one delivers. Let's talk about pros, and cons.\n\nPros-\nGreat detail, even for an older game- The shadows move ominously, and the darkness reaches around the walls, like in real life. I also loved the constant changing of the rooms, which made the game all the more interesting.\n\nImmersion- Everything from the small chants when you use the Crucifix, to the doors shutting behind you, really set the mood for this creepy game. The monsters, especially Shadow Vampires, are just amazingly eerie, as well.\n\nIntent- The intent of this game, to me, is scary, with an entertainment factor. I was creeped out within the first 5 minutes of the game, and that feeling didn't leave me, until I actually beat it. I liked being kept on edge, while still being able to have fun.\n\nCons-\n\nSlightly buggy- While this didn't distract much from enjoying the game, it can still get in the way from time to time. There were points in the game, where I'd randomly die, for no reason(Happened, maybe 3 times). Make sure to save often! The doors can kill, or damage you, while opening at times. The Flintlock will randomly lose one of it's chambered rounds, which is a slight ♥♥♥ pain. Especially if you need to shoot something right away. The stakes won't auto-switch, if you use one. You'll have to manually pull out another one, if you want to use it again. Sometimes the family members will fall off stairs, and die. So make sure you walk slowly down them, and try to stay on the walls. The melee combat can be a little clunky, and sometimes the hit boxes will cause you to miss.\n\nIn all honesty, Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a great classic game. I'm looking forward to collecting all the trading cards, and beating the game on the other 2 difficulties. Maybe they'll add achievements in the future, to increase the play value. My final review for the game:\n\nReplay value: 3/5 - The most you'll do, is beat it on the 3 difficulty levels.\n\nScore: 8/10 - Like I mentioned earlier, the game is 2spooky5me, and the cons don't really distract from the game-play. Highly reccomended. Plus, this is probably the first time I stuck my wood in a sleeping girl, and she didn't call the cops.","June 29, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has chilling atmosphere and music, neat-o enemies that abide by the usual vampire rules, and plenty of ghoul killing weapons. The main goal of the game is to rescue your family, who, along with items, are randomized, so replay is a plenty. It is a bit buggy but not annoyingly so.

I didn´t buy it and wouldn´t buy, but I downloaded it and don´t regret it. Great controls, good graphics and ambience. If you like the atmosphera of Castlevania, the Metroidvania like castles and survival horrors, you should play this.\nThe trailer is crap compared to the gameplay.\n\n\n\nLong review\nIts a good game! It doesn`t look like its from 2003 and maybe 10$ is too much, but I got the key for free and I didn´t expect too much but its really good actually.\nIts a first person shooter with dark ambience, you start and the entrance of the castle, is on his way to his sister's wedding. But when he arrives at the castle, something seems wrong. He discovers that his future brother-in-law is a vampire, who has taken his family members in custody. The first thing you find is a sword and a crucifix I think  (made me rememeber of castlevania) and so you try to enter the castle. There are three ways to enter and you can only enter one at first and you got to find the keys. The first thing it happens its that a monk fall from the windows from freakin second floor, and tells you what I just did. You proceed and find more weapons and enemies, inside the castle is like Metroid, a little confusing since there is no map but very well done. You keep finding the people and scorting to safe and they give you something. The bots are dumb? The allies surprisingly are NOT DUMB, they follow you very quickly and some of them help you atack the enemies, there is even a dog named Buster, sadly he is a little dumb. The cutscenes are well done and the graphics make you enter in character. But after playing like one hour, the middle levels glitch a lot (maybe it was because I scorted 4 people at once) had to save and load a lot of times.","August 26, 2015","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Pattersons, a poor but proud aristocratic family of the British nobility, and some of their closest friends, arrive at the castle Malachi residence of a wealthy Romanian Count."\n\nGame has bugs hindering progress if you don´t manually save before boss fights and due to it not working with steam you gotta start it through the main game folder making me not able to have steam overlay. For some it´s physx, some steam overlay, in general I think it´s just the way steam tries to start the game. Somehow.. somehwat. But if you can get it running and wondering where dahell the graphics options are... there are graphics settings on the start.exe not directly the nosferatu.exe in the main directory. It doesn´t support 16:9 and has a fix here for it:\n\nhttp://www.wsgf.org/dr/nosferatu-wrath-malachi/en\n\nBut be aware that anything above 1920x1080p makes the HUD and UI unreadable. 2hrs into the game I had a bossfight bug and due to me not having any manual saves and only quicksaves I was only able to replay all of it which I didn´t want to due to the game being too repetitive and tedious after some time. Let me explain further: The game mostly has levels and corridors which need keys to be able to progress thus making backtracking necessary most of the time and due to respawning enemies the fantastic creepy atmopshere gets lost quite quickly. It also makes you backtrack even more by rescuing your relatives and bringing them back to the main entrance where some can give you special help such as treating your wounds/healing. The difficulty is quite high but the fights can be very sloppy and unfair due to awkward running animations and such. Combat flow is nice though. I recommend it for anyone not bothered by backtracking or meaningless people rescuing objectives as the boss fights and enemy fights are quite fun and the atmophere is just fantastic.","December 23, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Using an HD6670 I got 700+ fps.\n\nAbout the bugs/pros:\n\n-AI is fairly stupid, especially your friends. After a battle or jumping down a short height they sometimes don't follow you or just disappear. It sucks having to battle your way through a castle with your grandpa in tow just to find out he's all the way back inside where you fired your first shot. Two of them disappeared when I went back for them. The dog reappeared at the kennel but shortly after it tells me the other guy died.\n\n-Reloading and choosing guns is an issue. 2 of your strongest weapons are the flintlock pistol and musket. They both carry only a single shot (as they should), but you can reload while there's still a shot in your gun, meaning you can lose ammo indefinitely (reloading makes you lose all ammo in the clip for guns, such as the machine gun and revolver. Flintlocks included.) Also sometimes when switching weapons using the scroll wheel and mouse button, the gun fires. Sometimes when I reload my pistol then my musket the pistol's bullet disappears.\n\n-AI is glitchy. Sometimes the enemy's head appears through the wall scaring the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. Every now and then they can hit you through walls and doors. While they spawn from portals they can't be hit or killed until their animation finishes. Sometimes they can't even hit you while you move although they're centimeters from your face..\n\n-No radar or map to tell you where to go (although the objectives are in constant places).\n\n-Going down stairs or ramps makes you lose control and can sometimes make you fall to your death since most boss battles are on rooftops.\n\n-Doesn't tell you about the weapons in the beginning you have to take from your case\nI actually died one time going through the game trying to kill men with guns with my fists.\n\n-Time limit of 1.5-2 hours\n\n-No resolution options (No options at all, basically).\n\n+ Save feature with 9 slots\n\n+ Randomly generated to some extent\n\n+ Many weapons all with their own uses on certain enemies\n\n+ Never lags. You could possibly play this on intel atom (actually, maybe not).\n\n+ Fairly unique in it's own way\n\n+ Animations fairly good for its time as well\n\nWould love to see this as a remake with a lot less bugs, better graphics and possibly multiplayer.","June 2, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A couple of the reviews I looked at early on made comparison with Clive Barker's Undying, and the comparisons are indeed quite valid...having said that, it has an atmosphere all of its own, and hands-down one of the scariest soundtracks (music AND effects) in all of video game history!\n\nSure, as the game advances those suspenseful aural cues just make things decidedly "easier" as opposed to "scarier", but the game doesn't overstay its welcome length-wise and can, for the record, be played rather quickly if one chooses to ignore the numerous (and after a while, quite obvious) "side-paths" which serve little purpose other than to give over-cautious players the chance to comfortably stock up on ammo and healing 'til said goodies are pouring out of their EARS (all of the other weapons eventually being rendered more-or-less obsolete by the supremely ♥♥♥-kicking Chalice and its uber-powerful Holy Water, in any case).\n\nOh, and you can also knock yourself out trying to save all your relatives and friends who've been imprisoned by the evil beasties, but this is neither essential nor, with the possible exception of the doctor (who kindly restores you to full health every time you visit him), particularly beneficial.  In short, once you suss out how things "work", you can pretty much play the game at your own pace...good news for both the slow-churners AND speed-runners out there, I'm sure.\n\nIn short...something for everyone!  Well, maybe not absolutely everyone, but I could certainly imagine this game being worth a shot for the vast majority of first-person and/or horror fans out there, which I think covers just about everyone who's liable to read this review, or anyone who even has a Steam account, full-stop, end-of-♥♥♥♥in'-story.  Don't expect the most revelatory gaming experience of your life, just a super-solid diversion from the far greater horrors of normal, everyday existence, and chances are you'll be pleased.

WoM was released in 2003, so it obviously shows it's age in it's graphics but contains excellent ideas implemented very well for that era of gaming. The AI is aggressive, doesn't hold your hand at all when it comes to enemies, and is smart enough for your family memebers to stay out of your way when you're being attacked, or help you if they can.\n\nYou will die, probably several times, but it will always be your fault, which is actually really refreshing. In these days of cover shooters and regenerating health, your ability to screw yourself into a corner by needlessly engaging with multiple enemies instead of carefully taking one or two at a time is a nice nostalgic touch which meshes very well with the overall story and aesthetic, as you are supposed to be just a man, confronting horrible unholy abominations in an effort to rescue your family.\n\nThe random element is a great touch, meaning you can find family memebers in different places every time you play. The clock counting down to sunrise adds to the pressure and stress you feel as you come across room after room with no one in it. You might almost catch yourself yelling for Melissa or Gregory, or finding yourself a little sad when you fail to save one of them in time.\n\nThe weapons are nicely varied. Your fists are your default, allowing you to smash face on little goblins and even stunlock early vampire enemies. Stakes are both weapon and utility, allowing you to stake sleeping vampires if you're quick enough, or being lit on fire to provide a portable light source in super dark areas. The guns are by no means overpowered, given the Flintlock's long reload time and the Revolver's 5 shot cyclinder. The cross is a highly unique weapon, as it can cower low level enemies but not harm them, be charged up and released to provide a bright, brief flash of light to help guide you through a room, and is the ONLY weapon which can destroy Shadow vampires.\n\nSome AMAZING sound design rounds out this old beauty. I would seriously recommend turning off the lights and playing with a decent set of headphones, but even on older tv speakers 6 feet away from me, the sounds and ambeint music are very very well done. Creepy noises, creaking doors, moaning ghouls, growling devildogs, all coupled with an ambient music score which was crafted by someone with an obvious love for old horror cinema.\n\nI definately recommend giving this game multiple playthroughs, but even once is enough to put this one in my favorites list.\n\nCheers.","December 6, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Picking it up on sale recently Ive just played it through in a couple of sittings, and found it to be quite well designed.\n\nWhat caused me to bounce off it initially (and almost again this time round?). Crazy difficulty curve where you get punished for not knowing how to play, like not staking vampires in coffins immediately, not knowing about the save/load options, not knowing you need to *move* as your relatives will die at fixed game times if you havent rescued them by then. My advice: just keep playing, die/lose a few times (quickly), persevere.\n\nWhat do I like having played it through (on easy!). Random levels and enemy placement, tension of wanting to move slowly as the game seeks to scare, with needing to move quickly to save relatives. Tension caused by enemies slowly respawning randomly with limited ammunition.\n\nDo I want to play it through again? Not really, but I did enjoy it and I would recommend picking it up on the cheap.\n\nPS: Ive played this game for about 2 hours - but I was running it outside of steam so I could get some decent graphics options.","December 25, 2014","true","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The escorts can be tedious, but they give great rewards with better weapons to make the game easier.

However, I have to reserve any positive review because this game is being sold deceptively for Windows 10 computers. It requires some pretty heavy work under the hood before you can get this game to run well or even be playable on Windows 10.\n\nWARNINGS FOR INTERESTED WINDOWS 10 USERSThis game is designed pretty much solely for 4:3 aspect ratio, and scaling for widescreen seems nonexistent\nThis game cannot be run from the Steam library, you will CTD when trying to boot the game from Steam\nThis game has no native fullscreen support for Win10, the game will only run in a window with important areas of the game window (health/ammo) out-of-frame\nThis game has an unavoidable game-breaking bug related to item 3 on my list. A dialogue window appears, and the button to close the dialogue is out of the frame. There are no keyboard shortcuts to close the dialogue window, and you must force-close the game. This makes the game unplayable past the first 2 minutes of gameplay.\nTo conclude, there is really nothing I'd like more than to review the actual game itself, but until there's an offcial workaround released, this game is being sold deceptively to Windows 10 users, with no warning on the Steam store page like other older games with this issue, and no update.","March 2","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Yes, i don't understand how this thing keeps being called great, awesome, cool, with great storyline, great graphics. etc. And no, i don't get it how this horrible abomination of a video game even has what, 4 stars out of 5? It's a great mystery to me.\nFirst of all, i'm no way into bashing old games for being... you know, old. I'm an old fan(g) myself.  I play a lot of old games. For example, i just re-played Clive Barker's Undying for like... 10th time because of nostalgia. I keep returning to Undying because it offers a unique and interesting gameplay, different ways of approaching it, something new every time. One of these games that you can replay over and over again and everytime you would discover something new, something you haven't noticed before. Creative stuff that used to prevail in old games, you know, some really creative interesting ideas. And it's even older than this one. But i know for sure, i won't be returning to Nosferatu, no way.\nSo i was looking forward to a game to satisfy my strong urge to play a good old school shooter. And i saw this, i saw all the good reviews and i thought: "Hell, how could i even miss it back in years?!". Now that i've seen what it was that i thought i missed... Oh boy, was i thankful i did. So, what do i start with. Boy, oh boy, the choice is wide. First of all, the very first thing i didn't like was the menu. It's simply uncomfortable. Pressing "ESC" doesn't return you back to game or a previous part of the menu. That's uncomfortable. No video settings? You gotta be kidding me. Control settings? Please, there's almost nothing to customize. For some reason, you can run and jump, but you can't crouch. Dafuq, really?\nCombat system, absolute joke, from the start we have a sword cane that just looks like a simple medieval sword. I have no idea where they saw a sword cane here. Movements are clumsy, they stutter. There are only 2 "types" of attack with that "sword cane" and they stutter as hell and look very poorly animated. Mechanics... I don't get it. The protagonist can run like a cheetah for a few seconds but unable to perform anything but two pathetic looking sword moves? Dafuq? You see, do you already see that thin line that's been broken, right? A protagonist that can on one side do something... extraordinary where most people would suck a huge dog's ♥♥♥♥ but on the other hand can't do something simple? Nah, i'm not buying it. Then, when (IF) you get a first firing weapon... Yes, in this game you don't just simply find new weapons, you gotta work ridiculously hard to earn'em, which is not a compliment in that case. Even on Medium! The firing and reloading animations are horrible. They're just horrible, hands down. They lack. The game is so bugged, half the time bullets don't even hit the target unless you manage to make a straight line of a couple of meters between you and an enemy, they stuck at doorways; stuck at furniture; plus there is no areal damage. Doesn't matter where you aim-to the head or leg, you'll get the same result. There's no aiming (ironsights) btw and mostly no alternative attacks, so yeah, your right mouse button is pretty much useless most of the time, animation is very broken and again, it "stutters", literally. Comparing to Clive Barker's Undying, this game simply seems poorly made in general.\nEnemies. Mostly the same all the time, appear randomly. Ugly, bugged, move and attack too "sharply", too "fast" in terms of movements, there's no smoothness. Environment? Now i have no idea whose idea it was to make the castle somewhat random all the time, but it doesn't help at all. If it was supposed to make the gameplay somewhat new with every new game, this idea has failed hard. It pisses off much more than keeps you interested or entertained because with every new game there's just more randomness, annoying backtracking and mess in general cause you simply don't understand where to go and what to do since there's no map or hints of any kind. AI is horrible. I spent good 15 minutes trying to escort some old nag down the stairs cause the damn thing literally kept stopping at every corner saying the same damn thing.\nDon't get me wrong, i absolutely LOVE old atmospheric games like Call of Cthulhu, Clive Barker's Undying, Cold Fear, Quake, Scratches, Penumbra, Dementium II, Gorky 17 etc, i freaking love them, the unique atmosphere they provide. I love all these old places, survival aspect etc, but this game is just broken beyond repair, it's terrible. It looks terrible and it plays terrible. One of those rare cases when a video game just plain straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\nI could keep on and on forever mentioning other broken aspects like an absolutely useless ability to pick up health packs even at full health, therefore wasting them - Dafuq?; the fact that they are all different sizes and there's absolutely no way to tell which will it be: small one, medium one or large one until you actually pick up one and see how much health it restores - Dafuq?!; or compass being useless in constantly changing environment; the timer that keeps ticking, oh the timer! If you didn't know, there are several family members that are being kept as hostages in an old mansion and if you don't save good half of them in like an hour and a half of REAL TIME the game ends. I read it on Wiki, since i was too sick of this game to actually test it out myself. Yeah, just like that, apparently it's called a storyline here. Needless to say how much this approach to a gameplay encourages players to explore the place rather than just run like crazy through the levels... Oh wait, that's what you gonna be doing;  or the ability to reload your weapon even if it doesn't need reloading - DAFUQ?!?! No, really, even if your weapon is loaded, you can still reload it, therefore wasting ammo, i'm not joking... And the list keeps on going.\nSo, if you are feeling nostalgic, like i was, try Clive Barker's Undying or AvP 1999 for that instance, they are so much better than this broken crap. 3\10 at best IMO. I fail to see what all the good reviews are about, people will just buy anything these days.\nP.S. Oh, i remembered why i gave up on this game. Last time i tried to enjoy it, i got killed by an opening door. The horror, indeed.\nP.S.S. Steam says i can't post a review until i spend 5 minutes in a reviewed game. Well, good, tell me how am i supposed to spend 5 minutes in a game that won't start from a library? I have to start it from an exe. file from a  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ folder. Do i have to launch it and watch it crash for 5 minutes? The horror, the horror!!! C'mon man, DAFUQ?!","February 11","false","0.1"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","13"

Obviously terrible graphics which is to be expected, but then no resolution options besides a hack you need to install online. No saves whatsoever as you have to remember to quicksave or all progress is lost. There is no story, you just wander around a castle and try to find your family. There is no map and no indication for where people are, you just pick one of the 5 ways to go and then backtrack and go the other way till you find them. There are many gameplay problems. You pick up health even when you cant use it and it makes it wasted. You also can pick up ammo, even if you cant use it, again wasting it. You can only carry 15 bullets for your pistol which makes no sense. The combat is just terrible. You use your fists or a sword and just mash attack and sometimes it hits them and sometimes it doesn't due to the poor hitboxes. Sometimes while you're hitting you they can suddenly also attack you and sometimes that can't, showing the lack of any consistency in the system. And since each hit does like 20 damage and you will be fighting 2-3 guys in a row its just stupid. There are spawners that just keep popping out guys and the only way to destroy them is attack the portal, but you have to kill the guys or you die, but they keep coming. Its annoying and poorly done. Also the guys take 20 hits which makes combat tedious and long without reward. I get it that the game is trying to be survival horror, but I have played games that actually accomplish it and they don't need to make terrible combat and way too strong enemies and a lack of being able to hold ammo and wasting resources. You die so quickly and easily, but since you can't sneak or avoid people..... you just die, hope you saved, reload, and repeat. Apparently weapons can randomly be in spots so just based on luck you can have guns sooner or not, which is dumb. Also I was playing on medium, not even hard. I don't know if it's just for nostalgia's sake people rate this because they have fond memories from childhood, but like many old games there are dumb and poorly implemented and outdated mechanics. You also find a bunch of gunpowder and bullets but you can't do anything with them at that point of the game. Not to mention your family can die and you lose the game and there is nothing you can do but restart the game completely since you can't beat it. Having the built-in timer is annoying and further ruins the game because instead of being able to play the survival horror at your own pace, you have to run quickly or you lose. Always having to hurry and pay attention to the timer ruins the atmosphere.  3/10","December 27, 2014","false","9.7"," 25 of 56 people (45%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","45","25","56","5","6"

Every playthrough the castle is randomly generated, but I didn't play more than once so can't say how different it is, also the items in the chests are random. The relatives often get stuck by door or they fall to death from stairs and sometimes they even disappear, if they get attacked by monsters you need to be really careful when attacking because they get easily killed by you're weapons.\nLevel design is bad, why bedroom would have door to some long empty corridor? But because it's randomly generated by computer then I understand. Often the enemies also get stuck in the wall or they just stand there motionless, also they will respawn but it seems random who respawn and who not.\n\nGraphics for it's time are bad, other games which came on the same year looks much better, although it's made by some indy group, so it's ok. If you want to change graphic settings you need to do it through launcher and it will reset them every time you quit the game, also you can't play through steam if you want better graphic settings.\n\nThe game is very short only around 2h, but it's actually a good thing because I wouldn't like to play it any longer.\n\nI'm friend of older 90-00 games but this one I can't reccomend, it's just too buggy, badly designed and has boring story.","September 10, 2015","false","2.8"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

It is very unique in the game design, the level design is very good, and the randomization of the castle means that the locations vary and never are in the same place twice when you die.\n\nThe story is pretty bland, you inherit a castle, you arrive a bit later than you're family, then when you arrive to the castle you suddenly find out that you're family is missing and you need to search round the castle to find them and not let them die, pretty boring stuff and it feels the same as any old horror movie\n\nThe game design is pretty good, the atmosphere is really creepy and well thought out, with the design of the monsters and creatures and the sound effects that play all around you. Although the combat is weak and the hit detection seems a bit off, it is still fun to play\n\nThe level design is pretty good as well however when you die, you might see a lot of the same rooms over and over again due to the randomization of the castle, that also counts for the monsters too, you will see the monsters over and over again, although the game does randomize, it is pretty repetitive\n\nThe level of difficulty is alright, challenging but fun to play and scary, however when you die, there are no checkpoints (you have to save regularly to continue from where you left off) and you lose everything and have to start all over from the beginning\n\nHowever this game is fun especially with the lights off, headphones and a couple of buddies around you, this is a great horror game. It is pretty much a hide and seek game with a few enemies here and there, but it is worth it especially during Halloween!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is pretty old and it might not run well on modern day computers, I hardly experienced any crashes or compatibility issues, the only issue I encountered with was the resolution options, and the cutscenes may look a tad ugly on modern day monitors, be warned before buying/playing this game!\nRECOMMENDED :)","December 20, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very unique in the game design, the level design is very good, and the randomization of the castle means that the locations vary and never are in the same place twice when you die.\n\nThe story is pretty bland, you inherit a castle, you arrive a bit later than you're family, then when you arrive to the castle you suddenly find out that you're family is missing and you need to search round the castle to find them and not let them die, pretty boring stuff and it feels the same as any old horror movie\n\nThe game design is pretty good, the atmosphere is really creepy and well thought out, with the design of the monsters and creatures and the sound effects that play all around you. Although the combat is weak and the hit detection seems a bit off, it is still fun to play\n\nThe level design is pretty good as well however when you die, you might see a lot of the same rooms over and over again due to the randomization of the castle, that also counts for the monsters too, you will see the monsters over and over again, although the game does randomize, it is pretty repetitive\n\nThe level of difficulty is alright, challenging but fun to play and scary, however when you die, there are no checkpoints (you have to save regularly to continue from where you left off) and you lose everything and have to start all over from the beginning\n\nHowever this game is fun especially with the lights off, headphones and a couple of buddies around you, this is a great horror game. It is pretty much a hide and seek game with a few enemies here and there, but it is worth it especially during Halloween!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is pretty old and it might not run well on modern day computers, I hardly experienced any crashes or compatibility issues, the only issue I encountered with was the resolution options, and the cutscenes may look a tad ugly on modern day monitors, be warned before buying/playing this game!\nRECOMMENDED :)","December 20, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(The sale ends in a about 14 hours so if you want it grab it now.)  That being said I'm not sure I'd spend full price on it.  It's not a pretty game, it was released in 2003 and the years have not been kind.  But the game play is enjoyable.  A pervading creepy atmosphere and scare resources make combat tense and the tension is further ramped up by the fact your ability to save your family members is based on how fast you can find them (take to long and they start meeting grisly demises.)  Randomization goes a long way towards making replaying it attractive and I like how despite what seems like a limited arsenal the rock paper scissors of lining up what weapons work best against which enemy types as well as the multiple uses of some items like the cross add a level of strategy that keep it from being just another bland first person shooter.\n\nHeck, spend full price on it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/283290/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Although obviously the older title, Wrath of Malachi comes off to me as "Depths of Fear with Vampires." That is to say, an indie horror-ish game with proceedurally generated levels, an actual story and endgame (in stark contrast to the endless parade of Slender clones and 'find the exit and get jumpscared' shovelware that makes up most proceedurally generated horror titles), slightly wonky physics, and lots of bugs.\n\nThere's not much to say beyond that with this one, as Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a very, very basic game with a very, very basic story. You play James Patterson, a very British man with a very British family of wealthy aristocrats who travel to a remote Romanian castle to see your sister wed to an enigmatic count. Said count turns out to be - to the surprise of no one who read that last sentence - a vampire, who intends to sacrifice your sister and the rest of your family in order to unleash the eponymous Malachi, who is in essence the vampire god and is sealed beneath the castle.\n\nYou arrive a day later than everyone else, and realize almost immediately (mostly because the narrator outright tells you) that something is seriously wrong. This is confirmed when your family's priest is thrown out a nearby window, at which point he quickly exposits to you the entire plot of the game (namely explore the castle and rescue your family) and if you could also find the family doctor before he bleeds out in the next half hour that would be swell.\n\nFrom thereon the game is pretty straight forward: wander the castle, fighting jumpscare-enthusiast monsters in roughly every room, find family members and escort them back to the entrance so they can open up their luggage and give you some new gear (or just some ammunition or a unique single-use buff if they're jerks), rinse repeat. There are three wings to the castle, each with a boss or two intent on sacrificing one of your family members to Malachi.\n\nHowever, said bosses are ♥♥♥♥-easy if you saved the priest. Or his acolyte. Or your brother. Or your lawyer. Because any of them allow access to the Ancient Grail, which is the most broken weapon in the game by far. It deals massive damage to any supernatural target besides the Count (INCLUDING the vampire god final boss!), killing even the toughest targets in two or three splashes. The only non-boss enemies immune to the grail are dogs and gypsies, the two weakest enemy types in the game. It attempts to balance out by only holding five splashes worth of holy water, but given that you can bless any source of water in the game with your crucifix, it becomes the only ranged weapon in the game with infinitely renewable ammo.\n\nThe game has a few growing pains in the beginning between the rushed exposition of the opening which makes you figure out the mechanics on the fly, but once you get into the swing of things it becomes a fairly enjoyable experience, and an absolute breeze when you get your grandfather's machine gun two thirds of the way through. It's also not without its bugs, including fairly awful physics that can lead to you randomly bouncing off of any slope you walk over and the occasional random death caused by some sort of glitch when stepping through a doorway, but it's playable enough if you can work past those issues.\n\nAll in all I found it quite a bit of fun, nothing spectacular but I bought it with the loose change in my Steam wallet for like a buck, so I'm not exactly demanding a game changer. Maybe wait until it's on sale but it's plenty worth the cost of a soda to keep you entertained for a few hours.","November 1, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Picked it up for under a dollar and I would have honestly paid full price for it. It feels like old school Doom mixed with Van Helsing.\n\nFirst things first, it looks like crap. If you can look past the dated visuals there is a unique level of detail and lore in this game. Second, the controls are dated as well. This is most notable when trying to go down a flight of stairs. Now, why would I recommend a game with dated visuals and controls? Because this game makes up for it with atmosphere and intrigue. I mentioned Doom and I'll also mention the Painkiller games in terms of similarities.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple. Go into a haunted castle to rescue your family. Each family member will give you unique items after you save them. A few of the family members will die if you take too long though, so there is a level of urgency built into the game. It’s also pretty short. I blew through it on normal in about five hours. Granted, I had to restart a couple of times once I figured out how the time mechanics worked. Also, a significant portion of the castle is procedurally generated. All of the big important fights and family members that you rescue are always in the same location, but the majority of the enemies, consumables, and relatives that you rescue have random spawn zones which keep things from getting boring. Overall its a fun old-school vampire horror game.","November 1, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But set at 1920x1080 with the small widescreen mod you can download and it dosen't look so bad.\nThe controls are your standed FPS layout and for the most part feel fairly solid.\nThe bad stuff in this game comes out when you have to start escorting your family members back to the start of the game. The game has a fast pace to it so it's not really a choir but the AI pathfinding here is terrible. I've had them commit suicide, get stuck, jump to place's they shouldn't be and down right act crazy.\nThe shooting can also be glitchful at times. Sometime's I'd shoot an enemy square in the face and it won't detect it.\n\nThe fun here comes from being under pressure from both the time limit and the tense atmosphere. Moving at a fast pace with an array of weapons which will run out of ammo fairly fast can be exciting.\n\nThe game is very short too. Steam say's I've played it for 3 hours, in that time I'd rescued all my family and killed the last boss, bare that in mind.\nI would say only buy this at a cheap price (I got it for £1.49) and install the widescreen mod.","January 21, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/basil698/recommended/283290/","basil698","Uncle Basil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/basil698/","43 products in account","A very atmospheric, but unpolished game.\n\nWhile it lacks when it comes to graphic fidelity, it has a solid gameplay. The AI characters and items are partially randomized, which keeps the game a bit more fresh and makes a player be wary of surroundings.\nBoth enemy and friendly NPCs happen to have issues with pathfinding, which can sometimes be extremely annoying. The platforming elements have problems too, especially given the weird gravity of the game and the tendency of getting stuck on objects.\nThe game has a nice variety of both enemies and weapons, introducing some original mechanics, which I won't spoil. The user interface adds to the atmosphere of the game. The environments themselves are somewhat repetitive, which, combined with maze-like levels, can make a player get lost easily.\nWhen it comes to the horror elements, they're not on Amnesia/Outlast/Alien: Isolation level, but they work nevertheless, more so at the beggining of the game. While the music is good and helps to build the tension for most of the time, it sometimes gets cut unexpectedly.\nThe experience lasts for around 5-6 hours (I'm pretty sure I checked every possible room, killed every enemy), depending on your pace, but keep in mind that the game has time-limited objectives, which make you want to be fast on your feet. I played it on normal difficulty, which made the game pretty hard at the beginning, but easy towards the end; for a more horror-like experience I would play on nightmare settings.\n\nIn my opinion the game is most similiar (while being somewhat inferior) to Clive Barker's Undying and has a similiar vibe of an oldschool shooter. I would not recommend it to people who hate backtracking and having to navigate maze-like environments without a map. On the other hand, fans of classic shooters should enjoy it if they can overlook some of the flaws.Worth buying when on sale, but for the full price I would only recommend it for fans of games like Undying.","February 9","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Picked it up for under a dollar and I would have honestly paid full price for it. It feels like old school Doom mixed with Van Helsing.\n\nFirst things first, it looks like crap. If you can look past the dated visuals there is a unique level of detail and lore in this game. Second, the controls are dated as well. This is most notable when trying to go down a flight of stairs. Now, why would I recommend a game with dated visuals and controls? Because this game makes up for it with atmosphere and intrigue. I mentioned Doom and I'll also mention the Painkiller games in terms of similarities.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple. Go into a haunted castle to rescue your family. Each family member will give you unique items after you save them. A few of the family members will die if you take too long though, so there is a level of urgency built into the game. It’s also pretty short. I blew through it on normal in about five hours. Granted, I had to restart a couple of times once I figured out how the time mechanics worked. Also, a significant portion of the castle is procedurally generated. All of the big important fights and family members that you rescue are always in the same location, but the majority of the enemies, consumables, and relatives that you rescue have random spawn zones which keep things from getting boring. Overall its a fun old-school vampire horror game.","November 1, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/283290/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Although obviously the older title, Wrath of Malachi comes off to me as "Depths of Fear with Vampires." That is to say, an indie horror-ish game with proceedurally generated levels, an actual story and endgame (in stark contrast to the endless parade of Slender clones and 'find the exit and get jumpscared' shovelware that makes up most proceedurally generated horror titles), slightly wonky physics, and lots of bugs.\n\nThere's not much to say beyond that with this one, as Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a very, very basic game with a very, very basic story. You play James Patterson, a very British man with a very British family of wealthy aristocrats who travel to a remote Romanian castle to see your sister wed to an enigmatic count. Said count turns out to be - to the surprise of no one who read that last sentence - a vampire, who intends to sacrifice your sister and the rest of your family in order to unleash the eponymous Malachi, who is in essence the vampire god and is sealed beneath the castle.\n\nYou arrive a day later than everyone else, and realize almost immediately (mostly because the narrator outright tells you) that something is seriously wrong. This is confirmed when your family's priest is thrown out a nearby window, at which point he quickly exposits to you the entire plot of the game (namely explore the castle and rescue your family) and if you could also find the family doctor before he bleeds out in the next half hour that would be swell.\n\nFrom thereon the game is pretty straight forward: wander the castle, fighting jumpscare-enthusiast monsters in roughly every room, find family members and escort them back to the entrance so they can open up their luggage and give you some new gear (or just some ammunition or a unique single-use buff if they're jerks), rinse repeat. There are three wings to the castle, each with a boss or two intent on sacrificing one of your family members to Malachi.\n\nHowever, said bosses are ♥♥♥♥-easy if you saved the priest. Or his acolyte. Or your brother. Or your lawyer. Because any of them allow access to the Ancient Grail, which is the most broken weapon in the game by far. It deals massive damage to any supernatural target besides the Count (INCLUDING the vampire god final boss!), killing even the toughest targets in two or three splashes. The only non-boss enemies immune to the grail are dogs and gypsies, the two weakest enemy types in the game. It attempts to balance out by only holding five splashes worth of holy water, but given that you can bless any source of water in the game with your crucifix, it becomes the only ranged weapon in the game with infinitely renewable ammo.\n\nThe game has a few growing pains in the beginning between the rushed exposition of the opening which makes you figure out the mechanics on the fly, but once you get into the swing of things it becomes a fairly enjoyable experience, and an absolute breeze when you get your grandfather's machine gun two thirds of the way through. It's also not without its bugs, including fairly awful physics that can lead to you randomly bouncing off of any slope you walk over and the occasional random death caused by some sort of glitch when stepping through a doorway, but it's playable enough if you can work past those issues.\n\nAll in all I found it quite a bit of fun, nothing spectacular but I bought it with the loose change in my Steam wallet for like a buck, so I'm not exactly demanding a game changer. Maybe wait until it's on sale but it's plenty worth the cost of a soda to keep you entertained for a few hours.","November 1, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/283290/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is the standout 2003 title from Idol FX, a long-defunct Swedish studio responsible for Drake of the 99 Dragons and so obscure that Wikipedia doesn't have a page on them.\n\nBring out your garlic and stakes, because we're going on an oldschool vampire hunt.\n\nNosferatu is a fast-paced action horror where you explore a series of procedurally generated castle wings under a strict time limit, with the goal being to rescue your family and friends from a malevolent Count. Every inch of the setting is drapped in early 1900's gothic horror imagery, thick stone and rickety supports hosting the bloodbath under a early film filter complete with dialogue cards. It's a premise that is far more novel than it should be, and it makes the game vastly more entertaining.\n\nDespite being sold as a horror game, the enemies don't pose much real threat to you and you'll be mowing them down in droves. For all the vampire-slaying weaponry in this game, your best weapons are your fists and a cup of water.\n\nAs you explore to the tune of glorious violin scare-chords working in unison to become a soundtrack, you're given 15-25 minutes to rescue all the family members in a particular area and escort them to a "safe zone" located in the main courtyard.\n\nThis is where the game's problems start coming into play. The escort AI is incredibly stupid - their greatest nemesis being stairs. From t-posing to changing elevations to cartwheeling in midair while attempting to navigate them, I had to reload a save multiple times from escorts deciding that gravity is a myth and it's time to take a leap of faith.\n\nIt runs well, but there's no resolution options. In fact there's no options of any sort. This game has not been updated for modern systems in the least and the options are as barebones as the procedural generation.\n\nProcedural generation that doesn't add an ounce of anything to the game. While it may have been beyond its time, the core game is bereft of replay value and all it changes is whether or not you'll get shafted by family members being hidden in the last possible place to look. It offers nothing over actual designed levels, the actual generated rooms means you'll be seeing the same handful of rooms a bunch of times.\n\nThreadbare design permeates the game. The hyperfast pacing doesn't seem intentional so much as it does a result of poor balancing and easy enemies. There's few weapons, few enemies, few rooms, a small amount of bosses and it reeks of relying on some technical aspects that look good on a box over a game that seeks to entertain in every aspect.\n\nUltimately, Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a fun game. Being the Fist of the North Scare is genuinely entertaining and despite the drawbacks it's worth your time. But it's not worth your money if you're after dollar to hour value, you'll blast through this once and never play it again.\n\nI can't complain too much about dollar value, I got it for free. I recommend this game, reader beware.","September 16, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If someone would be willing to polish it and remake it to today's standards, I am fairly certain it would be a successful game. This review is purely from my first experience of the game, so I might update it later in the future after playing a bit more.\n\nThe rough story of the game is that you've been invited to your sister's wedding in Transylvania, Romania, and as soon as you get to the castle where the wedding is meant to happen, things go awry and you need to find and save all of your friends and relatives in this hellish castle.\n\nI had slight trouble booting up the game initially, but I quickly fixed the issue by putting the game on compatibility mode. While the game is still in a weird window, surrounded by black, I managed to play it without many problems. (Had the audio go off once for no reason which led me to restarting my computer)\n\nThe actual mechanics of the game may be rough but I found them quite intriguing - in particular the fact that the castle is more or less randomly generated, along with the items, which makes the game replayable many times. Changing weapons is a bit tedious: one scroll of the mousewheel shows your weapons, and a second one lets you actually scroll through them, which I found irritating, in particular when I'm battling vampires. The animations of... pretty much everything are limited and there's not much variety, which can take you out of the experience. All the flaws aside, the sound and atmosphere of the game is what makes it great, in my opinion. It keeps you on edge and that's what I love about it. The lighting, design, sound, and some visual effects are really what drew me into the game (like the moonlight shining through stained glass in the courtyard of the castle).\n\nOverall, I would recommend to buy this game during a sale, (I did) as it's not really worth the full price, but is a fun game to kill some time and might be something exciting to horror game junkies.","January 7","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was playing Easy difficulty and still had a hard time with the enemies dispite having all of the good weapons. Even though it was hard I beat it in less than a day and almost one sitting, I just wanted to keep playing!  The combat was a little funky but I got used to it pretty fast. I did not like the way sword combat played out because it was almost impossible to not get hit. I liked the storyline, there wasn't a lot to it but when it comes down to saving your family from freaky monsters in a giant maze of a castle, it was pretty cool. My character did some glitchy dancing everyone in awhile and the fact monsters will glitch off of you and get on top of your head wasn't the best expirience. I also encountered a whacky death of jumping over Buster, getting stuck on top of him but started slding off of his barrier and landed over one of the railings outside the castle and died.\nI give this game 8/10 though, it's fun, addicting, with a few draw backs, but keep in mind it is an old game so there's going to be unexplainable sli[ping, sliding, and dying every now and again\n\nJust a tip for anyone who is going to play: use your fists!!","October 11, 2015","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Set in the castle of Nosferatu, your family attends the wedding of a woman and her secret vampire fiance. When they arrive they are put in danger by the satanic forces in the castle. It has twitch shooter gameplay with a variety of melee and ranged weapons. It is your job as the player to rescue your family before their fate is set in motion. Along with saving and shooting, you also have to keep track of time to complete objectives. These objecives are very fluid and fit well with the other things you have to do.\n\nAs far as graphics go, it's fairly obvious that the quality won't be good, and that a mod is required to set it to modern resolutions. However, this does not impact the horror quality of the game. The monsters are very diverse and each has their own weaknesses. They are good enemies, but a lot of them rely on a jumpscare entrance that can get old quickly. The sound for some things can get old too, but the music is dynamic and really nails the tone for the castle.\n\nFor an old game, it employs a lot of modern day mechanics whille keeping a foot in the past with old gunplay and nostalgic visuals.","November 8, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/283290/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","Although obviously the older title, Wrath of Malachi comes off to me as "Depths of Fear with Vampires." That is to say, an indie horror-ish game with proceedurally generated levels, an actual story and endgame (in stark contrast to the endless parade of Slender clones and 'find the exit and get jumpscared' shovelware that makes up most proceedurally generated horror titles), slightly wonky physics, and lots of bugs.\n\nThere's not much to say beyond that with this one, as Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a very, very basic game with a very, very basic story. You play James Patterson, a very British man with a very British family of wealthy aristocrats who travel to a remote Romanian castle to see your sister wed to an enigmatic count. Said count turns out to be - to the surprise of no one who read that last sentence - a vampire, who intends to sacrifice your sister and the rest of your family in order to unleash the eponymous Malachi, who is in essence the vampire god and is sealed beneath the castle.\n\nYou arrive a day later than everyone else, and realize almost immediately (mostly because the narrator outright tells you) that something is seriously wrong. This is confirmed when your family's priest is thrown out a nearby window, at which point he quickly exposits to you the entire plot of the game (namely explore the castle and rescue your family) and if you could also find the family doctor before he bleeds out in the next half hour that would be swell.\n\nFrom thereon the game is pretty straight forward: wander the castle, fighting jumpscare-enthusiast monsters in roughly every room, find family members and escort them back to the entrance so they can open up their luggage and give you some new gear (or just some ammunition or a unique single-use buff if they're jerks), rinse repeat. There are three wings to the castle, each with a boss or two intent on sacrificing one of your family members to Malachi.\n\nHowever, said bosses are ♥♥♥♥-easy if you saved the priest. Or his acolyte. Or your brother. Or your lawyer. Because any of them allow access to the Ancient Grail, which is the most broken weapon in the game by far. It deals massive damage to any supernatural target besides the Count (INCLUDING the vampire god final boss!), killing even the toughest targets in two or three splashes. The only non-boss enemies immune to the grail are dogs and gypsies, the two weakest enemy types in the game. It attempts to balance out by only holding five splashes worth of holy water, but given that you can bless any source of water in the game with your crucifix, it becomes the only ranged weapon in the game with infinitely renewable ammo.\n\nThe game has a few growing pains in the beginning between the rushed exposition of the opening which makes you figure out the mechanics on the fly, but once you get into the swing of things it becomes a fairly enjoyable experience, and an absolute breeze when you get your grandfather's machine gun two thirds of the way through. It's also not without its bugs, including fairly awful physics that can lead to you randomly bouncing off of any slope you walk over and the occasional random death caused by some sort of glitch when stepping through a doorway, but it's playable enough if you can work past those issues.\n\nAll in all I found it quite a bit of fun, nothing spectacular but I bought it with the loose change in my Steam wallet for like a buck, so I'm not exactly demanding a game changer. Maybe wait until it's on sale but it's plenty worth the cost of a soda to keep you entertained for a few hours.","November 1, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Picked it up for under a dollar and I would have honestly paid full price for it. It feels like old school Doom mixed with Van Helsing.\n\nFirst things first, it looks like crap. If you can look past the dated visuals there is a unique level of detail and lore in this game. Second, the controls are dated as well. This is most notable when trying to go down a flight of stairs. Now, why would I recommend a game with dated visuals and controls? Because this game makes up for it with atmosphere and intrigue. I mentioned Doom and I'll also mention the Painkiller games in terms of similarities.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple. Go into a haunted castle to rescue your family. Each family member will give you unique items after you save them. A few of the family members will die if you take too long though, so there is a level of urgency built into the game. It’s also pretty short. I blew through it on normal in about five hours. Granted, I had to restart a couple of times once I figured out how the time mechanics worked. Also, a significant portion of the castle is procedurally generated. All of the big important fights and family members that you rescue are always in the same location, but the majority of the enemies, consumables, and relatives that you rescue have random spawn zones which keep things from getting boring. Overall its a fun old-school vampire horror game.","November 1, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/283290/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is the standout 2003 title from Idol FX, a long-defunct Swedish studio responsible for Drake of the 99 Dragons and so obscure that Wikipedia doesn't have a page on them.\n\nBring out your garlic and stakes, because we're going on an oldschool vampire hunt.\n\nNosferatu is a fast-paced action horror where you explore a series of procedurally generated castle wings under a strict time limit, with the goal being to rescue your family and friends from a malevolent Count. Every inch of the setting is drapped in early 1900's gothic horror imagery, thick stone and rickety supports hosting the bloodbath under a early film filter complete with dialogue cards. It's a premise that is far more novel than it should be, and it makes the game vastly more entertaining.\n\nDespite being sold as a horror game, the enemies don't pose much real threat to you and you'll be mowing them down in droves. For all the vampire-slaying weaponry in this game, your best weapons are your fists and a cup of water.\n\nAs you explore to the tune of glorious violin scare-chords working in unison to become a soundtrack, you're given 15-25 minutes to rescue all the family members in a particular area and escort them to a "safe zone" located in the main courtyard.\n\nThis is where the game's problems start coming into play. The escort AI is incredibly stupid - their greatest nemesis being stairs. From t-posing to changing elevations to cartwheeling in midair while attempting to navigate them, I had to reload a save multiple times from escorts deciding that gravity is a myth and it's time to take a leap of faith.\n\nIt runs well, but there's no resolution options. In fact there's no options of any sort. This game has not been updated for modern systems in the least and the options are as barebones as the procedural generation.\n\nProcedural generation that doesn't add an ounce of anything to the game. While it may have been beyond its time, the core game is bereft of replay value and all it changes is whether or not you'll get shafted by family members being hidden in the last possible place to look. It offers nothing over actual designed levels, the actual generated rooms means you'll be seeing the same handful of rooms a bunch of times.\n\nThreadbare design permeates the game. The hyperfast pacing doesn't seem intentional so much as it does a result of poor balancing and easy enemies. There's few weapons, few enemies, few rooms, a small amount of bosses and it reeks of relying on some technical aspects that look good on a box over a game that seeks to entertain in every aspect.\n\nUltimately, Nosferatu: The Wrath of Malachi is a fun game. Being the Fist of the North Scare is genuinely entertaining and despite the drawbacks it's worth your time. But it's not worth your money if you're after dollar to hour value, you'll blast through this once and never play it again.\n\nI can't complain too much about dollar value, I got it for free. I recommend this game, reader beware.","September 16, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/basil698/recommended/283290/","basil698","Uncle Basil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/basil698/","43 products in account","A very atmospheric, but unpolished game.\n\nWhile it lacks when it comes to graphic fidelity, it has a solid gameplay. The AI characters and items are partially randomized, which keeps the game a bit more fresh and makes a player be wary of surroundings.\nBoth enemy and friendly NPCs happen to have issues with pathfinding, which can sometimes be extremely annoying. The platforming elements have problems too, especially given the weird gravity of the game and the tendency of getting stuck on objects.\nThe game has a nice variety of both enemies and weapons, introducing some original mechanics, which I won't spoil. The user interface adds to the atmosphere of the game. The environments themselves are somewhat repetitive, which, combined with maze-like levels, can make a player get lost easily.\nWhen it comes to the horror elements, they're not on Amnesia/Outlast/Alien: Isolation level, but they work nevertheless, more so at the beggining of the game. While the music is good and helps to build the tension for most of the time, it sometimes gets cut unexpectedly.\nThe experience lasts for around 5-6 hours (I'm pretty sure I checked every possible room, killed every enemy), depending on your pace, but keep in mind that the game has time-limited objectives, which make you want to be fast on your feet. I played it on normal difficulty, which made the game pretty hard at the beginning, but easy towards the end; for a more horror-like experience I would play on nightmare settings.\n\nIn my opinion the game is most similiar (while being somewhat inferior) to Clive Barker's Undying and has a similiar vibe of an oldschool shooter. I would not recommend it to people who hate backtracking and having to navigate maze-like environments without a map. On the other hand, fans of classic shooters should enjoy it if they can overlook some of the flaws.Worth buying when on sale, but for the full price I would only recommend it for fans of games like Undying.","February 9","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music and overall atmosphere are great but I though everything else was underwhelming. This is basically a randomly generated escort mission collection with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI. The NPCs will stop following you everytime a monster spawns, which is every 12 seconds or so, and half the time when you interact to make them follow, it won't work.\n\nThe shooting and melee combat are downright terrible and the randomly spawning enemies are beyond annoying. Also, if you sprint a bit too much you will bounce around on any small ledge and take damage while your screen flails annoyingly everywhere. You'll die by clipping through walls and ceilling during said bounce too. I understand that it came out in 2003 but c'mon, that same year we got Rainbow Six 3, XIII, Call of Duty and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy...\n\nThis game just sucks. 4/10","December 27, 2015","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found that I couldn't put it down. This game is excellent. I bought it again on steam hoping to support the developer.\n\nIt can be very hard, it's almost like a first person resident evil, where you have to conserve your ammo and play smart. The immersion is what I remember being the strongest part of the game. The filter effects and ambience make you feel like you're in a old movie.\n\nThe only cons I can think of are; I wish it was longer and I wish is had more replay value, unlocks etc.\n\n9/10\n\nAlso, make sure to run in compatibility mode if you use a newer OS.\n","January 27","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Horrible Resolution support had to google for about 20 minutes to find the right fix.\n\n2. Steam doesnt run it as admin by default, causes a ton of issues.\n\n3. Sometimes runs but doesnt drop cards in the meantime.\n\n4. Tries to fight with stuff on my PC (I have idea what) causing frequent freeze ups for 0.5 sec per 5-6 mins.\n\n5. Poor hit detection and too much of phasing through stuff. Bad animations. Horrible AI.\n\n6. More laughable than horrifying. Only thing that spooks me in this game is the horrible character movement and hit detection.\n\n7. Enemy spawns are extremely random and different for every game yet VERY predictable.\n\n8. Game switches to windowed mode everytime till you use another Fix from the internet.\n\n9. Mediocre storyline.\n\nPros :\n\n1. Game is pretty DECENT for the time it was released.\n\n2. Crappy Animations are still better than Guise of the Wolf The Game Animations, and that was a 2014 game.\n\n3. Great weapon, cross, holywater concept.\n\n4. Great level designs for the time of the game.\n\n5. PERFECT atmosphere. The dark has the right amount of lighting for the right place.\n\n6. Is kind of like Blood II but a bit better than that game.\n\n5/10, Generic - Buy during a sale.","January 27","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
