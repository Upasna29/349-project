"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/recommended/386690/","thelonesoldier","Cyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/","188 products in account","Fantastic Contraption is interesting but isn't a "fun" game. If it came with your Vive, great, knock yourself out. The pure experience of playing in virtual reality should be enough to keep you engaged for hours, even if you aren't really having "fun". Otherwise, the asking price is outrageous and you should wait until it's on a deep sale.\n\nWhere the game falters is in the extremely limited pool of parts to build from. There are basically only two parts, wheels and beams. There are technically two types of beams, but the distinction rarely matters. Using these tools, you complete simple puzzles by building simple machines. You cannot control your vehicle in any way, so getting it to do what you want involves either making a vehicle that moves straight and pointing it in the right direction, or designing it so that it moves in a curve - and pointing it in the right direction. You're so limited it's hard to be clever, and most puzzles come down to trial and error of adjusting the lengths of the beams until the vehicle moves just right.\n\nIn some cases it's easier not to make a contraption at all. I beat one level, where I needed to put a pink ball inside a pink cube that was far away, by attaching the ball to the end of a very long pole, swinging the pole around so that the ball was already inside the cube, and starting the level. The game pretends like you can only build within a limited area, but in reality you can make your parts as big as you want, and there's nothing to stop you from making a pole that stretches across the entire level.\n\nThe gameplay is very similar to Besiege, but with most of the features removed (though Besiege may have copied its gameplay from the original Fantastic Contraption 2D game). If you've played Besiege, you will find the gameplay of Fantastic Contraption much less intriguing. You may have loved the original 2D Fantastic Contraption, but the gameplay simply does not translate well to 3D.\n\nFC has the worst menu ever designed by anyone. The person who designed the menu is a psycopath. You access the menu by putting on a helmet in the game, instead of pressing the menu button on the Vive controller like a sane developer would expect you to do. The menu itself is a cluster of complex 3D objects all jammed tightly together, so that if you don't have a large play area you will literally be stuck inside the objects that make up the menu and unable to see them clearly. The menu uses strange physics-based design - for example, to save a contraption, you pick up a tiny copy of it off of a table and drop it onto a spinning plate. The fact that the plate spins freely makes this difficult, and if you drop the piece it can bounce out of reach and now you aren't allowed to save your contraption. I think you are also supposed to be able to change levels from this menu, but I have no idea how. I can grab levels from another spinning plate and throw them at the walls, but I don't see a way to activate one. The menu is incredibly stupid, and the devs need to accept that it was a bad decision and abandon it instead of sticking with it just because they put time into it.\n\nDespite the gameplay not being very good, the game is definitely engaging just because the experience of building a contraption by hand in VR is so new. The construction gameplay is very satisfying - it's easy to maneuver pieces exactly the way you want and the fact that you can be doing a separate thing with each hand is awesome. I get the impression that the developers got so caught up in the building mechanics that they forgot to come up with a fun gameplay concept.\n\nIf you got FC for free it will probably tide you over until you buy something enjoyable, but I definitely wouldn't recommend spending money on it. This game isn't even remotely worth $40. This is a $5 experience.","April 7","false","3.8"," 169 of 233 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","169","233","8","30"

That saps all the fun right out of it.\n\nThe Virtual Reality part is done very well. It feels flawless and intuitive to move around in the environment, grab things, and put them together using both hands. But the gameplay does not feel complete. It seems as though Fantastic Contraption has the basics down (beams, wheels, building with two hands, VR environment) but is missing elements of gameplay to allow you to focus more on creativity rather than simply fiddling with basics to make the contraptions work properly.\n\nA good example of this is that there is no way, as far as I can tell, to snap your wheels to be properly straight and aligned with one another. Because it's pretty much impossible for you to lay the wheels down perfectly straight by hand, your contraptions are often going to slowly turn one direction or another. You have to keep restarting the level and slightly twisting a wheel one direction or another until it works right. I'd rather spend my time trying to figure out a creative way to make my contraptions do the intended job than to mess around trying to get the basics to work (i.e. making the contraption drive straight).\n\nTo use Besieged as an example again, in Besieged there are so many fundamentally different ways to achieve the end goal that if you and a friend play it at the same time, it’s unlikely that your vehicles will look anything alike. But in Fantastic Contraption, there are so few parts and/or mechanics to draw upon that you only feel like there is one way to reach the in-game goal.\n\nThe VR is done really well in this game, and the basics feel well put together, clean and intuitive. It just does not feel like a full and complete game yet, and the current experience is not worth the asking price.","May 6","false","1.1"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

I enjoyed the flash game years ago, and I'm enjoying this game too! So far I haven't made any complicated contraptions yet, like walkers etc, but it should still be possible.\n\nControls are great except for one thing, and that is pulling pieces apart. Sometimes I screw up my entire contraption when I attempt to do that because it tries to readjust half of it incorrectly. I know what not to do but it's intuitive to do it the wrong way so it takes some getting used to.

The puzzles are fun and clever and the world is extremely immersive. Everything is very accessible and the difficulty of the puzzles ramps up slowly and predictably. The recent patches have made the game even better, with the ability to pass levels in different ways to earn various bonuses.\n\nOne thing about the game is that, other than a very short and simple tutorial, the game doesn't hand hold you. There is a lot going on here that is not immediately evident (such as the ability to pull parts off your back or out of your ears). I highly recommend doing a handful of levels, then looking for tips and tricks through the gaming community. Once you uncover some of the hidden stuff in the game, it makes building much faster, and makes getting the different level designations that much more fun.","April 28","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Puzzle solving and object manipulation are two things that the HTC Vive is exceptional at. Fantastic Contraption takes advantage of this in a largely unfulfilled way. You can build contraptions, but are only provided a very limited number of tools. You have challenges to overcome, but they are small in scope.\n\nThe best thing that can be said about Fantastic Contraption is it has a great visual aesthetic and sounds great. Even then, the variety is low.\n\nUltimately, Fantastic Contraption is just another low replay value tech demo for the HTC Vive, one that is thankfully included for free, but priced unfairly for anyone who ends up without the free launch games.","May 3","false","0.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Even simple measurment/alignment tools like rulers and straight edges make constructing devices so much less frustrating; and that's the real heart of why this game plays horrible - you have no tools. All you can do is grab things and move them, and god is it frustrating. To rattle off a couple of the most infurating things from my short playtime:\n\n- There's no way to mirror things.\n- There's no way to align things. Wheels especially are a MAJOR problem.\n- There's no way to copy groups of peices and re-use them meaningfully.\n- There's no way to remove a single peice without stretching the rest of your machine out of whack.\n\nAll of these things is so easy to acomplish with mouse and keyboard controls - for a great example look no further than beseiged. I don't envy Fantastic Contraptions's developers for having to deal with this problem, but that doesn't make the problem go away. Some of the issues I've outlined could likely be addressed, but I think fundamentally constructing multi-jointed machines in this fashion just really sucks to do with your hands, especially when you can't feel them.\n\nIf doing simple mechanical puzzels is your thing, and you *don't* mind spending 90% of your time making minor corrections to wheel alignment, maybe this game is for you.

Accidentally place a contraption into the ground before running it, and watch as it bursts apart and now must be painstakingly reassembled. Sticks spin when they shouldn't. Why did the developer not iron these things out in the months they sat around waiting for the Vive to release?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/__Minos/recommended/386690/","__Minos","__Minos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/__Minos/","320 products in account","'Fantastic Contraption' is a great puzzle game that is seriously hampered in later levels by many physics, UI, design, and quality issues. These issues are relatively minor, but ultimately extremely frustrating because of how many other things this game does so well.\n\nIt feels GREAT to just start grabbing pieces and building a contraption. The actual physical movements are intuitive, for the most part. When everything works together, you can enact your idea in no time flat. When your idea works, you're on cloud nine -- the physical nature of the building helps lend a feeling of true ownership and accomplishment when your contraption solves the puzzle at hand.\n\nHowever, there are several issues that can dissolve the bond between idea and action. These issues are relatively minor, but as the puzzles get more complex, the uncertainty and instability caused by these issues turn a fun and engaging puzzle game into an exercise of sheer frustration.\n\nAs of this current version, here are my collection of issues that I have noted...\n\nSection 1: Lack of tutorialization or documentationThe only tutorials offered by the game are on basic control and interaction matters -- what the buttons on the controllers do, what the general goal of the puzzles are, what the various objects in the creation space are for, etc. Once the game has filled you in on those ideas, it utterly abandons you. There is no way to recall those prior pieces of information in-game.\n\nAdditionally, even the meager tutorials and help text are incomplete. Here are some super useful basic points the game never tells you:\nThe difference between the 'wooden' and 'water' rods. Wooden rods collide with objects and building pieces, water rods do not. You have to read the FAQ on the game's website to find this out.\nThere is a sort of black-goo sphere on the underside of the cat. It will 'glue' joints together, and will slow down the wheels/motors. Again, this info is on the game's website -- not in-game\nYou can grab the building materials from around yourself instead of from the cat! Wood rods are behind your right shoulder, water rods behind the left shoulder. The sticky goo is 'in' your right ear. Wheels/motors are in your left ear (but for me, those don't work -- they don't rotate). These 'shortcuts' are AMAZINGLY useful if you know them. They are only documented in a talk given at a VR developers conference. Seriously. I found them because I watched a talk by the creator.\nSection 2: Insufficient editing toolsThe only 'tools' (or actions) available in-game are attaching objects to joints, detaching objects from joints, lengthening rods, moving individual objects, moving an entire contraption around, deleting' objects, and clearing the entire construction workspace. The two obvious additional actions sorely missing are undo/redo functionality, and part-duplication.\n\nIf for some reason, through your fault or not, your contraption becomes broken because of a bad edit -- you cannot roll back. All you can do is attempt to manually fix the issue. If the only causes of breaking contraptions were user error, this would be a minor point -- but those are not the only causes, something which I will return to at a later point.\n\nMany times in the construction of your contraption, you will realize that you will have duplicate sub-sections in your design. Perhaps you want to build two side-pods on your block-pusher contraption, one on each side. There is no way to 'duplicate' a contraption (or a sub section). You just have to build it twice. Do you want to have 8 identical sub-modules? Have fun building that sub-module 8 times. I hope you don't mess one of them up.\n\nAt later levels in the game, it becomes clear a more advanced editing tool would be of use -- a 'grid' with a 'snap to grid' function. As a simple example, if you have 8 wheels that all need to be lined up on the same plane, and facing the same direction, you are now engaged in incessant fiddling. Without a snap-to-grid function, you are manually fiddling with every piece and connector to make sure they line up as needed. And although the precision of the VIve controllers are amazing, this quickly becomes a Sisyphean ordeal.\n\nSection 3: Editing/Physics Issues\nAs a starter, the process of attempting to remove a part connected to multiple joints is fiddly and imperfect. What you need to do is first grab the part to be disconnected, then with the other hand, grab a part similarly attached at the same joint. If you're lucky, the joint of the part you want disconnected simply disconnects. If you're unlucky, you've disconnected your part -- but you've also moved the original joint around in the process. You intended to just disconnect a joint, but have now possibly broken your contraption. This assumes that you grabbed the right part at all, which is hit-or-miss with dense contraptions. You likely just disconnected or moved an completely unrelated part by accident.\n\nThe game, while in the editing mode, will completely mangle your contraption if you are not careful. I've still not fully worked out the conditions, but I believe it occurs when you move your contraption (or sections of it) within  solid environmental blocks -- like the ground. What appears to happen, is that the game tries to move the parts away from the center of the solid object until they are no longer colliding with that object. Note I said parts, and not 'the entire contraption'.\n\nSo, if you are working on editing a large/complex contraption, and you make the mistake of putting part of it through the floor -- the section of your contraption that intersected the floor has now been 'crunched'. This is absolutely unacceptable. With a large/complex contraption, you may be moving and rotating it around a good amount, in order to work on different parts of it. You may not even have noticed you put part of your contraption within a solid environmental space while moving it around. You'll just notice at some point that your contraption has been broken, and now you have to manually fix the contraption -- if it's even worth it. Sometimes it's not, and you're better off just rebuilding it.\n\nThe worst part is, all these issues so far interact with each other to harm the experience. You want to make a 8-wheels-in-series vehicle to 'crawl' forward over some obstacles? Good luck getting all 8 of those wheels to all touch the ground at once. Good luck getting them to all point in the same direction -- because you cannot. One of your wheels is slightly off-center -- now your contraption meanders to the right when moving forward. Oh, when building your vehicle, you rotated the whole vehicle, and 3 of the wheels  intersected into the ground. Now those 3 wheels have crunched into each other. But you cannot just 'undo' -- you have to manually fix them. Now they'll never be in line again. You're better off just starting over.\n\nSection 4: Puzzle IssuesI've had several instances where I had a contraption  solve the puzzle, but the game did not recognize it. When I compared my methods to those used successfully by other players, it was clear my solution was valid -- but the game simply would not credit me with solving it.\n\nMy other puzzle issue is that the game allows you to move your contraption outside the 'construction' space before starting the contraption. This allows you to trivialize several puzzles. Why build a contraption to exit the space forward, retrieve the object, reverse course, and place the object in the goal? You can simply just 'lasso' the object outside the construction space with a really long rod with a loop at the end, and have the contraption drive towards the goal instead.\n\nSummary\nThe very fact I've written this detailed description of issues speaks to the fact the game is fun and engaging -- when it works. When it doesn't, it's a nightmare.","June 2","false","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
