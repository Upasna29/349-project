"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MycroftCanadaNS/recommended/286160/","MycroftCanadaNS","MycroftCanadaNS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MycroftCanadaNS/","199 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst I'll take you back to the mid Seventies where all I did was play tabletop games.\n\nOnce Payday rolled around (every Friday) my friends knew where to find me. I would hit the Book Store, then my local hobby store to look over, and see what new has been added. I was, and still am a hugh fan of any Avalon Hill games, and normally after chatting with the rest of the folks in the store I would be heading home to unbox my new tabletop game. I would spend countless hours playing, editing, and creating my own scenarios, and I have to say those days are my most memorable of all in my life.\n\n.... Years pass, and as always you gradually pull away from these things because life is just like that. Work, Bills, Family, and so on just do not allow you to carry on like you use too.\n\n... A few years later I start having a few more moments allowed me, and I would have these small flashs of memories from years ago when I use to love Tabletop games, and how much I enjoyed them. I drove down to where my old hobby store was only to find out the store was torn down, and in it's place is a uni-sex hair salon, and I have to say I was really sadden by it.\n\n... A few more years pass and then I see the PC arrives, and I buy in at a whopping $1900.00 Plus for my Tandy 1000SL, and I dumped another $800.00 plus dollars for a 10 meg Harddrive, and started to purchase a few games such as Mechwarrior, well you know the deal.\n\n... Fast Forward to middle 2014, and into 2015.\n\nAfter playing years, and years of the same old thing which would be First Person Shooters, Survival Games, 2D side scrollers, and the like I got extremely bored, and began to see how all of these games seem to look alike, how they all pretty much played the same, and I began to understand that they are pretty much not what I want anymore in my life.\n\nOnce again my thoughts gradually went back to when I loved Tabletop gaming, and how just simply holding a game manual, looking at the box, setting up the board, reading the manual to make sure I have things right made my life in gaming an absolute joy.\n\nSo, I began to search for a way to get back into table top gaming, and I came across lackeyCCG which really I didn't like all that much because you were dependent on hoping the modder didn't mess up with the download links, so I decided on Vassal which I found fantastic since you only had to download one .vmod file, and you had everything you need in one package.\n\nWell after tinkering with Vassal which I think is great still didn't fulfill my desire to hold the pieces, Vassal made me feel like I was just playing another computer game which I really was trying to get away from.\n\n... A couple of Months later I came across Tabletop Simulator, and after watching a few Videos I thought this just might be it.\n\nI just recently purchased Tabletop Simulator, and downloaded a few Tabletop Conversions such as "Mage Knight", and "Eldritch Horror", as soon as I started up Tabeltop Simulator, and I was able to manipulate the pieces, dig through the decks, and empty out the bags, and pour over the contents of the cards I knew from that second on that I was finally back to where I first started. Finally I found what I have been looking for.\n\nNow mind you nothing can take the place of opening that box, picking up the gaming manual, seperating the pieces from the holders, but Tabletop Simulator is pretty darn close.\n\nThank You devs, I am so appreciative for what you have brought to the gaming industry, finally I can settle back into what I enjoyed so much back in my early days.\n\nFinal: Because of Tabletop Simulator, I am going to Mail Order Mage Knight, and Eldritch Horror (that will take some time, I'm not that rich), and it's because of the developers of Tabletop Simulator which made it all possible.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT: A Very Big Thank You goes out to all of the Modders who worked tirelessly creating these excellent Conversions so we can play once again!\n\nThanks for bringing me back Devs, and Modders to a world I thought I would never be able to return too.","February 27, 2015","true","23.0"," 352 of 366 people (96%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","96","352","366","33","3"

This is the game that has propelled me to save up for a beefier computer. Sometimes I compulsively buy games that don't quite meet my comp's requirements. Bad habit, I know. With 2 GB of ram out of the required 4, I can still play quite a few games on tabletop right now--ones that come with the product and quite a few on the workshop. Unfortunately, I can't play Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples yet, but at least I have my Sorry and Clue.\n\nI haven't experienced a true troll yet, only encountered one person yelling in a room. The community, for the most part, seems really friendly.

I have learned so many new games on here that I have bought or am looking forward to buy. Games I never would of heard of or played until I tried them out on this simulator such as Dead of Winter, Duke, Love Letter and the list goes on and on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/recommended/286160/","dandk","Dan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dandk/","1556 products in account","A simple but innovative concept that delivers thanks to dedicated and continued effort and improvement, Tabletop Simulator is the first mainstream product to explore an unique class of customizable simulation in the field of board games. From a basic setup with a floating table and a background, it provides a physics engine capable of simulating intermediate to advanced tabletop dynamics - from solitaire card games to complex RPGs with hundreds of elements. With a lobby system, up to eight players can play virtually any board game imaginable (unless it involves needlessly complex physics or requires unsurmountable space) in multiplayer across the internet.\n\nGameplayTabletop Simulator thrives on one simple concept: To provide the tools necessary for people to be in control of whatever combination of objects that make up the game they want to play, in any way they so desire. The game has no "AI" in the traditional sense, in fact it has no rules or scripting at all. It is a large sandbox that allows you to spawn a table and a background as a foundation for a room, then populate it with you-name-it: Smaller boards for traditional games such as chess, a larger one for hour-long social games, a wide array of pieces, blocks, figurines, dice, markers, the list goes on and on. You can add custom objects easily: Custom 2D pictures can be directly incorporated as game objects on flat templates such as card backs and card holder cards, while more advanced designs allow you to incorporate any three-dimensional object you could possibly make.\nWith later updates, you can now also add custom tables (limited) and backgrounds.\n\nOnce the objects have been spawned into the world, you can interact with them in a variety of useful ways: For card games, an entire subsystem allowing decks to be shuffled, searched, dealt from and kept hidden in pre-placed player zones enables you to perform most standard actions with a breeze. All objects can be grabbed and moved, locked temporarily or permanently in place in any position on the ground or air, raised and lowered, flipped, rotated along every possible axis, thrown or flicked, joined together etc. A variety of miscellaneous actions help with clarification such as an arrow that each player can spawn at their cursor to make sure players are looking at the same thing, a ruler for measuring in-game distances at will, and so on. Hosts and promoted players can easily spawn, duplicate (by Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V none the less) and delete objects at will. And while the signature option to 'Flip The Table' is always present, it never takes longer than a simple Undo to return the entire room to its state a few seconds ago.\n\nApart from simply interacting with objects, the world itself, as well as any individual object, can be manipulated in gravity, looks, material, opacity and other behaviour - to be experienced for yourself as the variables to be changed here are very limitless.\n\nThe game world - that includes all progress - can be saved at any time, and a load will automatically restore everything just the way you left it. Aside from making long complicated games a breeze to pick up at a later time (hugely beneficial compared to many real-life board games) this is also the main (and only) way you can publish your creations at the Steam Workshop - you simply save everything you want in one file that is then published as a game mode - including all custom objects you include with it, in exactly the position you left every item, down to their names and physics settings.\n\nEvery single object or collection of objects - custom or not - can be saved separately as well. These go to a player's custom 'Chest' inventory, which is account bound. If the player has host permissions, he can spawn any object saved here (in addition to all the objects included with the base game, obviously) to the shared world. By storing frequently-used objects in chests, you can spawn them in any world and make your own hilarious crossover modes, custom player figurines or whatever, only limited by your creativity. This is also a much faster way of accessing certain objects you need rather than having to open a new mode entirely, which both resets everything and usually takes some time to load.\nWith a recent update, Tabletop Simulator now supports loading partial objects from gamemodes, and many experienced Workshop authors now store load-heavy objects (such as card decks) in the bags that are included with the base game so that they can be loaded on a per-use basis after the world itself has finished loading. Speaking of which, the game also provides a old-school (alarm) clock that beeps when you tap it (for time-keeping), recently an object-based Notepad for scattered variable-keeping (in addition to the external Notepad from Early Access), a simulated tablet(!) that can access webpages and e.g. provide you with custom music from YouTube or whatever.\n\nDeveloper Updates and Steam Workshop\nI've moved this section to the comments since I apparently reached some character limit for reviews (WTF). Please read it there.\n\nStoryThere is no story. Period. It's a simulator and it does what a simulator should. Still a better story than Twilight many less serious simulators are awkwardly trying to tell.\n\nGraphicsThe base tables and backgrounds are assets that serve mostly as foundation, and are not especially aesthetically appealing. However, your focus should be on the board itself, on which every object is as lifelike as you make them. All items from the base game are perfectly modelled and the Workshop provides loads of custom additions, good and bad alike. The game does suffer from performance issues thanks to its very realistic handling of each individual object, but this is negligible in all but the largest scenarios.\n\nMediaThe objects have very smooth and lifelike sounds when connecting with each other or the board, reflecting their size, type and material which is of course also customizable to an extent.\nThere is no music. You can incorporate some with the Tablet object if you so desire. They added a fancy opening cutscene when you start the game but it feels awkward.\n\nOverallTabletop Simulator is the overall go-to solution if you want to play any imaginable board game (with very few exceptions) with friends over the internet, in a perfect environment with full control over everything and several benefits compared to the real-life alternative. It is best suited for card games and traditional style turn-based board games, though it also supports lesser physics-based games quite well. You have to handle all the details yourself (just as you would in real life) as there is no script support. You'll have to pay for the simulator, but then you get to immerse yourself in a world of almost endless entertainment whenever you feel like it (and can convince some friends to join you).\n\nProsConsUnlimited varietyPerformance stutteringExtreme customizationFixed table sizesExtensive object physics, card game supportNo AI or rule scripting supportDedicated developers, frequent updatesSome game types incompatibleInternet socialReal life anti-socialCreative community\nGameplay: 9/10\nStory: N/A\nGraphics: 8/10\nMedia: N/A\n\nOverall: 9/10","August 11, 2015","true","90.1"," 236 of 249 people (95%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","95","236","249","22","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/286160/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI love board games. There, I’ve said it. Unfortunately, I got my hopes up a bit too high, because it is not what I was expecting at all.\n\nFrankly, I don’t know what I was actually expecting. It could have been an organizer for your roleplaying campaigns.  Or even a way to pretend being a guest on Wil Wheaton’s popular board game webseries on the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel for all I knew.  But regardless, it is a tool that allows you to play popular classic games in a total sandbox environment.\n\nFor a lot of gamers, this might not sound immediately appealing. In order for a game to be a game, it has got to have rules. Otherwise, you won’t know who has won or lost, or even when to call another player a low-down dirty rotten cheater. Without rules, we descend into chaos. But this can be a good thing once in a while.\n\nWhen you start Tabletop Simulator, you are given the option of several types of virtual tables, as well as the boards and pieces of many classic games such as Chess, Checkers, Go, “Chinese” Checkers and Backgammon. There are also card games and other options like an RPG table (more on this one later). There is a quick little tutorial on how to pick up a piece, rotate it, pick up multiple pieces, or randomize things like dice and card decks. Once you have done these thing a few times it becomes like second nature.\n\nIf you put a checker down on a checkerboard, or a stone on a Go board, the program will auto-correct it to the nearest square or intersection as appropriate. But that is as far as it goes to police anything you do. If you want to move your rook diagonally or put a checker on a red square, that is your prerogative. Go right ahead – Tabletop Simulator won’t stop you.\n\nYou can play any of these games in single player mode, or you can connect to other players by finding them on Steam or hosting your own table.\n\nOne interesting aspect of this program is its potential use as a role-playing game aid.  The table for this is rather large, and you can even upload your own background for the pieces to sit upon. Unfortunately, the animations of all the available monster miniatures might use up more resources than you might expect a board game simulator to need. Also, constructing the layout takes some practice and is time-consuming even then. Just to construct a couple 4-square by 4-square rooms and a connecting hallway took upwards of 30 minutes, which is about 30 times as long as it took me to do the same thing with pen-and-paper. But, if you want to spend the time and effort, you can make some decently visual dungeons.\n\nWhat truly sets Tabletop Simulator from any other board game program is, not only is it a complete sandbox when playing, you are free to add any pieces to any of them. Every scenario you load is like a developer’s kit for creating new games. If you want to put some marbles in a chess game, you can go right ahead. Most of the time this won’t lead to much more than a big mess, but you never know – you could invent the next “Double Cranko.”\n\nIf you do invent something fun, you can upload it to Tabletop Simulator’s area of the Steam Workshop. While you’re there you can also see what other people have done with this program. There are component sets for popular eurogames like Carcassone and St. Petersburg. People have even invented new ones like Portal Chess and a Walking Dead trivia game. Be sure to check them out.\n\nThere are a gazillion sites out there that will let you play chess or checkers according to the rules. Some might even be a decent opponent. But, if you are looking for a place to experiment with those games or maybe even make a few of your own, the you should give Tabletop Simulator a whirl.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","27.3"," 223 of 246 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","223","246","0","0"

With a focus on physics sandbox gameplay where you are free to abide by the rules or cheat, playing with friends feels fun and satisfying.\n\nThe game is still in beta and I've encountered a few bugs while playing. However, the developpers are really close to the community and listen to feedback. The bugs are being fixed every update and while it's still far from a finished product, it is shaping up really fast.\n\nPros:\n-Physics Sandbox. This is a must for sandbox games lovers.\n-Revives the old board games we love and allows you to play online with friends.\n-Table flipping. Who wouldn't dream of flipping a table after losing a game of chess?\n-Great platform for custom board games. While it doesn't support workshop content or 3d models yet, importing images allows you to create your own games or play games you love that weren't included with the purchase.\n-Great looking models and shaders.\n\nCons:\n-Needs some polishing, currently has noticeable bugs and can be ressource heavy at times.\n-Does not include liscenced games (obviously, but unfortunate.

I picked it up on a recent sale for $10usd around early December 2014.\n\nIf you like popular board and card games (or if you just like to spawn my little pony figures and throw them around in zero gravity for some reason), this is the best and practically only game to do it in.\n\nIf you watch a video you'll see that it's basically a physics engine with some tools to help you play board/card games. Cards can stack, you can right click and deal out cards to players, you can shake cards or dice to randomize them, you can flip cards upside down with the f key, you can have a 'hand' where cards are hidden even when face up, and so on.\n\nIt took me a day to learn some of the keys and the proper way to manipulate objects so I don't go smashing things around. And it took me a bit of time to learn administrative controls so I could take away the ability for players to flip the boards, or even join games without permission. Sometimes this is good. You can also press L to lock things down so they don't get moved and control if spectators can jump into your game and start throwing things around or if they have to wait for you to put them into the game.\n\nIf you think that people will just join your game and wreck it -- that happens. But with the right privileges set it doesn't...and even if someone does there is an 'undo' button that works adequately. You can also save the state of the game (and there is an autosave feature) and reload it if things get messed up or if you have to leave or someone drops and you want to continue later. This also lets you set up a board game the way you like to start and then save the state so you don't have to keep doing that over and over. You can import parts of one game into another game and then save it together, too. If you join someone's game and they have a cool looking 3d model, you can save that to your chest and then pull it out anytime and anywhere you have the privileges to!\n\nIn a recent patch, the developer of Tabletop worked on a NAT punchthrough method so you don't need to set up port forwarding to be able to host your games. This doesn't work for some people, and I still try to port forward so I don't have any problems.\n\nLag can be an issue if you have a slowish connection. I've played with people from the US/Canada, various parts of Europe, and Australia. Players come from all over and some will naturally have bad pings. Even so, I regularly play with people who have a 300ms ping and it works fine.\n\nThere is voice chat within games. It is set to push to talk by default so you don't have new players with open mics annoying you. There is a mute, kick and ban feature. The ban feature is especially nice since it remembers your ban list so that if you play the next day that person will still be banned. Recently, the ban list was improved so it doesn't get reset when you reset your settings. Griefing is remarkably low considering how easy it is to grief and typically it happens when the host doesn't care enough to stop it.\n\nIt really comes down to finding some people who will play the games you want -- much like with real board or card games.\n\nAs far as the game selection goes -- I'm pretty sure this whole thing is illegal but there are many top board games (see boardgamegeek.com) that have cards, boards, tokens and dice models copied into the game. Check out the Steam workshop for this game to see the options. I heard a rumor that the developer of the game Munchkin (I'm not a fan) sent a cease and desist order to Steam and all the munchkin mods were removed. I would expect more of that in the future. That being said, it is not very difficult to create your own card decks, boards, pieces etc or find ones other people have made and then save private copies yourself.\n\nThe games on the workshop are actually playable and gameplay is not as frustrating as it may seem.  In fact, since it's basically just a physics engine, it is rather intuitive to use. I've tried board game simulator programs before and they had about 500 context menus you had to go through to do anything and they were impossible to use. With this, you may not know the most optimal way of doing things -- but you can easily figure out SOME way to do it.\n\nYou could even play MTG in this. There's Android Netrunner, too. Plus a whole bunch of great board games. I played some simpler ones...like King of Tokyo, Cosmic Encounters, Dominion, Forbidden Island and one complex one - Eldritch Horror (which just takes a long time) and they all worked great.\n\nI also had a good game of 5 player chess which started off chaotic and very exciting and turned into a game of turtling -- so I created a sudden death player to finish up the game (a new player on the board to replace a dead one starting with 16 queens).\n\nReally, you can do just about anything. You can play D&D through here, you can play all the classics - poker, black jack, monopoly, clue, candy land...tons of games are here and I would imagine more are on their way.\n\nIf you like board or card games at all...or want to try some of the most popular board/card games on the market today...you really should pick up this game. There is literally nothing that can compete with it.\n\nBIGGEST CONS:\n\nI ran into some bugs that are worth noting.\n1. On my first day, I would be playing with a bunch of people and then everyone would lose connection. This did not happen on my second day. Something may have been going on with their master server.\n2. Somehow, at one point in the middle of a long game, I suddenly couldn't push to talk anymore. When I restarted the program it worked again -- I'm not entirely sure what happened there. I was host so I don't think anyone could have muted me (but I admit I didn't check).\n3. Once or twice after playing for a while the game won't let me load new tables until I restart the game.\n4. About a week into playing I hit a bad bug where I wasn't able to end turns, search, change settings, or even exit the game (without clicking the X and crashing the window). I'm not entirely sure why that started to happen. I have to restart the game to get it to work. I can still play games and chat while the bug is in effect, but this is definitely not bug free.\n\nCheck out the list of board games and card games on the steam workshop for this game. If that doesn't excite you then don't buy this game. And if it does, know that I've tested a bunch of them and they are playable and not just piles of garbage. There are some difficult things that you sometimes have to work around...but if you learn the UI they are easy. A lot of problems people have are rolling dice properly without smashing into things or shuffling and stacking cards quickly or even drawing and moving cards around without accidentally revealing them. All of these things can be done very efficiently but it takes a little bit of learning to understand how the engine works and until you do you'll probably find yourself knocking things over by accident...but everything is pretty easy to fix. And it's kind of fun.\n\ntldr: 10/10 - no regrets buying this for $10. Would pay full price. You better like card/board games.","December 11, 2014","true","104.2"," 133 of 140 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","133","140","0","7"

I have seen some people in discussions who are frustrated because they didn't know what they were buying.\n\nSo What Is It?: TTS is a platform for playing board games. There are no AI or rules coded into the game, just like a real table and board game you can pick up your playing pieces and do whatever you want with them. If you pick up your chess pawn and move it all the way across the board in one move, or try to balance it on top of another piece, or throw it off the table, the game won't care (the other player might).\n\nThe Games: It comes included with some classic games such as chess, checkers, backgammon, jigsaw (add your own picture, pick no. of pieces etc) but the main meat of the game is the workshop. It's reasonably easy to add your own custom cards or dice, tokens and boards, and if you can do 3d modelling you can make more complicated  things too.\n\nThe result is that there are thousands of mods on the workshop to download, some of them are there with the blessing of or created by the creator of the board game version (there are also a handful of paid DLC games), a few may be prototypes being tested by games designers before they consider making physical versions or homebrewed games created just for TTS, some are not everything you need for a game but may be additional pieces to use in another board game  or for  use in RPGs (like D&D). The vast majority though are versions of physical boardgames, and these are something of a grey area, legally, as the copyright holders have generally not given permission for them to be uploaded. Some may not know about TTS or may find it easier to turn a blind eye, a few have allowed their products in the hopes that the mods may drive sales of the physical games, and some, like Munchkin, seem to be regularly taken down only to be uploaded again by someone else.\n\nOpponents: There are a number of gameplay options, single player is used for solitaire games, setting up tables before taking the save multiplayer or uploading as a workshop mod. Or just loading up a multiplayer game and loading all the pieces yourself if you want,whatever floats your boat. Multiplayer has options to host a server, browse current servers, direct connection or hotseat (its better to use the proper hotseat mode than single player for hot seat games as you can then each have your own hands of cards, turn counter etc). There is also a global IRC channel which is (optionally) shown in game as well as text and voice communication. Generally public games are pretty good, there are a few trolls but the mods are good at banning them from global and the host of a game can kick them from games easily if needed. You can of course password protect your game so only those you want to join can. How easy it is to find a public game of what you want to play really depends on what game it is. There seem to always be games of secret hitler for example but if you want a game of Heroquest you might have to offer to teach people in the global channel or arrange a meet up through forums or steam friends.\n\nOverall: I really recommend TTS as long as you realise what you are buying is a an extremely flexible sandbox playing environment not a traditional computer game.","February 8","true","54.4"," 116 of 118 people (98%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","98","116","118","10","0"

Obviously if you aren't interested in tabletop games or are of the "I rather play with real life friend's" crowd it may not be for you, but otherwise there is no reason not to be eyeballing this game.\n\nAs a simulator it's quite robust. I've found a few small issues here and there but these are minor and don't really make themselves felt until you've played for a considerable amount of time (50+ hours). So far though there hasn't been a game I've tried to play in Tabletop Simulator that I was unable to play due to limitations of the simulator, and although there are a few games I can think of that would be harder to play in this simulator, the vast majority of games play just fine.\n\nThat being said, the workshop content of this game is what makes it so recommendable. The basic package comes with classic games like Chess and Checkers, but if you delve into the workshop you'll find tons of great games available at the click of a button. Some copyrighted favorites are regularly taken down due to DMCA strikes, but plenty are not (and plenty of Kickstarter backed games allow their games to be uploaded). Take a gander over to the workshop page for this game and search/browse before buying it, I'm sure you'll find more than a few games you like there.\n\nLastly, this game is great with friends, whether they are friends you know in real life or oversea buddies. Grab a mic and a few friends and start working through that workshop content, if you're able to do this I guarantee you'll be happy with your purchase. If that's not possible, I've made my way into a few public games and have had a pretty okay experience there. Many pubs tend to have mics and usually one person is willing to explain to everyone the rules of the current game. I've had my occasional issue with the griefer who comes in and messes with everything but for the most part it's been pretty good. Plenty of tabletop games have solitaire modes as well, so even if playing with friends isn't an option all the time, you can always try your hand with solo play.\n\nI started playing Tabletop Simulator and I almost never played tabletop games, now a half year later since buying it I have 250 non-idle hours into this game and I've tried close to 50 different games out and have had a blast playing them all. It's even helped me find a few games that I'd definitely like to buy in person for when I do get the chance to play with real life friends. Get this game. It's worth it.","August 20, 2015","true","483.3"," 113 of 119 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","113","119","7","6"

If you are someone that loves the generic chess, checkers, backgammon, chinese checkers, etc. or if you absolutely love card games such as poker, solitare, or even go fish, this title delivers impressively. It is NOT a single player game, but you could (as mentioned) play solitare with the cards given to you.\n\nThe game doesn't hold your hand. It gives you some luxory controls, but it otherwise wont tell you what you can and cannot do. As the video preview shows off, this garuntees chaos if you allow it to happen. This is more of a good thing (I think) than a bad thing, but it does cause somewhat frustrating experiences in the online play. Because it doesn't hold your hand, people might unintentially break the rules in various games or make some up of their own. This is a good thing for people in various cultures with different rules, not to mention those that want to play house rules (such as not having to jump in checkers, something you technically don't have to do if you are okay removing the piece, but programs force you to typically anyways). This is bad because complete anarchy is expected, it really is a simulator and, like real life, some disagreements are expected. Overall, I'd say it's a good thing despite the consequences; I believe you could say it's a double edge sword.\n\nIn my opinion, this game's strongest advantage over anything else on Steam that demands much more money for such less content, such as any mediocre chess game on Steam, is the freedom this game gives you. Not just the ability to do virtually anything within reason like the first paragraph poked at a bit, but the ability to create custom games and downloading other's custom games. This, of course, inevitably means about 90% of the time COPYRIGHTED content. This is a huge blow over the board game and card game industry and I ♥♥♥♥ing love it.\n\nJust like the whole "people don't want to buy music on the internet" and then the same morons began wondering why music piracy began to rise, you can expect this tabletop simulator to have a significant role for a similar outcome in regards to board games and card games. We asked for a good *insert trading card game* simulator and we got ignored, maybe humored with half ♥♥♥♥♥ games instead, but now we have an alternative. Some copyright claims have been made, particularly Munchkin, this was to be expected but some are yet the wiser and either ignore this game or don't even realize it exists like (it seems) a good part of the gaming community... particularly the people willing to pay $50 for a chess simulator.\n\nRegardless, I wont ramble on about that nonsense that doesn't matter to us, the consumers (at least not until our "freedoms" start get taken away by lawyers that are smarter, yat greedier, than their own good). No, I will discuss further how custom work *kinda* works, as someone who puts in a heavy load of *cough*copyrighted material*cough*. It is very easy! For cards, you just make a huge picture and put all the cards on it, up to 69 specifically at the moment, and the game cuts it up into pieces. The downside? The quality will be ♥♥♥♥ unless it is a very big picture. To make matters worse, the game currently requires you to upload said giant image to a random website for everyone to download it from. This is bad, because there isn't exactly a variety of file hosts to use that would allow such a huge file. I currently use dropbox, but it gave me problems recently that I will forgive because I have nobody else to go through, but I will never forget. With that said, it would be nice if Tabletop Simulator uses an alernative last resort file sharing method, have it between the players.\n\nWhy wouldn't the game do this from the start? Well, there is the possibility of saving file types with specific names and the game will, for now on, load that specific file instead of the original. If you had it so the game will send the files the players have, this could result in exploits that involve offensive or otherwise illegal materials most of us don't want to see. So, I agree not to have this as a primary form of getting files, but it would be nice to be able to download from the host or whoever upload the item and maybe keep track of the steam id that gave that specific file to you, that way reporting is an option. Hopefully the TTS devs will consider this as a solution to the problem, assuming this problem was the reason they avoided the option of peer to peer file transfer.\n\nThe game offers so much, but like any early access games, bugs are expected. They fixed quite a few recently, but some still exist. Despite all of them, the game is well worth it. However, I cannot stress it enough that you plan to do this with friends, for randoms only play a handful of games.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nPros:\nFreedom. For something that is just on a single table, it feels as big as a sanbox (I'm exaggerating, but for what's worth, you have building blocks, something you'd see sometimes in a real life sandbox)\nVariety. You get a lot for what you paid for. Try to look up chess games on Steam.\nCustomization. You can make your own games or copy and paste something else... probably copyrighted most likely. Because of this, you can play virtually anything you dreamed of having in your childhood for the price that is TTS.\nOnline. You can play board games with loved ones from far away, or with near by friends that don't want to spend hundreds on trading cards or RPG materials.\nThere is some anti griefing options in place, but maybe we could use more.\n\nCons:\nThere isn't a whole lot of people in the community, a lot of them are griefers.\nPlayers currently cannot just pull card decks out of workshop items without loading it, something that is addressed for other items.\nHost is unable to change server settings once the game server is made. Such as server name, player count, etc. This will probably also be addressed in the future.\nLack of file transfering between players with custom items. Of course, this is probably to prevent porn to be traded around rather than monopoly board images by "mistake," but this is something the devs should look into.\n\nOverall, this game is splended. We have building blocks, but could someone for the love of god add in some plastic army men?\n\nThis isn't the kinda game you wait for a sale for, this is the kinda game you buy with only one regret: not buying it sooner.\n9/10 seems fair, but it will be different for everyone. I ♥♥♥♥ing love Monopoly, Yugioh, Coupe, Tsuro, Chess, Poker, etc. so I make the most of this game. For those that are not so into all of that, maybe you wont make the most of it like I do. Regardless, buy it. Seriously... buy it.\n\n\nEdit:\nPlayers, including non hosts, can now upload their trading card decks. Initially, only hosts were able to lost from saved chest items but that is no longer the case. Because of this update, I removed this from the cons list.\n\nIt has come to my attention that someone made software on the forums that indeeds allows hosts to send card deck files to others from their own computer. Clearly the game is capable, but I do not personally know the details behind this. I just wish to point it out that it's possible, but I still will leave it under cons due to it being unoffical software and the game doesn't seem to even hint the possibility as well, again, I don't know the details in how it works.\n\nIt is worth noting that there is now a tutorial added to the game. It, however, does not teach you absolutely everything players may want to know in the game. Things I recall not being taught includes locking and unlocking items, the L key, changing object sizes with the -/+ keys, or how to navigate the menus which might be a confusing part of the game to newer players. I mention this in regards to my initial comment that this game doesn't hold your hand. Still doesn't, but better.","October 9, 2014","true","371.1"," 73 of 76 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","73","76","0","0"

Do you ever find yourself in a dire situation in which you can not contain the hatred and fury of the rage inside of you which burns like the flames of one thousand suns and lays waste to all who oppose you in such a mood?  Then this game is right up your ally!  At any given time, you can flip the table and watch your game pieces fall into the void of nothingness with the physics unmatched by any "game" sold commercially or otherwise.

Did I mention the deep and vast multiplayer expierence?  Duuuude... it's like, soooo deep. 8 players. Yeah... it's like that. The host also has the ability to lock items or the table itself to prevent those less capable of abstract thought to flip the table in the middle of your session.

Through the power of Steam Workshop as well as a lot of well-done built-in assets, you can essentially make any tabletop experience you so desire. Want to make your own card game? Go for it! Want to create your own intricate RPG of some description? You can do that with animated monster figurines! The possibilities are literally infinite.\n\nThe hosting capabilities of TTS are also really well done. You can kick and/or ban people from your server easily, and you can restrict certain things from being possible within your server. Anyone you've banned is sent to a personal blacklist for any servers you host in the future. If you host anything related to the Steam Workshop, anyone who joins will automatically download the necessary files without having to be subscribed to that particular mod at all. It's one of the most robust systems I've seen.\n\nEven the game's DLC, thankfully, follows that last rule. Originally, Tabletop Simulator had a weird hybrid system of everyone owning DLC or just the host or whatever. It was convoluted, and it's been changed to a much simpler system that works like the Steam Workshop. Only the host needs to own the DLC. It makes everything so easy!\n\nThe only gripe I have is that mod files do take a long time to load, but obviously this depends on the size of the mod and where the images are being hosted. It's really apparent on larger mods, though. But every release has seen improvements to the game's performance, and mod loading has gotten smoother and smoother, so this isn't as much of an issue as when I first wrote this review.\n\nPrior to originally writing this, for the record, I had spent two hours in a heated Uno game with 7 random people I had never met before, and all of us were having immense fun. Never in my entire life had I thought that would be possible.\n\nIf you like tabletop games of any kind, you owe it to yourself to purchase this and get your friends in as well. It's a hell of a fun time.","June 10, 2015","true","36.7"," 61 of 64 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","61","64","2","0"

I will also compare it to Roll20.net, a web based system for playing tabletop games.\n\n\nEASY OF USE/HOW INTUITIVE IS THE SYSTEM?\n\nRoll20 - If you have a general knowledge of how to control most interfaces related to games, you will likely be able to accomplish just about anything after watching a brief (15 minutes or less) YouTube video about the interface.\n\nT.S. - You will choose certain options when you may have wanted something else (Choosing "Game" instead of "Table"), but you will shake off the habit pretty quickly. I did not require a tutorial in anyway to use the system and just dove right in.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nI will say the only feature Roll20 has that you would want in TS is Fog of War, the ability to hide areas and tiles on the table from players. With TS, I have to keep the items off the board until I am ready to play them as to leave some element of surprise for my players.\n\n\nCOST\n\nRoll20 choose not to compete in this area. Where TS has the steam workshop with countless tables and models at no cost, Roll20 will charge you$5 - $9 for a 20-40 item set that not only typically looks poorly done, but you also won't like more than 2 models (https://marketplace.roll20.net/). Tabletop Simulator is still in early access and offers a huge catalogue of fantastic, and free downloads.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAre you worried about leaving Roll20? Are you worried about bringing your campaign online? Don't be. I'd go as far as to suggest you buy a 4-Pack, give them to your friends, and start rolling. I had my first game of Pathfinder a few nights ago and really enjoyed the experience.\n","October 12, 2014","true","45.3"," 53 of 53 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","53","53","0","5"

I then went to tools and started playing with that, to learn how the tools work.  One is literally a shared web browser.  If you don't realize how powerful that is, then you've got problems.\n\nAfter learning a bit of the tools and such, I then went through the browser to find a server to watch.  I found two people playing risk, so I started watching them.  Turns out, their risk board was bugging out, so they changed the game to catan.\n\nOnly problem is, one of them didn't know how to play catan.\n\nWe taught them how to play through the entire game, and we had zero issues with fustration or anything of the sort.\n\nConfusion over whose turn it was on the other hand.. Yeah.  That's when the host spawned in a miniature and said "Pass this when your turn is over."\n\nIn real life, Catan is the kind of game where turns could never end.  You can sit there for hours braindead trying to figure out all the possibilities, at least, wheny ou're new to the game.\n\nWe started doing our turns in sequence much faster, and we were collecting resources.  I was about to trade in 4 of a kind for one resource, as you do when you play with people who don't understand the concept of economics at all.  People I know in real life.\n\nThat's when they traded resources.  1 to 1.\n\nI have never traded resources 1 to 1 in a game of catan.  The people I play with IRL always give you an option.  Either you let them win, or you play a painfully hellish game in hopes of getting the resource you need.\n\nAnd so, we continued to trade resources 1 to 1 back and forth and build.\n\nFor the first time, I actually played a game of catan in which the building phase wasn't dragged out over the course of the entire game.\n\nWe kept the table clean through the item bags and the entire game went easily.\n\nFinally, someone reached 10 points, which signals the end of the game in Catan.  The person who won was the one who didn't know how to play at the start.\n\n\nAnd during all of this, the giant button that says "FLIP TABLE" taunted us all.  And none of us clicked it, despite the fustrations a game of catan can cause.\n\n\n100/100, would play with anonymous people who are nicer than my RL friends again.","December 8, 2015","true","143.6"," 49 of 50 people (98%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","98","49","50","20","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrhanman/recommended/286160/","mrhanman","MrHanMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrhanman/","1422 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHave you ever bought a board or card game, only to never have the requisite number of players around at the same time? I know I have. What an awesome thing it would be if I could take that game and play it over the internet with my friends, without having to schedule it with everyone a month ahead of time. Enter Tabletop Simulator by Berserk Games. It’s not the first piece of software that has sought to fill this niche, but it is my favorite by far.\n\nHere’s the deal – Tabletop Simulator isn’t a game in and of itself. As the name implies, it simply simulates a tabletop. That is, the board, pieces, dice, cards, etc. are all physics objects in an engine designed to be manipulated in the same manner you would if you were playing a game on your living room table. There are no mechanisms in place for rule enforcement. If you want to cheat, and the other players don’t stop you, the game will happily let you. The game comes with the objects you need to play several classic games like chess, checkers, marbles, pachisi, backgammon, and many others. There are dice and figurines suitable for various pen and paper role playing games. Standard decks of cards for any number of games. Blocks for building sets. And much more.\n\nBut the biggest draw of all is the game’s modding potential and the community around it. There are already hundreds of games people have modded in. Everything from Risk and Clue, to Galaxy Truckers and Munchkin. The quality of the mods varies somewhat, but there is no shortage of great mods to choose from. This of course begs the question of the legality of these mods. Since it’s all user generated content, the developers are free of culpability. The creators of a few mods have been hit with DMCA takedown notices, but this seems to be a rare occurrence. Some game makers encourage the mods, or even create them themselves. Most seem to be content to simply ignore them, and it makes sense why. These games are meant to by played in person, and are difficult or impossible to play online. The mods, on the other hand, are played exclusively online, so there is no overlap. If anything, the additional exposure has probably garnered additional sales.\n\nTabletop Simulator is an Early Access title, but it already feels very polished, though not perfectly so. In the 32 hours I’ve played it, I’ve experienced two crashes. Many people have had issues with getting network connectivity to work, including myself. I finally solved my problems by setting a static outbound NAT for the game, but many consumer routers don’t allow that level of manipulation.  In my opinion, the technical difficulties have not made me regret the purchase in the least.\n\nAll in all, Tabletop Simulator is a fantastic program, and I’m excited to see where the developers take it in the future.","March 11, 2015","true","149.8"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","44","46","4","0"

It crams all board games into one very well delivered package. What is great is it allows the user to interact with the game as they (just about almost) would in real life. The integration of Steam Workshop really is icing on the cake, as you can just go on and download a huge range of board games people have reworked into the game, like Magic the Gathering, Takenoko, Carcassone, Forbidden Island. The game however is more of a sandbox where you can tamper with anyone's cards, destroy someone's tokens, steal someone's dice and FLIPPING THE GOD FORSAKEN TABLE IN A FIT OF UNCONTROLLABLE RAGE WHEN A LITTLE WHINEY KID PUTS YOU IN CHECKMATE.\nIt starts you off with checkers, cards, chinese checkers and all the bog-standard tabletop necessities before you soon migrate to the Workshop. It includes singleplayer (for literally just solitaire) and the multiplayer which surprisingly doesnt require having to port forward. You can just slap a name on your new server, slam some assets down on a table and await the arrival of some players (hopefully ones of which won't exploit the table flipping mechanic CONSTANTLY, which is the reason 80% of servers are password locked :P) and just have some fun. It also lets you use voice chat and normal text chat to talk to victims of your newly thought up next level plays.\nAs a conclusion, it saves you a helluva lot of money on board games in one big digital package which is a huge WIN in itself.","February 14, 2015","true","127.9"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","32","34","4","1"

But Tabletop Simulator does more than that which makes it more appealing.\n\nYou could play chess with a friend for example. You move a piece, he moves, you take is knight, he takes your queen, then you throw a rook at his king. Literally. And your friend, so enfused with rage of you being a cheating conniving jerk, flips the table in anger, scattering the pieces to oblivion. Then you try a new game. Ludo perhaps. Adding the necessary parts; marbles, dice, mahjong tiles, RPG Dragon...\n\nThis is one of those games which may look serious, but seen from a different perspective and you have something that can be a great laugh for everyone. All the more, you can make your own games and put them directly into TS for everyone to try out. Which, to paraphrase NerdCubed, makes it an ideal platform for board game makers to test out their new games before they make physical copies. There is a lot that can be done, it's quite astonishing.\n\nThere is online multiplayer so you can play with friends across the web. Wouldn't mind seeing local hot-seat multiplayer in a future update, if it hasn't already been included.\n\nIf you haven't bought this game, I highly recommend you do.

This is fantastic for anyone, like me, who has no local friends, but still has the urge to play things like Monopoly or Connect 4.\n\nKeeping in mind that almost anything that is a licensed game is not in the main title. You can still find basic card decks, D&D style figures and almost any kind of dice you could ask for, among many other things. The amount of detail given to the controls and options is astounding as well. Basic physics on items, but it certainly does the job!\n\nHowever, the meat comes with the workshop. What the developers cannot do legally, the community can do, and for free! This is certainly the greatest part of Tabletop. Not only the licensed games that are available, but people being given the ability to be creative and make their own games or rules, if they so choose!\n\nQuite honestly worth the price if you and/or some friends are really interested in playing board/card/D&D-style games, but distance or ability to get together in one spot proves to be an issue.","June 5, 2015","true","16.0"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","37","43","4","1"

Hardly anyone plays them these days, allowing the cardboard games to collect dust in the closet or remain unwanted on the shelves of Target.\n\nTabletop Simulator helps you remember the fun that those board games gave you as a child.  With a seemingly endless amount of games to select, your fun is only limited by the power of your computer and the availability of your friends.  I do not joke when I say that there is at least one game on here for everyone.  Uno, Scrabble, Monopoly, Sorry!, Cards Against Humanity, and even a game about Cthulhu are all here.  There is no limit to the amount of games, and even then, you can always use the game to lay out a table for a game of your creation!\n\nHowever, this game does have one major problem.  It's rather buggy at times, and the lag is a massive pain to deal with at times.  There were times I played this game and I wanted to quit because I couldn't move my pieces the way I wanted to.  It was a mess to deal with and it's easy to drive you up the wall.  I realize that this is mostly because the game is early access, but I do hope they fix that soon.\n\nBut really, I would give this game a try.  Find some friends and play some board games together.  It will help you remember the days before we relied on handhelds and consoles for gaming entertainment.

That is, you can play tabletop games with it in the manner you would a physical tabletop game on a physical table.\n\nCurrently TTS has all of the features needed to play nearly any type of tabletop game: board, war, card, rpg and so on. New features are added almost weekly. The developers (Berserk Games) are doing a great job adding substantial features, while also paying attention to the player's suggestions. If there's an issue with an update, you can typically expect a hotfix released within a very short time to fix it. They are easily one of the most on-task developers I've seen on an early access title.\n\nThe controls can be slightly unwieldy until you get a handle on them. Once you play with it for a bit, it'll become easy and a lot of fun. Rolling dice and manipulating pieces is a much more tactile and enjoyable experience then other digital tabletop applications.\n\nDon't expect there to be AI or automation, TTS is meant to simulate the actual tabletop experience. Meaning you will need other players to play with. There is an online lobby to find other players, you can also direct connect to a friend or use the offline hotseat mode if you want to play a game with a local friend.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend TTS to fans of tabletop games. It's great, and will only get better. Casual tabletop gamers should also enjoy TTS, as there are a lot of game mods that cater to them as well.","December 12, 2014","true","596.6"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrnom/recommended/286160/","tyrnom","Tyrnom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tyrnom/","24 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWhen I initially bought this about a year ago, I felt ripped off. I had paid $15 and the game didn't even work. It would constantly CTD with out of memory errors when I've got 12 gigs of RAM and 1 gig of VRAM; which is not the best, but entirely functional. So I gave it a few months for them to update and iron out the issues, and by that time it worked. It was well worth the purchase.\n\nThis is a game where you can play pretty much any tabletop game in existence. It comes with a few such as chess, checkers, chinese checkers, poker (in the style of Texas holdem), backgammon, and several others. If you want to play another type of game using the components, you can do that. There's no rules here; it's just the players and the components. If someone is losing at chess, they can chuck a piece at their opponent in frustration, perhaps knocking over the king and a couple pawns. If you want to reach over and steal some cards from your opponent's hand, you can; though you'll probably upset them in the process, and they're more than likely to take them back from you. If you don't know how to play chess, bugger all; move with the pieces however you want, throw the pieces, do whatever. This isn't to imply that the community is a bunch of savages that don't care one mote about the rules; quite the antithesis.\n\nI've found that most people whom sit down to play a game like chess, poker, or any other game tend to play by the rules of the game they're playing. Sometimes you have someone who doesn't know the rules and they have to be explained, which is fine; but every once in a rare while you have the person who gives no damns whatsoever, comes in, and starts throwing things everywhere and attempting to flip the table, ruining the game for everyone else. Luckily the admin can kick and ban troublesome players, so this is seldom a problem in public games, and much less so if you're just playing with friends.\n\nThis game is extremly flexible in what it can do. One of the things I like to play most with my friends on this is a card game called gin rummy. There's not any predefined mode for gin rummy here. Instead, I have to go to a 'chest', which is a tab where the admin can spawn in pretty much anything they want, including custom components. From here I can spawn in a standard deck of 52 playing cards, explain the game to my friends if necessary, and go. That's all there is to it.\n\nIf you're decent at creating your own images or modelling, the game allows you to load in custom cards and pieces and ergo make up your own game with your own rules. If you're not, then this game has a wonderful Steam community workshop feature wherein you can browse other user created games. Pretty much every board game you can imagine can be found here, and this allows for a lot of freedom in what players can actually play. Most video-games are simple; they have a set paradigm that the player cannot change, or can barely change using mods. For example, a video-game that's designed to be just an Uno game or a game designed to be just a chess game are nothing less, nothing more - they offer the experience they want the player to have and that's it. Tabletop Simulator to an extent has these limitations, of course; it's not an "everything" simulator, it's a tabletop simulator - but that range is extremely broad, and within that context you can do whatever you want, either using its predefined pieces, creating your own, or finding some really epic games in the community workshop (Eels and Escalators, anyone?). It's not a game that says "Do this or else.", or a game makes you lose half an hour of progress because you completed an objective incorrectly; heck, it's not even a game with objectives. It's just a game that gives you a whole plethora of pieces and says "Have fun.", and for that it's one of my all-time favourites.","December 5, 2014","true","122.9"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","35","40","0","0"

I don't have a problem with the game itself, but rather the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community/players involved. There are 2 HUGE issues that lie within this games community.\n\n#1) Greifers/Trolls - This game is riddled with them. Its so easy to just take cards from someones hand, or throw pieces around while playing a game such as chess or dungeons and dragons. There used to be a TON of unlocked card game servers (I.E. Uno, Blackjack, Poker, Texas Hold'em, Yu-Gi-Oh, Cards against Humanity, Magic the Gathering etc.) and they were always ruined by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(s) that would sit around for a bit and act like they were playing seriously, and then they would just start grabbing others cards, ♥♥♥♥ing with the decks, or just ignoring their turn. Sure the admins would ban these people, but it would ALWAYS happen, and I'm still convinced this is to blame for the lack of servers now. The same type of people will host games that seem legit, and when you join, the board will be some sort of disguisting/scary/♥♥♥♥ed up picture. I have joined countless servers that had a normal name such as "Chess" , "Uno" , "Blackjack" etc. only to find that the board is a photo of goatese, a mutilated corpse, naked old women, a scary face, or something else thats "WTF?!" worthy. Not to mention the custom decks will be the same thing. The back of the card would be normal to whatever card game you're expecting to play, but when you draw them in your hand and turn them around, they'll be, like stated above, some sort of ♥♥♥♥ed up photo(s).\n\n\n#2) Servers - Okay now this is just as bad, if not worse than the trolls/greifers. When i first started playing a few weeks ago, sure there were a ton of locked servers, and some of them had vulgular/racist names, but there was still a very good amount of open, legit servers playing exactly what they stated in the game mode/name of the game. Whenever I browse servers now, 98% of them are locked. This is especially annoying for admins who start normal games, and lock the server up as soon as a few people join, so you end up seeing an Uno server (or anything like it) with 3/8 people locked. I feel this has something to do with the plethora of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who play this game in an attempt to ruin it for others. Now out of all of those servers that ARE actually locked, almost (with the exception of 1 or 2) all of them have stupid/vulgular names. You'll see names such as "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥" , "♥♥♥♥♥♥s here <3" , "Big ♥♥♥♥ cheese" or anything in between. Its incredibly frustrating because these people are just wasting space on the server browsing list. Due to these things, I personally have only come across 3-4 unlocked servers (that are vacant) at any given time actually playing a game as stated. Half of the games being played I dont know how to play, but I digress.\n\nSo all in all, this is an amazing game. I give props to the dev's for being so active among the better half of the community on the Beserk forums and on Reddit. I really do love this game, and I spent a few late nights having an amazing time for hours just a few weeks ago! I cant even play this game for 20 minutes these days. Like I said above, this game is amazing, and I have no problem with it at all. I just hate the community. If you're willing to take a risk with this game, then by all means go for it, and good luck to you. But if you're expecting a consistant amount of fun, you'll be greatly disappointed (unless of course you enjoy trolling/greifing).","April 26, 2014","false","23.6"," 375 of 600 people (63%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","63","375","600","30","46"

Now we have jobs, smartphones, tablets, computers, lots of videogames, Social Media sites, and have little time to even consider whipping out an old board game. This game changes that, allowing you to play any board game in an open world sandbox with people from all over the world. You can even make your own games and play them with friends. This game is worth more than its asking price, because the devs put their heart and soul into this game. They always listen on the forums and update this game almost every week, unlike some other greedy developers I know. It's something fresh and new that almost never gets old compared to all the zombie and FPS games out there. They even have a workshop filled with thousands of player made games and steam cards and achievements. You must buy this game even if you wouldn’t even play it much, because it will eventually become an addiction.","March 22, 2015","true","464.0"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","26","26","2","0"

Not only does the game come with inbuilt games of its own which are all great fun, but also realistic physics, and massive amounts of customisation. Custom decks of cards, tables, backgrounds, even a tablet to browse the internet or have a movie night with friends! I personally find the board games created by Tabletop Simulator's community to be great. Fun games such as Heroquest and D&D can be played with ease, and without having to throw out tons of cash for rulebooks.\n\nNot only that, but also the community of Tabletop Simulator is great. I have met very few people that were unkind during my playtime, and it appears to me that the game has a very tight-knit community. Overall, I would say this game is very well made, and a very fun game to buy.

Why? because this game is so good I have to recommend this to everyone.\n\nWe all know most of the Early Access Games are terrible. Most well known example being DayZ. However, not this game. The Devs are so passionate and caring about this game. If you browse the forum they respond to people who have troubles running the game smoothly, multiplayer issues or anything in trouble generally.\nDevs stated the reason why this game is on Early Access is because they received an overwhelming response from Kickstarter and decide to polish the game and bring out more content further. Which they did. Read more on what the Devs said and you can see how much they have added.\n\nNow my comments on this game: This is the perfect game for a bunch of friends to gather around at a table to chill out and have fun if people can't already do this physically IRL. The diversity of the game makes it suitable for any age group. Mods in game allows you to play any kind of games as long as you make them work. Mods also allows you to re-visit nostalgic games in your childhood.\nThis game's simple controls allows anyone to get used to the game in no time. The game has an in-built decent voice chat that allows vocal interaction with other players. You are not require to own the mod the room is currently using to join. Mods will automatically be loaded. Furthermore, hosts can load individual items from separate mods while in a different mod. Hosts and promoted members can also spawn items from chests and saved items from the game. You can also instantaneously upload an image from Internet as a board by simply inserting the URL in required place.\n\nThe community is mostly great. Most people have self-discipline are well mannered. However you occasionally get some trolls that do nothing constructive and are only there for ruining other people's games. Luckily hosts have a ban function and ability to limit players from flipping tables and drawings etc. On top of that you can rewind any amount of times so you can undo if anything messed up. It also autosaves so you can continue the games whenever you feel like.\n\nIf you ask me to rate this game I'd give it 8.5/10 at this stage. Atm this game is fairly underrated as well as a lot of room to improve. I hope this game will get out of Early Access very soon so more people will buy it. I'm looking forward to seeing this game having more people playing.","February 18, 2015","true","49.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","27","30","5","0"

The workshop mods alone make this game well worth the price. I started first looking through the steam workshop and found that any tabletop game I could think of was there and ready to play. Which is great because it is rare I have all my game playing friends anywhere near my tabletop collection. So its nice to be able to roll some virtual dice and play some board games online.\nThe gameplay can be a bit awkward sometimes (kind of depends on the game) but use the hotkeys for functions like, lock down game piece, or zoom in on card, can really help speed up game play and keep you from knocking pieces all over the board. If you do manage to destroy your board or someone gets mad and flips the table, you can simply undo step and the board has been reset to the last play before desaster struck. Another thing you might wonder about is hiding your cards so other players cannot see them. There is an area over your "seat" that you can place cards without others seeing, however if you need a larger area simply use the fog of war tool and your cards are safe from other players view.\nIn the time I have played Tabletop Simulator I have purchased a few tabletop games that I wouldn't have otherwise, due to the cost of some tabletop game titles. Being able to try them out with expansions and get a feel for the game really made the difference for me and I then had no problems sinking the money into the real thing. The game is constantly growing with more from the workshop and polish from the developers. Once again this is well worth the investment and has endless reply value.","March 24, 2015","true","60.8"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

Of course, this is expanded much farther by the steam workshop, where people sumbit games that range from original and genius board games, or just a copy of a well-known game (Monopoly, Uno, etc.)  Everyone in the game has a hand cursor and matching color, and they can interact with anything on the table at any time, the rules for must be set up by players and obeyed for the sole reason of playing correctly (which of course opens the doors for a number of trolls and griefers)  The game, of course, is still in early access and, suprisingly, is updated quite often. People often say that people release early access games and then never update because they've made their money. For some games this is true, but Tabletop Simulator is consistenly updated and so far it looks like the final release will be great. If the game were released now it would still be great! However, it's obviously not perfect. Interaction with objects can sometimes feel awkward and dropping pieces when you aren't looking from a birds eye view is usually guesswork when you aren't placing the piece 3 inches from the camera. Despite its flaws, Tabletop Simulator has been fantastic so far, and it promises to be even better at release.","November 26, 2014","true","31.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Tabletop Simulator lays the foundation for you to reconnect with old friends that you used to game with as well as meet new friends that play the same games that you do. It is a toolbox allowing you to unlock nearly every experience you could have sitting at a normal table except you and your friends can now be thousands of miles apart and everyone has the best seat.\n\nThe most important aspect of enjoying Tabletop Simulator is understanding the controls. In the beginning, they can be a burden if you don't spend a small amount of time learning how everything works. Take the time and explore all the different ways you can interact with cards, dice, and pieces. Once the controls become second nature, you can instead focus on what you're playing and not how you're playing it.\n\nFor me, any and all network issues have been resolved. The game plays smooth and everyone can see everything in real time. Tabletop Simulator can also handle a crazy amount of individual pieces before it begins to struggle -- many more than you would ever use in even the most involved miniature or Euro game.\n\nLastly, Berserk Games is working hard to make the experience even better. The game is advanced enough now, in my opinion, to be released, but they are finding even more features to add and updating on a regular basis. They listen to their user base and are working to make the best product they can. When you're looking for an Early Access success story, this is the example you should give.

The amount of fun you can have with people from around the world is immense. The Steam Workshop really adds a level of creativity to the game.\n\nPeople can make their own games from Uno to Monopoly. They can create their own special versions of games, like a unique Nintendo Monopoly, or a Minecraft Monopoly. I am currently the owner of three Workshop Items. The possibilities are really endless.\n\nPeople can import these games and host a Multiplayer server for up to eight people from around the world. Of course if you live further away you're going to have more server lag unless the host has amazing internet. Currently LAN support is not available, but that's not a feature I usually use in games anyway. You can set passwords for your game room for a private match. You can disable table flip, hands for non-card games. There used to be a problem where people would join a game, table flip and leave, but now the game has a delay before a person can do that even if table flip is on. There are really a lot of options.\n\nRules are enforced by the host, simply meaning if they don't play properly then why would they allow them in the room? The host can kick/ban a player, or mute a player if they're squeaking or something through their microphone.The people on this game are mostly friendly. To filter out annoying people though you can put "(mic)" or "(mic needed)" in the title, then you can ask them if they can talk when they join the game. People are usually nicer when they have to speak to others with their voice rather than text speak. Seat requesting has been suggested before but has not been added yet.\n\nThe single player version of this can be played on your own or with others if you share a mouse. This isn't really something I'm too interested in either. This mode is usually the place where people make custom games designed for multiplayer, or simply to get used to controls and mess around. Of course there are single player games you can play, if that's what you're in to, like Solitaire.\n\nThe physics in this game is really fun to play with to. There is a gravity multiplier which changes the gravity effect of objects in-game. People have made tabletop tennis with a coin. Throwing things around, watching things fly off as you flip the table.  Rolling a dice around a game board. Everything is really well done.\n\nI get the most fun though out of talking to people through microphone. Talking through chat just doesn't cut it for me, especially in a silent game as it currently has no game music. I enjoy arguing with people over competetive games such as Story War and Once Upon A Time. I recommend you get a microphone before getting this game in order to have a better game experience, unless you just want to play quiet games.\n\nPerformance wise the game is excellent, and should run on low-end computers as well as high-end. All the game really has to load is a single table and the amount of things on the table. Performance will likely droop if you're hosting though, but for me this doesn't really show any considerable FPS change. The game looks good on Medium to Ultra, but starts to look bad if you go any lower. (Not that you should need to.)\n\nUnfortunately there are tabletop games which are just not possible to recreate at the moment such as Mouse Trap or Dingbats, but hopefully due to the fast updates this game has these games should be possible to recreate in a few weeks/months or so.\n\nThe developers are amazing and listen to the community. My best advice would be to ask/suggest things on the Berserk Games forum as that's where they mostly hang out. They push out a new update every week or so with new and fun features for the community to try out and squashed bugs. It's great fun being a part of the Early Access community and helping to shape the game into a game everyone would want to be a part of.\n\nIf you're interested, you should watch some videos and see what all the fuss is about.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this unique game for anyone who likes playing tabletop games in real life (which is pretty much everyone). This has great replayability.\n\n10/10 - Fun!","May 28, 2014","true","828.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I can't speak too much about the default tabletop games it brings such as dominoes or chess. However, my friends and I have put in nearly 100 hours of game time already because we've found this to be a very fun, social game to play.\n\nWe've downloaded and installed at least a dozen board games and it's been really fun trying them out.  We've played Cards Against Humanity, Fluxx, Ascension, King Of Tokyo, Munchkin, Red Dragon Inn (a drinking game that we've had a lot of fun playing :P ), Dixit, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Once Upon A Time, to name a few. It's been a fun experience playing all these board games that we normally wouldn't have been able to play online with friends. A few of us have even dabbled into some light Role Playing which we didn't really ever try before and found that we've enjoyed it.\n\nThe game isn't without its bugs here and there but I can honestly say it's nothing game breaking. The developers have done a fantastic job with fixing bugs and releasing frequent updates. Every time we've found ourselves asking in game "Wouldn't it be great if they added X, Y, Z?” they seem to add those things in within the next update or two and then some. I feel that the developers listen to their community and actually take their suggestions and implement them.\n\nOverall, I most definitely recommend this game for hours of silly fun with friends. If board games are your thing or it's something that you've never really tried but are curious about, I absolutely recommend you give Tabletop Simulator a try.\n","June 26, 2014","true","173.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

But this is enough to open up unlimited possibilities for boardgame geeks, don't let the screenshots from the store fool you! This sim can handle way more than Chess, Checkers and other common stuff you'll find online en masse.\n\nThat said, the workshop support is the heart of this application, because it allows modders to recreate every boardgame, cardgame, tabletop or physically existing game. Lots of historical stuff you'll never get your hands on (except you're willing to pay high collector's prices) like games from Avalon Hill or those nasty american nuclear-themed games from the atomic age.\n\nHere's a random selection of well-done workshop items you should try out:\n\n- Advanced Civilization\n- Bohnanza (popular german cardgame)\n- Carcasonne\n- Settlers of Catan (including Star Trek mod)\n- Risk (LotR-mod / Star Wars-mod and more)\n- Exploding Kittens\n- Zombie Dice\n- Starship Troopers (based on the novel, not on the movie)\n- Alien\n- Fallout-Monopoly\n- Escape from Colditz\n- X-Wing Miniature Game\n- Warhammer\n- Hotel\n\nThere are no limits: Scan your favorite game's cards, reference sheets and rules, import 3D-Models and preserve this stuff for all times.

After some random online games filled with trolls I expected even less. But once I managed to have a game of MTG with'n tabletop sim with mature, and well organized players I was sold! I saw the light, I see the potential and grand scope that this game has to offer. I am actually incredibly impressed by how well it functions once players are there to play, rather than to troll.\n\nThe scope and concept, as well as it's versatility is incredibly impressive. Truly the name is as accurate as it could possibly be. It simulates what it's like to play these tabletop games IRL. There's no score keeping by the game, it's upto the player. There's no digital ref restricting your moves, it's up to the player. It honestly does feel close to the real thing.\n\nOverall, Tabletop Simulator has a few rough edges as of now, but the potential of this is quite impressive.\n\nPros:\n- Mimics real life tabletop experience very well\n- Extremely versatile sandbox that will allow for virtually any table top games to be mimiced here.\n- Brave and unique design choices\n- Very fun with well coordinated players\n\nCons:\n- Graphics are a little crude currently\n- Too many trolls online\n- Almost require friends or trusted players to enjoy","April 24, 2014","true","4.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

I know not if this is an issue that can be fixed, though the preservation of decks when undoing actions would be really nice to see.\n\nIn regards for suggesting features, I would like to see the implementation of books (perhaps imported from documents on your hard drive?), though one might question the feasibility of such an implementation because at the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator is really just a physics sandbox with a few features to help simulate card, tabletop, and/or board games and I understand if the pages of said books would prove far too taxing on the game's physics engine.\n\nOther than that one gripe and suggestion I have, I have yet to notice any jarring issues besides the one above so yes, I can safely recommend this game as it does what it does really frickin' well.","March 9, 2015","true","109.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","1"

The sole purpose as to why I got this was for the Tabletop Roleplaying aspect of it. I am a Game Master and have found many ways to use this before or during my game sessions. I am the founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League, a Group that is made up of people, players of tabletop/pen and paper games, and I definitely recommend this to all fo them. Anyway, lets continue on to the pros and cons lists\nNOTE-This review is based solely on the RPG/Game Master features and uses for Tabletop Simulator.\n\nPros-\n\nUnlimited Features, you can do literally do whatever you want to with this thing. If Tabletop Simulator doesn't have an asset that you need like a castle piece or knight model, you can just make one! It literally has unlimited potential for all of your Game Master needs.\n\nConsistent Updates, the developers are still expanding the base resources, specifically the RPG assets. This is great news for those interested in these assets, us Game Masters that is.\n\nMultiplayer, you can literally play your favorite tabletop game with your friends using this game, either through the internet or using hotseat gameplay. For the internet part, connecting is very easy and allows the Game Master to set the rules.\n\nMany others, but lets continue to cons...\n\nCons-\n\nComplicated Controls, the controls are not to simple for beginners, remembering which button does what is hard early on. Once you have played with the controls for a while you will get a feel for them. The tutorial tells you how to use the controls, but thats about it.\n\nInefficient Menus, finding the piece you are looking for takes to long, not because they are hard to find, but because you have to search through the menu, then sub menus, then more sub menus. It just takes to long, but I can live with it for now, although it would be nice to eventually change the menu set up. I guess you will never be able to reproduce a real tabletop session 100% in a virtual game.\n\nConclusion-\nOverall, this is perhaps at the moment the best and most realistic means in recreating the actual feel of tabletop gaming, not just roleplaying games, but any game. I believe that this could eventually become the standard for PC tabletop roleplaying, and look forward to seeing what the developers do with this. This is a must have for any Game Master, or anyone who just really likes playing tabletop games!\n\nMay your adventures be many and always end in reward!\n-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League","July 21, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You can basically build or play any game you want. The Steam community has created some pretty cool games and items in the Workshop. Though if you want to create something 3D then you better have some computer modeling knowledge. I also like the feature where I can import my own playing cards or pieces or boards. Though I did try to make a disk type "card", I used a .png with a transparent background and when I imported the file, the transparency was filled with black making it a square card. I'm still trying to figure out the card importing thing, since when I imported a card type, it became very pixelated and illegible... But I've seen games on the Steam Workshop where the cards are very clean... SO - one of these days I'll get that result.

I wouldn't recommend this game if you plan on playing with strangers, but when you're with friends- it's just like the real thing. It's hilarious and fun, but the game runs on honesty since it's quite literally a simulator- allowing you to flip the table in a fit of rage, or steal another person's cards right out of their hand, or plop down a tablet on the table only to open up a web browser to bring up hardcore gay porn.

The game revolves around simulating a tabletop and physics, and allowing players to play a variety of games (or create their own!) on said tabletop.\nWhere the game currently shines is the development team. They've formed a close-knit tie with their community and are currently listening to community feedback in a way few other games can. Many features have been straight from the communities mouth, and they're willing to engage the community and discuss with us upcomming features, plans, and gameplay.\n\nIf there's no game on a table you're interested in playing, TTS probably isn't for you. This isn't going to magically make DnD, Chess, or Munchkin more fun. But if you do enjoy tabletop games, then playing with friends and strangers online on TTS is the way to go.","April 17, 2014","true","170.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Also easily undoable.\n\nAnyway if you have friends or family far away and want to play games like yahtzee, monopoly, chess, checkers, snakes and ladders you name it in a 3D style game and not in some glitchy 2D flash game with questionable ads you found on a Google search, this is the game to get. It doesn't require a lot of computer power to run and, with some coaching, may even be easy enough for your grandparents to use. Mine got the hang of chess anyway. It's also a lot of fun being able to play a game like yu gi oh and have every single card available even if it's a challenge sifting through all ten thousand of them.\n\nOverall highly recommended, this simulator is better than I ever would have expected","June 8, 2015","true","21.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

That, however, is not where this game shines. Its true worth is the fact that Workshop Integration and an active modding community allows you to play almost any tabletop game imaginable, from Cards against Humanity to Pokemon Master Trainer to Munchkin to Liar's Dice to Sellswords to Triple Triad. Given time, almost any game, no matter how obscure or how niche, will find its way to the Workshop and therefore be playable for you and up to eight friends.\n\nPROS:\n-a large amount of agency is afforded to players in order to provide an optimal game experience\n-an almost limitless library of modules is available via the workshop, giving access to hundreds of distinct games\n-a tutorial explains most of the obscure commands and keys fairly effectively\n\nCONS:\n-some functions that one might expect aren't available (no way to import backgrounds independent of game-types, some kind of inventory functions for players for items other than cards, etc.)\n\nUltimately, the game is absolutely worth it if you and yours have ever wanted to play a particular tabletop game without all the hassle of having to be cluttered around a messy game board or table. I absolutely recommend this game and its various workshop modules.","January 29, 2015","true","35.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arctacia/recommended/286160/","arctacia","❄ Arctacia ❄","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arctacia/","223 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWe live in a crazy and busy world at times. But what's more apparent, is the fact that we're finding ways to be more connected with one another. We live in a digital age where a lot of the things we do have a tendancy to revolve around some electronic device. Board gaming has been one of those hobbies that strays away from such things and it is something I can appreciate. Despite the convenience and power we practically wield through even just a phone these days, it's nice to take a break from it to gather with friends and forget about such things for the sake of a more personal and human interaction.\n\nBut, we realize that such gatherings may not always work out, or perhaps you just happen to not have anyone nearby that shares the passion of these games. Ironically, through the use of computers, such experiences can at least achieve second best. Tabletop Simulator allows one to share those experiences with others over great distances, but most importantly, it still keeps that personal feel to a degree that one may not necessarily regard as digital or artificial. The way it plays out with physics and actually seeing what others are doing are the hallmark of what helps make board gaming interesting and engaging. Sometimes because of it, we may accidently tip over a piece or put something where we didn't intend. As much as it seems like a minor inconvenience, such little details are all the same thing we may tend to find in real life scenarios. Obviously, I realize not everyone is on board with such things and there are other solutions out there that fit the bill for those seeking a refined, perfected, and orderly take on tabletop gaming.\n\nThere's plenty to experience right out of the box with classic board games and cards. Also, the possibilities for bringing in custom content are grand, even given the limitations the program may have in the beginning. In time, we'll see more potential unlock from there. Imagination is the only limit I can see.\n\nQuite aptly as it is named, Tabletop Simulator seeks to simulate the tabletop gaming experience. I think what makes this program a great entry is that it doesn't try to perfect the board gaming scenario and make it efficient. Rather, to bring it as close as possible to those who cannot as easily do so, but keeping it as organic as possible. To me, that's where the real beauty shines through.","June 4, 2014","true","285.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I cannot recommend this enough if you love boardgames and you want to be able to play it with your long distance buddies.\n\nI will say though that if you want this PURELY for D&D or other such pen and paper things, do NOT get this.

The core aspect relies on mod-based contributions, like Garry's Mod – except for tabletop games. There are thousands to choose from, ranging from things like RISK, Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity – to Chess and countless other party style board games.\n\n\nSome mods are intricately rendered with original skins for playing pieces, others are cleverly designed and planned out. There are original games, and a good chance to find any of the board games you've loved back at home or for those times where you're forced to put up with extra relatives.\n\n\nThe initial premise, of course, is that you're presented with a table, faced against a randomly generated background (which incidently is also moddable.) Depending on if you choose a private or open game will decide if you play with your friends or with strangers. I would probably recommend playing with friends, as there is a high tendancy for random players to “flip” the table, which consequently ruins the progress of whatever is there.\n\n\nThe controls of Tabletop can take a little getting used to, since sometimes a wrong movement can accidentally sabotage things that you don't want sabotaged, or reveal your card hand. (Which then makes you flip the table because it was a really good hand.) This is probably my only real gripe – the chance of a game being killed before it hits the real action, and the fiddly controls. Also, perhaps, people who have excellant mods but don't update them, or don't include rules with their games. :(\n\n\nThe gameplay offered is whatever mods you choose to download and whenever you find people who will want to sit around and play all those classic party games. I played Pictogram! Cards Against Humanity, Uno, Threeway Chess and WoW Guess Who! In one session with a few other friends.\n\n\nIt's brilliant to be able to pick through the list and agree on games together without doing the packing and unpacking that goes beforehand with physical board games. Obviously there's something special about doing that as well, but when your friends live across the map, this is the perfect opportunity to get them together and tackle that desire to find people willing to sit around long enough for board game sessions.\n\nWant moar?

This is a really good simulator because it\'s actually so much like real life and you don\'t have to spend loads of money on the real thing. Even the drawing mechanics make this enjoyable alone. You can play pen & paper games like Tic Tac Toe, Hangman or Dots and Boxes.\n\nI thought I might not have enjoyed this game prior to buying it because a lot of videos suggested that you need friends for it to work but playing on random servers worked the best for me as this game has one of the best communities I\'ve ever seen.\n\n9.5/10","June 1","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's more of a physics sandbox game where you can spawn regular cards or board games and equipment or you can just play by the rules before someone can flip the table out of rage! Including Steam workshop for additional games and fun content to spawn and play.\n\nSo basicly, my first time playing this game was with a friend of mine to show me the ropes and random workshop items. Next time I launch the game, I was looking for a Cards Against Humanity server, and I did. Played a couple of rounds and swap games as a group. Next thing you know, tablets and porn. I came back to the server and 2 of my new friends were spawning in tablets and started to looking up porn. How am I suppose to explain that?

It's so great getting to play board/card games with people all over the world. The controls take some getting used to since it's just a physics engine, but once you get the hang of it it's great. I have yet to try out making my own game, but just the fact that you can is awesome. It's also incredibly good as a way to try games before you buy them or simply just to play them. I mean, this is still doesn't come close to actually physically playing a game in person, but let's face it; games are damn expensive. Tabletop stuff usually runs $30 each minimum, often more, and it isn't always easy getting people over to play. My only problem with this game is that most of the workshop is copyrighted games.... which I will honestly still use while they are available but I wish there were a legit alternative since favorites like Munchkin get frequenty removed due to copyright claims. Berserk Games needs to try getting partnerships or deals with the actual game creators to allow us to use assets for free or a reasonable price. It won't stop the fan-made copies from popping up, but I'm sure others besides me would be ok with a fair price in exchange for it remaining easilly available.\n\nTL;DR: Incredibly awesome game, but needs permissions from copyright holders to stop workshop content from being removed!","March 19, 2015","true","14.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Tabletop Simulator is very close to the real experience of just sitting around with friends but online (without the hassle of picking pieces off the ground everytime your friends knock them down). I've had a lot of fun with this game so far just generally messing around with the physics system, playing D&D, building sets, rolling dice and the sorts. It's great for me and my friends to get together and play like we used to since we all moved to different parts of the world and it can be great for anyone else too. The modding community also really brings this game to life and the ability to make pictures and models and add them to the game with relative ease gives it some great replayability.

We were told we could play games such as Poker, Pokemon, UNO and a lot more and its true!\n\nWith worksop mods their are games such as Yu-Gi-Oh, many versions of Monopoly, Top Trumps, Trvia Pursuit, Scrabble and so many more. This game is something great. The graphics are rather nice but could do with a little more. The UI is great and easy to understand and its great fun to play with friends. We regullary have poker nights on this game and play Monopoly an dmany others as its such great fun.\n\nThis game is currently priced at 10.99 GBP which....... in my opinion isnt worth it. I would pay about 7 GBP - I got mine for 3 CSGO Keys. BARGAIN!\n\nI feel that their needs to be more worksop mods, although there are already a lot, their could be so so so much more. I am currently creating a trvia pursuit for teens game. And its very easy to make your own mod for this game.\n\nOverall:\n\nGraphics: 8/10 (although it is mod related)\nUser Interface:  10/10 very easy to use\nWorksop: 8/10 wide variety of games but not a lot of great games\nPrice: 6/10 i wouldnt pay 10.99  GBP for it\nPlay Time: 9/10 this game can provide countless hours of fun\n\nHighly recommended","February 10, 2015","true","11.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have a feeling that just about any tabletop game can be played in this.\n\nBeing physics based, it feels good to roll your dice, mess with other peoples tokens and toss items off the table in furious rage!\n\nStrangely enough, for a game with such a simple concept, it gets lots of regular updates with bug fixes, changes and new content. You can (for example) now add your own custom pugs by using the URL of some character or monster’s image. You can display a grid on one of the many different tables and have pieces align to it. You can spawn in a bag, drop things in it, shake it and pull them randomised out. You can apply a different colour to just about everything and more!\n\nUsing the Steam Workshop, it is very mod-friendly and spawned a very active modding community with modders adding in new games, models and all sorts of stuff!\n\nI use this program a lot for my Dungeons and Dragons sessions and had a lot of fun in it.\n\nIf the idea of having a virtual tabletop doesn’t interest you, you shouldn’t buy this game. If it does however, you can’t go wrong with the versatility of Tabletop Simulator.\n\nMy only real gripe with this game is that the UI doesn’t feel right, but other than that it is everything you expect it to be and more.","August 25, 2014","true","45.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It comes highly reccomended, but you must realize thtat right now it is still in Early Access and the game has many flaws.  Some of which right now include occasional hard lag spikes, limited boards, and RPG options. However, it has come very apparent that Berserk games is very hell bent on making this work, so I would not be scared of this turning into a no full release early access game like many in this genre.\nTabletop Simulator is wonderful in so many ways.  If your like me, Board Games are super fun but harder to get people to come around a table just to play them.  Tabletop Simulator is full of people from all sorts of places ready to play a simple universal game like checkers and chess.  What I love the most is the RPG options, although limited, are still in the game.  I always wanted to DnD, so this makes it easier to get into it without having to buy a bunch of peices. They do plan on expanding these options as well as many more.\nFinally, the biggest apeal to Tabletop Simulator is the costumization features.  People are playing ONLINE games of Uno, Monoply, and the very popular Cards Against Humanity in mere seconds.  I have also found people making their own boards or making their own games with the features in the game and playing their own wacky crap online.\nOverall, Tabletop Simulator comes highly reccomended to anyone.

A game played in Tabletop Simulator is only as good as the mod creator made it to be.  A TRPG is only going to be as fun as the people you play with.  That's just how it works.\n\nYour first step should be to look at the Steam Workshop for a few games you might be looking to play with your friends, or think about which you might want to work on yourself.  I myself added a mod to the workshop for a now-defunct CCG, and it wasn't too hard.  Adding some resources for modding could be an important improvement from the devs, but with a little elbow grease, reddit / steam forum searching, and google you can find the answers you need without difficulty.\n\nIf you've got some tabletop games you want to play online, this is the tool for you.  Still receives regular updates too.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=305502693","August 2, 2015","true","42.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The only complexity with this comes from the actual game rules of whatever you decide to play - the simulator itself is simple, easy to use, and very straightforward with its presentation.\n\nThe mod community is great, and it's thanks to all their hard work that we have as many games to play as we do!\n\n10/10, will play again.\n\nAnyone who has never played Betrayal at House on Haunted Hill before should really do so, as an aside. It's a wondrous game! As of this review, only the first edition is available from the steam workshop as a tabletop simulator mod, which unfortunately contains misprints and vague rules, and other minor errors. Hopefully modders will whip up the revised Second Edition soon!","July 18, 2015","true","66.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UFOLoche/recommended/286160/","UFOLoche","UFOLoche","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UFOLoche/","156 products in account","Simulator games have frequently been a bit of a joke to a lot of people.  There's a reason why Goat Simulator is so popular after all, so much so that certain devs are starting to look at the name "Simulator" with a bit of hesitation.  On the surface, a few people might think that Tabletop Simulator is a bit of a joke as well due to some of the things it offers(Flipping the table, zero gravity mode, etc), but what it offers honestly makes it worth the price and shows that it's more than just a silly little thing.\n\nGraphics:\nTabletop Simulator's graphics, as a whole, are simple.  They look good enough that they'll get the job done but they won't be winning any awards.  The game allows you to import models and textures, so your mileage may vary, as well.  The backdrop for the "rooms" use a 4800x2400 HDRI Panorama shot, which means seams won't be an issue.  Overall, passable for what needs to be done.\n\nGameplay:\nTabletop Simulator is, as the name says, a game used to simulate various tabletops.  You start off with a decent number of standard board and card games, most pretty typical for what you'd see.  They're nice, but not exactly something I'd pay 20$ for flat out(But I'm a bit stingy), although the ability to play in a system that's not automated is nice.\n\nThat leads into my next point:  The game isn't automated for the most part.  Everything is pretty customizable, and you can do various things, such as set hidden zones, flick items around, throw them around, flip tables, etc etc, with almost, if not all of it being able to be changed for your benefit(Of particular note is that you can disable the Table Flip option, thank god).  Leading to a pretty fun experience of just sitting around a table and BS'ing with friends.\n\nMy one MAJOR issue with the gameplay is that you cannot peek at a card while it is face down outside of moving it into a hidden zone(Which is a bit cumbersome) or returning it to your hand(Which has its own fair share of complications)\n\nWorkshop Support:\nThis game allows you to create objects, texture them, and use them to make your own various games.  The system of doing so is relatively simple, as long as you know your way around models and textures, and it's pretty open, allowing you to import your own models into the game as well.  This is where the game shines, as almost any card or board game is possible with what is given to you.  The little figure can even be given animations for attacking and the like, to simulate an RPG.\n\nAlong with that, there are various tools inserted in the game to help you accomplish this.  From counters, to tablets, to MP3 players, to calculators, and more.  And ALL of this can be uploaded and downloaded from the Steam Workshop, with download times being reduced due to the ability of Tabletop Simulator streaming image content from a hosted site(Which is both a blessing and a curse, to be honest).\n\nHonestly, all of it is really nice, my only problem with the modular ability of this game is that it seems like you can't plug your own MP3s into the MP3 player and you can't import custom tables, which is a shame, as that would have made RPGs truly perfect for this system.  Both of these can be worked around but it leads to an experience that is less than perfect.\n\nOverall:\nAt the end of the day, Tabletop Simulator is a great game that allows people to just instantly pick up a deck or a pair of dice and play their favorite games.  It isn't perfect, and it won't ever be a true replacement for sitting around a table with your friends, but for those who are separated by long distances, this is a great alternative that will be sure to keep everyone happy.  It has a few issues but it's constantly being updated and I hope these will be sorted out in time.  Something else I want to note is that, while the DLC is a bit heavily priced, only one person needs to own it, which is..pretty much how it goes in real life, so I really appreciate and respect that.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 9/10, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.","January 31","true","46.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Dice rolls with satisfying thuds like 45 grams of the finest plastic four sided cube on 19th century rosewood table. And if you highlight multiple dice, it tallies the total for you.\n\nAll game states can be saved and loaded, by any of the 8 players joined, with permissions allowed by the host ofcourse. With integrated voice chat, turn indicators, handzones and private zones for hiding your hand/dice, it brings a lot of games to the table. Also, all types of objects can be customized with its own models, physics, and textures.\n\nThe game grants you objects like cards, poker chips, coins, dice (d3, d4, d6, d20, etc.,) and figurines (chess/d&d). Objects snap and cascade by physically stacking, like chips and cards. You can shuffle cards by just pressing R, animation takes less than a second and is heard by all players. Then you can deal to everyone's hand just by clicking a button. Where the host controls the permissions of how every player interacts with the environment with a dropdown checklist. With a maximum of 8 players, it is really multiplayer tabletop games.\n\nAlso, there’s a tablet simulator that links to google and youtube, that can be seen by every player on the table. Movie/music night?\n\nThe advance features, like tape measurements, allows accuracy POV/LOS action figure games, like Warhammer 40k to be simulated perfectly. All you need is a brain for storing the codex rules, and the figurines available on the mod page. You measure 6” for walking infantry, toss a grenade and borrow the 3” blast marker available on the workshop page. When you shoot, you just lower your camera onto the table, and get an accurate Line of Sight from the space marine’s point of view.\n\nGame's good.","January 31","true","374.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Additionally, it is very easy to host games and people almost always join and play with me!\n\nI've created a few mods which was relatively simple.\n\nMy main complaint is that the controls are a little bit difficult to learn and I wish some of the functionality could be mapped to keyboard. However, once you figure it out it becomes second nature and the controls no longer get in the way.\n\nIf you're worried about dropping the money to get this and not being able to find people to play with, don't worry, the community is awesome and you will be playing games right away. Additionally, everyone is extremely friendly. However, make sure you have a microphone as it is *almost* required to play most games.

From what I've seen on the Forums, the Devs are going to update content (a tape measure is one of the ones they've talked about...for miniature gaming), so this is going to add even more variation to the creation and game play.  I love the physics involved in the game, things like picking up and moving the pieces, shuffling cards, rolling dice, and even flipping the table (yes...that flipping the table).\n\nThe Bad:  It's Early Access...it's effectively a beta...so right now, you pretty much have the basic stuff in the game.  There is a thread on the Forums regarding the use of copyrighted material...this can hamper some of the more popular "games" being reproduced.\n\nThe Ugly:  The "game room" is...well...empty...there's the table...but no walls, no floor...just the table (this is something that is added later).\n\nThat's really it...I enjoy the games so far, I hope that more is added in and that copyright holders allow for their products to be added to the Steam Workshop (when that's added).","April 18, 2014","true","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The lawlessness of it really makes it feel like you're playing a game with your friends, and really the entire playthrough of each game is entirely dependant on the integrity and self control of the party members. I don't really have too many complaints so far, and I also know this is still in beta however... I feel that this game needs a system that allows for more orginized play throughs. The only other things that I'd like to be changed/added would be the following.\nThis game really shouldn't market itself as a lawless game where you can just rage whenever, that's just the nonsense-type "fun" that is very temporary and well... it makes games boring quickly. (Especially in this "simulator" genre). In terms of the game and what it should provide, I do not know the intentions of the developers but these games are the real basic classics, they're very simple games and as much as I love them, i'd like to see some more elaborate-modern type games, heck even monoploy would be nice to see. I don't care if it's made up or based on another board game, I just want more of a variety with much more replayability then these classics. That's really what I feel this game needs. Lastly the game should have a GUI system, one to enhance the playability of game modes, be it one that issues money to players to add gambling, or something that could allow for further development of the games. That'd be great.\n\nOverall what I enjoy the most within this game is it's freedom, it allows for an intimacy and looseness that simulates real life board games with family and friends. It's physics are great. (I would only fix the perspective of the table to it's background (Which isn't really a big deal and has little to do with the physics). I just see that this game really has a lots of amazing potential. I know that this game is still in early access but i'd like for the developers to strongly consider at least some of these things. Thanks for reading through my "review" or rather rambling thoughts, I hope some of these suggestions come to the attention of the developers.","April 19, 2014","true","20.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But it captures the charm of actually sitting around a table playing a game, in a way that other online board games do not. Playing board games with friends is more about the social experience than about rock-solid competitive play IMO, so I'll take some clunkiness in exchange for that charm.\n\nThe workshop integration is awesome and also helps makes the game.","June 9, 2015","true","17.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Now that Table Top Simulator is out of E.A. I felt like I could write my review of the game. Table Top Simulator is a great sandbox! The community and mods are fantastic! I mainly use Table Top Simulator for my D&D group, during our sessions. All I need is Table Top Simulator, my laptop, and a TV. Using all the wonderful mods in Steam Workshop, I can create great 3-D dungeons, towns, and etc for my players. Uploading mods to the Steam Workshop is with ease, in my D&D group we have a player whose been working on models for our D&D games and exciting to see what she develops. Using Table Top Simulator is a great visual for encounters and dungeons, among a long list of other things.  We've even used Table Top Simulator for playing our D&D sessions even over the internet, all in the comfort of our own homes. It ran really smooth and there was little to no issues we encountered. The Dev's also release updates quite often and it's exciting what new content they add.\n\nI don't only use it for D&D, though that's what I mainly use it for. Users have been able to upload, in the Steam Workshop, actual board games. Such games as Star Wars: X-WING, Beytral At The House On The Hill, Settlers Of Catan, and etc. It makes playing games with friends easy and still as fun as if you all got together. I would be lying though, if I said it didn't take away the feeling of actually interacting with your friends and seeing their emotions. Although Table Top Simulator has made playing games with friends over the internet easy and fun, it still cannot replace the moments of sitting at your dinning table and playing all together. Given that, I would still recommend Table Top Simulator, 10/10.","August 2, 2015","true","137.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You'll think at first "is the price really worth it for a virtual board game?". You're not just buying a board game. You can play literally any board game you want with this and make up your own rules. Not only that but you can also play any card game at all be it Texas Hold 'Em or Magic the Gathering. You're even able to make and upload your own cards. Not only THAT but you're also able to build and manage your own dungeons and dragons roleplay session. The concept is there and they plan on expanding on it but as it stands it's probably the best virtual tabletop I've had the honor of playing Pathfinder on.

You can see where each player's cursor is, and you can drag and drop betting chips. You can chat easily during the game through voice or chat.

Rather than limit you to a series of 'planned' interactions with the 'game' the engine merely responds to how you move the pieces. So this is basically a true 'sandbox' in the sense that you can do whatever you want and the engine doesn't get in the way if possible. It might be a little frustrating for people who are looking for a dedicated poker game, or a dedicated chess game, etc etc, but for tabletop gamers....\n\nThere's an RPG set that looks like it can be used for D&D, GURPS, etc with an in-the-works 'character sheet;' could this seriously mean that D&D could move to virtual pen and paper?","April 21, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All without the mess and streamlined actions for dealing and cleaning up cards. It even has gravity settings and blocks to play with.\n\nFurther possibilities are added when you throw in board and deck importing into the mix. You're basically capable of playing any board game that exists as long as you or someone else knows how to make it. The possibilities are almost limitless, and this may even allow for new tabletop games to come to life, allowing for a potential whole new wave of board games.\n\nIt can be a brilliant game for classic tabletop fun or for complete hilarity, allowing you to do things you wouldn't normally be able to do in your house, and even allowing you to do table flips. It's your choice.\n\nProbably one of the most simplistically innovative ideas for a game out there. I recommend it to the highest degree.\nOh I almost forgot, make sure you have friends to play this with- you could always play online, but it's nothing like having you and a bunch of your friends at the same table messing around.","May 6, 2014","true","67.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yeah, there are sites online with that kind of stuff, but they're kinda lifeless.\n\nYeah, you can buy "Monopony" or whatever on Steam, but there's no online multiplayer.\n\nWith this Early Access simulator game, you can do whatever the hell you feel like, and you just pay once. Plus, if you're looking at this, chances are, you have a Steam account, as well as Steam friends.\n\nJust take a quick look at the workshop at the games people put. Monopoly, Cards Against Humanity, Risk, UNO, Scrabble, Candy Land, Sorry!, the list goes on.\n\nThere are even different themes for games. Nintendo Monopoly, Sonic Monopoly, Mass Effect Go Fish (I'm serious).\n\nBeing an Early Access game, things are being changed all the time and there's bound to be issues, but even in its current state, it's certainly worth a buy.\n\nIs there anything I wish could be changed? Well, yeah, a couple.\n1. Custom model imports for game pieces.\nEarlier I mentioned Monopoly. Well, there's no house models, so you have to do like Chess pieces or something in their place. There's also no cats, shoes, cars, or anything. Just standard game pieces. I think adding custom models would make things very neat.\n\n2. Adjust the gravity a little for certain objects.\nI notice when I turn the gravity up, the game pieces move like I want, but then the dice is a little heavy. Maybe there can be sliders for dice, coins, game pieces, and whatever else.\n\n3. Tags or Descriptions for game rooms.\nYeah, there's the name section, but people put their username or something silly there. Nobody puts what game it is. How about an extra section that lists the game from Workshop currently in use.\nLike: (Room name) (Host name) (Workshop item name)\nAnd if they're using a custom game, just let the user type in the game and that'll show.\n\nBut even without these, this is simply pure raw fun. Sure, the players have to enforce the rules, but that goes for real board games as well.\nRecommended for those who have online friends who you really want to play board games with.

I can think of no better game than Tabletop Simulator that mirrors this experience. With all the Steam Workshop items as well as the included content this game will give you hours of fun and excitement. If you are into board games this is a game for you!\n\nThere are some issues with this game that still need to be worked out. Currently, the multiplayer portion of the game is still somewhat broken. You can check out my frustrations with this multiplayer here ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/626329186887989015/ )\n\nLike any game on Steam that features multiplayer you WILL ecounter a troll/griefer. The one server I was able to get connected to turned on his mic to some of the most hideous screams, music, sounds, etc until we were able to kick and ban him. Thankfully, there is an option to remove/ban players. Also, if you haven't disabled table flipping there is the potential for someone to come into the game just to take everything out in one single table flipping move.\n\nWith all that said I still recomend this game. I have had so much fun playing that I turned three of my friends on to this game already. I look forward to seeing the multiplayer connectivity issues corrected in future updates and as always playing more community created content from the Steam Workshop.\n\nTL;DR\n\n+ Awesome Game\n-  Multiplayer has issues","December 17, 2014","true","314.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not for playing with random people online but rather for playing with friends or family. It's easy to use and with plenty of workshop content readily available, and if you are a little creative it is easy to create custom games or even invent your very own.\n\nThe only thing that it needs is ingame customizable time keeping, like a one-click x-minute timer and I'd be able to create any game I want in it.\n\nNow if only you could buy a bundle when you already own the game, then I'd be buying the crap out of this game to gift to all my friends.

I can think of no better game than Tabletop Simulator that mirrors this experience. With all the Steam Workshop items as well as the included content this game will give you hours of fun and excitement. If you are into board games this is a game for you!\n\nThere are some issues with this game that still need to be worked out. Currently, the multiplayer portion of the game is still somewhat broken. You can check out my frustrations with this multiplayer here ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/626329186887989015/ )\n\nLike any game on Steam that features multiplayer you WILL ecounter a troll/griefer. The one server I was able to get connected to turned on his mic to some of the most hideous screams, music, sounds, etc until we were able to kick and ban him. Thankfully, there is an option to remove/ban players. Also, if you haven't disabled table flipping there is the potential for someone to come into the game just to take everything out in one single table flipping move.\n\nWith all that said I still recomend this game. I have had so much fun playing that I turned three of my friends on to this game already. I look forward to seeing the multiplayer connectivity issues corrected in future updates and as always playing more community created content from the Steam Workshop.\n\nTL;DR\n\n+ Awesome Game\n-  Multiplayer has issues","December 17, 2014","true","314.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can see where each player's cursor is, and you can drag and drop betting chips. You can chat easily during the game through voice or chat.

Rather than limit you to a series of 'planned' interactions with the 'game' the engine merely responds to how you move the pieces. So this is basically a true 'sandbox' in the sense that you can do whatever you want and the engine doesn't get in the way if possible. It might be a little frustrating for people who are looking for a dedicated poker game, or a dedicated chess game, etc etc, but for tabletop gamers....\n\nThere's an RPG set that looks like it can be used for D&D, GURPS, etc with an in-the-works 'character sheet;' could this seriously mean that D&D could move to virtual pen and paper?","April 21, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Yeah, there are sites online with that kind of stuff, but they're kinda lifeless.\n\nYeah, you can buy "Monopony" or whatever on Steam, but there's no online multiplayer.\n\nWith this Early Access simulator game, you can do whatever the hell you feel like, and you just pay once. Plus, if you're looking at this, chances are, you have a Steam account, as well as Steam friends.\n\nJust take a quick look at the workshop at the games people put.

Well, yeah, a couple.\n1. Custom model imports for game pieces.\nEarlier I mentioned Monopoly. Well, there's no house models, so you have to do like Chess pieces or something in their place. There's also no cats, shoes, cars, or anything. Just standard game pieces. I think adding custom models would make things very neat.\n\n2. Adjust the gravity a little for certain objects.\nI notice when I turn the gravity up, the game pieces move like I want, but then the dice is a little heavy. Maybe there can be sliders for dice, coins, game pieces, and whatever else.\n\n3. Tags or Descriptions for game rooms.\nYeah, there's the name section, but people put their username or something silly there. Nobody puts what game it is. How about an extra section that lists the game from Workshop currently in use.\nLike: (Room name) (Host name) (Workshop item name)\nAnd if they're using a custom game, just let the user type in the game and that'll show.\n\nBut even without these, this is simply pure raw fun. Sure, the players have to enforce the rules, but that goes for real board games as well.\nRecommended for those who have online friends who you really want to play board games with. For 15 bucks, it's worth it.","May 25, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

True dedication and work has been put into this, and it truly does what it aims to do, and it continues to do it better.\n\nPROS:\nPlay with your friends.\nPlay the games you love (Monopoly, Munchkin, etc. Find them on the workshop)\nGreat piece control and system\n\nCONS:\nWorried about copyright issues as far as games being put up by users on the workshop.\nTrying to do multiple things at once(I.E. zooming in on a piece you are holding) tends to be buggy for now. Not a true issue though.\nInitial load into a room is slow even on a high end computer due to intensive memory load and image processing. After this there are no real problems.\n\nEDIT: The recent update (v2.7 on 9/19/2014) fixes many of the memory issues, so if this was holding you back from buying this, DON'T LET IT :D\n\nWhat I would like to see:\nCharacter sheet support\nPiece interaction support and health bars/stats applied to pieces. (I.E. Elf Attack-> Orc for 12 damage. -12 image over Orc, health bar, if known/visible, drains an appropriate amount.)\nEFFECTS! ALL THE EFFECTS! EXPLOSIONS! FOIL CARDS!

But it also allows you to run card games like Cards against Humanity, or Apples to Apples, or Uno, and again, many many others.\nAnd of course this game allows you to play any RPG dungeoun crawler/adeventure/Story-driven game your little heart can imagine. In my years of gaming, This is the most complete version of the physical, becoming the Digital. And i adore it.\n\nIf you like playing board games, RPGs, or card games AT ALL, play this game. Any gamer should play this game. Its the greatest thing gamers could ask for.\n\nAlso the graphics are really good...\n\n10/10 take all the tens!!!","May 20, 2015","true","212.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With some playful props thrown in and everyone chatting, It definately feels as close to sitting around a table as it can get without engaging webcams.\n\nThere'sd no AI so rules are not artifically enforced, if a player wants to cheat by moving out of turn or swapping the places of a Knight and a Rook - just like in real life - there's nothing stopping them but honest.  However, there are physics mechanics in play to keep objects from slopping around the board.  Pieces can be hard- and soft-locked in place so accidental nudging doesn't ruin a carefully laid board and pieces can optionally snap to a grid.  -  Just enough framework to allow things to work well and avoid chaos without being restrictive and 'too much like a videogame'.\n\nI highly recommend TTS to anyone who enjoys any manner of tabletop games.  I was skeptical but saw that the game had potential and am very pleased to say that it's lived up to my expectations and surpassed them.","September 25, 2015","true","187.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's no music, so supply your own if need be.  The sounds that do come up are nice and sound like they should.\n\nControl:\nI use keyboard/mouse, but it seems it also supports controller.  You can move anythign and everything around and there are no issues that I found.\n\nGameplay:\nThis is where the game shines!  Not only are there several games already included, it supports Steam Workshop, which has LOTS of user created games as well as full recreations of established boardgames such adn Monopoly and Risk!  There are so many, I don't think you could get through them all, though there are a few user created ones that you might wanna pass up for various reasons.  But with up to player 8 online support and extensive Hosting tools, you and friends will have a HUGE blast with this game!  There is even support for Dungeons and Dragons miniatures, so you can host an online D&D session, which is great for those who want to roleplay, but don't live near people who do!\n\nI urge everyone to get this game!

The base game includes your standard tabletop classics, including playing cards, dominoes, and chess and checkers sets, but you can download other games from the workshop, such as Monopoly, Uno, and Cards Against Humanity. While the singleplayer part of the game is fine, with things such as jigsaw puzzles and solitaire, the options are limited. Playing with at least one other person opens up many more options, such as Chess, Checkers, Go, and multi-player card games, and it's even more fun playing a big game with a group of friends or even with other random people online. At $20, the price is rather steep and it's probably a good idea to wait for a sale, but if you think about it, it only costs as much as an actual board game or two. That said, Tabletop Simulator is very good, and I recommend it. Play on!","March 17","true","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
