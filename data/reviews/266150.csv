The reason for the block is lag issues, this being a fighting game, lag from people across the globe will break gameplay.\n\nSecondly, if you see people who write reviews and only appear to have a few minutes of gameplay (myself and others), it's because we are veterans who have played the game long before steam, and due to technical issues cannot merge existing accounts with steam.\n\nAnyway, this is a great game, taking fighters for KoF, BlazBlue, and from Asian manga series. You have the capability to switch fighters at any time, equip gears found from other fighters onto your own for skill customization, which thus creates endless combo possibilities (sometimes a bit too much). There's PvP, PvE, Plazas, and HQ's, where you can invite friends in all cases. There's an in game market system akin to Steam's own, where you can buy other people's gears and sell your own, (even comes with taxes!).\n\nJust, just try it.","November 28, 2014","true","2.2"," 128 of 162 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","128","162","0","7"

I've played this well over 5k hours in the past 5 years and this is my most favorite game of all. I don't know why but it just is.\n\nThe graphics are very low key and good, even on my r7 250 im hitting 125fps on max settings. And even before I got a gaming computer this game was able to run an intergrated graphics card around 65 fps. Note: frame rates do drop at random moments in the game.\n\nThe community gaming. There is a giant gap of players who A) Played for years. B)Recently started playing. The difference is huge and growing. Admittedly at first this game isn't the most fun as I was once a newbie. But after time you just get good. You'll realize different stragies to play and win. Some will say it's a  PAY2WIN but it isn't. Since the major client update on September 30, 2014 that has been gone. When you start the game you will automatically get a select few of basic, but pretty sweet perm heroes. In lost saga we have what is called "Skill level" It arranges your matches to only play people within a certain range of your skill level. With Cadet being the lowest skill level and Admiral being the highest. Everyone has a different style of playing to tailor to their liking. Say you want to just spam/camp base, get a mage, like pressuring and fighting up close? Get a melee hero. Want a hero with a gun, get a ranged hero. Want one of those special mixed hero, get a special hero. Want to be a complete ♥♥♥, get a cyborg<<<< Everyone will complain about the hero you use so just ignore them. Also anyone can get very easily angered in game.\n\nRANDOM COMMENTS OFTEN FOUND IN GAME: "NEWB, NEWBIE, NOOB, N00B, LOSER, YOU'RE JUST SAD, YOU SUCK, HAHAHAHAHAHA, LAGGER, LAGGERS, LAG, SPIKE, INDO, INDO HACKER, RUNNER, SPAMMER, SPAM, PAY2WIN, PAY2LOSE, EW, DISGUSTING, TRASH,  SWAGGER, ZZZZ, SSS, FFS, SOME WORDS AREN'T FILTERED SO GOOD GAME,  ETC."\n\nONLY THING I DONT LIKE: The community itself varies. People can be nice but often idiots or just want to fight and don't care for talking.\nJust like Dota there are people from other regions that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game. Lag plays a very prevaliant part of this game. Often times hits are either not registered or delayed when hitting a lagger.They are called Indos(indonesian)  Which in my opinion is the only thing that ruins the game\n\nThere are 8 different game modes but you'll often find these: TDM, PRISONER (ONE LIFE PER ROUND), ADVENTURE MDOE, DAILY MODE, AND POWER STONE. Mostly you'll find farm rooms where you just chill. There are passive things you can do like fish in a plaza or go relicing for items(in game currency or gear)\n\nGears of this game: As with any hero you can have up to 4 epic or rare gears in the following order, weapon, armor, helmet, and trinket. The weapon is only epic and only for that type of hero. Say if you have a cowboy, it can only use an epic cowboy weapon. The armor, helmet, and trinket can be any rare or epic gears. Rare gears are not a part of a certain hero released already. Epic gears are the special gears of a hero, but do the same thing, the only differnce is that you are able to add stat points. Medals also add stat points, you are able to get up to 6 medal slots.\n\nOverall Game: 8/10 Community iffy, Gameplay fun as hell\n\nEdit:\nOverall Game: 9/10 Only game like it's on kind. If there honestly were another game built just like this one I would go try it out. But for the past years nothing has been like it. It maybe the reason why I like it so much.","November 25, 2014","true","6.0"," 72 of 96 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","72","96","0","7"

Although, in general, I wouldn't necessarily listen to what most people said about the bad reviews. Although a fair portion of it might be true, it's more-or-less extremely exaggerated, and for most of the given part, is taken with a little pinch of salt. Is this game "Pay to Win?". I can't lie here and say no, but saying yes would be just as much of a lie. You can easily play this game without spending a single dime and actually be able to compete with other players. For me, I have 56-58 permanent characters (none are under 15$), and I would say I paid for less than 5-10 of them. We're at the point where complaining about a game like this being "pay to win" isn't actually a legitimate argument.\n\nThere are tons (when I say tons, I mean tons) of events that give away free crap all the time. Most of them don't really even require effort, it's just that people don't bother doing them. At higher ranks, you can argue that this game is competitive to a level that it's utterly boring, but there are ways to go around that. Do you need to play with the highest ranked players? Hell no, grab a friend and do a 1v1, and play for freaking fun. My main concern is that everyone is fanatic over winning that they've become corrupted, psychologically insane and some may even be lunatics. But it's easy enough to avoid these kinds of players: every single damn game has these guys. There's a block button you know.\n\nTo address concerns that other people have been complaining about, I first must put this out for the public to realize: THIS VERSION IS MADE FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN SERVERS. DO NOT POST BAD REVIEWS IF YOU CAN'T ACCESS THE GAME BECAUSE YOU LIVE SOMEWHERE OFF THE COAST OF BRASIL OR INDONESIA. I swear, half the bad reviews were just foreign people unable to access this game's version. Yes, lag can also be a slight issue, but if you live on the Eastern coast of North America you should be fine. Only some people experience lag from the West coast. As for bugs/issues, this game does have quite a few, but they're nothing game-changing at all. I mean, slight text bugs? Unreleased styles? Unintended prizes? If you're going to complain about SUCH minor issues, don't even bother to play video games in the first place. Period. Go grab a book if you get that startled over such little things. Most bugs aren't big, but it may look like an issue, considering this game has quite a few.\n\nAlthough the purpose of this post was to tackle the certain complaints, if I were to conclude, I would say it's a great fighting game. Whenever I'm bored of playing shooters, action games, MOBAs or whatever it may be, I often find myself having a few matches on this game. Huge variety, uncomparable customization options, various modes and styles: it has all that's on my hit-list. Although it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're into cartoony/animated (or anime) inspired visuals, along with a huge variety and great action, then this game would be for you.","January 8, 2015","true","0.2"," 52 of 67 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","52","67","5","3"

I admit ignorance when confronted so instead of disliking my review and running off why not start an argument?\n\nTL;DR\n---------\n- Bad community\n- Pay to win\n- No support team\n- No balance\n- No skill is required to be good\n- To many bugs\n---------\nThe morons who give this game a positive review are idiots like me who spent over thousands of dollars into this game. Now before you click the funny button let me explain why.\n\n1. You must pay for the simplest of features. You cannot have a female avatar without paying real money. You cannot keep playing without paying real money. (No matter what anybody tells you this is factual. This has actually happened to me three times. Please correct me if they've fixed this in the comments.)\n\n2. They're plenty of events that may give you pretty cool gear but it's nothing compared to what they have in the shop. Gears that will switch locations with players across from the map. So all you have to do is jump off the edge and use the gear. Z8Games is smart doing this because the competitive players will patiently wait until the next week or so they release a gear to counter the previous. Thus making a endless cycle of addiction and paying to win. Another thing you will notice as a new player is that you can pick up gears that opponents drop. If it's a gear that somebody bought they will whine and complain in the chat about how much money it costed them for that one gear. What they tell you isn't a lie.\n\nPeople giving this game a positive review are fine with this aspect. (Which is why they're so many.)\n--\nBalance is another problem this game has that will never be fixed. This is impossible because of ways around the skill rank system and the amount of over powered gears that have already been given to players.\n\n1. Players are able to repeatedly join rooms and act as a noob getting damaged by enviromental hazards and jumping off the edge. When the game detects this it lowers a players skill level. This allows them to join rooms that new players have created.\n\nThis is the one thing aside from the pay to win that could somewhat make the game better if it was fixed.\n--\nGameplay is horrible.\n\nAll you'll be doing as a free player is PVP because the PVE is nearly impossible to beat. Also expect to just open hero scrolls and gear chests.\n--\nSo many ♥♥♥♥ing errors.\n\nWhen you try to delete anything it tells you to type a confirmation code. When you type it in it states that you're the one incorrect when it's literally impossible to decipher the text thats flying off the edge of the panel you read it on.\n--\nThis game in the past have had worse connection problems so I'm going to mildly criticize it on that.\n\n1. Instead of blocking a foreign ip address (don't ask me how it works, Korean Lost Saga managed to do it) if you're locale isn't set right you can't play the game.\n\n2. People with great connection are getting cannot operate.\n--\nThis game takes no skill to play.\n\nTo win in this game all you have to do is buy a premium hero and literally I MEAN LITERALLY throw your head back and forth on your keyboard.\n--\nHackers still exist, fishing gives you ♥♥♥♥, no support team, bad community and the game has little to no features.\n---------\nMoney spent: 2600$ +\n\nThere is nothing good about this game and it took me six years to realize it.

And over that time, I've watched the game evolve and flourish. Yes, there's been some missteps, but we're here, and the game is at it's best, the best it's been in a long time.\n\nFor starters, our current hosts, Z8Games, have given players the most stuff our of all three publishers (OGPlanet and WeMadeUSA being the other two). Z8Games regularly gives out chances to get style packages (let's you completely style out a hero regardless of style level restrictions. It also let's you choose to have the female gender). We also just today had a perm hero scroll in the attendance calendar, which gives a player a random permanent hero!\n\nWe also had a large game changing update recently that made the game a lot more newbie friendly. the first quest you do now gives you a scroll that lets you choose a permanenet hero of CHOICE out of a selection of heroes. Master modes of dungeons ALSO now give perm hero scrolls as drops, which means even more chances at free permanent heroes!\n\nNow, onto the part I'm sure you're wondering about. Is the game pay2win? With the current state of the game, I can honestly say it is not. With all the free stuff being given, a free player can get a lot of permanent stuff, as well as GOOD permanent stuff. I myself have gotten 18 free permanent heroes, and then paid for one (a premium, only available with cash). Now, while premiums and rares might only be available through cash, that doesn't make the game pay2win. Some of them are outright bad, and some of the better ones have a free hero that's as good as that rare or premium hero, so you can still compete.\n\nAll that said, I give this game my full seal of approval. I say give the game a shot. If you don't like it, chances are it just wasn't meant for you. After all, not all fighting games appeal to everyone. However, be considerate of others if you review the game. Even if you didn't enjoy it, others might as well.","November 28, 2014","true","0.4"," 50 of 68 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","50","68","0","0"

Same with items, you can buy items themselves in the normal shop, for 1+ day increments, tho, you can also use in-game cash, and a lot of it too, to buy permanent gear chests, and permanent <Insert clothing item here> chests. The normal chests have low chances of yeilding a permanent item.\n\nSpeaking of gear chests, don't worry too much about obtaining these, as you'll obtain plenty of them, by just playing the game, and logging in all the time! Seriously, every day, of every month, has a log-in reward, and if you log-in consecutively, you get rewards too! The consecutive log-in rewards reset at the start of a new month.\nSome of these log-in rewards can be gear chests, permanent gear chests, legendary chests, permanent legendary chests, oh, and my personal favorite, "+10 permanent gear chests/permanent legendary chests" which give you a permanent gear, with "+10" stats! And hey, the gears you don't like, save them up for use with a moderately cheap "gear mixer", where you plop in three gears of any kind, and get one new gear back!. Or you can use a "parts mixer", where you plop in three of the same kind of gear, and get a new gear back of the same kind of gear! Over the time you play this game, you can rack up some pretty sweet gear!\n\nCombat is pretty simple in the game, controls only consist of your arrow keys for movement, and your "asd" keys; A for jumping, S for defending/blocking, and D for attacking, you use different combos of these keys pressed together to trigger skills. Now, as I've just said that the key to attack is the D key, you'll find a lot of needing to press the D key.\n\nYou'll find that people complain a lot about spamming, when the only way to attack when your skills are recharging, is with the D key, there is no hidden attack with F, so complaining about spamming is just why.\n\nRemember, just because it has a cash shop, doesn't make it P2W. If that cash shop sold skill (Better D, and S smashing skills), then it'd be P2W.\n\nI know of many time's where the "Great Paladin" and his mighty hammer, were all it took, to smash a premium character into the ground (He's obtainable with the free permanent hero scroll you get after playing for a while). Heck, even the easy to obtain knight can kick some serious ♥♥♥, great defense, great speed, and a good skillset, including a passive skill, in reality, all the basic heroes in the game, can kick all the other hero's asses around. Again, the game isn't really P2W, it just has a cash shop that allows purchasing basically everything in the game if you are up for shortcutting ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMy main concern, would be, fixing the pricing of basically everything in the game. The heroes, for in-game currency, that is, seems just a tad bit pricy. And with real life dosh, buying one character, permanently, is about $15. They should really introduce, at most, $10 dollars or so, for characters that you've unlocked by leveling up, and $15 for characters you still need to level up to unlock. but hey, that's on them.\n\nOh, a really fun mode to play, is champion mode, essentially, 1v1 me bruh, where two fighters duke it out, till one loses, the winner stays in the ring, while the next challenger steps up, really fun!\n\nA lot of players giving this game negative reviews, have barely any hours into it, note, that they probably just assumed "CASH STORE, THE WORD PREMIUM IS BEING USED? I HAVE TO PAY TO "WIN" THE GAME AHHHGGGH BAD REVIEWS". Another thing to note, this steam version is for 'Murica and Canada for the most part, seeing how the steam editions title, includes North America in its god danged title.\n\nOh hey, speaking of it not being P2W. You get a permanent hero scroll near the beginning that lets you pick from 13 heroes, a second one later on that lets you pick from 20+ heroes, and then one when you reach level MSG 1, you get a "Permenent Hero Package" which lets you pick any non-rare, non-premium character from the game, and any hair, hair color, skin color, facial expression, and, yes, some sexy underwear.\n\nOH hey, want proof of all the free stuff you get?\nI've thought of it, and added some screenshot links below!\n-permanent scrolls just for playing: http://puu.sh/dw2zc/004b74ba72.jpg\n-lots of permanent gears, from free perm. gear chests: http://puu.sh/dw2zc/004b74ba72.jpg\n-[Most Recent Screenshot] All of my perm. heroes were free, and all the gear they have equipped are permanent gears I've gotten for free!!: http://puu.sh/htLlg/54f76a3660.jpg\n\n[TL:DR]\n\nMy overall rating for the game, and all its parts, is:\n\n7/10. Could be improved, could be much worse.\n\n+NOT P2W (You can use real dosh, but real dosh isn't required to be victorious)\n+Defi. NOT P2W (Money doesn't magically make you stronger, or more skilled, then your opponents)\n+Easy combat\n+Lots of free stuff thrown at your face over time\n+Lots of quick fun\n+Champion mode is an especially fun side-view 1v1 standard fighting style game-mode\n+Basic heroes can hold their own when up against later unlocked characters, and even against 'premium' characters, and 'rare' characters.\n+Ability to use your own heroes can determine the outcome of a skirmish, instead of just the heroes\n+++++You get four permenant heroes, just for playing the game for a while.\n\n-Overly expensive items, both in-game currency-wise, and IRL dosh-wise\n-the ability to buy basically everything in the game, for IRL dosh, allowing hella shortcuts, tho, SHORTCUTS DON'T MEAN YOU PLAY WELL, so ayyy lmao.\n\nAyyyy thanks for reading if ya did. This is basically my thoughts with the game so far, and I'll probably be putting in many more hours into it. I'll update it every couple of patches to the game, depending on any improvements to the cash store, or any devolvements to the game.\n\nKeep in mind, my high hour count, compared to a lot of people who have bad reviews of the game, but barely have put any hours into it!\n\n(On top of whatever my current hour total is on steam, prior to this, I've put in roughly 250+ hours into it, before hitting steam)","December 8, 2014","true","417.4"," 42 of 57 people (74%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","74","42","57","8","1"

Each one of these has an "epic" version that you can put on another mercenary, except for the weapon.

But...I can't recommend this to anyone, veterans or newbies, on account of several issues, major and minor.\n\nFirstly, that this can be seen on non-North American Steam storefronts is -very- bad, as several have already experienced region locks. If TERA can have a European page for so very long, while it's North American counterpart never had one until last month or so, Lost Saga can be taken down from the non-NA Steam storefronts. That should be a simple matter of contacting Valve and asking it to be done.\n\nSecondly, anyone who had played Lost Saga before and were hoping they could get playing again via Steam can drop those thoughts right now. You can only link new accounts to Steam, not old accounts. The reason they give for this is mostly bull, something about technical issues, but most Free to Play games here on Steam freely have linking, allowing new and old players alike to log on to their accounts using the Steam version of their launchers and clients. Why can't the same be done here? Just having this -not- be a thing is a detriment to the game.\n\nThirdly, if you have your computer set to Japanese locale, you can't play the game. Period. AppLocale won't work either. I don't know the reason for this. X-Trap, the anti-cheat software used in Lost Saga, detects your locale and if it isn't set to English, it locks you out of the game. This makes zero sense. Why would it lock you out of playing the game for having Japanese locale? Some games here on Steam require the locale to be set to Japanese to function properly, and all of them run in English locale as well (though with issues) instead of locking you out of the game. There is -no excuse- for having X-Trap locking you out of Lost Saga, and considering the wide array of games available on Steam, having one that explicitly locks you out of the game is a -very- stupid move.\n\nAs for the cash shop, it's quite bad. I don't know about pay to win, since there are usually enough events going on throughout the year to throw free stuff at people, but the cash shop could be better than it is right now. But the serious issues are the above three.\n\nIf you are interested in playing, you need to take real care to make sure that your locale is set to English, and that you are a brand new player. If you are a veteran, don't bother touching the Steam version since you can't use your account on it. If you are in a region-locked area, I'm sorry that the game being shown in your area is teasing you (though really, it says NA right in the title, use your eyes), and I'm hoping that can get rectified.\n\nSmilegate, this is a disgraceful way to launch the game on Steam. The X-Trap issue has been known ever since the game launched under Z8Games, and it was never addressed even up until now? And now that the game is on Steam, you have the gall to alienate us veteran players by not allowing us to use our old accounts on Steam? I had such high hopes for coming back after this hit Steam, but now I'm just disappointed. Very disappointed.","December 1, 2014","false","0.2"," 110 of 183 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","110","183","6","17"

I spent literally years lying to myself about how great the game was. I just quit recently because after all this time I got fed up with it.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Pay to win: You must throw your wallet at the screen to be even competitive in this game. While I played, my main was the Dark Shaman and it was a low tier character I completely dominated with. Main reason is that I had to buy certain gears to keep him viable as the game devolved into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ basicly money only game. The main people I see voting for this game are most likely people fine with this aspect and have already spent a ton of money. To them, there's no point in quitting since they've already invested a large amount of funds in this product.\n\n2. There's no point in the characters this game showcases. You could easily just make an avatar and outfit him or her with whatever style or gameplay you choose. You want a magic character, give him a staff, you want a ninja, pick the kunai, and etc. If they had made the game to where you couldn't interchange different character gear and only able to use gear you bought, the game would be perfectly fine. But guess what, you can; making the point of having such characters moot and pointless.\n\n3. The game seems to force you to pvp. Reasons:\na. Lags like hell during crusade and other pve modes.\nb. exp gain is slow compared to playing with someone for a couple of hours.\nc. The difficulty in Adventure mode is unbalanced to where the only way you get a somewhat adequate exp gain is to do Master with a bunch of people.\nd. Party with people at your own risk. If you don't play with friends, you may get leeches that hang back while you fight everything. It's just not worth it in the greater scheme of things.\n\n4. If you aren't a veteran, you're pretty much screwed. The main reason is that certain gears people own showcase an incredibly OP ability that's either hard to dodge or difficult to counter. You're also faced with people with stats in the 100s in which you can only beat by some obscure tactic that involves a gear you missed out on. The thing is, if they hadn't dragged their feet on getting this game to steam, this problem probably wouldn't be that bad. Coupled with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ room rank finding system, new players would run before they sat around long enough to dig their heels into the experience and just roll with it.\n\n5. ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community. 9 times out of 10 you will come across a shitbird that has his ego so far up his ♥♥♥ that he believes he can beat anyone and raises a complete ruckus wherever he goes. How do I know this? I was at one point said shitbird with an ego to match it. But at least I wasn't all talk like so many others. I could back up whatever I said with force. I was however, helpful and nice to newer players and took it easy. The fact still remains though, that there are people like me and people much worse than me.\n\n6. Too many farm rooms. To get past the slowpacedness of this game, even the veterans farm. I never took part in it as I preferred to suck it up and do crusade or fight people. About 90% of the rooms you'll see in the queue are farm rooms. Anyone that states otherwise is full of crap. Even the people that have put more time into leveling their characters than I, farm their asses off to do so. In that sense, there's not really much accomplishment.\n\n7. Slow leveling. One actually has to fight at least 8 hours out of a day and win the majority of his matches in a large room to make headway once you get past lvl 30. If you don't want to do this, you can sade or adventure with possibly unreliable people or you can just fish. This is the slowest leveling method of all.\n\n8. Premium characters: Iori, Kyo, Mai, and Project K are probably the characters that you'll encounter most when playing other people including the veterans. Along with Staff Master and Destroyer, all 6 of these characters make the game even more pay 2 win. You can literally, I mean literally throw your face in the keyboard and win these characters. Which once again, makes the game even more pay2win since 4 are premium and 2 you can buy to bypass the rank restriction.\n\n9. The events are crap. Sure, you get certain things to sort of catch to those that have been playing forever, but these events are far in between the instances where they update the shop with new gear everyone runs out to buy.\n\nAll in all, I put myself through a lot with this game. I had a total of about 60+ characters and 200-300+ pieces of gear in this game. I survived the transfer when OGP didn't give us our crap and bought, all of my crap back again. I'm telling you this from experience. This is former Dark Shaman master DarkShamanTazuna/Ace~Of~Bunnies telling you that, if you want to save a few bucks to play something better and not as p2w, run as fast as you freaking can because you will be left with nothing but an empty feeling and an empty wallet. Hell, I'd suggest LoL or Dota2 over this mess. RUN! You can't even call this review biased because I spent an incredible amount of time in this game and almost ruined my marriage over this. I had that amount of stuff in OGP and in Z8. If anything, I'd say I was being super objective. The fact that this was allowed on Steam is rather appalling if anything else. The only people that gave it a thumbs up were majority veterans that have played before it came here. Steam is a home to me and with this release, it feels like my home was violated by this hobo.\n\nIf there was anything I had to say that was good about this game, it would be that if you are able to make friends cherish them and play with them as much as you can or that they'll be available for. I made some extremely good friends while I played and I do miss them. However, I have no intention of returning anytime soon.","December 5, 2014","false","0.1"," 38 of 56 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","38","56","2","2"

The beginning quests give you a ton to start with as well.\n\nBasically the game works on leasing characters (time is in-battle not real time) and in terms of costs while it might be hard to save up a lot of money for other items and have a lot of time on a lot of characters left they give plenty of money (I have combined over 50 hours of play and still enough money to buy some cosmetics).\n\nIt's free to play so not surprisingly some characters (maybe 1/5th of them?) are premium (cost real money) as well as the option to buy a character permanently which as I mentioned isn't really needed at all it's just nice to have. Almost all of the cosmetics can be bought with in-game currency as you level up but if you don't want to wait you can use real money to buy them at any point.\n\nGameplay-wise it's pretty fun, nothing amazing but it's lighthearted not something I'd consider competitive. There can be some lag issues but I'd say most of the time it's not more than a minor issue.\n\nOverall I'd say try it for maybe an hour or two and see if you like it, try the different modes (prisoner is fun).

Avoid right now. After a few matches with the fellow rookies you'll be thrown into games with the players that been at this for years, and you will lose. A lot. Stripping what fun there is to this game.\n\nThey claim that with events and dailies you'll be geared up and ready to take on everyone, which is a lie. You'll need to get really lucky with the RNG chests to give you the gear that could be even remotely useful. And when it comes to heroes, you'll need to get a certain combo of heroes to even stand a remote chance against your opponents. All the premium "fun" heroes are going to cost you either actual money or a ton of grinding in the PVE, which is another RNG timesink. The hero scrolls given to you will give you a hero at random, some are good, others you may like, but the concept of play to your style is a lie against the meta crowd.\n\nGameplay can be fun if you run into the right people. All the qualities of a brawler with a so-so combo system. Only so-so due to connection problems and odd hit detection for unknown reasons. I can play most of the games I own without any lag but somehow i'm stuck on 1-2 bars in LS, and I live in the US. If you're running on wireless or don't have decent enough speed, don't bother playing. Add to it the "pros" that have the hero combos that will stunlock you into eternity. The community claims Cyborg is the way to go to counter this play, but the veterans have a counter for it and will shut down and mock you for using Cyborg.\n\nThe community itself is riddled with unhelpful toxic players that will mock you for the slightest hiccup and will insult you non-stop, win or lose. If you make one complaint against this game you will be met with LS defense flame. Just as terrible as most MOBAs out there.  You have those few that are friendly, but good luck spotting them.\n\nThis game must of been good at it's original release, but now it's infested with a terrible P2W system and a toxic elitist community. So to the new, poor, or those with not alot of time on their hands, avoid this game.

The customization is also amazing. Being able to use image software to recolor and redesign your own gear is perfect for individualists like myself. The only problem is it is addicting. I played since 2011. Spent around $600 USD on the game and the company shut down. I'm about $400 USD maybe more in now over the past 2 years. It is good if you do not spend a dime on it. Over time there will be free events to get heroes, legendary gears, and more. If you do spend money, just buy rare heroes. They dont come by that often. People say this game is pay to win, but it is really experienced based. Experience + powerful gear + high stats most-likely will net you a win. Take away the experience and a skilled player using a new account will probably win. Objective is mainly to learn what all the heroes do and how to counter them. Also to set up a strategy when going into battle. I really like this game obviously, but I wish I never heard of Lost Saga to be honest. I have a life outside of Lost Saga and this game sometimes interferes with it. It is everything I would want in a game, but it is so addicting that I feel trapped playing for hours, despite the new alert that goes across the screen every hour of playtime.

Lost Saga offers over 60+ characters to play as and enjoy. Theres a hero for everyone out there! A common complaint is that the game is 'p2w' however that really is not the case whatsoever. With the major system update, the NA quests have been brought to the original prizes of the mother game. Newcomers to Lost Saga can expect 2 free permanent heroes of their choice using 'permanent basic scrolls' relatively early on for playing the game. The events award players a variety of style items, gears, and other in-game items. The log-in system utilized in Lost Saga awards player for logging in daily and theres even a special prize for logging in for 5/10/15/20/25 days. With plenty of game modes, tons of customization, this game certainly has something for everyone. However, no publisher is perfect the game does have its latency issues, text problems, and other errors that other games experience from time to time. Most major problems are resolved in a timely manner. For fans of fighting games, you've found your haven. Come to Lost Saga, and experience for yourself why we play 'on another level'. Give the game a decent try, and you'll see it can be quite fun :D","November 25, 2014","true","0.4"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","22","37","0","0"

I was happy to play it, I was always excited when there was an update, and any time I encountered a problem, I was quick to find the bright side and even come back later. I held four accounts over the years and passes between companies and servers, and I had numerous heroes and gears, some rare and hard to get. Every little part of this game made me happy.\n\nHowever, that has all come to a slow, painful, depressing stop. It started when I was first ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by the original owners all but dropping the game on this side of the world. However, it passed. I brushed myself off with no troubles and simply resolved that it merely wasn't meant to be. I was even overjoyed when I heard that it was picked up again, and I was one of the first to sign up for the new one. Even having to make a completely new profile because of a foolish and easily rectifiable error by the company only gave me momentary pause. I was just happy to play again. But that's where it started to feel a little stale. Well, the game continued to fall down in the world's eyes, even to the point of the US server being excluded from an international tournament. That was when I first questioned how much I really loved this game. Still, I loved what it was, and I especially loved what it still had the potential to be. And when it lost this new carrier, I was mortified. I remember actually being depressed about it for a while. As you can imagine, this kind of embittered me to mmo's in general, and I fell out of a lot at the time. Well, it was with that still-bitter eye that I noticed the game had been passed off again. By this time, I was less than convinced that it would last, and so I entered in again with full intentions of not getting attached so I wouldn't care as much when it was inevitably abandoned again, but I always held out that hope that it wouldn't. Surprise surprise, it was axed again. Very unceremoniously this time, too. I'd given up on it by this point, so when I found out that the game had been put out on Steam, I was actually pleasantly surprised, and believed this meant it was for once here to stay. I jumped back in and played along, even enjoying all the new features and events.\n\nAnd you know what? The game is still fun. It is unique and fun to play, and the concept is still pretty novel, as far as I'm concerned. I'd even agree that the pay to win model is fixable with hard work, dedication, and lots of effort.\n\nSo if I still like the game, why's this review negative? Simple:\n\nThe community is one of the most toxic I have ever experienced in my life, and the people in charge of the game do absolutely nothing about it. The best there is to deal with it is a block feature that does nothing before a match except keep you, and only you by the way, from reading anything they type, and a poorly made censor that messes up perfectly reasonable words because it looks for a sequence of letters instead of watching for the word itself. You can't even say Assassin. It comes out ******in. That is BS. So if you come across a person that is harassing the crap out of you? Block his text and pray the fight ends soon, because there's nothing else you can do about it. Oh sure, you could report him, a function which apparently only works in selective situations. But I have yet to see that do anything whatsoever, and that leads me to further believe the devs do not care at all.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a fantastic game with a fantastic concept that has been completely driven into the ground by obnoxious little brats that are finding and enjoying irritating the crap out of any person that they come across since there are no repercussions whatsoever for being a ♥♥♥♥ in the game. Even League of Legends is more diligent about following their rules, and I don't think I need to expand on that, do I?\n\nTL;DR:\nDo you want to play a fun game? This is one.\nDo you want to play a fun game with a nice and supportive community that actively want you to keep coming back to enjoy it with them? GOOD FREAKING LUCK FINDING ONE HERE!\nFor the love of whatever kind of religion or lack thereof you follow, do not play this game. Do not sink hours, weeks, years of your life in what has become a doomed game like I did. Go play something else.","June 1, 2015","false","209.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","4"

It's addicting, fun, and it passes time pretty well.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of downsides.\n\nThe community is good enough, its a 50/50 good/bad community with half of them being offensive and smug, and the other half either silent or okay.\n\nThe day this game connected to steam, everything fell down.\n\nFirst off, MANY, I repeat, MANY players have experienced a server breakdown when opening a game.\nWhether it be Could not connect to server [2]/[5] or loading screen failures, It. Will. Not. Load.\nZ8 Games is unresponsive, and does not help many players with it b/c other players are doing just fine. Lets just assume that since 90% of the players are playing okay, we can just ignore the 10% who cannot open the game and have tried for over 3 weeks. Oh wait, remember that ticket they sent? Awwww.. Lets just send them a fake message, "The issue has been fixed. Should it continue, please submit another ticket." Hilarius.\n\nBecause Dev's just ignore you and assume that its okay.\n\nThe network for steam and lost saga is messed up.\nAnd It will always be messed up.\nI think approximately, there are over 3 errors within 2 weeks.\n\nThat's 6 errors in 1 month.\n\nThis game is amazing, trust me. The game play is legit, fun, and its a overall great made game.\n\nBut if lost saga is going to ignore these errors, who am I to say but disapprove. The community makes the game, pays for the game, and keeps the game here.

Not to mention the INSANE amount of customization this game offers in terms of hero skills and visual design.\n\nI will highlight that one of the main challenges to the game seems to be the learning curve. Many veteran players are extremely skilled and will crush any new players they happen to run into, HOWEVER there IS a system in place so that you are generally playing with people around your skill level (not to mention tutorials + guides to help newcomers).\n\nAlso, as this is a F2P game there are obviously cash sinks and some of the prices are viewed as a bit high - however with the amount of goodies players get from simply playing and leveling up coupled with weekly events, there is never a sense of, "Oh, I can't win a fight without spending money." No - skill is everything in this game.\n\nSome features I will highlight about the game:\n\n- Fighting system includes: basic attacks, combo attacks, input attacks (hard combos), blocking, counters, air attacks, and more depending on your hero.\n- Lobby system w/ multiple rooms to join.\n- Massive selection of Heroes (80+) and they consistently release new heroes keeping the game fresh.\n- Each hero has a unique fighting style and are categorized by: Melee, Ranged, Magic, & Specialist.\n- You can customize each hero with 4 pieces of 'gear' which grants them new abilities depending on the gear. This allows you to create a hero that fits your preferred playstyle, the possibilities are near endless.\n- Multiple fun game modes including: Team Death Match, Ghost Tag (basically Tag/Manhunt), Champion Mode (1v1), Faction War (Guild Battles/Ranked fights), PvE dungeons, and more.\n- Ranking system + Skill Rating System.\n- There are friendly plazas where you can hang out and chat with other players and do side objectives such as fishing or relic hunting which yield rewards.\n- Constant events by the publisher which usually yield pretty good rewards.\n- You can upload your own textures and apply them to your hero's gear using an item called 'Gear Design', as you play the game you'll notice a lot of amazing custom textures players have made themselves.\n- Controller support!\n\nTo conclude - if you are a fan of action games and enjoy the idea of a casual brawler where you can jump into the fray in just a few clicks - then give Lost Saga a try!","November 26, 2014","true","91.2"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kunoki/recommended/266150/","Kunoki","Touch Fluffy Tail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kunoki/","60 products in account","This game is going to be extremely frustrating for brand new players, especially those that leap right into the Daily Mode room the first chance they get. Similar to any fighting game, those that play longer get used to the game's quirks and know exactly how to use them. If this is your first time playing, just TRY TO HAVE FUN. Don't worry about winning, because there is no way you can close the skill gap in a day. Find a hero you love and play the hell out of it.\nThat being said! I have a few tips for you new players:\n1) This is a team game. Throw away that lone wolf mentality. This isn't Smash Brothers.\n2) Even if you aren't the best player on your team, try to protect all of your allies equally. If you see a teammate getting attacked, go help them!\n3) Items can have a huge effect on the way you play your character. Look for a weapon and set of basic attacks that you like. Any character can wear anyone else's armor. The only thing you can't change is the weapon.\n4) If you enter higher level rooms, you'll encounter players who use [Swapping]. This is the rapid changing of your heroes to quickly use powerful skills to rapidly take down an enemy. It takes time and effort to learn, but it isn't hard to do. It can be frustrating to fight against, but any good teammate can stop them mid combo.\n5) Again, HAVE FUN. That comes first. Lost Saga has a LOT of modes to play in. Some are 1v1, some are 4v4. Some are against com players and some are like a strange LoL or Dota style with objectives and towers to destroy. This game has variety. Don't force yourself to play a mode you don't like.\n\nThat being said, if you want to enjoy this game, treat this game like Dota 2 or LoL. Block almost everyone you meet before they have a chance to open their mouth. The entire community is extremely toxic. There are no exceptions. People with extremely warped personalities and massive insecurities inhabit this game. Anyone above the rank of 1LT is more than likely a rager and make up every excuse possible as to why they lost. Anyone with a skill rank above 1LT will most likely be abusing every overpowered gear possible and use kill combos that take you from full HP to zero. If you, too, are a hateful, raging masochist, you'll feel right at home. Otherwise, stay the ♥♥♥♥ away.","November 26, 2014","true","13.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

I've played this since it came out. (Not on Steam, the original launcher) Lost Saga has is a very unique battle system it's simular to Rumble Fighter or GetAmped2 but the difference is when you health is down, instead of dying instantly you drop your gears then die. You and cluch a 1v1 if someone is half health and you have no health.\n\nAnd the Characters are called "Heros" (Used to be called "Mercenaries") Their all different unlike other MMOFighters, all of them are different with their own combos, skills and gears. Let's start with Sword Master, next to his weapon skill he has a gauge and when it's charged he summons 5 swords behind his back once you attack, they attack. Or Earthbreakerhe also has a gauge but this time you hold it and when it's ready you create a hole that a enemy can fall in. But when you first start playing Lost Saga theres gonna be a tutorial of how to play the game right (You also start off with Shadow Assassin)\n\nI've been reading ALOT of these reviews saying "This game is P2W, the battle system is weird, the community is salty. I can go on & on about this. You MAY think this game is P2W because of the Premiums & Rares but it's a choice if you want buy them because you can get them for free you can get them in many ways in Christmas, Easter, Bingo, Capsule events. You can get them by Farming, Daily Log-in or doing Daily Quests. I got Maid and Earthbreaker for doing that.\n\nThe bugs and glitches may be a problem for the people that want to play serious on Lost Saga but finding these Glitches and Bugs are pretty fun to do. On a plaza you can switch to another hero and press "Relic" at the same time and you'll exit out of "Relic" and if someone is going to attack you, they can't but you can hit them. The camera glitch randomly happens when you win/lose a match with cinematic mode on and the screen wll twitch left, right, up or down, also this last glitch that I know when a match starts you can't charge you gauge, can't go on cinematic it fixes itself when the enemy spawns in.\n\nBut really Lost Saga is a really fun game, the touneys are underrated which have an alright prize when you win, and the game itself is underrarted. And Z8Games is struggling to keep their player/supporters maintained in their game, but in 2017 Lost Saga is going to another company (We'll transfer our account to the next company OGPlanet messed up that one time) And if the company is wealthy or well to maintain Lost Saga the Hero update might get shorten to every week instead of every 2 weeks.\n\nI hope you finish reading my review to the start 'til the end. It really helps me for someone that actually notice my review. Also if this review got you the atleast same way I did, please like this review, 'til then bye! :D","May 8","true","23.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It plays alright, with A, S, and D keys acting as combo buttons, with A as jump, S as guard and D as attack, and different combinations of those three keys (A+D, S+D, for example), activates one of four unique skills for each hero.  There are a LOT of heroes in this game, including a few licensed ones, the only problem is they are all locked behind a paywall.  You CAN access heroes free as random drops or by obtaining or purchasing an item with in-game currency that grants you permanent access to a new hero from a short, random list.  However, all other hero purchases with the in-game currency called GP are rentals that las for 2, 4, and 10 hours.  This is rather disappointing because the few heroes I played are fun, but the fact that I either have to pay, re-rent or rely on luck to keep playing them is just a shame.\n\nLost Saga is lobby-based, so fans of games like DFO will feel comfortable here.  Once you've selected your desired mission or PVP event, you enter a lobby to wait for more players or you can enter a dungeon solor by locking out other players with a password or by using the matuchmaking options.  From there, things are pretty straightforward.  You fight trash mobs, you defeat mini-bosses or towers and doing so turns those into towers for your side, attacking enemies or spawing AI allies to aid you in combat.  It's not a bad idea and it works well.  The gameplay is frenetic, forcing you to think fast, but can mostly be won by simply spamming attack and the occasional powerful skill when it's not on cooldown.  Once you beat the boss, you get a random reward based on performance and then are dropped back into the lobby.  This system isn't as well polished here as it is in other lobby-based MMO's, but the dungeons are much faster, so it doesn't feel so grindy, at least not at first.\n\nA final and minor gripe is the constant pop up balloons from quests and help dialogues that plague the start of this game.    You will click through twenty or more little reward and dialogue balloons just from completing the most pedestrian of tasks, and it gets old.  The writing, which attempts to be clever, is bad and the presentation is just lazy, as all of this dialogue is just pasted on a yellow or blue popup.","November 27, 2014","true","0.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Too many issues that make players quit playing: Unstable servers, major emphasis on pay to win, and a not so friendly community, just to name a few. Yet there is a reason I keep coming back and that is LS's mechanics.\n\nLost Saga's mechanics rank up there with the best games out now, AAA and Indy alike.\n\nFirst there a hundreds of characters/heroes/mercenaries with specific skills and moveset. The movements and skills of these characters are easy to grasp and even the more complicated ones can be mastered with time.\n\nSecond LS has this "gear drop" ability, where the armors can be knocked of characters and can be used by opponents. It's hard to describe in words, so play the game to find out :D.\n\nThird Lost Saga has a hero for everyone. Are you someone who likes to fight close range, mid range, or far range? There's a hero for you and with the ability to mix and match gears you can create a hero set/style specific to you and works only for you.\n\nLost Saga is not a perfect game, yet if you find a group of friends to play with and take time to learn and master your heroes, the experience will be mostly positive.

I first found out about this game through a friend mainly because there was BlazBlue characters in here and after seeing Jin Kisaragi being in here, automatically had me sold at this game.  The very first days of playing Lost Saga wasn't so bad but, while I was playing with friends as the days passed on.  It was very clear to me that the servers were an issue to me in which it resulted into me or my friends being dropped from private lobbies, non-steam players insulting us for no particular reason and the premium character's (I purchased Jin for almost 20$!!) prices were ridiculous.  Although its a fun game in it's own right, I personally believe that this game is overall meh and that's including the combat system, pointless fishing for random stuff, and repetitive missions.  In my honest opinon this game gets a 3.5/10.  This kind of gameplay does not appeal to everyone and gets boring after a while too.","March 29, 2015","false","28.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I first started playing the game when it was owned by OGPlanet, a company which had alot of Korean titles available for North America with American servers. I played the game for about 2 years before the game got transfered to WeMade games, then later too z8 games which it is currently available now. Anyways Lostsaga is a Brawler with very few fighting game mechanics like "Inputs", and combos. The game has a unique fighting system where as you can swap characters mid match to make combos and aid your current situation.  These characters are called "heroes" and there are roughly 100 characters at this time of the review. These heroes can be bought permanetly or timed. Here is one of the main issues with the game, even though Z8 does give out many rewards for simply logging in, I think the cash shop is broken. There are certain characters you can only get by paying REAL money, and the same thing goes with items. Is the game pay to win? Not quite, but some of the items are unfair that can only be purchased with real money. One of the many things that makes this game unplayable is the Net code which is deal breaking for a fighter/brawler. This game has a terrible time keeping everyone at 4-5 bars and if your internet isn't great you WILL lag like crazy. Which reminds me about the bugs.... This game has so many silly bugs, its mind blowing that the devs still haven't fixed some of them. The bugs range from randomly disconecting from a dungeon or the game closing for NO BLOODY REASON. I think this game has and will always have potential, but the Heroes and items need balancing and the net code is AWFUL. I honestly think the devs are holding the game back, but that is my unpopular opinion. What the game does right is when you CAN hit someone is feels satisfying, and the gameplay feels unique as in you can find a game like this anywhere else. But thats about it. Is it good for a free to play game? Definitely. But as I said the shop feels unfair and the Net code brings it down.\n\n\nTL:DR\nPros:\nCombat feels unique\nMany characters to choose from\nExtra content like fishing/relic\nUpdates for heroes constantly\n\nCons:\nAwful netcode\nUnfair balancing\nQuestionable shop\nDisconnections for days\nToo many crashes\nSo-So Graphics\nSlighty below decent community\n\n\n5/10 - Decent","February 18, 2015","false","83.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Instead of actually fixing major game breaking problems, they add in a new character every two weeks for way too much.\nThe Translation is terrible, most descriptions for items in the shop get cut off so there's no way to understand them, lots of items, and quests are just lines of question marks. Serveral maps are just horrible to play in due to the large amount pit falls. The servers are way too small and have constant problems. Often times you'll just get disconnetted as soon as you log in. PvP can be way imbalanced due to clear favorism by the devs (ex. the maid, desert blader, Grim Reaper, and succubus are way too powerful, especially the maid.)\nPvE is a nightmare, Easy is like baby sauce and Master is like get shoving a metal sponge up an opening in your body, "you can choose which one, and get to find out which one hurts less, I suggest getting some help though." and don't get me started on Crusade. The controls are erritating, It's better to play this game on a controller, but you can't put all the controls on your controller like "potions" "accept" or "any way to use a single menu", so you'll have to keep close to your keyboard.\nBut at some points the game has it's cool points. Sometimes events are nice as they give you a lot of good items. The graffics aren't anything big, but it looks good, so I can run on almost all computers. Upgrading you heroes is cool (although not a lot of chance is apparent). Geting to play the characters by renting them and unlocking more by ranking up is great, the item calander is an amazing idea, and how they handled the permanent gear is perfect.\nThe fact you can change Permanant gears texture by uploading a custom .jpeg is probably the coolest thing I've seen in this game. Unfortunatly, all this cool stuff is pointless if the game gets infuriating, boring, or unplayable.\n\nBad Connection, Terrible Difficulty, and very confusing.\n3/10","January 25, 2015","false","115.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The main complaints I've heard about LS on Steam are A) it is too "pay to win", B) the community is offputting, and C) the game forces you to do pvp.\n\n(A)\nI didn't transfer my account from when the game was still on OG so I had to start over and, just from experiencing the game from the start this time, I'd say it is much less "pay to win" than it was back in the OG days. If I remember correctly, back then you didn't get any perm hero to start with and just had to work with hires until you bought a perm. Now however, you get to choose from a dozen or so heros to pick as your first perm after you clear the tutorial stuff. Some people will say that to get a "good" hero you need to pay real money and while that is the case if you want a premium or any kind of perm hero I don't think the ones you're given to choose from initially are bad for any stage of the game if you use them right (I knew a friend back in OG LS that used death knight as their main all through their game). I also know from experience that some of these "good" heros you need to buy are also tricky to play as and, if they were included in the initial perm hero list, would just end up frusterating the people that chose that hero without knowledge of how to play it well. From what I've seen, most of the initial perm heros are fairly easy to play as off the bat.\n\nI'm probably rambling and may have repeated myself once or twice, so I'll move on to\n\n(B)\nOk, some people in a free online game are mean to you, so what? I challenge you to find one free to play online game where the majority of the people in the chat are just idiots trying to insult people. As a veteren of online gaming I have this to say: suck it up, ignore idiots, and enjoy the game. If you want to chat with nice, non-trolls all you need to do is make a public plaza, weed out the idiots that join, ask the kind players to be friends, and eventually you'll have a group of awesome people you can do crusade with or pvp with or whatever.\n\n(C)\nI've heard that because of the way the game is made, how the modes are set up, etc, the game pretty much makes you do pvp. This isn't true. I've played the game (Steam version) for about 3 hours now and haven't done one PvP match. I've fished in the plaza with friends, did crusade, and played on other cooperative modes and the game wasn't unenjoyable, laggy, boring, etc. There's even a prize list with some pretty nice rewards after forest or snow mode.","June 3, 2015","true","37.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

The game has become a very unstable place in balance and community, the competitive league for the game has halved if nto more, again doesn't matter to someone who wants a fun game to play. Problem is with introduction to many items and heroes that are unbalanced have caused an outpouring of infinites, 1 trick ponies, and many carbon copies of competive play (Which isn't impressive given majority of it isn't skill orientated). If that wasn't a big turn off , the current state of affairs with the servers which have always been iffy since the games conception have gotten much worse where even those among the community who run well under 100 ping in most games (Lost saga does not given you numerical value unfortunetly which is pretty poor in design) will likely experince one of the following in their time playing, sudden moments of freezing(as if you had been disconnectedd) and then a rpaid speed up of the game showing what had happenned in the last few seconds and returns to normal, delay between key press/ attack animation and the person recieving a hit effect wich in a fighting game can ruin it especially when a game like this sometimes relies on a stable connection to use certain abilities. If you can look past those issues and want an amazing never really scene genre of game where players have mutiple heroes than can swap between  then best of wishes.","February 26, 2015","false","13.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Really big balls. It's like the developers decided to screw with the gaming community and make a half-♥♥♥♥♥ joke of a game as if to poke us in the eye and laugh. I don't understand how people can enjoy this train-wreck of a game.\n\nWhy make all the characters, even ones meant to be female, male by default? Then why give them stupid looks?\n\nThe combat is simple enough to understand.... arrow keys, asd/zxc. mash multiple keys at the same time to pull of skills... but... I fail to see what makes combat enjoyable in this game. it's the same attacks over and over again, and you fall down a lot, and get juggled..... a lot.... maybe I just didn't try hard enough to play it. I dunno, but if you're spending more time on the ground than you are doing anything....\n\nI will say that it is somewhat better than its sister game, "Rumble Fighters" but not by much.

You have 2 options of playing this game.\n1: Fight your way through warriors, Ice Princesses, and even the Grim Reaper.\nOr 2: Sit and fish, an idling system that will never be fixed.\nIf you play the game just for number 2, you won't get anywhere quickly, really.\n\nThe fighting system is simple at first, but if you're trying to do massive combos, it can get complex.\nThe physics in this game are strange, however. It is pretty glitchy, but as it's development was passed over by the years, less experienced people have created elements in-game. This is the only flaw, besides the fact that the community is mainly full of kids. Servers being full of kids is from the game being F2P, and that's the only flaw of it not being payed, really.\nI recommend this game because I have had quite some fun moments.\nAlso, watch out for the epic C-C-C-C-COOOOMBOOOO BREAAAAAKAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!","January 11","true","10.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Besides on competitive there's almost never someone of your level and this makes the game a little more unfair. Another thing is that the game is not fun when you get caught on an infinite combo which happens more often than not, mostly with the same gears every time.\n\nThe game is not bad in itself, but i think the community is somewhat trashy. Still, i wouldn't recommend it because it's not an easy game and there arent enough people to play with people of your level all the time... at least i almost never get the chance to, therefore there isnt what i would call a nice skill leveling "enviroment" and this can lead to frustration pretty easily. Your skill also is greatly "increased" by the gears you have and obviously you wont get these easily so it somewhat depends on your luck.\n\nIn conclussion, in my opinion the game will never be balanced enough to play your favorite hero and have the same chances of winning. The game is unfair to begginers. And can be frustrating due to the same heroes being used over and over again.","September 11, 2015","false","32.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Lost Saga is a good game and i love it to death ( i very much do ) But the thing is that Bad Company with no money /=\ Good Game. The game should deserve to stand right next to L.O.L in E-Sports just cause of how well the game is and NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOOK THERE IS NON-OTHER OF IT'S KIND. i mean the ability to swap heros in game is AMAZING and thing of Tekken tag 2 where the bound comes in BUT YOU DON'T NEED BOUNDS AS THERE ARE KNOWN.\n\nOutside of that..People PLAY the DAM GAME FIRST. It's funny how most of these comments complain about you have to cash up real money for FACES ( don't you already do that in MapleStory.Tera,DragonNest, Vindictus Etc? Like WTF) Plus THE FUNNY THINGS IS you don't even have to pay money for faces you can UNLOCK THEM FOR FREE...if you can spend 1BILLION hours on TF2 to unlock..now what was it? HATS...T.T you can the same with this game to unlock New Heros. New Hair,Eyes,Skin Dye.\n\nThe thing is how people complain when you get into the game " They don't get the OP Heros" NGA STUF heres the thing...When you raise a baby what are you going to teach it to do FIRST? walk or CRAWL, as i would say there are heros that need some time to play also such as a hero named Graffit Artist which the point of that hero is to spray Paint then blow them up with the block buttom ( Default S ) but how am i supposed to do that if i am blocking? just jump and pess S, but it's so hard :C.... MAYBE IF YOU PLAYED THE OTHER CHARACTERS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS TROUBLE and acutally learned how to do such with pratice.\n\nthe game could be sexist also I AGREE AND MANY OTHER PLAYERS...the fact you have to buy Female for real cash is annoying i know...If your that willing to not play a game for that...be my guest ( Even though GTA 5 has all boy characters and girls still play them ) or wait out a few events to get them for FREE.\n\nthe balance issues yes that is a problem ( If you know Army ranks ) i am  a Staff Stargaent fighting Majors and those guys have like +40 all Stats and at one point i found myself ( unknownigly ) in a room with then and got owned xd.\n\nTLDR: LS is a good game and loved dearly give it a chance and stick with it PLEASE TURST ME you will enjoy it but hate some of the cons. and Who knows if you get good at this game and it stays alive and LS get's noticed for monthly tourneys by EVO then see you there c:\n\n","December 5, 2014","true","883.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't really like playing a game, where I won't be able to play a hero cause I didn't buy it. Also heroes are timed, unless you buy it, which might give an advantage to paying players, but I haven't confirmed this yet, but I think you get a free permanent hero when you start the game. There is also some noticable lag in this game. I think I have decent, or even nice computer, but some of my attacks won't register on other players. But I do like the concept of multiple different types of heroes like there is an assassin class and a knight class. It is a fighting/brawler ish type of game, so if you like this game, maybe you can give it a try, but there are some issues like pay to access a hero stuff, which I do not like.","November 30, 2014","false","10.8"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","3"

Perhaps with the fact that you're charged real money to have a female character. Besides flipping the bird to all you ladies out there, you need to pony up cash to buy anything resembling permanence or customization. The game's defenders will argue that you get all sorts of freebies. They fail to take into account that some of us would like to put together a character from something other than random pieces of garbage strewn about from randomized packs.\n\nGameplay? Spectacular - once you get past the horrifically overpowered heroes. Don't see them yet? Probably because they're rank-restricted (so only the best people get to crush you). Unless you want to pay cash. Funny how that works. In all honesty, the gameplay is mostly fantastic, save for a few caveats. If you're caught blocking, you're screwed, as the other guy can attack you without any delay, leaving you with no option to fight back. This is a ridiculous failure for a fighting game. The other issue is the sheer number of crowd-control effects that rip away control from your character and, more frustratingly, forcibly reposition your character, often into a pit. How is that fun?\n\nOh yeah, overpowered heroes. They're out there, the best players have them, and you really don't have much of a hope against them.

I have a little bit of a bias because I have invested a lot of time and money into this game since it came out.  However, that's just the thing.  I have spent money on this game.  Lost Saga and it's players have a VERY heavy pay-to-win mentality.  Now, while having exclusive content isn't always a bad thing in video games, especially free ones, this game (just like every free asian mmo) shows you all the cool things that you can get that can help you but you'll be forced to play the game and get in-game money in order to extend the time limit on the heroes you have.  This can become tedious and set you down a path in which you'll realize that it'd be better to spend money on getting a character without the time limit.  Another thing is the gears.  There are many gears in the game and they can be easily be purchased with in-game currency, however, for a new player who has very little experience with the game, collecting 48k GP is going to be a real struggle.  While you don't need these gears to win, but if you want to make your characters look more appealing as well as have the skills of other characters to help you in battle, you're gonna want to get these gears.\n\nNow, the big thing about this game that makes me tell people that they should avoid it is the community itself.  In my honest opinion, after playing this game since OGP days, it is absolute garbage.  You can't go a minute without seeing someone calling someone out for losing or showing their frustration by rage quitting or something.  It's sad to see that the game's community has not gotten any better.  Trash talk is so common, it makes me mad for all the wrong reasons.  Not because it's rude or anything, but because of how frequent I see it.  Also, if your connection is anything but perfect and you lag, players will relentlessly chew you out for that.\n\nThis concludes my Lost Saga review.  Overall, I enjoy the game and enjoy it enough so that I felt like pouring my money into it, but if someone were to ask if they should start playing it, I'd tell them no or that the many mixed reviews this game has already received are all completely justified.","December 28, 2014","false","198.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Like there are certain heroes you can't buy  called "premiums", that you have to buy with real money. These heroes seem to be more powerful looking than the regular heroes. I don't really like playing a game, where I won't be able to play a hero cause I didn't buy it. Also heroes are timed, unless you buy it, which might give an advantage to paying players, but I haven't confirmed this yet, but I think you get a free permanent hero when you start the game. There is also some noticable lag in this game. I think I have decent, or even nice computer, but some of my attacks won't register on other players. But I do like the concept of multiple different types of heroes like there is an assassin class and a knight class. It is a fighting/brawler ish type of game, so if you like this game, maybe you can give it a try, but there are some issues like pay to access a hero stuff, which I do not like.","November 30, 2014","false","10.8"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","3"

Perhaps with the fact that you're charged real money to have a female character. Besides flipping the bird to all you ladies out there, you need to pony up cash to buy anything resembling permanence or customization. The game's defenders will argue that you get all sorts of freebies. They fail to take into account that some of us would like to put together a character from something other than random pieces of garbage strewn about from randomized packs.\n\nGameplay? Spectacular - once you get past the horrifically overpowered heroes. Don't see them yet? Probably because they're rank-restricted (so only the best people get to crush you). Unless you want to pay cash. Funny how that works. In all honesty, the gameplay is mostly fantastic, save for a few caveats. If you're caught blocking, you're screwed, as the other guy can attack you without any delay, leaving you with no option to fight back. This is a ridiculous failure for a fighting game. The other issue is the sheer number of crowd-control effects that rip away control from your character and, more frustratingly, forcibly reposition your character, often into a pit. How is that fun?\n\nOh yeah, overpowered heroes. They're out there, the best players have them, and you really don't have much of a hope against them. Expect to be comboed for half your health before falling off the stage, no matter what you do. Game balance was clearly an afterthought for the developers.\n\nThis could have been good.

You will get matches that make you want to punch a wall several thousand times. pay to win? I haven't had a bad experience with this so far, it does exist. I ive only had to face at least one or two in a match that clearly paid for what they had. Maybe I have just been lucky for what stuff i have got for my heroes, or maybe I am just being smart and have some skill against these oay to wins, or im just lucky. It's a free game pay to win will exist either way. So just do your best. There seems to be a lot of ways to get free stuff, through quests and events, so this also offsets the pay to win. I do well with the heroes and equipment I have available. Lag can be an issue and it is annoying. When Im at my house it's not so bad but a college wifi, cna be cringe worthy. some of the abilites in this game are troll worthy, as well as the players depedning how they play, don't let that turn you away from this game, Id say out of the matches I have played 8/10 were good, fun, and not one sided nonsense.

There are intire forms and posts chatting about if this game is good, but my main concern is if the community is welcoming to the new faces. a New player will start of getting use to the playble characters, and the controls, getting little small rewards and get that little bit of confidence and begin to enjoy the game.\n\nhowever, there is a MASSIVE GAP when it comes to what level of skill you are. It doubles since the communities that ive noticed (i dont know about the korean one, they tend to either be friendly or we dont understand each other owo) do have that tendancy to be extreamly toxic, overcompetative or just outright rude. Im expecting to see some improvement, but im getting WAY off subject,\n\nPros\nALOT of Characters,Gears and able to create amazingly cool combos\nSwitch system enhances the gameplay and tactics during a fight(change characters anytime)\nA couple of known characters from other games, comics,movies, ect.\nA large selection of PVP modes and a couple of PVE modes\n\nCons\nInsane skill gap concerning new players and Returning players\nWhile non paying members can gain powerful gear through events, paying players are able to get a small advantage\nThe Meta of the game can be very frustrating if you intend to branch out and use somthing out of the Meta\nCharacters that are from other games are mainly only for paying players\nIf you have a tendancy to lag, specific attacks will be either greatly buggy or 100% inneffective\nCommunity normally is Toxic, but this is steam, that might be somthing able to change.\n\nive played this game for quite a few years, and i gotta say, to new players, or gonna have to grit your teeth.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nandasithu/recommended/266150/","nandasithu","nandasithu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nandasithu/","256 products in account","Like some of the reviewers here, I started this game when it was hosted at OGPlanet during 2009. I played for about three years, so please don't be fooled by time I put in steam for this game (although I also did spent considerable time here as well). Overall, during OGPlanet time, I spent about $500 on this game, so you can tell how much I have invested in and how much I liked.\n\nBut I cannot recommend to anyone here on Steam to play this game. I will skip usual bread and butter review. Here are the reasons why you should not waste your time (and money) on this game. If you can get past these reasons, then be my guest, download now and enjoy the brawl.\n\n1 - Player base is shrinking. It is harder to find a good game room as your level higher. The game also have skill level system. Which means that you are doing well (Kill/Death ratio), even though your player level is let's say level 1 (they have military style ranking), the game will only find you game room on higher level than level 1 because, well, your skill level is now higher than level 1. Which can give you many problem. You have lesser room to play. You will face higher level player (although not that bad).\n\n2 - Farm, Farm everywhere! What is farm? Well, as you guess it, there are some events going on and most event are based on how long you log in to game and how long you play particular game mode. Sound cool, right? Yes, but the problem is again with player base. I don't understand why these players do what they do. You will not find game room where players are actively, well, playing. They make game room, instead of playing, they just sit there until, fight time counter runs zero. The point of this game is all about fighting and brawling but right now all games are like that. If you don't farm (stay idle), game room host will vote to kick you out. If you just leave your hero idle, the game itself will kick you out for AFK. So in the end, you join a game room to fight but instead you just run around nothing to do. Does that sound fun to you? Not to me.\n\n3 - Game is very latency sensitive. Unless you stay very close to server, you will not get the good ping. Not like other online games like DOTA or LOL, here lag is very visible. Because all your input needs to happen in split second, and if you are lag, the other player suffer! Yes! it's the other way around. Lag wins you. So why does this bad? Well, imagine you lag horribly, you input a punch, it register to another player 10 seconds later. During that time, the other player might have been furiously pressing his punch key to you 100 times but never hit you. He won't be happy, you also won't because all you see is delay after delay. Fighting game with lag is horrible experience.\n\n4 - No strategy, no skill, just spam to win. Although, the game promote creative way to fight each other, here is the a simple truth which has been true since the game come out. Just spam the ♥♥♥♥ out of attack to win. There are some considerable hero that are mostly hated but really just for spamming. One of the example is 'Cyborg' hero, who can just stand behind and spam your attack grenade launchers. Another hero is called 'Gangster' (used to be Mafia back in the days), just spam the gun shooting. Although, there are many ways to counter and win these heroes, in reality, the game is very broken to the point that it is not fun anymore.\n\n5 - The higher the level, the more toxic players you will encounter. Although, this is not just new to online gaming, especially I know in DOTA or LOL, you will find many hostile players, the community in Lost Saga is in a way very immature. If you are older player like me, you will find it annoying or irratitated to the point that you just block the chat to really play the game in peace.\n\nSummary\n----------\n- Shriking player base.\n- No game room, Farm everywhere\n- Lag means no fun, and the service does not seem to be better in future\n- Spam to win\n- Bad community. A lot of 12 years old\n\nDon't play this game.","December 31, 2014","false","60.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

And one thing make this game more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is the lag. It's laggy than a hacker spawning random ♥♥♥♥ in GTA 5. Going into a room is nightmare sometime your hits get delay or worst you can't hit at all, random teleporting and Grab Items being stopped for no reason by it. The gear are so unfair that like for example gear makes you untouchable, one that makes escaping impossible , gear that give invincibility ,and unfair counter do more damage than other gear and other gear don't even work. People are pretty petty, get mad at little thing, annoying, racist, Trash talkers etc.... The patch give unnecessary nerf for balanced characters and no nerfs for overpowered characters. The character cost is $20 to $15 per character and rare and new characters are extreme needed to beat people or from the game "pros" to be good.\nI give this game a 10 Out of a "the typically MMORPG buy-to-win game Cancer."","March 13","false","648.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I used to have respect for this game, but now it just seems more and more like they're just trying to get rid of it. It has been tossed around by many people who have only made the game worse, and worse. For me, its a pay2win. No one really wants to talk about this issue because i am definitely the only one who experiences it, and i can't just let go of my progress because of some stupid developer thinking its a good idea to give noobs the most op pay2win heros since they're complaining about it all the time. Did i mention that those heros are permanent? Thats right! you get to kiss the fair-good-community goodbye! Permanent heros don't just mean you have to put up with it for life, it means that once they get their evo's, You'll want to sue the game just for even thinking about how stupid the idea that came to a horrible twisted reality.

Do NOT play this game if you want to be bored from the start, because i PROMISE you, those heros you get at the beginning will only make you feel like you want to uninstall the game just from boredom. atleast thats what happened to me when i made a new account and tried out the heros.

I've been playing this game since OGPlanet released it. At first, this game seems unfair and hard to play but new players just need to learn the game before they can get better. Also this game does have a "Pay to Win" aspect but the game rewards those who don't buy stuff by the daily challenges and login events with the premium characters and gear, occasionally. Overall, I rate this game 7.5/10.

ADVERTISE MORE, GET THE WORD OUT THERE!!! There's a reason it's listed as one of the top games in Korea!\nIt doesn't look like I've played a lot, but I know what I'm talking about. I've played before Z8 games, all the way back since OGPlanet (a lot of things happened - company transferred, people lost their accounts, used to be really popular. I've come back now that it's stable again, and since it's so so good).\nThis game is a North American adaptation of Korean Lost Saga. It has a unique hero purchasing system where you can buy heroes for periods of time - 2 hours, 10 hours, 30 hours, permanent, etc. You can use those heroes interchangeably in battle for combos. There are many game modes, but essentially you beat someone by making them lose their health/gear. Each hero has 4 gears that each have a special ability. You can replace some gear by purchasing gears in the shop, excluding weapons. The more you play, the higher rank you get, and the more heroes you unlock. In addition, you can level up heroes and upgrade them to make them stronger. It's a free game, so it's definitely worth playing. You start out with one permanent hero, and soon after you can get another 2 permanent heroes.\nSome people call this a pay to win game, and some heroes OP. That's not true. This is a skill-based game. If you're good enough, with ANY hero, you can beat someone. Some heroes are more advantageous than others (premium, legendary heroes especially), but that doesn't necessarily mean you can't win. It's all about which hero suits your style of fighting. Others say that you HAVE to have an input hero to be able to stand a chance - not true either. There are so many playstyles around inputs that the people who say that don't know what theyre talking about. There are some people who've developed infinite combos with some heroes with the help of money and are OP, but Lost Saga is a team based game (mostly). Spending doesn't compensate for skill and teamwork.\nThe community isn't as big as it was back in OGPlanet, nor is it hacker free, but hackers are kicked as long as you enable auto kick for poor network. It's not a dead community - and it never will be, with the people who've dedicated so much time into this game. There are even tournaments in other countries where it's more popular.\nDon't get turned off by some of the text glitches in tutorial and the guide/quests. Z8 is focusing on adding more heroes and events, not getting new players, unfortunately. This game has a unique combat system, it's free, it's easy going, and it's fun.

I also enjoy the many game modes with different people and the oppurtunity to get new gear in the co-op modes. And the fact that when you lvl to a certain lvl you can get a kit that will let you choose any character battle style and fully modify his/her look to the fullest. the only cons i saw was the server issues and if you want someone super new or lots of gear quick you have to pay, but you can easily earn money with temporary characters and gear.","December 1, 2014","true","74.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","6"

Hits that\nfelt like they should have hit wouldnt and vise versa. In addition to\nquestionable combat mechanics, strategy inside of an arena felt rather limited.\nMany players including those who were more experienced liked to just hang as\na team and constantly spam ranged attacks while my team may have been charging at\nthem. Sometimes one of their guys would take a different route and try to play lone wolf\nfor a few seconds but at the end of the day every round devulged into a mob\nof players trying to beat down each others characters. Being able to knock\npeople off the stage was nice, but the tricks in each arena seemed limited.\n\nNow for a free mmorpg, games might be able to get away with combat like this game but\nfor an action game it felt wholly unsatisfying. I think after the initial excitement\nof playing the first match wears off that you could get more enjoyment\nout of playing any shooter with reasonable aiming mechanics.","December 9, 2014","false","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Where to begin...\n\nThere are many many problems with this game.  It looks good on paper but plays like trash right now.\n\nIn this fighting game the cheapest and easiest moves to pull off will allow you to win. Using highly skilled moves, charecters  and combos won't get you as far. Which makes this game quite trashy for a fighter. You are not rewarded for taking the time to become skilled at a character that is very hard to master.\n\nBeen playing this since the OGP Beta.\n\nHere are some of the many issues with this game.\n- Constant disconnections\n- Is not good for your pc will cause BSODs and kernal errors.\n- The events revolve around play time lately. Now for the past 2 months there has been dc issues and lag issues. Put 2 and 2 together and you cannot complete any of the events as it resets upon disconnection.\n- It is not as P2W like others have stated. They have tons of events to obtain these cash items however you would have to no life it to get anywhere.\n- The quality of fights absolutely sucks. Playing Lost Saga is like having a bi-polar girlfriend. You never know what you are going to wake up tomorrow. What new problem will there be with the game?\n- In fights half of the time the enemies can hit you , but you can't hit them at all even with large AOE skills and a godly connection and computer.\n- Lots of foreigners in this game who are trying to kill it. They have a version of this in their own country or close to it yet they come to wreck LSNA because Z8 does not implement foreign restrictions which was promised earlier by them.\n- You can be highly skilled with a character but if the enemy has better gears then you, you are going to lose.\n- The community is quite toxic. It is filled with a bunch of sewer people and 10 year old GET REKT ****** children.\n- Many people who are trying to play this game right now can't even log in . I don't know why they would want to though considering the quality of this game right now. Which is really sad because it has some great potential . This is the 3rd company Lost Saga has been with.\n\nAlways starts off good ut then those in power get greedy and allow foreigners in which bogs down the server and ruins the game for everybody else eventually ending in the games demise.\n\nIt is funner than smash bros. Just a shame that it keeps ending up in the hands of people incapable of running it properly.

The games concept is great however I wont sugar coat it its problems becuase it does have some. But in the long run, you always come back for more, since its the only game really of its kind and lost saga seperates it from the rest. The problems that exist is having in game currency for more stronger gears. However with the current publisher they have been giving out these gears which sort of remedy the problem. But with this remedy creates another problem which is the overuse of some gears, not itself the problem, but it makes things stale at some point.\n\nI mean the games fun, dont get me wrong, but when I get poisoned for 12 seconds, skadi'd every 2 seconds and mummied, you know the game never used to be like that.\nRegardless its fun to play, my best advice is dont go in trying to be the best, just have some fun with friends and maybe stick away from higher ranks as they do have that drive to win, so they do use alot of gears but if your up for the challenge go for it.

I have gotten probably 50$ worth of free items from events and free things from quests. There are cheap strategies. There are bugs. The translation is awful. This does not deter me from playing the game. I have been able to beat "super overpowered uncounterable" strategies just with the gear I have gotten for free. They also give daily reward when you log in, there is many events which give you free gear/upgrades, there is PvE to get gears without even fighting, along with xp and gp. If you can get past the bad things. this game is, in my opinion, the best FREE (emphasis on the free) fighter out there.","October 4, 2015","true","217.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Nothing said it didnt work. One of them said they changed developper or publisher whatever...So i tried it. Its fun. SEXIST. The female characters should be free. I dont want to pay 5$ just to be a girl. Which sucks. At least make it less expensive, or buyable with in-game currency.... But anyways.

You either win a lot, lose a lot or a mix of both. Mainly PVP with a bunch of modes, some PVE and the Plaza where you can just relax and chat or doing optional missions that can gives you some nice stuff if you're lucky. Unlike half the people here leaving hate comments because they can't win, there's many ways to win  even if you lose the match: I'm talking of the Honorable Mentions at the end of each match that grade your performance during battle. These give you bonus GP to use in the market.\n\nAlthought Pay to Win concept, there's a lot of quests and events that give you some awesome items or powerful  characters that you would normally have to pay to obtain. Without having to spent a penny, I managed to get 4 permanent characters which 3 of them are girls and another 2 female conversion tickets (Yes, you have to pay to get the female version of a Hero); Along with other permanent  epic and rare armors/weapon/accessories, etc.\n\nYou can end up having just as powerful Heros by playing free just as those who purchase OP Heros. The only difference is that they get them faster, but where's the fun in that. Train your Heros, get better and feel proud.\n\nGameplay wise, it's fast and fluid. Of course a good pc is key here and also a very good internet connection. Like a few mentionned, some people play wireless and got a downright terrible connection, making them hard to kill in a match. Worst case this can happen is during Boss Raid and they're the selected Boss. Each character is unique and play differently. So many styles to choose from. When you're used to them, you can purchase or obtain various special equipments to equip them depending on your preference. 1 hero could combine the speciality of 3 others heros if you wanted.\n\nTry it for yourself before listening to complainers. You'll have ton of good time.","January 1, 2015","true","237.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KonXII/recommended/266150/","KonXII","GaouP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KonXII/","194 products in account","Lost Saga is an arena fighter that doesn't do a lot of things right. A lot of these fall under accessibility, mechanics, customization, latency and as a personal matter, sound.\n\nPart 1, Latency:\n\nAs far as the latency goes, if you're in the East Coast, then you will suffer a lot in this game even if you're gifted with FiOS or Google Fiber because of a mix of either deprecated and underpowered servers, or they're located far far away in a country that prevents data going through right. What I mean by this is that hitboxes and frames are two very important things for a fighting game. You need to figure out how big or how small the hitboxes are, and then you need to figure out the "frame time" of each attack. The hitboxes are the main problem for this situation. A lot of times, your hitboxes and your opponent's hitboxes will keep resizing or be somewhere away from the character model. This is a really bad problem when you're playing as a small hitbox Hero like Graffiti or Werewolf. Frames aren't as bad, especially when you can block and see the extra frames from a Hero like Death Knight, but it's a huge problem when you're guarding against D`artagnan, because you can't tell where that one "counter frame" is. What I mean by counter frame is the frame you can start your counter at to give yourself the edge. Seeing how popular D'artagnan is, it's even harder to fight unless you cheese yourself. Small games like these were originally made to only handle a small country like South Korea, Philipines, Singapore or Japan. For China, they create a million different servers inside two main servers. So unless you're a big publisher like Nexon or Tencent, you would have a hard time trying to find good servers to support a game like this. Other action-packed games such as LaTale, GetAmped 2, SD Gundam Online and GunZ also suffered from these problems because either the servers were too weak, had a deprecated protocol or too far away.\n\nPart 2, Accessing the game and their mechanics:\n\nLost Saga has got to have the most stickiest controls I have ever used in a fighting game. A lot of times, you will have problems trying to do good attacks and combos. All you can honestly do is defend yourself with zoning and approach when they mess up. If you do a rushdown playstyle, you're going to punish yourself hard because the mechanics and controls are so stiff, you will not be able to properly do a good rushdown. Overheading is also a problem. What overheading is is when you attack someone from the air behind them. The only way you can get passed this is if your moveset has a divekick in it, which brings me to accessibility. You have a 10 hour option and a 2 hour option with free money. As you fight and have all those heroes, their time depletes despite the fact you never really bought them out to the field. Say I am playing Authur and I have Graffiti, Paladin and Werewolf active. When I am playing Authur and play nothing but Authur, the other three Heroes' playtime remaining will decrease, despite the fact you never swiched into them. This requires you to continously spend money on them to extend their playtime and if you're desperate, shell out or be lucky to find offers that aren't credit score or insurance related to get Permanent variants of them.\n\nPart 3, How come I can't be a cute girl or have those equips?\n\nCustomizing your heroes in Lost Saga require you to shell out money or get lucky with boxes. This is where the game really falls apart. In GetAmped 2, Splash Fighters and Rumble Fighter, I honestly don't remember gear, weapon or accessory upgrading mechanics that breaks the game. What do I mean by this? You're able to try and roll for epic variants of standard Hero gear, or original gear to put on your hero. This breaks the game as you're also able to upgrade them to a point where you can one-shot newbies. Say if there's a mirror match between the two, one is vanilla and the other is decked out. The decked out one would obviously win, even if he's a bad player compared to the "novice". Being the little girl is a huge selling point in MMOs nowadays, so if you put them behind a paywall, you're pretty much either having them ditch your game or have them shell out five bucks just to be a girl for one hero.\n\nThere's also the general sound of the game. A lot of the voices and sound effects have little to no quality in them. The soundtrack is also not memorable whatsoever outside of the lobby theme and for fighting games, hype from the astetics and action are huge factors to keep a person playing, outside of giving cash shop items for free like crack, and then expecting them to get more with offers or their cards.","November 28, 2014","false","3.1"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

But after a while playing it you soon realize it is very pay to win. Also using a melee style character is laughable in this game, they are so bad in comparison to most of the ranged characters that they shouldn't have been in the game to begin with. The customization isn't half bad, but to get anything good you either spend real money, or would have to grind for fair too long. The art is nice and the gameplay would be smooth if it weren't for what seems to be an endless wave of random lag spikes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryForYou/recommended/266150/","DeliveryForYou","Mr.Mailmann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryForYou/","12 products in account","I've played way back when this game first came out on the OGP release. I'm going to say this, on this version's release of Lost Saga I'm very.....mixed.\nThe game seems more easy to grasp onto, but if you haven't played any kind of Beat-Em-Up or never even played a game, I'd....well I'd probably not touch this. People say this game is P2P (Pay 2 Win) and....well it always was. Remember when Hazama first came out on the NA release? Everyone either stole their mother's/father's credit card, wasted a LOT of time on surveys, begged to be gifted Hazama, or just whined about not having Hazama passive-aggressively, and sometimes very aggressive to the point of everyone kicking for Toxic-ness. Censorship is more of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than before, so whenever I say class (because I'm stuck on the whole classes thing) it comes out as cl***** which is stupid. On that topic, the game has became more PG than PG-13. The only "cuss" I can say is dammit. Now I understand cussing is bad and all that, yada yada, but still. Anywho, disruption of the first ammendment is not the topic at hand. You care about the gameplay and the community. The gameplay is laggier than before, but I've rarely ran into that problem. I guess I must be lucky. Every hero is awesome~ Except for the guy with the purple axe that charges and slams into you and it drops you through the ground. That's not even a special move, it's just a charged attack. Broken hero. P2W (Pay 2 Win) confirmed. That's the only problem I have gameplay wise. Now the community tends to either be non-existant, or salty. Matches are harder to find now, many plazas have AFK people who fish or people who relic search. So it's really not the place to converse with others. The game is very competitive.....aggressively competitive. The game no longer rewards teamwork, and the raids and crusade aren't an excuse. All this is obnoxious....but unlike other's, I have a twisted way at looking at the game which keeps pulling me back, because don't get me wrong, I love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game, even if it has A WHOLE LOT OF KINKS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED + the whole "owners keep getting swapped". that's what really REALLY killed the community I'd say. So, quick summary:\nPros:\n- Nostalgia geeks will love it, and be drawn into it as long as they aren't sensitive little brats. No offense.\n- The game easily gives you two free permanent characters. Now we don't have to constantly farm to get ourselves a hero. Let's be honest, for the people who actually couldn't use a credit card, this was a MAJOR turn off. The rest are somewhat hard to obtain, and what I mean is that it's now reasonable in my opinion.\n- You're going to be able to get practicly every hero that's ever been released ever. At least, in the NA version.\n- Events are common, hard to go by without noticing that.\n- Battling is the same. Game modes are diverse, and fun.\n\nCons:\n- Laggy\n- Salty/Non-existant community\n- Purple axe guy who makes you fall through the floor and needs to be removed/nerfed HARD\n- To Nostalgia Geeks of OGP? Awesome. To Veterans of Lost Saga in general? Not awesome.\n\n6/10.......not bad........but needs a lot of work. Still pretty fun and playable. Do recommend to competitive peeps and nostalgia geeks. Not so much to hard asses....honest opinion.","January 3","true","581.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, its difficult to start the game as a newcomer due to so many side accounts on the server and translation issues.

The game allows you to take control of mutiple heros, both thoughout history and crossovers from other games.The fighting feels exciting and you have your choice of either melee or ranged weapon,with skills also playing a big part. However some characters do feel cheap and less creative though. As an overall I give Lost Saga a 7/10","May 8","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
