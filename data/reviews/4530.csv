Ten Hammers takes away some of the simplicity of the original with new and complex mechanics that are a bit hard to get the hang of but once you do it makes the game better than the first. The abuility to make a 4 man fire team into 2 two man teams replaces bounding from the first game, you are now able to aim individual soldiers wepons inorder to eliminate priority targets as well as the addition of breaching and clearing buildings.

It's a very good tactical squad based game. You command 2-3 squads depending on the missions. The goal is to point fire, suppress, flank, and eliminate the enemies. It's hard but worth it. Strategic and fun. This is not for casuals or kids. This game offers improvement over the first but some of the classic features are should have returned. It is still a pretty fun tactical game. It's a third-person squad based game. The story is pretty good, telling the lives and stories of each soldiers. It's pretty sad but it makes you feel the characters. The game is intense, fun and full of strategies. Though there are times when enemies are unforgiven and spawn behind you, especially on the hardest difficulty. Can be annoying and frustrating but it's a fun overall game. I just wish they can make a third in the series, despite all the characters had "moved on". Still would love to see this kind of gameplay!

A fun, challenging, and quite honestly, punishing tactical game. You control a few different 4 man squads (squads can also be broken up into 2 man buddy teams essentially creating mini squads) and sometimes a vehicle or other special unit. The story and story dialogue is a little cheesy, but I honestly don't care. The gameplay is great and the combat dialogue is surprisingly responsive to what is actually going on. You task your soldiers with breaching rooms, moving to corners, taking cover, laying down suppressing fire, throwing grenades, covering a sector, etc. Even on easy difficulty the game is very unforgiving and can be challenging, especially when you're just starting out. Send your troops charging into the room recklessly? They're gonna get dropped by a bunch of AK-toting sand-dwellers. Have good ol' sarge run out from the corner into the street? He's gonna catch a tank shell in the face. Decide to jump out from behind cover and say boo? All your guys are gonna die. Or if there's an enemy with an rpg in a window and you decide it's not worth moving your squad from behind your lovely flowerbox, you're going to have to casevac an entire squad. Basically if you don't play it smart in this game, you will lose. It is challenging game and requires the use of real tactics. Have your LMG trooper lay down suppressing fire so you can move your second team into a flanking position. Lay down smoke so you can enter a building to get an angle on the enemies in cover. You get the idea. Great game, well worth the price.","December 28, 2014","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a gem of a game that I spent countless hours upon just on the campaign alone. Bought it again on the pc, and mowed through the campaign multiple times again for the sake of ol' times. The game has its pros and cons but what got me hooked is the solid gameplay mechanics of its squad command.\n\n7/10\n\n\n\n","November 6, 2015","true","31.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
