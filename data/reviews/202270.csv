I really, really do. It's a refreshing style of turn-based strategy that makes you rely quite heavily on your wits and intuition. It's the sort of game where the winner is not decided by the size of their ship and its guns, but by the savvy of the player. It has a timeless style and an endearing sense of humor that tends to leave one in a good mood, even as their ships sink to the briny deep.\n\nI want to recommend this game, but I can't. The single player campaign could be beaten in a matter of hours, even at a leasurely pace, and leaves much to be desired. It was obviously designed to recieve regular attention from the developers, who seem to have forgotten it. However, the thing that really sinks this game (pun intended) is the lack of a multiplayer community. This game was made with the intention that players would faithfully and regularly play with and against each other, and although it started out that way, it never coelesced. Unless you have friends that you know also want to play this game, it's simply not worth it.","June 11, 2015","false","22.8"," 126 of 140 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","126","140","4","4"

And then it ended.\n\nThat's the only major issue here. This game is not for anyone who likes to play singleplayer, the entire singleplayer campaign ends after 9 missions, even though the plot is on going - and it's not a good plot anyway. *Spoilers* Giant aliens basically. The turn based system can be painful when trying to travel long distance and the interface is glitchy at times. Also not enough customisation is available. In the tutorial it shows you all your defense options, and by the end of the missions you only unlock 3/4 of them - radar remains locked even when you beat the game. This game in general just was unfinished. A disappointment tha tParadox published this.\n\nI got this on the humble bundle, otherwise I'd be really upset - it's so not worth the price unless you have friends who also own it, and then multiplayer might be fun.","February 27, 2014","false","3.9"," 86 of 101 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","86","101","0","0"

Offline non workingess that is left.\nThe game does its own "check" if you have internet connection, if it fails that it doesn't let you go online, but it is flawed.\nIt doesn't even let you TRY to log in to their servers, nor give any useful information to you to help you troubleshoot the problem.\n\nAll it takes to break this system? Exit the game after first launch, then restart it.\nSo the multiplayer part is out of the window, the UI is very clunky and the functions aren't intuitive to use, basically a lot of saving is done, and those saves you can't use if you are in "Offline mode", so if you built a nice fleet it is all goners.\n\nOverall, this game is now EOL (End Of Life) but the best part about it you can enjoy for free, and that is the launch trailer.\nYou want naval warfare you have to look at Dangerous Waters or SCS Fleet Command for something that somewhat works, but it is a dead market today with very few good ones popping up to replace the oldies.","June 28, 2014","false","1.6"," 55 of 68 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","55","68","0","1"

If you ever played Intra Galactic Battles on your 386, this is like that but with boats. So I guess that makes it a bit like Starfleet Battles.\n\nIt's like Gratuitous Space Battles (love that game still), but you have direct control over each ship, and you generally only have a fleet big enough for a few ships at a time.\n\nSo before the mission, you choose hulls and equipment for every ship in your fleet, based on a predetermined total "fleet value," which I imagine is calculated based on the difficulty of the mission in question. Then you micro-manage your fleet in a turn-based battle.\n\nYou issue move and targetting orders per ship, or if you're really a micromanager, you issue fire orders per weapon.\n\nCool concept, right? Well I'm happy to say that this game pullis it off smashingly. The interface takes a bit of getting used to, but the tutorial is actually VERY good. Only once did I find myself thinking "okay... How do I do that again?" It's very intuitive, and the missions are varied and overall the game is just fun.\n\nI give Leviathan Warships an A-.

And then there are the co-op missions that I have been playing over and over, but they will soon be a bit boring as i will have run out of different fleet customizations that I can use.\n\nMultiplayer however, is ultimately worthless. Nobody plays online anymore, and if you do find a game, most likely the people in the lobby will just be sitting there, as they have been for literally a year. I can't say anything about it cause I haven't played a game online yet, but I'm sure it is fun.\n\nOne thing that annoys me is the fact that you have to create a custom fleet for EVERY SERVER you play on! That means that the ships I make on "Leviathan 1" server will not be on "US Server 1", so if you do manage to play online, than make sure you write down or remember what kind of ships and guns you had.\n\nFor what I have played so far, 7.5/10.\n\nOf course I got this game and the $3.00 DLC in a weekend sale for about $3.00 total.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/recommended/202270/","ultanium","Ult","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ultanium/","409 products in account","I was following this game round about the time they released an announcement trailer earlier this year, but then my attention was diverted elsewhere and completely forgot the existence of this game until the recent Humble Bundle. Leviathan is a strategic, turn-based game in which the player customises their fleet using a variety of battleships and equip them with an array of offensive and defensive add-ons. Similar to the gameplay mechanics of Frozen Synapse, the game has a planning phase during which the player assigns movement, direction of ship, aiming & attacking, deploying defensive shields and so on. The actions are then enacted in a 10 second animation.\n\nI completed the campaign in cooperative mode within 2 hours. The premise involves tackling the growing Marauder threats through escorting key vessels across the river or ocean, protecting areas of high value priority, breaking into a well-fortified bunkers, and destroying key enemy warships serving as boss encounters. Although there isn't much to the story, the key area of satisfaction becomes evident once you engage in naval combat. In terms of gameplay the game responds and plays really well, although there isn't much to the complexity. At first glimpse boss encounters may startle you a bit, but as you discover the pros and cons of individual weapons you will come to realise what works and what doesn't, leading to a more strategical approach on consecutive playthroughs. You occasionally find yourself taking on more vessels than you can handle regardless of how many cannons and railguns you have attached to your fleet, so being able to maneuver them effectively becomes second nature. Aside from the campaign, the game also serves special challenge missions such as waves, or battle against friends and strangers over a variety of maps. A tiny but fun package with plenty strategical possibilities.","September 24, 2013","true","7.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

However the in-game store is broken, and neither Steam nor Paradox are supporting a viable support staff to address.  I found the message board, and my exact problem was reported over 6 months ago, with zero responses.  So be prepared to play with whatever is in the box, and the Steam DLC.  If this problem were somehow addressed, I would consider changing my recommendation.\n\nI find the game play itself to be reminiscent of the old Starfleet Battles paper game, where you plan your moves then players execute the planning together to see the results.  If you like that sort of thing, you might like Leviathan: Warships.  The game is easily accessible, as the advertising suggests (possibly the cleverest thing about the game is the video ad) and the learning curve is pretty flat before you can start dusting it up with friends whom you've also hooked into buying the game (catch it on sale!

The base ship variety is somewhat limmited, but there are three dlc packs available which all contain three new ships, raising the total amount of ship types available to 14. And even if you don't want to buy any dlc, you can customize the loadout of the ships yourself, providing an endless variety of tactics. I feel the game can be somewhat unbalanced at times, but there are still plenty of viable tactics available and some strategies that may seem overpowered at first can usually easily be countered.  The biggest problem with this game is the playerbase, or rather, lack there of. There are very few people playing this game at the time of me writing this review. It can sometimes take a very long time to get into a game. That is also the main reason i'm writing this review; to get more people to play. There is a singleplayer campaign, but it's not nearly as much fun as the multiplayer. Just as a side note, this game is also available on tablets (for much cheaper). So if that is your thing, get it there (I believe you will play on the same server as the pc version, but don't quote me on that). One last tip: in my experience most people play on the "Leviathan 1" server, so if you are looking for a multiplayer game, you should probably look there.\n\np.s.\n\nYes, Jazz Boatman does the ingame commentary, and it's awesome!","April 21, 2014","true","44.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A friend and I pre-ordered it, but after playing it for some time we started to feel like we were playing a half-baked game. The AI is almost non-existant, usually going straight at your ships while firing and not actually trying any other tactic. The Developers also tried to go for a multi-platform game, such that you would be able to play the same game from your computer as well as tablet. Ultimetly, they came up with a fairly bad system of implementing this by keeping all of your save data (For anything, including singleplayer) on their server. Saves on one server are not transferred to the others, so if you swictch servers you will not be able to access anything that you had on the other server. There are also 5 servers up at the moment and most likely only 5 players online.","October 2, 2014","false","11.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It only has 9 missions, even though from the dialog it's obvious they meant to add more, but just couldn't be bothered.  Not only that but the same ships from the campaign are different in multiplayer so you can't use the same designs.  There is no way to fix this, unfortuately since you can't mod the game.  Even worse is the interface, which constantly gets in the way of doing things (I blame mobile for this), but the last straw really comes down to not only is the game unfinished, but they want to charge you to make it slightly less unfinished with the DLC, which doesn't finish the campaign!!!

The gameplay is basically what you'd expect, move, aim your guns and shoot, etc. The singleplayer is fun but short and seems tacked on compared to the multiplayer, but I don't find the multiplayer very fun either (seems more restricted them SP). Let's face it, you bought this game to make a rad ship decked out with guns on every slot. Well guess what, you can't do that. At least, not unless you're willing to make do with commanding only one ship. See there's this point system in place, guns and ships cost points and you can only place as many guns/ships as your point capacity will allow. Basically this means that you'll really never be able to make that awesome fleet you always wanted to.

(I apprechiate that it's there but at least tell me about it.)\n\nWhy isn't space also used to progress any dialogue on the screen instead of having to move the cursor to click the little arrow?\n\nWhy can't I bind and select ships quickly with shortcut keys like 1, 2, 3, 4?\n\nOverall this game is a fair amount of fun provided you can get a game running but some basic technical oversights from being designed for tablets first and foremost leaves me unhappy.","February 13, 2014","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It only has 9 missions, even though from the dialog it's obvious they meant to add more, but just couldn't be bothered.  Not only that but the same ships from the campaign are different in multiplayer so you can't use the same designs.  There is no way to fix this, unfortuately since you can't mod the game.  Even worse is the interface, which constantly gets in the way of doing things (I blame mobile for this), but the last straw really comes down to not only is the game unfinished, but they want to charge you to make it slightly less unfinished with the DLC, which doesn't finish the campaign!!!

Teamwork, guessing your opponent's next move, out manuvering and decieving your opponents (like with smoke and cloak) were the things that I used loved on this game.\n\nThe bad thing I could say (excluding the amount of people online) was that the core features, whilst fun, is limited.

It is not optimized at all. FPS is all over the place, and that's with two 7970s. The campaign was, although enjoyable, short. The other missions aren't really all that fun and not connected at all. The multiplayer is slow, and requires that you have friends who also have this game, who I don't, because I recommended they don't get this game because of reasons below. When I pre-ordered this, I expected a full product. The product I recieved was more of a demo. Because I like the way the combat system is set up, I thought I might buy the full game that they would release as DLC. I'm glad I read the descriptions of the DLC before buying. More ship shapes. That's it. I am very disapointed in this game. I expected so much out of this cool idea for a combat sytem, but it let me down. This game is just an attempt at trying to get into peoples wallets with a funny commercial. I would not recommend this game to anyone. Do not buy. Play the demo...oh wait, the demo costs $10. There is no full game. You'd be better off buying sone candy. Go do that instead. It'd be more enjoyable.\n\nYou might also notice I only have 8 hours total for this game. The campaign took a solid hour. Then I tried to find some other way of enjoying it, but was only able to stand it for another 4 hours.

The gameplay is basically what you'd expect, move, aim your guns and shoot, etc. The singleplayer is fun but short and seems tacked on compared to the multiplayer, but I don't find the multiplayer very fun either (seems more restricted them SP). Let's face it, you bought this game to make a rad ship decked out with guns on every slot. Well guess what, you can't do that. At least, not unless you're willing to make do with commanding only one ship. See there's this point system in place, guns and ships cost points and you can only place as many guns/ships as your point capacity will allow. Basically this means that you'll really never be able to make that awesome fleet you always wanted to. Maybe if this game had a sandbox mode, or at least was moddable, I'd give it a recommendation, but sadly, it has neither.","March 25, 2014","false","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers could have turned this game around if they had developed the single player side with far more depth. Like Civilization it need a balnce between the two and this is decidedly lopsided for multi player. There is no hook for this game to get you into it just a short single player campain then nothing. Also I though recently I would give this game another go and when I whent to log in to the server it wouldn't accept my password I asked for a reminder to be sent to my email but it never came and it would not let me set up a new account.

Once I've completed all the missions, the multiplayer mishaps will begin.\n\nLeviathan: Warships was surprisingly easy to jump into: the simple commands and clean interface allow for strategy to come to the fore. The movement system creates the feel of a tabletop game, as well as giving you the amount of seconds it will take you to get to the destination.\nWith around 10-15 different weapons and add-ons you can bolt to your ship, there is a strategy here as well, rather than relying on a myriad of weird weapons. It also means the game is much easier balanced, as each weapon has its obvious strengths and weaknesses.\nI hear the multiplayer is fantastic, and I recommend picking up a copy next time it comes on sale.\n\nAnd downsides?\nThe networking is the worst implementation of server connection I have ever seen. If the game can't connect when you launch the game, there is no "re-try" button. The game must be exited and relaunched. However, this isn't such a bad thing as it launches in a swift 10-15 seconds. Also, your saves, replays, ships and stats are all per-server, which just simply sucks. However, if you stick to one server, you'll be fine and dandy. There is also an offline, and again that has its own separate saves etc.\n\nBut don't let that put you off!

It's not a AAA+ shooter, so apparently there are next to no multiplayer matches. With that said, I got this game in the hopes of playing a fun single-player campaign, and I managed to squeeze over 6 hours of fun out of it in one day because of how addictive it is. I got this as part of a bundle even though I had been eyeing it on Steam for a very long time, and quite frankly, the game delivers more than enough entertainment if all you want is turn-based strategy. The graphics still look great, the sound design is incredible with a good set of speakers, and the campaign + challenge missions should give you well over 10 hours of gameplay if you are anything like me. If you multiplayer is not as important to you as the single-player experience, this game is worth at least $10, but if you get it for under $5 with a bunch of other games, don't even question it. It really is a fun game. Just a shame I did not notice it earlier and that it did not grow into something more.","May 15","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Commonwealth fleets are tiny, and while the number of enemies in the campagin is sensible, in challenge mode you wonder how the enemy navies have so many disposible people.\n\nI've yet to try a versus game, but coop is nice and works well.
