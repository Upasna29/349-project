I belive that too many people come into this game expecting it to have the same off-the-walls wacky gameplay that Goat Simulator brought to the table and find themselves disapointed when the find out that there aren't any people to bowl over or explosions to create. Bear Simulator instead focuses on is creating a setting where there is a story to be told that the player has to discover by exploring as much as they can and finding food and clues as to what's going on. Everything is not as ordinary as it seems as the player progresses, and the fun is in slowly discovering new things, which admittedly is not for everyone.\n\nA notable discovery early on is the fact that you are not a full grown bear, but rather a cub. In one of the very first areas that you will explore there will be a sign stating that a cub and not any full grown bears reside in the area. If you stop to think about it some more you'll realize that all the other animals you encounter are rather large comparative to you. And this brings me to anoter common misconception about the game. Many people who have played this game find it unfathomable that you, as a bear, are not smart enough to eat certain foods or are getting killed by a fox. While a normal adult bear would have no trouble with these things, you are just a stupid and frail cub and will need to eat everything in sight to grown stronger and smarter.\n\nTo end this I would just like to give a simple message to the developer of this game. Don't give up, man. A lot have people have found the actual method to enjoying your game. It's completely normal to make mistakes at the beginning which will net a lot of criticism on you. If you feel you need to take a break then go ahead, but please don't say you'll shelve your talent away forever. You've managed to achieve something here that plenty of other people can only dream about being able to do by getting your own game published and put up for sale on steam. I am one of those people. I don't know if you'll even get this message, but if you do, then whatever you decide to do in the end, then just make sure you're happy with your decision.","March 18","true","11.9"," 190 of 220 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","190","220","6","0"

This guy gives me a lot to update about. Because of the negative reception Bear Simulator got, John said in a Kickstarter update (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1330754003/bear-simulator/posts/1510978) he's not going to work on the game anymore.\nUPDATE 2: The developer flagged my review as abusive. It has since been repealed by (I'm guessing) a Steam moderator.\nUPDATE: The dev has deleted my forum post. I made a post warning people about the game and it was deleted without warning. It looks like this is happening to other posts, too.\nI was a $50 Kickstarter backer. The dev has not communicated anything. I got my alpha access 3 weeks before release. This game has recieved no bugtesting and John Farjay (the developer) will not listen or respond to any form of input. This game is a poorly made and buggy mess. The codes the backers are not personalized and anyone can use them. The exciting area the developer promised to backers is a shed with a picture of a frog in it. The developer rarely posts to social media and rarely if ever responds to messages. The game was supposed to come out over a year ago, but John went on hiatus for a year without a single word. This game is a mess as it is, and I don't see it changing in the future.","February 29","false","2.8"," 902 of 1,211 people (74%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","74","902","1","60","103"

There could have been birds flying in the air, schools of fish in the river, and tiny bugs crawling around.

This wouldn't be a problem because you cain regain health and stamine by eating food, mushrooms and defeating enemies, but what is even the point if those things rarely appear in the game?\n\nIn the same vein, the "Intelligence" system is so frustrating. I'm so happy to find something new to eat to level up my character, just to discover that I'm so stupid that I can't even touch it. There's absolutely nothing to point me towards how getting more intelligence, and even if it were, there is NOTHING in this huge overworld for me to gain more XP or Intelligence. Is painfully frustrating discovering great stuff that you can't even read or grab.\n\nAnd I know this is a "joke game", but what is wrong with the animals balance? How in the bloody hell a freaking RAT obliterated me? I'M A BEAR.\n\nAs I said, I really wanted to like and love this game, but I'm not masochist enough to be running around the same places over and over again with no stamina, no strenght and no intelligence, and no elements to get more of those anywhere to be seen. I guess I'll try to fight enemies with my valves or eating off my hats to not starve to death. Hopefully this things will get patched out in the near future, and if so, then I would gladly rejoin the adventure of exploring and recommend it to some friends, but in the state that is right now, yeah, it's playable, but absolutely not enjoyable.","February 27","false","2.6"," 281 of 401 people (70%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","70","281","401","15","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/recommended/395850/","PutridMeat","PutridMeat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/","215 products in account","UnBEARable...?\nBear Simulator = Faux "Simulator" humor game + Bears + A low rent Skyrim\n\nFor a little context, this was a game sucessfully Kickstarted years ago for something to the tune of $100k.  The KS itself was something of a mess but we aren't here to review a KS campaign.  We're here to review a game and chew bubblegum.  And I'm all outta bubblegum.  ...Wait no, I still have some! ::obnoxious chewing noises::\n\nBear Simulator is yet another one of those kinds of "Simulator" games that are to actual simulations what mockumentaries are to documentaries.  In Bear Simulator you are (duh) a Bear.  Although there is a plot, there is little to no narration or introduction as to what your motivation for getting up and out of the den in the morning should be.  Most of the gameplay consists of wandering around the environment to find hidden bits of food and/or animals to eat.  Eating causes your stats to go up which in turn allows you to access more areas, read more hints, and eat better items.  90% of the game is this, a sort of exploratory collect-a-thon.\n\nThere is a story to unfold and other objectives to complete as well, but completing these objectives basically consists of having stats high enough to get into a certain area/being methodical enough to find whatever hidden thing you need.  This process is made that much more laborious by the fact that the game world, which is quite large actually, has no map.  You'll need to simply memorize where everything is and this ends up resulting in a lot of needless backtracking.\n\nThe environments themselves range from reasonably pretty to absolutely hideous.  Some areas were made with a bit of care whilst others suffer from terrible texture stretching/shimmering.  Still, it is a bit of chill-paced fun to explore areas, eat stuff, and examine some of the funny notes/items and such scattered about the world.  That world feels rather barren, however, with really not much to do other than eat things, and all food/animals are finite so once you've eaten them it makes everything feel even more like a ghost town.\n\nThere is also "combat" to be had.  It is extremely awkward and imprecise and often it's better to run away from that scary frog rather than fight it.  There is a charge attack you can unlock but since it is really quite hard to hit enemies it is sometimes better to simply spam your claw swipe and hope you don't get too jacked up.  It definitely did not make me feel like a mighty bear.  More like an oversized teddy bear.\n\nAs you get more powerful/capable, you will be able to venture further out from the starting hub-like zone and discover a lot of strange happenings and mysteries.  It's interesting as passive story-telling but doesn't grip you like a bear-hug should.\n\nBecome a bear if you...\n\nJust REALLY like the concept.  There is some interesting stuff in the game and yeah, I thought some of it was actually funny (really corny, but funny).\nWant to play an adventure game that is really different.  This is that at least.\nAre willing to gamble that the MANY rough patches will be smoothed out by the developer.\nFeed the alligators instead if you...\n\nDon't want to play a very amateur-looking/feeling game.\nAren't willing to cope with bugs.\nAre averse to memey-corny type humor, and/or hate these "LOLRANDOM Simulator" type games.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough I'm actually getting a little bit of enjoyment out of being a bear, I can't, at this point in time, recommend it to anyone else (particularly at this price point).  I've already encountered far too many bugs and the first time you see some of the hokey AI and animation you are going to laugh for sure...  For all the wrong reasons.  I'm really hoping that the developer continues to work on the game's bear necessities.  If he does, this wouldn't actually be a bad quirky little adventure game.  Would I come back to update my review in the face of future updates?

The charm wears off extremely fast due to poor gameplay mechanics that feel like they should be included. Basic things that feel like they should be included: A map, and some form of skill/stat chart. When certain things require for me to have X stat, it's frustrating having to look around to find things that make me smarter or stronger, uncertain of how many I need to eat.\n\nAs for the map, this game feels so directionless, and I easily lose track of where I've been, because the general blandness of the map. I feel constantly lost, and end up going in circles, to occasionally rediscover a landmark or two. Maybe something of a radar, a bear-dar if you will, would help greatly. Just something that says "Food is nearby" or "An item is nearby".\n\nTwo other gripes I have are the hitboxes, which feel nonexistant, especially when every creature is fast moving, except frogs. Having a massive bear claw swing, it feels like I should be doing something when I hit a location that isn't the center of being.\n\nMy last major complaint is that I'm not sure what is poor level design, and what is 'secrets off the beating path'. I'll often be reminded of Skyrim and Fallout, jumping and holding W as I traverse a mountain, only to find a flat surface, with nothing on it. Yet, I still feel obligated to climb up these mountains, in the event there is something hidden, since there is no real other way to know otherwise. Also, on at least two occasions, I felt like I skipped part of the map, just by climbing on things until I was able to jump over whatever barrier was preventing me. Again, not sure if I was supposed to or not, becuase there is practically no explaniation of this is game design of exploiting Dev's errors.\n\nI want to end on a positive note, though. This game is still salvagable. A few features and fixes could make this game fun.  I think that part of what makes this fun is the Steam's stream ability, which allows me to privately have a group of friends watch, and experience the jokes and laugh along with the jokes that are scattered through the game. Honestly, its' the only way I can continue through it at it's current state.\n\n4/10, I am honestly sad that this game turned out the way it did.","February 27","false","1.7"," 155 of 243 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","155","243","7","3"

My partner Steve was sick with typhoid fever, and I was serving my shifts alone. I got a call in the morning that some campers (who were camping ILLEGALLY) had spotted a grizzly bear within 100 feet of their campground. As a devoted ranger, it was my RESPONSIBILITY to protect these people. When I responded to the call, I came upon a campground painted with the blood and guts of these park visitors. I almost VOMITED in pure disgust. Little did I know, the grizzly bear that had committed this atrocious act of violence was still lurking amidst the trees only meters away from where I stood. He must have smelled the peanut butter sandwich I held in my pants pocket. He charged at me, tackling me to the ground with a level of force unrivaled by any earthly creature. Luckily, I had a .44 in my ankle holster, which I used to shoot the bear in the neck, as he snacked on my delicious sandwich (later I learned this bear was allergic to peanut butter anyway). Did I flinch or hesitate to destroy this animal? No, because I had to do it to save my own skin. If I had a scud missile I would've used it. Maybe it was perverse of me to open this game, expecting to play this kind-of encounter out from the other side, but regardless, I didn't get to experience any scenario close to the TERROR of my own. Although later I learned that bear was a golden retriever. I lost my job that day, but I could've lost my life. Instead, all I got were childish memes, clearly picked from the mind of a CHILD, not seasoned by the horrors and sights of what MEN like myself have seen within national parks. You grass men seem to think creatures like these are JOKES. They aren't. A bear killed my brother in '92.\n\nThe American Grizzly Bear is one of the most formidable animals in any given forest. Its power is unmatched. One strike from its muscular limbs could leave a man dead.\n\nIf you're giving a game in which I step into the body of a BEAR, THEN I'D EXPECT TO FEEL STRONG. I'd EXPECT to overpower any fellow animal, much like that giant golden retriever overpowered me. Nature is NOT a joke. People lose their lives. It's not a little virtual playground for grassmen to make jokes about frogs. Liliputian homunculi.\n\nSo next time you think about make a game with bears, please depict them with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ accuracy. LIfe isn't a meme. Men lose their lives. Golden retrievers (unfortunately) get shot in the throat.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 (I have to admit the frogs were quite humorous).\n\n- Ranger Charles","February 27","false","0.5"," 523 of 861 people (61%) found this review helpful 479 people found this review funny","61","523","861","479","44"

Janky\n-  Not enough foods restore stamina once you go out farther into the world\n\nConclusion: 8/10\nWhile this game is very good IMHO, it could use some improvements. I'm probably just going to write this up and thing over 100 different things to say in this part as I'm happily sprinting away toward whatever ♥♥♥♥ing alligator decides to take a bite out of me.\n\n","March 6","true","11.8"," 64 of 100 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","64","100","4","0"

As expected, you play as a bear doing bear things like hunting, scavenging, exploring, wearing silly hats, and discovering ancient bear temples. Bear Simulator is a sort of Sandbox/Action & Adventure game with a hint of plot behind it. It should be noted that Bear Simulator is not just a game you can relatively finish and find everything within an hour. In fact, I've played over 18 hours of this game and I still have not seen everything. Most of the fun from Bear Simulator comes from finding and collecting things and exploring the land. So if you enjoy games that center around collecting and adventure, this is the game for you.\n\nWith all of that said there are some problems with the game any potential buyer should know about. There are a lot (and I mean A LOT) of places you can get literally stuck in with saving and respawning at your den or whatnot being your only saving grace. Also, the hitboxes for some of the animals can be quite wonky and there are a few platforming segments that can be absolutely rage inducing. However, it should be noted that the single creator of this game, Farjay, is trying to fix these problems but is having a hard time with some of them as he is a first-time game developer.\n\nIn the end I feel as if maybe this game should have been released as early access or backer only until more problems were fixed but as it is its a very fun and unique game to play that I would recomend to anyone who enjoys being the best bear they can be and doesn't mind the bugs.","March 6","true","22.6"," 48 of 74 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","48","74","0","0"

This isn't that, don't come in expecting that. This game was made entirely by one person, and it was made with the purpose of having fun, and that's it, but having said that.\n\nI have enjoyed every second of this game. It gives you exactly everything that you'd ask for in a BEAR simulator. You're a bear, so have fun. The game itself is very soothing to me--akin to something of Viscera clean-up but in a collect-a-thon way. It's not the prettiest game, but that isn't the focus. It's being a bear, and doing bear things.\n\nThis game is a wonderful experience, and although it might not be for everyone with its quirky humor and playful gameplay, I've had a blast playing it, and it was worth every cent.\n\nOn another note, supposively due to the bad reviews(although few, currently It's at 30 negative to 120+ positive) has incited the game dev to stop developing the game. I hope he continues to make it, there is a lot of promise here, and I really want to see this game at its fully-fledged beartential. Having said that, the game is still well-worth the price.\n\nAnd Game dev, if you see this, thank you so much for making this game! I love it so much, and you shouldn't let the opinions of the few outweigh the many! We understand you, we understand what Bear Simulator is supposed to be, and we love it even for what it is! So don't let the negativity drag you down!

Do you want to wander around exploring, hunting, fishing, scavenging, eating, and climbing around on things? Do you want to sniff around and find out where other animals have been, and what they've been up to? Do you want to uncover spooky ancient mysteries? Well this is the bear game for you!\n\nI've played this now for quite a few hours, plus some more time with the kickstarter preview, and I have to say this is everything I'd hoped it would be. The graphics are better than I expected and quite good for a one-man development team. Few games live up to the hype, but Bear Simulator absolutely delivered. Beware of negative reviews with very little playtime. Those people have surely not even discovered a fraction of what this game has to offer.\n\nBased on my rate of progress, I'd expect this game will take me at least 40 hours to just explore and find everything, eat everything, and complete the game. Not a bad entertainment/price ratio at $15. Anyone who says it'll take less than that has clearly not found any of the hidden zones yet and isn't playing this game to its fullest. There's a lot of secret stuff to discover, and the world is a bigger place than it first appears.\n\nAre there bugs? Sure. Nothing game-breaking though. The game is difficult at times but I've caught, killed, and eaten ducks, successfully fought and killed some other predators, and gotten over or around various barriers that seemed too challenging at first. Sometimes you just need better bear stats before you attempt things, or need to get better at the game. Take your time, really investigate your environment fully, and then only move on when you're absolutely sure you've finished an area. Chances are high you'll still need to come back though, and don't forget that there's different challenges at night, and the weather changes things too.\n\nThis game is not for everyone. If you've got no sense of humor, no sense of direction, no attention span, or are obsessed with graphics above all else, you'll probably hate this game. If you like adventure, like exploring every nook-and-cranny of a huge and fascinating world, and don't take things too seriously, you'll have a blast. The game does start slow, and at first doesn't appear very deep. Give it some time, explore a bit, both in daytime and nighttime, and you'll really discover all that this game has to offer. This is not a game that can be judged in a 15 minute let's play.","March 7","true","25.8"," 28 of 45 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","28","45","0","1"

Plenty of hidden little secrets and nooks to find setpieces left by the dev to delight you.\n\nIt's not a very youtube friendly game compared to other "simulators," while the game has silly dialog boxes for most things, it really is a game about getting as far as you can from the bear cave until you die and return to it.\n\nI have a few issues with it, nothing unfixable afaik. I'd like to be able to attack while sprinting, or to have the time between dropping out of sprint and attacking heavily reduced.  ducks are nearly impossible to hit due to this, they fly away before you can get close.\n\nStat points are kinda of... not well thought out, in that they are entirely too well thought out.  All it needs is health and stamina. It's supposed to be a simple game about exploring and being a bear, it doesnt need RPG elements like luck and smell level. Bears should be able to smell everything just fine without having to eat ducks to make numbers go up. Combat shouldnt be a numbers game either, it should be about fairly easily killing the creature but not losing too much stamina in the process so you dont pass out before finding food.\n\nI really enjoyed the time I spent with it, it's charming and clearly has had a lot of effort put in by one person. I'll be back to exploring it soon I think, the environment is legit cool and the dev is a well-intentioned guy.\n","March 12","true","1.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Of course, it took its fair amount of patience, but I rarely lack in that field. That, AND, I'm a huge fan of exploration games, and that's mainly what this game is+adventure+some platforming, rather than a simulator.\n\nYou explore to find out what the goal of the game is and its story. To find out why you're playing as a bear. To find out the indications of what you need to do. To find out why you lack stats to eat certain foods or do certain things, even if it doesn't really make sense. And, if you give the game the chance to, it's really made well enough that you get your answers if you bother going beyond what you're maybe usually use to go in video games. Bear Simulator DARES not take you by the hand and show you the way, and instead, pushes you to get out of your comfort zone.\n\nYou're not given a map. So what? The game's environnement is designed well enough that you can make your own map in your head without getting confused. There's a whole bunch of beacons and landmarks everywhere, and nothing looks exactly the same. After playing about 10 hours, I knew my way around the entire game world pretty darn easily and if you can run it on high graphics, some of the environnements are pretty darn neat-looking, especially one region of the game, even WITH some low-res and stretched textures.\n\nThe game has also a good share of surprises and things that are, depending on how easily you can be amused, pretty worth working hard to unlock, especially after grinding your stats and unlocking new abilities.\n\nNow, for the less positive. Yes, indeed, the game has its BIG share of bugs. Like, I got stuck in some parts of the environnement many MANY times and had to go back to the main menu to reload AND the hit detection is sometimes very ackward, even if you can get it working right after a while.\n\nYes, the game is rather unfinished, but if you can get pass those two aspects, which I think are the two major ones, to me, really, this was pretty darn worth the money I spent on it, and I would love to see it get properly finished with ALL the other remaining mysteries still left unanswered after completing the last possible objective.\n\nSo, overall. Yeah. It ain't a game for everybody to enjoy and you gotta like the gendra and be able to forgive silly things and some bugs here and there to be able to fully have fun playing it. And this, I got all that was needed to achieve.","April 1","true","26.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It doesn’t run at 600 FPS!?”\n\nI kickstarted this game for $30 and I don’t regret it.  It’s exactly what I expected.  A silly, fun, little bear game.  You walk around, beat up animals to eat, and harvest bugs, berries and mushrooms.\n\nDev doesn’t communicate?  He posted 46 different updates to kickstarter.  He did fine.  The game runs exceptionally well on ultimate graphics settings for me.  I’ve gotten stuck on the map twice, but saving and loading shifts your position, so no big deal.\n\nYes, you can lose to a fox.  The point of gathering berries, bugs and eating other animals is to improve your stats, such as damage and health.  It’s called progression.  Something too tough?  Gather more things first.  Not sure why everyone is making such a big deal out of such a simple game.\n\nThe game is incredibly in depth for a one man project, especially his first project.  Don’t listen to the kickstarter hype.  I’m satisfied with my backing.  Honestly I’d say this is almost fit to be a children’s game.  If you’re looking for a serious game, then move on.  This is just a little silly fun.\n\nTo get this game via Kickstarter was only $15.  Same price as it is now.\n\nThere were 17 different updates emailed out by Kickstarter to backers in 2015 alone between March and September. 45 updates since backing.  The Dev wasn't silent.\n\nIt had an  estimated  release of Nov. 2014.  Pretty good for a one man show's first time.","March 7","true","2.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","5"

Needless to say I'll keep playing it. Reminds me of older games where there wasn't much to explain and tons to explore. I think the big difference between this game and goat simulator is that while goat simulator relied on easter eggs and gimmicks to make the game fun. This game plays more like an RPG with tons of collectables and secrets. As well as some nice jokes. I would recommend this game to people who like comfy games or just want to be a bear.

I backed it on Kickstarter and I don't regret that for a moment. It's a silly little collect-a-thon that reminds me of shareware games from yonks ago, along with a little bit of Twilight Princess's wolf Link, and a dash of walking simulator thrown in. It's a laugh being a bear. And honestly, some of it's pretty clever and I'd love to see the idea developed even further. It has some real potential behind it!\n\nI've mostly played this in its Kickstarter Humble Bundle preview release version, and recently (finally) got around to switching to the Steam version. So I don't have too many hours here, yet.\n\nI've heard that this has been unfairly roasted by PewDiePie and that that's killed the enthusiasm of the developer. This saddens me. After all the misogynistic, homophobic, racist, and generally unpleasant and imbecilic things that come out of his channel, it's really not clever to put any stock in it. He's discredited himself on countless, countless occasions. And the fans are often rabid and crazy enough to deserve being institutionalised. Not a good crowd.\n\nSo, that said, do I recommend this? Do you enjoy game where you've played as an animal or animal-like creature? Such as Okami, Ori, Twilight Princess, and so on? Do you like mysteries and collect-a-thons? Do you, perhaps, have an urge to eat all of the things? And do you enjoy playing games which are just a little bit different?\n\nThen yeah. Be a bear.

I personally enjoy them, and I think this game is one of a kind.\n\nI really like PewDiePie, but I think there was some kind of a misunderstanding. I don't think he managed to explore the whole map of this game. At first, exploring the forest might be troubling or considered somewhat boring because almost everything is hidden including other regions, but this game is deep. I could definately tell that they put a lot of effort to this game.\n\nI do have to say the bear's story advances slowly. So..At first, it might be hard to get this game, I guess. It has hidden messages if you play it through and explore different areas. Everything is meticulously planned and designed, even the right timing(or bear level) of when to find an area or a special souvenir, etc.\n\nIt might be challenging to control your bear or survive or eat something or find something at first, but it's really fun to make the bear eat a lot of different things and discover new areas and make the bear super strong/intelligent. I really like how they made these different areas. If you explore around enough, you'll find a radioactive zone, beautiful beach and even a spooky area. You can also give your bear a fun makeover, which is enjoyable as well. They have a rastafarian hat, a nice cap, glasses, a moustache, and fun bear furs. I also like the casual humour they put in to this game, because fun remarks would pop up if your bear does something that a human wouldn't normally do. It made me laugh while I played. I think this game is appropriate for all age and gender. Everyone can enjoy this.\n\nBut I do hope that the bear control would be easier and maybe have more options for choosing my own key for bear movements? cuz I prefer different keys for jumping or running.\n\nIf you start upgrading your bear enough, I think you'd definitely find the true essence of this game and what the developer is trying to say. I mean, it even raises awareness on environmental issues! Like I said, this game is deep. It's definitely worth $15. Love this! Keep up the great work, and hope to see this game expand inside and outside.","April 6","true","79.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I would like those of you who read this to keep that in mind. This is the only game that I have ever purchased where I have liked it at first, but then realized that it is a complete waste of time, energy, and my money. There is no direct goal to be heard of, no way of guiding the player on what the hell they're supposed to do besides gaining 20 intelligence to eat a ♥♥♥♥ing mushroom, which in order to do that you have to comb the area before for things to eat (which don't re-spawn so it makes it even more time consuming). This game had a lot of potential, but didn't execute it correctly. The color scheme and concept are amazing but everything else doesn't meet that and it's charm of exploring and eating things is removed when you have to scrutinize every detail from the area just so you can make any semblance of progress. I only have 4 hours because I thought it was going to go somewhere at a decent pace. The reason this game is bad isn't because it's inherently a bad game, It had a lot of good things going for it, but the poor execution completely killed this game that, otherwise, would have been very delightful and charming to play.","March 6","false","3.8"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

I haven't, but I've seen plenty of people say it in forums. For those people, there is Bear Simulator.\n\nImagine if, in Miasmata, you played as a bear instead of a human. And instead of crushing berries and mushrooms in a mortar & pestle, you eat them right off the bush/ground. (Personally, as an amateur ursologist, I have a theory about why bears never invented the mortar & pestle. Bear paws are very unsuited for the type of gripping involved, and the claws don't help either. My theory has been mocked by professionals, though, who claim that bears "aren't smart enough." But this simulator proves that bears do possess intelligence and can improve it by consuming smart shrooms and lab rats.) Also, instead of triangulating positions on a map, you just get lost because technology is currently unable to simulate a bear's natural sense of direction.\n\nI've yet to figure out how to hit things with the charged power swipe, but I'm still having fun following Wally Duck's tribulations.","March 14","true","7.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

If I had to describe it in five, I'd say it's "Cute, but a real mess."\n\nAs a well-known lover of bears, I followed and backed the Kickstarter. I was curious to see what it was going to be like, and was interested in the developer's sense of humor. The dry and inoffensive humor is the game's shining feature, as each example of writing in the game has a sort of cute and casual cadence to it that actually had me looking forward to the next item description or animal smell. It's such a shame that the actually interesting things to look at are hidden behind [long stretches of incredibly ugly textures and] (note: this is no longer an issue) z-fighting shadows (even on the highest graphics settings), very difficult "enemies" with incredibly small hitboxes, wonky platforming, and [obnoxious stat barriers] (note: this is no longer as big an issue). I found a door in a place called Nido Valley (A Dark Souls reference?) that required 777 in a certain stat and something called Bear Courage, [and even eating mushrooms would require you to have a high enough Intelligence stat] (note: this is no longer an issue). Also, and I don't really know how to describe this, but the trees wobble. I think that the trees react to your view bob differently depending on how far away they are. Bizarre. (note: I have been informed that this is an engine limitation. It's still weird, though)\n\nAs a developer's first game, it's a nice little prototype/practice for what could possibly be described as a "real" game sometime in the future. I'd be interested in reading a wiki for this game, but I absolutely do not have the patience to write it. Maybe pick this up if you really love bears and simple jokes, and have a lot of time to waste and don't mind walking simulators.\n\n\nEdit: As of March 3rd, Farjay released a patch upgrading the texture qualities and removing the stat requirements on food. Although there is still a significant amount of Z fighting on shadows (Z fighting is where two textures that occupy the same space overlap each other and fight to be seen), these updates fixed the two biggest problems I had with this game. The game is actually pretty good looking now! I am now upgrading this to an uniornic recommendation.","February 26","true","1.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","20"

Unfortunely. So, let's get to the review:\n(Short version is BEFORE THE summary at the bottom.)\n\nLONG VERSION:\n\n\nTEH GRAPHFICS\n\nThey are good for a Unity game, considering it's just one guy (I assume) who made these all by himself (I assume), I really mean it. I've seen worse. Much worse. Not much to talk about here. Apart from random stuttering and lag in some locations where a lot of stuff is going on, even off-screen. Something Unity is good at in the hands of unexperienced/unseasoned user of Unity. Obviously we've all seen worse optimization, even in AAA games.\n\n\nTEH AUDIO\n\nWell, we get all the sound effects you might expect: punch, hit, monster idle sounds, etc. There is no ambient music though, so just put on some Mambo #5 and you're good to go. However, the music when you find a temple, or an altar, the music is... intriguing... it adds to the atmosphere of this... mysterious story. That's pretty good. The music in the main menu sounds generic though.\n\n\nTEH GAMEPLAY\n\nWeeeellll... it's kinda boring. I was hoping for a little more (like everybody else I guess), like you know: you can get a clan of bears, upgrade your cave to hold more bears, go out with your bear-clan and kick some bottoms, fight other bear-clans far away, etc, etc.\nUnfortunely, nothing like that here. It would be ok, IF the monsters you fight against would respawn, so it wouldn't be so empty when you kill everything. Yes, the monsters die forever, just like the food you ate disappers forever, so if you're suddenly low on stamina/health and you've killed/ate everything... too bad.\nBUT, this killing/eating is tied to progression of you bear. You kill/eat something, your attributes get upgraded. This is where it got in the wrong direction. It would be a smarter decision to make the Bear Points your experience and you can spend Bear Points to upgrade your attributes. That way, you could make stuff respawn, so players could kill them again and get more Bear Points to upgrade other attributes. By making mobs/food add attributes themselves, removes that possibility, because players could just come back to the same mob and kill it over and over to upgrade their jump skill. So the Bear Points have been rendered useless. Unless you care about 2x damage, which doesn't do anything. Still takes about 3 hits to kill a fox. Upgrade strength, then it takes 2. So yeah, Bear Points = useless. They could be experience that you spent on attributes/perks, but unfortunely no.\nThe combat seems a bit broken. I hit an animal, it immidietly hits me back. Twice. No way to dodge either. Sometimes it works, but sometimes dodging doesn't work even when you're standing behind the monster. It's hard to explain this unless you've played it, but believe me it's terrible. The hit detection is very shoddy too. I point at the monster, right at his heart/head, it misses 50% of the time, whilst they hit you twice per your hit and almost never miss.\n\nWhen you sleep in the bed, you can choose to sleep until day or night. Apart from changing day to night and night to day, it changes the mobs to different ones. Also, some events/monsters appear/happen only during the night or day, so you'll be doing a lot of back-and-forth from location to location.\n\nHOWEVER... The story, is VERY intriguing. There is something eerie to the story, about... some ancient bears. The story, this... mysteriousness is awesome. It really is. Combined with that strange music when you find the temples is just... a great combination. This is a very strong positive thing to this game. I loved it and that's what kept me playing for... IDK, 12 hours? Of course the combat was annoying and when I killed/ate most of the things it got pretty boring.\n\n\nTEH CHARACTERS\n\nWell, the models actually look good, especially the bear. The animations are also done well, but the animation for differnet actions, doesn't match up with the speed coded for those actions, so you can see the rabbit moving his legs really fast, but then you look how far he moved and it's just a few centimeters from you. It looked like he would put like a 20 second gap between us, but no.\nOne of the more annoying non-aggressive mobs has to be THE DUCKS. They take off like a F-16 or something. And like I mention: hit detection is not good, so it's hard to hit them. Also, all the mobs that fight back are annoying too. Why? Read TEH GAMEPLAY.\n\n\nMISC STUFF\n\nI don't think there's anything else to talk about.  Oh no wait, collectibles. They are there and some of them are useful, others... not so much. Useful: those for the bear, like a bed or a new skin/hat (bear with hats? That's cool). Not-so-useful: the ones for your cave. They don't seem to be doing anything. Except the bed. I also got... a cat that doesn't move or meow, a cat bed, some hats, a different skin and a new bed. I don't know much, because I still haven't finished this game. Surprisingly, this is a very long game, if you want the 100%.\nThe locations could be unlocked if you had enough Bear Points or level (if Bear Points were actually useful). There is no fast travel as well, so prepare for A LOT of walking, as you go back and forth to explore the same locations during the night and day. It's just... not fun. It's tedious. + when there is no ambient things going on AND when you kill everything there is to kill on your way somewhere, it gets even less fun and more tedious/boring.\n\nSHORT VERSION BELOW.\n\n\n\n\nSHORT VERSION:\nThe story has a very strong mysterious feel to it and the music that plays when you find temples that are connected to the story adds even more to that atmosphere. A bunch of collectibles like hats and skins and bed upgrades. Also some other collectibles that don't seem to do much, apart from makin your cave prettier/more lively. The combat is not good. The hit detection is shoddy. Character progression has some bad decisions to it, like mobs adding attributes rendering Bear Points (which could be used as experience so players could upgrade stats themselves) useless. Mobs/food doesn't respawn, making your world emptier as you progress. No fast travel. Expect to spend most of your time going back-and-forth to your cave to change from night to day or day to night, as some things happen at night or day.\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY:\nI still recomend this game. It has lots of negatives, some positives, but I don't think those negatives are beacuse of the developer being terrible at... coding or something. Some locations actually look interesting and are well made. I think that he just made some bad decision here and there. Considering how this is his first game, it's not surprising that he made a few things wrong (like making Bear Points useless... I know, I can't get over that, but it just bothers me a lot, since they could work as experience points. Missed potential right here.), but hey, if you don't fall... you... won't know how to stand up? IDK, I'm not good at this.\nOverall, it was a tedious/boring adventure so far. The only thing that kept me going was the mysterious thing/story in the game. If you can look past all the other things and focus on the story and mysteriousness/exploration you might put some hours into it... like me.\nIf you can't look past the problems... this is not for you.\n\nAlso, I'm not here to give life advice to the developer, beacuse he feels sad the game got so much hate. I feel sorry for him, I really do. But I'm here to review the game, something the developer can use to better his next game, or update the current one. That's it.","April 3","true","12.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paladinarndt/recommended/395850/","Paladinarndt","PaladinƱ★❤♧۩","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paladinarndt/","307 products in account","I wanted to like this game. I've actually been following this game off and on since I saw the kickstarter. I thought that I had found a game that would be a giant hit like Goat Simulator was when it came out. You know, something that doesn't take itself too seriously, and is mostly there for you to laugh at its absurdity. By looking at the website before this game came out, it seemed like this game was heading in a good direction. There were jokes everywhere; and they were actually pretty funny.\n\nSo naturally, when the game came out, I bought it. I was ready to be a bear.\n\n....I quit after 1 hour.\n\nWhy? Because there's nothing to do. In that one hour, I walked around a world that was more barren than anything I'd ever encountered in games like Fallout, which are SUPPOSED to be barren and devoid of life. I killed two rabbits, which I was only able to do because they got stuck on terrain, one duck, and then died to a fox. A fox....the natural enemy of the bear, obviously.\n\nThe game mostly consists of this: Walk around and try to find something to eat. Oh, is that an apple on the ground? Eat it. Yay, some stats went up. Is that another apple? Eat it too. Yay, some stats went up. Is that a plant of some sort? Eat it too. You cannot eat this plant. You are too stupid. Yes, you can apparently be too dumb to eat things. Things that you REALLY NEED TO EAT so that a fox doesn't kick your ♥♥♥ in a fight.\n\nNow, you may be reading this and think "Well gee, I dunno, that sounds like it might be kinda funny.\nTrust me, it's not. It's extremely tedious. You can walk around forever and not find anything to interact with. The highlight of my gameplay was finding a hat.\n\nPROS:\nYou are a bear.\nYou are smart enough to eat an apple without killing yourself.\nThere is the occasional funny sign to find.\nI found a hat.\nCONS:\n\nWorld is so barren that it looks like the apocalypse just happened and they didn't take the bears with them.\nGraphics look like something I'd find on a PS2 game in the year 2004. A lot of things, such as hills, just look like extremely stretched textures.\nHit registration is off. In combat, I died to a fox because my right paw REFUSED TO HIT ANYTHING, EVER!\nTHERE IS NOTHING TO DO. - This is the biggest drawback to the game. There is literally nothing to do. If there were more animals to kill, more places and secrets to find, more funny things in the world itself, and you weren't so stupid that you risk killing yourself if you eat a mushroom, then the game has the POTENTIAL to be fun. As of right now, the game is a chore to play. I bought this with the intention to start make a YouTube series out of it, but there was so little actual content in the game, that it was just incredibly boring.\nOverall score: 2/10 - Would not bear again.","March 14","false","1.0"," 18 of 40 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","18","40","3","0"

Many of the funders knew that (1) this is a bear simulator (2) this was Farjay's first real game and (3) the game was more than 3x overfunded, which is not a good thing. You couldn't go into this expecting a 100k game made by an indie professional, and if your negative review is negative because it isn't a game you'd normally pay ~$20 for, then you came in expecting the wrong thing. This game is called Bear Simulator, and it is exactly that.\n\nWe start off waking up from hibernation (by that I mean the extra year of development the game took, much of which was without any updates - which I am not using to affect this review) in a bear den. You explore the world, which is surprisingly large and detailed, looking for food. There are a lot of random things to find (e.g. boards that have Bear Facts on them, random signs that have been graffitied), and I've enjoyed reading pretty much everything. Farjay's humor was what originally drew me into the game (other than my love for bears), and the game is rife with it. I personally quickly found myself acting like a bear - all I cared about was finding food. Everything is pretty much about eating in this game, which is pretty much realistic for a bear coming out of hibernation. Granted, the game effectively becomes a big ol' collectaphon, but I've enjoyed the constant need to stuff my bear stomach. Food gives you stat bonuses, and these bonuses help you in your exploration (and subsequently adding more interesting foods to your culinary repertoire. It's fun, it's silly, and it's very bear-like.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does suffer from a few issues:\nThere is no map, which makes the expansive world a bit difficult to explore consistently\nThere isn’t much food and few animals to kill, which quickly makes the world seems empty. It’s made worse because the food and animals don’t respawn.\nSome items don’t really make sense – e.g. some mushrooms require a certain amount of intelligence…which I’m not really sure the reason behind\nThere are a number of weird clipping issues when it comes to the environment, just random areas where the controls don’t work well, you can’t jump, etc. It seems to be mostly around rock formations and cliff areas.These were my biggest issues with the game. Otherwise, this is really just a bear simulator with some bonus things in it. It isn’t much like Goat simulator, which many people seem to have expected it to be.\n","March 1","true","3.2"," 17 of 40 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","17","40","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/memeflower/recommended/395850/","memeflower","She Scream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/memeflower/","139 products in account","I backed this game as soon as the kickstarter was released, and I've been watching the progress ever since. Now that I've been able to experience the final product I can say without a doubt that it perfectly does the two things it always set out to do: being about exploration.... and also being a bear.\n\nAs I said before, it's about exploration. There's plenty of places to explore, and plenty of things to find. Plus, you get the added bonus of doing all this as a bear. There are of course added bear attributes, such as having a den and hunting for food.\n\nThe game can be a bit buggy with hitboxes and getting stuck (I've gotten stuck inbetween rocks a lot, and once in a floor of an area that required me to crawl). However, the hitbox part only seemed to be a real problem with the Mean Wolves. I would certainly look into getting stuck though. I also think the intelligence levels needed to eat some foods is a bit high.\n\nOver all, I think the game is amazing at what it is supposed to be. It's not for everyone of course, but I can 100% recommend it if you like collecting things, good basic humor, and just generally exploring. Unfortunately, I think $15 is just a tad bit too expensive for just this... perhaps $10 would be a better base price. Still... if you have the money and you want it go for it.","March 1","true","15.5"," 17 of 49 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","17","49","0","0"

What's so interesting about this stupid looking bear game?" Well, I don't know. This game is exactly what you'd expect it to be like, but as you play it, you start to realize that it's very different than you expected. Yes, you play as a bear. You beat down some lesser-being chumps and forage berries, mushrooms, and such to increase your stats and restore life/stamina. You explore and run around a lot. But let's break this down:\n\nPROS:\n- Best Bear Simulator on the market.\n- Notable sense of progression.\n- A storyline with some lore, surprisingly.\n- Plenty of humor as long as you don't take this game seriously.\n- Hidden stuff to find.\n- Pretty impressive since it was a one-man studio making his first game.\n- Achievements and trading cards.\n- You can find decorations, pets/friends, and other things to put in your den.\n\nCons:\n-No clear sense of direction.\n- You get stuck pretty easily, but learn quickly how to avoid it.\n- Food/animals don't respawn, so getting health back can be kind of a pain.\n- Textures can be hit or miss. I would assume they're just bought from somewhere, since this was, as previously stated, made by one guy.\n- Initially searching for things to increase your stats (specifically intelligence) can be a bit annoying, since you need higher intelligence to eat most foods.\n- The hitbox detection for fighting is awful. Don't even try to kite around something, they can hit you when you're behind them and you won't hit them half the time.\n\nYou'll mostly like this game if you want something simple, fun, and exploratory. Don't take this game seriously, and you'll enoy it. A good, fairly mindless time sink. (I wouldn't recommend buying this at $15, though.)\n\n*Edited to add hitboxes as a con.\n\nMay 5th, 2016 edit: The Dev has fixed many of the issues, by giving you a checklist of what to do, fixing hitboxes, removing a lot of the intelligence barriers on food, and adding quick travel.","February 29","true","24.2"," 28 of 79 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","28","79","0","0"

It's clever with silly jokes throughout the game.\n4. No controller support yet. Use something like Xpadder if you want to use a controller, which I think is better than keyboard and mouse.\n5. A lot of graphics pop-in.\n6. Make sure your build up your stats before wandering to new and tougher areas because every bear should work out (eat a lot) before hitting the streets.\n\nI give it 2 paws up. Would eat again.\n\nUPDATE: The developer has fixed some issues like graphics and the ability to invert mouse look.

It's silly, I realize, but it's reminding me something of early gaming for me.  There's collectibles, secret areas, lots of exploration, and some content is numbers gated, meaning you sometimes just can't jump high enough.  There are a few oddly placed doors, and...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamawesomeface/recommended/395850/","adamawesomeface","AdamAwesomeface","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adamawesomeface/","88 products in account","I backed thisbon kickstarter so I have watched this game go from silly images to the version it is now.   I think that the game is fun if you like to explore and find Easter eggs and little funny jokes.  It's controls work most of the time but I have had to restart at my den a few times by getting stuck inside of rocks unable to run or jump out at various parts of the map.  This is frustrating and to some it may be a deal breaker -- but I also know that one man made this whole game happen by himself and is his first appempt at making a game\nI think from what this game started out being and where it is are night and day in a good way.  It's not the best game every. It's not polished and has tons of voice actors or writers making it amazing.  It's a game where youre a bear.  You run around and do bear things.  It's very simple but lives up to everything it states.. And more.  I can see why a lot of people are spewing hate on the forums, but I can see a lot of people are also just playing it for what it is.. A silly bear game...and being really surprised at how well it is that.  Hope this helps.","February 29","true","3.6"," 9 of 42 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","9","42","0","0"

Ive mostly explored all the regions in 10 hours of gameplay\nCollecting objects and completeing objectives to complete story is entertaining\nItem descriptions are funny, but after a while you just interact with stuff without reading the text\nAll round, entertaining to sink a few hours into. Lots of secrets and stuff to do.\n\nCons:\nCombat is almost completely broken. Nearly impossible to catch some animals unless they glitch and get stuck in one spot. Often animals that attack you will run towards you, moving their hitbox too close to you to be hit, but they will keep hitting you.\nGetting stuck in some areas is too common, no movement works on some slopes. Sometimes you can crawl into an area and get stuck. Requires save/reload.\n\nOther notes:\n\nStill highly recommend\n\nPrevious review below--\n\n\nGreat game so far. Here are the pros and cons:\nPros:\nYou get to play as a bear\nMap is huge, and ive only barely explored one of the 7 regions in 90 min of gameplay\nIve been waiting for this game for years so having it makes me happy\nHilarious item descriptions and scenery througout\nYou get to play as a bear\n\nCons:\nHave gotten stuck once under a ramp, had to drain energy to die to get out\nBasically impossible to dodge attacks\nYou can enter any region without restriction, but you will die right away if your level is too low to fight there\nHitboxes seem too small or attack range is too shallow to hit animals that run away from you\nSpelling/grammar errors everywhere (omit instead of emit, refection instead of reflection)\n\nOther notes:\nHighly recommend","February 26","true","15.0"," 36 of 107 people (34%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","34","36","107","5","4"

There are bugs and secrets and stats and jumping puzzles and silly notes from animals just about everywhere. Getting started initially is a bit difficult because there's no map or minimap in any way so you have to more or less learn landmarks to find your way around.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting breath taking visuals and storyline. Do go into this game expecting tame and gentle ridiculous humor (like the fact that you're a bipedal bear collecting butterflies and reading messages from depressed ducks).","February 28","true","19.1"," 11 of 47 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","11","47","0","0"

Well, I'm here to tell you that isn't what this game is about. Like bears? Want to play as a bear? Got a sense of humor? Wonderful, go buy this game. It's all indie, crowdfunded, and developed by one guy, as far as I'm aware. It does have some minor graphical bugs here and there, but it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Give the game a couple more days for people to get used to it, and you'll see the reviews tipping in favor of the positive.\n\nPROTIP: If someone says a game is horrible, and their played time of it is 0.6 hours, maybe, just maybe, said person has no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what they're talking about.","February 28","true","12.2"," 25 of 81 people (31%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","31","25","81","0","1"

If you love bears as much as I do, this is a dream come true.... almost. There are some teething issues that hopefully will get resolved before long (no invert mouse option makes this near-unplayable for me), but the most important thing here is that this game captures the spirit of being a bear. You wander around hitting anything that moves or that you don't understand, and eating everything. Other people have done pros/cons so here goes:\n\nPros:\nYou are a bear\nMap seems HUGE\nGraphics are decent\nI don't want the pros list to seem small, but you must understand, being a bear is amazing\n\nCons:\nNO INVERT MOUSE OPTION (please fix this ASAP)\nTypos everywhere\nVery limited resolution options (no 1920X1200)\nSteam overlay ghosts at top and bottom of screen (maybe resolution-related?)\nVery occasional graphics flicker\nHave found no way of locating your den once you've gone exploring, making stamina a real problem\nBeing too dumb to eat stuff (makes little sense, maybe too dumb to know the effects would work better?)\n\nYes I still recommend this game, being a bear is awesome and the next best thing to my ultimate dream - owning a pet bear.\n\nFinal Score - Bear/10","February 26","true","22.3"," 20 of 69 people (29%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","29","20","69","6","2"

And given that fact, it turned out to be nicely done - audiovisuals are well done (not AAA level, but indie level of course), pieces of story come together at times, "character development" seems rewarding.\nWhat I find the most entertaing here is this game is quite nostalgic - it gives you hardly any hints what to do, what is going on and what is your purpose, there is no minimap or objective list, yet the learning curve is well planned, hence you quickly discover everything yourself and feel much rewarded for that - just like in 90's games.\n\nThe only things I see that should be fixed are flickering shadows and tendencies to getting stuck and being unable to move - however I'm sure these will get patched soon.\n\nAnd, well... I wouldn't mind finding a map sometime in later part of the game, just to put pieces of own knowledge together :)","February 28","true","19.0"," 14 of 55 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","14","55","0","0"
