Any fans of the puzzler-adventure genre should easily find this game enjoyable. Once you start playing you will likely find yourself engrossed by the experience.\n\nIt has a much thicker, richer story aspect than many other puzzler-adventure games out there. I was truly entertained by the narrative throughout my entire playthrough. The interesting plot goes a long way to elevate this game above the standard. Furthermore, I thought the graphics were nice and the voice acting was solid, which reinforces the high quality of the writing. The end result is a very enjoyable game with an excellent presentation.\n\nThis inherent quality in the writing, atmosphere, and overall presentation results in a game which feels much more true to the Sherlock Holmes brand than the other couple of games I have played that were franchised the intellectual property.  The others feel like standard adventure games with the words "Sherlock Holmes" on the title. This game, to me, really felt like what I believe a Sherlock Holmes game should feel like.\n\nThe puzzles were very challenging and quite fun; though to be honest I lost patience and had to seek assistance once or twice because of how tricky some of them were. Some of the puzzles are doubly complicated because the objective of the puzzle isn’t always made clear. So first you have to figure out what you are trying to do, and then you have to actually do it. This does add an extra layer of challenge, but it also can be a bit jarring.\n\nAnd lastly, something I thought was a pretty cool feature is the fact that you can choose to move around in 1st or 3rd person, or play in classic point-and-click adventure style. Having this freedom sounds trivial, but it is really nice to be able to tailor the style on a whim as you play through the campaign.\n\nIn summary, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a pretty sweet ride. It should appeal to both fans of the game genre and fans of the Sherlock Holmes IP. Give it some consideration if it sounds up your alley.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 21","true","25.5"," 67 of 69 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","67","69","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nudiustertian/recommended/205650/","nudiustertian","Nudiustertian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nudiustertian/","214 products in account","Short review\n\nGraphics & sound are good, especially for an adventure game where you usually don't expect much. "Hunt the pixel" is mostly avoided, though you may have to seek around a bit sometimes. There's brilliant moments where you actually feel like Sherlock Holmes when you're deducting the true circumstances of a crime, but those are outnumbered by dodgy moments where you're confronted with unconnected puzzles that really have no reason to be there. Fortunately all such puzzles are skippable, so you won't get frustrated. The story is interesting enough to motivate and feels like classic Holmes, with a twist at the end that may not be everyone's cup of tea but is certainly original.\n\nSnap this up when it's on sale, especially if you're a Holmes fan. It feels slightly overpriced at full ($20 at the time of writing).\n\n\nLong review\n\nThe Testament of Sherlock Holmes is the latest installment (as of writing) in a series that I haven't played. No knowledge of events in the previous games is required, fortunately; there's some allusions but you don't need to know anything about them to play this one. Your very first investigation serves as a tutorial on the controls, and you can simply go from there. This game does not rely on you carefully scanning every inch of the screen with your mouse until you've found the hotspot; you don't have to do more than get close enough and you will get clear indications of what can be investigated. At the same time, this is not so obvious that it takes all the fun out of exploring, and sometimes you do have to backtrack carefully to see what you've missed.\n\nFor an adventure game in particular, the graphics are good. You won't fall out of your chair in amazement, but character models and environments are all well done and fit the atmosphere of the story. The soundtrack does its job, in that you hardly notice it's there, except for one notably bad case of it playing with an intensity that the situation doesn't warrant -- things only start to happen in that location later, yet the soundtrack is ominous and frantic right from the start. The voice acting for both Holmes and Watson is excellent and the characters come across just right. The other characters are mostly believable, with two notable exceptions: one character who is required to pass for another with a British accent has a painfully obvious faux German accent that shouldn't have fooled anyone, and the actor voicing the main villain sounds like he's taking his cues from cartoons, with the only thing missing being an evil laugh. Both of these break immersion quite badly and mess up what is otherwise fine voice acting.\n\nEnough about the window dressing, let's get to the gameplay. Here we get to both the game's best and worst parts. As in all adventure games, you walk around, gathering information and objects, and occasionally apply one object to another. Especially commendable in this regard is that when you do have to combine objects, this makes sense and is easy to do (like combining pieces of rope to make a longer piece of rope) -- sounds obvious, but there are many adventure games where you have to combine unlikely objects in bizarre ways to solve puzzles in the most roundabout way possible. You won't find such puzzles here -- whenever you need to overcome obstacles by combining objects it feels perfectly natural.\n\nUnfortunately, what you will find are puzzles that are generic brain teasers (like matching colored balls in some interesting sense or rotating tiles) that have no believable connection to the story and are just there to make you stop and solve them. To the game's great credit, all of these puzzles are skippable after some time has passed, because it would feel really frustrating to *have* to solve them if you didn't want to, or couldn't. Some can be solved by trial and error, some are impossible to do that way, but almost all of them feel like they don't belong in the game and they don't fit in with the narrative. Apparently everybody in Victorian England used intricate locks that can nevertheless be opened without outside help to safeguard their valuables, instead of, you know, keys. The lowest point for me was a series of puzzles in an elementary school that really break immersion by their sheer contrivedness and lack of justification for solving them at all (rather than simply forcing the issue). Elementary, dear player? Hardly.\n\nIf those were the only puzzles, I couldn't really recommend this game, but it redeems itself with the deduction puzzles. The game's best moments come when you actually get to feel like you're solving crime like the great detective himself, carefully observing for clues and piecing them together in a logical whole using "deduction boards", where you choose from several logical (and less logical) alternatives until both the clues and your deductions line up. Solving these puzzles with a minimum of guessing rewards you with the feeling that you're Holmes himself, coming to seemingly impossible conclusions by eliminating the actually impossible. Even the "chemical analysis" puzzles, which are not really about deduction but about memorizing colored blobs, tie in with the overall atmosphere of crime-solving. The game could have elevated itself considerably if it had more of this and less of the arbitrary puzzles -- in fact, if they ever make another installment, I'd strongly recommend that they only do these deduction puzzles and no more of the mechanical ones. As it is, there are only three or four in the game, with the regular puzzles padding out most of the playtime.\n\nThe story is the other selling point of the game. The flavor is excellent, and when it works, it's worthy of anything Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has written, with both the mundane and slightly fantastical/unbelievable elements mixed together in a familiar way. The characterization is fine -- Holmes has his dry quips and stoic determination, while Watson is there to reign in his friend's unique brand of callousness where it's warranted, without coming off as a dunce (a common sin in other adaptations). There's nothing original here (except for the end, which we'll get to in a bit) and you've seen most of these elements before in other Holmes stories, but it's all well put together, with the exposition scene where Holmes recaps what's really happened for Watson before the final showdown being especially memorable. It doesn't quite exceed its source material, but it's a valiant effort nonetheless.\n\nThere's a twist at the end that might leave opinions divided on whether it's of benefit to the story (or whether it should be there at all), but I liked it. After all, this is only one of many stories told of Holmes, and if you don't like what this one's selling, you can always ignore it, but I thought it was a charming idea that I hadn't seen before. Not everything is wrapped up in a neat little bow and there are one or two spots that I'd consider plot holes, but I found myself intrigued and entertained. Overall the level is more "penny dreadful" than Shakespeare, but then, that fits the Victorian era nicely.\n\nBottom line: this is a strong recommendation if you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes as he appears in the Doyle stories. If you're just an adventure game aficionado in general, be warned that this contains some pure puzzles which have little or nothing to do with adventuring, and the remainder is probably not going to challenge you a lot. In either case, at the $20 that is its current asking price it's probably slightly disappointing, but this would be a good one to pick up on a sale.","May 18, 2014","true","16.1"," 33 of 34 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","33","34","0","0"

Despite being a detective game, there is very little actual investigations - the game turns into a simple point and click adventure game pretty quickly. While that is done quite well, and the puzzles themselves are quite good, albeit quite standard for the most part, the narrative structure of a Sherlock Holmes novel just fits terribly. As a game, you expect to be able to influence events as you come across them, not have Sherlock Holmes solve them behind the scenes and present the results afterwards - when you PLAY as him. As a player, I would have liked to be the one to logically think up the clever plots and put them in motion, not switch to Watson and be forced to ignore evidence available to let the plot move along. As a mystery game, this fails spectacularly... which is surprising considering that this game is quite well made - with the exception of some of the worst animations I've seen in a long time.","January 3, 2014","false","11.3"," 88 of 131 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","88","131","0","0"

Some of the deductions of Mr. Holmes are so far-fetched you've got to wonder if he's high.\n- Some of the puzzles are overly difficult, and most of them has only rudimentary instructions which are of very little help as to what you're actually supposed to do.\n- The gameplay is as linear as it gets, and consequently the game has absolutely zero replay-value.\n- Animations and lip-sync are far below par. There is also weirdly little visual difference between gameplay and cinematics, which makes you wonder why they bothered.\n- Considering the low-level graphics and effects, the game still manages to take up nearly 10 GB of space.\n- Running is only marginally faster than walking, which makes some sections fairly tedious.\n\n5/10","November 2, 2014","true","10.3"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/e108theta/recommended/205650/","e108theta","Timecrash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/e108theta/","302 products in account","This would be a great Sherlock Holmes game if it actually tried to be a Sherlock Holmes game.\n\nWhat I mean is, it starts off really well, and has two investigations that are very interesting, and very much in the vein of what I expect a Sherlock Holmes game to be. You explore a crime scene, noticing very little details about it, and piece them together in a 'deduction board,' an invention of a game which serves to gamify Holmes' famous deductive reasoning. It does a pretty good job of it, too! I also really liked the ONE scene where you analyze evidence you gathered in the crime scene, as there were quite a few clever minigames that I had fun going through.\n\nThe problem being, basically the entire game after that, save for two further, and much smaller, investigations, is literally just a mediocre puzzle adventure game, with a bunch of stupid 'find item -> use item' puzzles, and with far more puzzle boxes than I think should have existed in the late 19th Century? Normally, I wouldn't mind this...but I don't play a game in the Sherlock Holmes universe to go through puzzles that could be in ANY game. I play a Sherlock Holmes game so I can BE Sherlock Holmes, exploring crime scenes and solving them in a way only he could. And you don't even have the excuse there's so little you can do with that, because just look at all the cases in the public domain stories. There's SO many ways to adapt and expand them without ever resorting to stupid puzzle ♥♥♥♥ that even Sierra was doing back in the 80s.\n\nThat being said, I do like the voice work of Holmes and Watson, especially Holmes. And the environments are pretty well done, especially for a lower-budget game like this. I wish the engine was a little better, as controlling Holmes and Watson felt like trying to drive a drunken tank at times, but it didn't hamper my experience of the game too much. Though, there WAS a bit too much backtracking, and, yeah, the scene with the dog was completely pointless.\n\nAs for the story...it started out pretty well, and then went to ♥♥♥♥ at the end. Minor spoilers from here on out.\n\nSo Moriarty's in the game, because apparently you just have to use Moriarty as much as you can, despite there being perfectly fine villains in the mythos. I understand this is part of a series, and he would be suited for 'Holmes' darkest case yet,' but he basically just shows up at the end with little fanfare, and he's just this utterly-generic 'evil for the sake of evil' villain, not at all the criminal mastermind and equal to Holmes he should be. What buildup there is was fine, but his appearance was completely underwhelming.\n\nNot to mention, the final twist at the very end, once Moriarty's dealt with. I actually would have REALLY liked that, and thought it would be a great way to take Holmes as a character...except it's literally JUST introduced seconds before the credits roll. We're given no development, no buildup, it's just a way to cheaply garner audience sympathy right at the very end. It almost comes across as a deus-ex-machina, if it had ANY bearing on the plot. Moriarty doesn't even mention it until he's [SPOILERS] and uses it as his motivation in basically two words.\n\nI would have loved it if we kept meeting Moriarty as the game went on, and he kept hinting about it, and he kept saying he had a reason for his crimes this time around, and it kept us in the dark and serves as a primary motivation to his character, rather than he's just doing it because he's evil.\n\nThis game could have used much better writing in general. For being called one of the best Sherlock Holmes games up to now, it's surprisingly amateurish. I just can't give it a recommendation, even though it has just enough of the Holmesian spirit to get me wanting more. If you want to buy it, buy it in a sale when it's 75% off, because I don't think it's worth much more than $5-10.\n\nI really hope the next game, Crime and Punishment, will actually satisfy me. I DO have The Awakening, so maybe that will, too.","January 4, 2014","false","11.8"," 67 of 106 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","67","106","0","2"

Why? Because opposed to nice graphics and well built environments, some interesting gameplay ideas, three different control interfaces and a lengthy story, the player has to deal with rather inexpressive characters, subpar voice acting and animations, some logical puzzles put there only to extend longevity, a pair of little nasty bugs and an unreal and intricate but never clear story that leaves you powerless and confused even when Sherlock expresses his ingeniuos deductions/intentions.\n\nI always loved adventure games, The Case of the Serrated Scalpel from the Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes series back in 1992 is still one of my favorite exponents of the genre, and I think Frogwares are on the right track to build a worthy successor to that perfect mix of realism and atmosphere. Crimes and Punishments is out at the end of the month and I feel good vibrations about it!\n\nRecommended to adventure and Sherlock fans, and maybe also to newcomers who would like a not too difficult game to begin their journey from the best game of this developer's prodution.","September 4, 2014","true","14.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This is my first Sherlock Holmes game and I was pleasantly surprised. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a point-and-click adventure game where you play as Sherlock (and Watson) trying to resolve the murder of a Reverend in his own church. I won't say more about the story since the main reason of playing this game is to discover that.\n\nThe gameplay is faily simple. Where you can interact, there is either a magnifying glass to look at some items or a hand to show that you can take the item or that you can interact with it. That's it. Most of the time, you'll have to look through everything to be sure that you didn't miss any important clue. The rooms are small enough so it's really easy to find everything.\n\nAlso, as a detective, there is a deduction board. You'll have to discover every clues to see statements about them. With these facts, it's up to you to choose between 3 answers which one is the right one about what happened in this case. There are multiple questions to be answered and you won't know if you're right until you have all the right answers. It can be hard but if you pay attention to the story, it will be fairly easy. There is also a lot of puzzles in this game. Some are logic and really easy once you understand how they work but some of the puzzles that does NOT involve any deduction/logic can be really hard and frustrating for some people. There is a skip buttons after some minutes so don't worry !\n\nOne of the problem in this game is that it's too linear for a detective game. There is no real choice to be made and even if you choose to go to a location instead of another, you'll end up going to both places without any change.\n\nThe story is really interesting and there are a lot of twists (I found it similar to the TV show and it's a good thing). The problem (because it's a videogame !) is that Sherock is not as funny as Cumberbatch's Sherlock (but it's understandable since there is no actor involved).\n\nIn conclusion, if you like point-and-click games, you'll like this one. It will definitely entertain you for hours ! (I finished the game in about 7-8 hours)","June 23, 2015","true","7.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

I may edit it or replace this later on.\n\nThings I love about this game so far:\n* This is Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, not Robert Downey Jr.'s action hero Sherlock Holmes.\n* You have to actually use your brain and deduce from your facts. Puzzles tend to be logical.\n* There are several references to former Sherlock Holmes cases, not only from earlier games, but from the books.\n* I know action-driven players could get massively bored, but it is just my kind of game.\n\nThings I am neutral about:\n* Perhaps less videos and more little mind games would have been nicer, but it's cool anyways.\n\nThings I hate about this game:\n* When I use the "point-and-click" mode, it is not so easy to move around and cover the whole area,  but when I use the "first-person" mode, the movements of the "camera" get me so dizzy that I end up nauseated after a few minutes. It reminds me of the old Doom game for PC from the early 90's (graphics are way better, though).\n* Watson, get the F#@k out of my way!

Much as I don't like to skip them, sometimes I get so frustrated with puzzles that I don't understand, that it spoils the game for me. There are only 2 reasons why I give this game 9.8 out of 10 instead of 10. One is that I find when I am Sherlock Holmes, Dr Watson always gets in the way by standing directly in front of him. You have to negotiate around him otherwise you keep speaking to him inadvertently. His constant 'what should we do now, Holmes?' is a litte irritating. The other negative is that frequently when you are just walking around the message box showing how to make the character run pops up - if I wanted to make him run, I would! This, I think, is just a little glitch.\nOverall, story excellent, graphics excellent, game play excellent and I can't wait to play the next one which will be Nemesis.","November 22, 2015","true","26.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Apparently Watson can't tell the difference between a London accent and a very thick German accent.

Experience doesn't mean perfection but seeing how they started (the mistery of the mummy) and all the other titles they went through you can see how all the titles evolved, improved and changed chapter by chapter with good news and new mistakes. Even though The testament of Sherlock Holmes isn't perfect I really consider it a great improvement, a big leap into a new generation of the Sherlock Franchise.\n\nThe Testament of Sherlock Holmes is a point and click adventure with third person view. Gameplay uses pretty much the usual mechanics, you can observe, use or pickup items according to the icon it displays when you get on it with your cursor, and besides the usual combination of items there are riddles and puzzles and some of the are tough and random. when you're done with the clues of the current section you will be prompted to complete a deduction scheme, where you will link concepts and clues together with deductions (which YOU must choose between a choice of three possibilities). From this point of view this chapter doesn't represent anything particularily new, but it's mostly a very refined and polished verion of what has been already done in the previous chapter, Sherlock Vs The Ripper. The real innovation and leap forward to a new level is represented by three factors, Story, graphics and soundtrack.\nThe story begins with a small section used to explain the gameplay in which Sherlock will quickly solve a case of a stolen necklace. Later they will learn from newspapers that Sherlock is being accused of returning a false necklace. And from here the story is a succession of facts and situations that will lead to a dangerous degeneration of his good name. And I won't say no more because this is a great story with plot twists which represent its best parts.\nGraphics is a great improvement considering the previous chapters and their remasters. It doesn't surprise much the fact that they employed the Unreal Engine 3 and even though you can't say the result is a true miracle of beauty you can undoubtely see that the results are great and various locations filled with many contour details and even though some animations can be a bit rigid, some situations can be a little buggy and few areas here and there are simply clipped to prevent exploring useless zones, now you see a new type of approach for the narration as it has been paid more attention to camera settings with focus and effects, new expressive animations (even though they're the same ones often repeating they're still new).\nThis chapter's soundtrack is completely new and it's a magnificent set of orchestral pieces that will pleasently accompany you during all your investigations and will also set a more pressing atmosphere when there will be some tense situations. Unfortunately I believe there are few tracks as I heard the same tracks in more situations and sections. I still love them, but I believe a few tracks more could have avoided this feeling.\nA small note to praise some gameplay sections, especially the ones with Toby (Sherlock's Hound... Yes, you control him... XD) and the ones with Watson, because you will usually need his small help a few times, but there will be entire sections with Watson alone and I've been waiting for this as Watson is not just a mere doctor incapable of any deduction but he really has some skills and in this chapter he will prove that more than once and I'm very glad about this. And one last praise for the credits... Yes the credits. It doesn't make any sense, I know, but I just love that art because the it reminds me a lot about Casinò Royale openings...\n\n+++PROs+++ STORY. Clearly the best point of this chapter is the story, very intense, degenerating and involving, but I can't say much because it deserves not to be spoilt.\nGRAPHICS & ART. A very big leap to the next level thanks to a very good use of the Unreal Engine 3, lots of neat details in various and coloured ambiences, great cutscenes with camera settings and focus effects, new good expressive animations.\nSOUNDTRACK. A sweet and great score with beautiful orchestral tracks that will pleasently accompany the gameplay with proper tones in the different situations.\nGAMEPLAY. A very well refined gameplay, based on the previous titles but more polished and accurate. Great and interesting puzzles and riddles and original nice sections with Toby and Watson.---CONs--- MUSIC & ANIMATIONS VARIETY. I personally believe that a few animations and music tracks could have improved the experience because during the game you will notice that songs tend to repeat in various secions and characters move in the same way during speeches.\nRESTART THE GAME TO APPLY THE SETTINGS. And still nowadays I am forced to restart the game to apply the video settings. Kind of unexpected...","May 19","true","12.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Very annoying once you realize you get an achivement only if you complete them all. Also, there were times where I couldn't figure out what the game wanted me to do. I couldn't leave an area until I found some crucial bit of evidence, but was given no indication what it might be.

I have read the stories over and over since I was a kid. I've watched the old Basil Rathbone films, and the British Sherlock and American Elementary. Enjoyed all of these adaptations, as each has something unique to offer. So of course I was super excited to play a game based on the famous detective.\n\nThen I read the reviews. And got less excited. Waited for it to go on sale, thought I'd try it out despite the criticisms. But I should have listened.\n\nFull disclosure: I haven't finished the game yet. Not sure if I ever will, because I'm already sick of it.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nOh my god the dialogue animations. It's so awful, it completely distracts you from what the character is saying. The opening cutscene with the little kids is the worst; it's almost a joke. It doesn't help that the children look like terrifying soul-less ventriloquist dummies.\n\nLooking for clues doesn't really feel like looking for clues. It feels like wandering around until your cursor turns into a magnifying glass. Which is exactly what it is. No brain activity required.\n\nSherlock doesn't really feel like Sherlock. I think this was deliberate on the part of the game creators; this is supposed to be a darker, less heroic version of the detective. I see what they were trying to do, but it just felt so... wrong.\n\nThe environments are very closed, and you can only travel along a very linear path, even though it looks like you should be able to walk everywhere. It really takes you out of the game.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nPuzzles are sometimes fun.\n\nThe deduction board is a good idea. These were the only moments during the game when I actually felt like I was solving a mystery. But there are no consequences if you get it wrong; just keep clicking until you get it right.\n\nEnvironments are kind of pretty. Not mind-blowing, but ok.","October 25, 2014","false","7.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Being that I hadn't played any of the new games yet, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I'm a fan of Holmes from the books and later the new series, and I wasn't sure how the game would capture the right atmosphere.\n\nI'm pleased to say that, in my opinion at least, they knocked it out of the park.  Settings were extremely evocative of the time period.  I thought especially that the slums of Whitechapel were very well done graphically and atmospherically.  If a game can make me say "oh my god why can't I help these poor people" and actually make me distressed about it, I call it a win.  Good immersion, I'd say.\n\nFans of the books will appreciate some easter egg references to past adventures, plus the fun of taking Toby for a spin once again (with some added skills he didn't have in the book; I think he was smarter than Watson in this one...)\n\nThe puzzles had that perfect balance of challenging without making me tear clumps of my hair out.  The very few times I consulted a walkthrough was in situations where I knew I'd forgotten to pick something up earlier and didn't want to have backtrack too far for it.  It was unnecessary for the puzzles themselves, which took me a lot of thinking but no random rage-quits over it. :D\n\nI will mention there is some "digital" gore due to a couple of rather grisly murder scenes, in case that matters to you.  I cringed a little bit at doing a post-mortem exam, but the sequence was mercifully short.  I'm naturally squeamish and it really wasn't enough to bother me much.  Just wanting to throw that out there for anyone who wants to know!\n\nOverall, an excellent experience and one that was so entertaining I'll probably go back and play it again at a later date, which isn't a treatment I give to too many games.  I'd pay the full $19.99 cost without flinching, knowing how much I enjoyed myself, but if the cost is bothersome, wait for a sale.

It's not often that I find something that I am actually saddened by its ending. The story was magnificent, and the gameplay was not bad either.\nAs a game this is a point and click adventure that you can also play in first person (as the third person option I found to be frankly useless).

This game makes you use your brain.\nThe game itself was also made quite nicely, the animation not perfect, but voice acting and immersion were fairly great, at least to me.\nIn short, magnificent puzzle game with wonderful story, Sherlock being one of my favorites.\nI simply cannot wait for Sherlock Holmes: Crime and Punishments to be released.","February 10, 2014","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

He's slightly slower to cop on here but that's fine.\n\nThe game design is nearly flawless.  Just a couple of glaring UV seams not worth mentioning (would you look at that, I've mentioned them) but no-thing else to complain about there.  Some slightly overused NPC models but it's an indie game so you expect that sort of thing.  Really good attention paid to Victorian English culture, accents, clothing, architecture, &c.

A couple of less believable actors but most of it's great.\n\nI will complain about the controls.  It doesn't matter much because you don't really need fast response time in this game, but in third person some stuff is annoying because it takes far longer than you'd expect, and this is fixed by going into first person view.\n\nOverall, great game, great story, great puzzles, great Holmes, great Victorian London.

The puzzles are brilliant.  Very difficult to guess correctly; you certainly have to think about it.  Watson is funny but very like the Watson I'm familiar with from the books.  He's slightly slower to cop on here but that's fine.\n\nThe game design is nearly flawless.  Just a couple of glaring UV seams not worth mentioning (would you look at that, I've mentioned them) but no-thing else to complain about there.  Some slightly overused NPC models but it's an indie game so you expect that sort of thing.  Really good attention paid to Victorian English culture, accents, clothing, architecture, &c.  Though a couple of articles of clothing, if I'm to be overly fastidious, are American and not British.  You won't notice.  Only me.\n\nThe story is perfect.  The acting is mostly perfect.  A couple of less believable actors but most of it's great.\n\nI will complain about the controls.  It doesn't matter much because you don't really need fast response time in this game, but in third person some stuff is annoying because it takes far longer than you'd expect, and this is fixed by going into first person view.\n\nOverall, great game, great story, great puzzles, great Holmes, great Victorian London.  Very impressed by the puzzles.","April 9, 2015","true","20.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You'd think they'd gotten pretty good at it, but judging by The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, they've just gotten sloppy. The engine is getting visibly long in the tooth, and the mystery you're solving this time does some very un-Holmesian leaps of logic and plausibilty towards the end.\n\nThe production values are just plain mediocre all around. While some of the puzzles are fun, there is an alaming number of inventory puzzles requiring you to combine various ropes and ladders into longer ropes and ladders. At its worst, the gameplay just devolves into a hotspot hunt, a variation of the dreaded pixel hunt. Not recommended unless you're either a hardcore Holmes fan, or a hardcore adventure game fan.","October 21, 2014","false","12.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I really enjoyed the darker turn that this game took over the others (even Holmes vs Jack the Ripper, imo). The game isn't without its faults, to be sure, but it gets so many things right that what is wrong can be tolerated. The story was very well done, the puzzles weren't overly difficult (I think there were only two or three that I absolutely could not figure out on my own), and the graphics for this title are greatly improved over previous titles in this series.\n\nAs for the issues I think need working out, for one, there are a few clues which can be dificult to find. Also, being an adventure title, it does fall into the problem of inventory based puzzles, which again are not normally difficult to solve, but there a few which require item combinations (which is done in the inventory menu) that might not be intuitive. Also, and this is kind of overly nitpicky, but whatever, I wasn't a huge fan of the vest Holmes wore the entire game.\n\nAll in all, I would say, if you're a Holmes fan, and like puzzles and in general like adventure titles, I would absolutely pick this game up, especially if it's on sale.","March 15","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Can Sherlock and friend solve the murders and take the consequences?\n\n!! Be aware of blood and gore  you even have to preform an autopsy and use a scalpel to cut open parts of a corpse; not suited for younger kids !!\n\nThe style of this game is very like the later game Crimes and Punishment, but this game only has one story and the cases are all related. Unlike C&P this game's deduction board only allows you to progress if you find the right conclusion, and it's not always obvious. (You can always click absolutely every option in every combination and the board will 'click' open instantly if you get the right one).\n\nIf you're the type of person to click everything and solve everything without help from the game there is only one missable achievement and that's for choosing a specific dialogue option in 3 different conversation throughout the game and you may need a quick guide for that; or do it on a 2nd playthrough. The game saves for you in different slots in addition to allowing you to save whenever you want, which is very nice.\n\nThe game also has many neat mechanics, as in some parts of the game switching between Sherlock and Watson, and you get to control Toby the dog, who may be even smarter than Sherlock himself.\n\n\nThe game only has one ending and one story, but you get to do little changes for choosing different dialogue option; mostly if you pick the nice one the other person will find things for you as if you pick a 'bad' one you have to do that yourself.\n\nAfaik the voice actors are the same as in C&P and are done well, as is the sound and music in the game. The puozzles are decent and not so hard that they would need a guide, though the explanation of the puzzles can be a litttle too minimalistic so much that I had to internet one just because I didn't get exactly what I was supposed to do.\n\nThe game lets you choose between third person view, first person view or classic point&click; I personally preferred third person with first person used as a zoom-in in some areas. In general; if you're stuck and can't find an item: Look up. The game mentions other cases, especially if you click everything and some are "souvernirs" from other cases (and therefore games), but you don't need to have played any to understand the story, but it helps to know the basics of Sherlock.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game, my game time is one playthrough plus a speedrun through some parts to get that last pesky achievement, so there is plenty of playtime, story and content.","February 21","true","18.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The core mechanics of finding and analyzing clues are grossly linear. And as far as I can tell, much of the story is filled out by Holmes' sporadic arbitrary narratives, which relate only vaguely to the clues you've gathered. It makes you feel like you just have to go pick up a prescribed number of rocks before Holmes divulges impossibly-omniscient information on the case. While this may or may not be in the style of traditional Sherlock Holmes, it is not in any way satisfying as a plot progression mechanic in a game.\n\nAlso the few puzzle-based asides are entirely self-contained and have little or nothing to do with the story or any details you may have observed. On top of that the movement, much like the GUI, is clunky and annoying, in all 3 of the view modes, and makes you feel like you have nubs for hands.\n\nThe "deduction board" is a fairly smart mechanic, but is ruined by the fact that it's closely tied to whether or not you simply clicked on certain pre-determined clue hotspots. It would be infinitely more challenging if you were allowed to simply examine the various scenes and fill out the deduction board yourself, instead of it breaking everything down to meaningless and often absurd multiple choice statements.\n\nTL:DR; Far too linear and simplistic for a veteran adventure gamer, but much too tedious and clunky for casual gaming.","April 11, 2014","false","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was a little surprised by the gameplay, as it was not only point-and-click, but also WASD walking around (if you choose that kind of view). I enjoyed this a lot, as it made playing Holmes, Watson and Toby (!) more real.\nAt times the controls weren't very precise or it took a while until WASD reacted accordingly to my input. The point-and-click mechanisms did function very good for most of the game. Sometimes it was a little difficult to hit the exact spot.\n\nThere were plenty of riddles which were all good fun. Sometimes they were a little hard at first, as you get often no explanation what you need to do. But then, you are a detective and your reason of existence if to solve mysteries.\n\nYou don't need to know much about the Holmes-universe, but if you do, you'll be in for a treat.

Set as a rememberance by three small children, you go about London, solving crimes that, at first, seem non-related. With point and click clues, deduction boards and the creating of new items from what you've found, there's always something to discover! That is, if you don't quit after getting caught in the cutscenes. Often long and unneeded, they cut into an otherwise seemless gameplay. Perhaps replace them with requiring more action from the player would work. Need a place to hide? Don't cutscene, go find one!\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge personally, were some of the "boss" puzzles. Often, they come with little or vague instruction and no hint to guide you in the right path. Some are easier than others but if you're not Holmes yourself, perhaps have a hint page pulled up online. (That way, you still get the satisfaction of 'having done it mostly myself'.)\n\nAll in all, a pleasing game with graphics you grow fond of and an ending that tugs at the heart. The credits are displayed in a style that would suit better at the beginning of the game for they were quite well done. Instead of so many cutscenes, use this work as chapters? Either way, if you're a Holmes fan or love mind aching puzzles, here's a good game to spend some time with.","June 4, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"The Testament of Sherlock Holmes" is a dark, sometimes gory investigation into a criminal conspiracy that threatens the British crown in Victorian England.\n\nGraphics are decent but clearly outdated. They do a good job at letting Victorian London come to life before you, though, and the locations are beautifully designed.\n\nControls can make or break and adventure game (see: Grim Fandango), but in the case of "The Testament" they are not an issue since you can choose from 3 different control schemes: classic fixed-angle point-and-click, third-person free-roaming and first-person free-roaming (first-person shooter style). At any time you can use Homes' special ability to help point out interactive elements in the environment.\n\nPuzzles are the core of any adventure game and there are some good ones in "The Testament". Others feel too difficult and lack proper instructions. Sometimes objects become clickable only once an event has been triggered, requiring you to search locations again after you've already searched them, but it's not a big hassle. Some of the more difficult puzzles can be skipped, but it will cost you the achievement, which is fair.\n\nStory is the frame within which the puzzles are set. "The Testament" does a decent job at presenting you with an increasingly threatening conspiracy while keeping the main villain disclosed until the end of the game. As the story progresses, Holmes himself becomes a suspect and the game does a good job at depicting Watson's increasing doubts about the integrity of his old friend. In general, the interactions between Holmes and Watson are very well done and often provide comic relief in an otherwise dark and serious narrative. The writing displays some weaknesses and certain turns of event come too suddenly and inexplicably. The story does keep you hooked, though, as you will want to find out who's behind it all and how Holmes himself might be implicated.\n\nThis is definitely a highlight for adventure fans, particularly, of course, for fans of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. At 11 hours, the game is of very decent length for an adventure game, too.","August 9, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

BUT those are the games I prefer over every movie, television in general, and even (most) books (btw. I eat books, no reading, I literally eat them ^^). Those are the games that make me stay up all night, squeezing the rest of logic out of my (at very late hours and not everyday) bourbon-clouded mind.\n\nThe Testament of Sherlock Holmes meets every possible criteria you'd probably have towards such a game - and that with a superb notion.\n\nThe story will suck you in and will leave you not knowing what the hell is going on several occasions (awesome, deep, comprehensible).\nIt is ALL LOGICAL. The answers are right in front of you, even some clues on top - but logic is mean.\nGame mechanics are easy to pick up but enough to give a variety of clue searching, case solving, and more. Some quite unique by the way.\nYour playing Sherlock ♥♥♥♥in' Holmes as well as John freakin' Wilson for crying out loud! What's topping that in a very well developed Adventure-Game?!\nHave I mentioned the story???? Till this game I had the most fun with Longest Journey, Day of the Tentacle, Siberia, Indiana Jones, Myst, Exile, and the like - but where they have given me fun time in the sense of laughter and/or mind boggling thought-acrobatics this one I treat like a rare tasty wine. I care what happens to the characters; I do not want to look into a walkthrough 'cause I know I have the puzzles solution right there; it drives me; I actually take it seriously :)   Those emotions (let's just call it that) I otherwise only get from scripted movie-like adventures of the sort of The Walking Dead - but this one is a full blooded, full fledged Adventure-Game as you would expect!\nYou can play (additionally) in first or third person mode but it is an option, a feature you're free to take advantage of. I myself rather play the old fashioned point-and-click way and there is no backdraw whatsoever. Some people were complaining about that for whatever reason... As said, it is a feature - play to your liking, you wont have any disadvantages one way or the other. ;)\n\nIf you like adventure games or want to try them or just want to play something wihout much time-fiddling hassle...

But take note: this is not a big production so don't expect the game to be perfect or to blow your mind. Just have fun solving the puzzles and enjoy the story :)\n\nStory: In The Testament of Sherlock Holmes you see the crazily good detective investigating the dead of a prominent figure of 1898 London. And that has a lot more to it that first meets the eye. After a mini-case, that serves as a tuturial, which is about a necklace that disappeared from a closed room, the rest of the story revolves about the same case, even if more people die and more strange things happen for you to investigate. Overall I liked the story. The beginning and also the very end can be a bit sketchy but the rest is a solid good with a lot of references that the fans will catch with a smile on theirs faces.\n\nGameplay: It is diverse, sometimes difficult, others rather simple, and when you finally figure it out it's just as Sherlock Holmes says: "It is simplicity itself". I got stuck two or three times without knowing what I should do next and I found that two puzzles were very difficult, but nothing that will spoil the game for you. You can control Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes, and some areas are solved with both characters doing different actions. Most of the game consists in looking for clues in the environment and solving puzzles, which can be simply to connect the clues you found or to open something (some box, door, secret compartment, etc). There is not much action, so don't go for this with the latest Sherlock film in mind.\n\nTechnical aspects: The graphics are good, the voicing is good for the main characters but could be a lot better for others, the animations could be a lot better also, and the soundtrack it's not bad but goes unnoticed most of time.\n\n"Come, Watson, come!" he cried.

But take note: this is not a big production so don't expect the game to be perfect or to blow your mind. Just have fun solving the puzzles and enjoy the story :)\n\nStory: In The Testament of Sherlock Holmes you see the crazily good detective investigating the dead of a prominent figure of 1898 London. And that has a lot more to it that first meets the eye. After a mini-case, that serves as a tuturial, which is about a necklace that disappeared from a closed room, the rest of the story revolves about the same case, even if more people die and more strange things happen for you to investigate. Overall I liked the story. The beginning and also the very end can be a bit sketchy but the rest is a solid good with a lot of references that the fans will catch with a smile on theirs faces.\n\nGameplay: It is diverse, sometimes difficult, others rather simple, and when you finally figure it out it's just as Sherlock Holmes says: "It is simplicity itself". I got stuck two or three times without knowing what I should do next and I found that two puzzles were very difficult, but nothing that will spoil the game for you. You can control Dr. John Watson and Sherlock Holmes, and some areas are solved with both characters doing different actions. Most of the game consists in looking for clues in the environment and solving puzzles, which can be simply to connect the clues you found or to open something (some box, door, secret compartment, etc). There is not much action, so don't go for this with the latest Sherlock film in mind.\n\nTechnical aspects: The graphics are good, the voicing is good for the main characters but could be a lot better for others, the animations could be a lot better also, and the soundtrack it's not bad but goes unnoticed most of time.\n\n"Come, Watson, come!" he cried.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/something_random/recommended/205650/","something_random","jimmy jimmyson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/something_random/","368 products in account","This game doesn't change a lot from previous games, but certainly brings new concepts to the table and then punches "Holmes and the Mystery of Silver Earring" right in the teeth.\n\n"Holmes: Testament" is probably one of the more story-based games compared to the majority of its predecessors, in that all the cases you solve are somehow interrelated to the final event. Heck, even those absurd cutscenes with the kids reading through Watson's diary are related to the game's conclusion.\nThe plot-twist after the middle of the game was also commendable for making me question the deeper intentions of Holmes' action throughout the game, but it was slightly expected (I watched the BBC "Sherlock" series long before playing this, and a similar plot-twist was utilised there).\nAnd the ending is certainly an unexpected one, but I feel as though Moriarty was thrown in at the last minute, just to give the game a villain to defeat. I mean, it felt like his character lacked depth in his particular style and his motives were a little too generic (i.e. "I want ot rule the world by force"), compared to say, Lupin from "Holmes: Nemesis", Jack the Ripper from "Holmes vs. Ripper" or even that insane guy who jumped off the lighthouse in "Holmes: Awakened".\n\nThe puzzles vary greatly in terms of activity, from looking into photographs for details to picking locks, so there is a wide range of challenges and tasks for all skill levels. Having said that, there will be different puzzles that appear rage-inducing and near impossible for you, because everyone's good at different things.\nFor example, during my first lock-picking puzzle, I thought I had to connect the wire to a certain mark on the board. I try doing that for a good half hour, and it turned out that the mark was purely aesthetic and all I had to do was recreate the shape on the top half of the screen (which I hadn't paid much attention to, since I was so focussed on the wire itself).\nLike "Holmes vs. Ripper", the deduction board feature is back, but it's not as extensive (but still a bit of a challenge). The worst part is the fact that the game doesn't tell you mid-way whether or not you have specific board components correct or not; it's either all right or all wrong. Still, I suppose that makes the game all the more challenging, and all the more satisfying when you've got it all correct.\n\n"Holmes: Testament" brings new mechanics to the game, which in turn, open more opportunities for engaging (and slightly frustrating) puzzles.\nThe most notable example of this that I can recall immediately is that you get to play as Toby, a sniffer-dog employed  by Holmes to find a man in the docks. In other words, YOU GET TO PLAY AS A DOG! TOTALLY DOG-TASTIC! And while playing as Toby, you have to solve environmental puzzles to give Holmes access to certain areas.\nOf course, the ol' "Holmes Vision" (i.e. pressing spacebar to see all the interactable elements on the screen)  is back, but a bit more dulled than in previous games. Here, you can only detect aspects directly related to the storyline, and you have to be a lot closer to things before you can detect them.\n\nAlso, it's worth making a comment on the achievements in this game. The majority of achievements can be obained simply by working your way through the storyline. Some will require a little more work, like "The Holmesian" and "Pea-Souper".\nAnd then there's "Blackmailer", the one achievement that relies on three separate unrepeatable events with the correct responses. It's achievements this that make me want to strangle the game.\nBut otherwise, they're alright... I suppose.\n\nGraphics haven't changed too much from "Holmes vs. Ripper", and the facial flexes are still fairly basic, in that a character can be yelling but still exhibit a mostly regular talking animation.\nI still like the inclusion of Watson walking animations, since it makes the game MUCH less creepy than it was in "Holmes: Awakened", where he'd be spawning behind doors and around corners.\nThe cutscenes have also improved a bit from previous games.\n\nAnd lastly: technical issues. Although they don't constitute as part of the game itself, it still affected my enjoyability of the game. I remember when I first installed this, I couldn't actually run the game. Even though a simple machine restart solved this issue, I don't think I've ever had that problem with other Holmes games.\nSaving was also a weird problem, as sometimes the game would crash in the middle of an autosave, and so I'd lose the autosave AND have to redo parts of the game where the save failed.\nAlso, the game synchronisation times with Steam are abhorrent. So, I'd finish playing "Holmes: Testament" for the night, and then wait a good 5 minutes for the game to synchronise with Steam. This is strangely inconsistent with other games I  play, like Team Fortress 2, which also synchronise with Steam with much less required time.\n\nIn summary, "Holmes: Testament" is a slight improvement to previous Holmes games, so I think this deserves... an 8/10? The game has a decent quality, but could brush up in a few areas.","January 10","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A fairly sized one.\n\nFirst of all, know that I haven't played any other game in the franchise.\n\nI found it quite a standard point and click adventure, spruced with the usual puzzles (chess, pathfinding, logical progressions, pipes!, what you can expect). It's not fair to condemn it for what a game in the genre is supposed to do, and this one does quite correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, when you add the Holmesian universe to the mix, it becomes a tad disappointing by being so generic. The deduction boards were a really nice addition, and I feel the devs missed a good opportunity of adding some more of those. The characters... well, fitting most of the time. A secretive Holmes, not very scrupulous about the means that lead to a "good" end; a knightly Watson, holding his principles in spite of anything, always behind in the reasoning path of his partner. But then, things get complicated, logical leaps happen, and everybody accepts them because sure, why not? I cringed a little.\n\nAnd while I agree with those who say the lack of expression of the models it's a bit unsettling, I wasn't as bothered with them as with the children. Everything, everything having to do with them is annoying and plainly wrong. Not only how uncanny they look (ugh, what a terrible modelling and voice acting), but also their very existence as a frame for the story, plot twists included. It doesn't help the story at all; in my eyes, frankly, it killed it.\n\nSummary:\nEntertaining gameplay, interspersed with different playable characters. The switching PoV feature would have been nicer if it had any reason for it to be there. In the end, it was just a personal choice, besides that one point in which it hinders you from finding some clue because of the camera.\nGood characterisation and enoyable plot most of the times. Except for the children who proceed to throw it all out of the window.\nCorrect, but could have been done better.

Voice acting is probably the biggest improvement although it comes with the drawback of having terrible lip sync.\n\nIt plays out like previous Sherlock Holmes games but with a slight imbalance between logic and deduction puzzles. There are far too many logic based puzzles that revolve around opening locks on doors, chests and boxes that have complicated puzzle mechanisms.\n\nThe majority of these puzzles are fairly easy to figure out but there are three particularly hard puzzles one of which pops at at tne at the very beginning. Thankfully you are able to skip these three puzzles if you spend too long failing at them.\n\nThe deduction puzzles work much the same way as they do in Ripper, pieceing toegether the clues that you gather on a deduction board. It's a nice method of explaning the story in an interactive puzzle, the problem is that there are only three deduction boards in the game. It needed more.\n\nSo if you like adventure games with puzzle elements then this is one of the better examples, it's by no means great but the series has taken a leap in quality.","May 10, 2013","true","14.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some of these "puzzles" you truly have to take on the role of sherlock and CSI the hell out of everything and piece it all together using logical deductions. Some of the unique safe locks you must unlock have all the clues to do it, but you really have to use your head, some are mathematical :p. At least there is a "skip" option if you find a puzzle challenge too difficult. Only major complaint, yet I'm glad they have the option are 3 separate camera views, 3rd person is good for running around London, but extremely sluggish, point and click mode sucks as it doesn't now show certain areas where a clue might be, and the best option is 1st person view, as it will let you look at every single corner of a room, but also somewhat sluggish.","January 5, 2014","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Let me add that the genre of point and click adventure / puzzle games is one I have built a love-hate relationship with over the years. For every game with a gripping storyline, great characters, and mostly logical and fun puzzles, there seem to be three (possibly up to n-1) that send you on a pixel-for-pixel hunt for items and constantly obstruct your progress in the most obscure way possible.\n\nThat being said, I have used a guide for parts of this game. Maybe I could have done it without, but sometimes, after searching the same 3 places over and over again for that one item or observation that allows you to progress, you're faced with the choice of using a guide or uninstalling the game, and I kinda wanted to finish it after all.\n\nThe game looks decent, but it doesn't feel great. You have the choice between first person, 3rd person, and point-and-click mode, all of which feel a bit clunky at times. The voice acting didn't strike me neither as great, nor terrible - it works.\nPeople seem to think that this game is very gritty, mature and dark (compared to what exactly?). There's the occasional graphic scene, but all in all it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Sherlock Holmes game. At least it's pretty much what I had expected, I guess. The story didn't have me jump up from my chair in regular intervals (or at all for that matter), but it's enough to keep you going.\nAs suggested earlier, The Testament of Sherlock Holmes isn't free of typical adventure game moments. Now, I'm certainly not a genius, but I'm not a complete knucklehead, either. At least not all the time. Sometimes I just got stuck. I don't remember how often exactly, but it will probably happen to you. Or maybe it won't and I'm just really bad at this. Anyway, a hint system other than the "6th Sense" - that didn't really do anything useful for me when I used it - would've helped here.\n\nSo, would I recommend buying this game?\nThe answer is a clear "it depends". Do you enjoy this sort of game and can you live with the inherent quirks and issues of the genre? Do you have a large sum of money at your disposal or can you get the game on sale for no more than 5-8 bucks (or both)? If you can answer both questions with yes, then sure, go for it. There are worse ways of spending a couple of hours (there are also better ways, but aren't there always?).","December 31, 2013","true","9.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The graphics have been dramatically improved, there's an added third person camera option for that one person who played LA Noire and wanted all of his mytery games to make sure the camera was as far away from the evidence as possible, and the story starts out really interesting, bring up the idea that Sherlock Holmes may not be the legendary detective that Watson writes about in the novels. But right at the end it suddenly decides to get really stupid, and does something that was acceptable as a cute little easter egg in one of the previous games but doesn't really work as a main plot element, and then at the end it tags on a happy ending in the absolute worst possible way that I could ever imagine. The only thing saving the ending is the fact that the next game, Crimes and Punishments, turned out to be the real best in the series and abandoned all thoughts of the ending of this game. I'd still recommend playing it for the sake of the early parts of the game, but I can't recommend actually buying it individually; it's only worth playing if you get it in the Collection.","April 3","false","9.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/recommended/205650/","Mountain_Man","Mountain Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mountain_Man/","162 products in account","SummaryA decent enough adventure game and a treat for fans of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nReviewI won't say this is the best adventure game I've ever played, but I enjoyed it for what it was worth.  The fact that I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes did help me look past some of the game's rougher spots, but I'm not sure someone else would be so forgiving.  The overall narrative, suffice it to say, is no match for the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle originals, but it's enough to hold the game together, which is really the most you can expect from a video game story.\n\nI called this an adventure game, but I think "puzzle game" might be a more fitting description.  Who knew the denizens of Victorian London were so fond of locking their secrets behind intricate logic puzzles?  You will encounter around two-dozen puzzles throughout the course of completing the game, and while I didn't find the puzzles particularly difficult once I understood them, the rules and operations of the puzzles were sometimes vague, so it wasn't always obvious to me what I was supposed to do, or if it was obvious, it wasn't obvious exactly how I was supposed to go about doing it.  I suppose that's part of the gameplay experience, figuring out exactly what the puzzle is and how to solve it, but there were times I honestly wasn't sure if this was intentional or simply poor game design.  No matter, walk throughs are easy enough to find on the internet these days if you need a prod in the right direction; alternatively, the game does present the option to simply skip a puzzle if you're well and truly stumped, but what self-respecting gamer would choose that route?\n\nThere are also the more traditional adventure game puzzles that have you exploring your environment for clues, picking up everything you possibly can, and occasionally combining various objects in your inventory so you can proceed.  Thankfully, the game has a "Sixth Sense" feature where you press the spacebar to momentarily have points of interest highlighted for you which eliminates the frustrating pixel hunt.\n\nThe presentation is a somewhat mixed bag.  The environments and character models are generally oustanding with great attention to detail and lots of atmospheric touches that really make Victorian London come to life.  The overall character animations are good for the most part, but the lipsynching is atrocious with the characters frequently flapping their lips for a few seconds after delivering their lines, which I found distracting, and the voice acting is average at best.  I never really took to Watson's melodramatic delivery where every line is spoken with an awkward urgency, and Holmes speaks in a drone, sounding almost bored at times, as if the whole business of crime solving no longer interested him.  Curiously, the bit players you encounter throughout the game are often better acted and sound more convincing then the stars of the show.\n\nThe game controls well enough with a mouse and keyboard, although the mouse movements felt somewhat sluggish even with the sensitivity turned up to maximum in the settings. I played mostly from the third-person perspective which gives you a good view of your surroundings, and while a traditional adventure game perspective is offered, I found the controls too awkward (although people with a gamepad seem to have good success playing from this perspective).  I'd like to pass on a couple of tips on controlling the game since I'm not sure if it's mentioned in the manual: 1) you can use the mouse wheel to quickly scroll through individual items in your inventory; this is a lot faster and more convenient than opening your inventory screen, although you still have to open it if you want to combine one object with another; 2) if you have a bunch of hotspots clustered together, you can click the left-mouse button to highlight one and then use the WASD keys to cycle through them until you've highlighted the one you want; click the left-mouse button a second time to activate it; otherwise it's just way too fiddly to try and maneuver your character into the right position.\n\nI realize this review might seem overly critical, but none of the criticisms I've noted are fatal, and I did spend an enjoyable 14-hours completing this game.  With the noted exceptions, the puzzles are clever and fun to solve, and I have to say again that I found the art design to be terrific making each area a joy to explore, particularly when I came across obscure references to the original Conan Doyle stories.  If you're a fan of adventrue games, and especially Sherlock Holmes, and you think you could look past the weaknesses I've noted, then I would recommend this game.","January 12, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The story line is excellent.  I did not enjoy the puzzles.  I would like to have seen some hints on the simple mechanics, or even objective of the puzzle....some of them you're just given the puzzle without any explaination.  This adds what could be seen as unneccesary difficulty, although there is a "skip puzzle" button that appears when you take too long.  I would rate the game in the 20hr range\n\nMy other problem is the deduction boards without a place to review the evidence you collect...I'm not sure why there isn't a review clue option in the menu.  Also a straight case objective list for some guidence in the various areas would be of benefit...sometimes watson is of help.  I think I may have been jaded with finishing LA Noire right before playing Sherlock and expecting more of an open sandbox type rather than a straight point and click.\n\nIt is a great installment for Sherlock Holmes fans.

The overall narrative, suffice it to say, is no match for the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle originals, but it's enough to hold the game together, which is really the most you can expect from a video game story.\n\nI called this an adventure game, but I think "puzzle game" might be a more fitting description.  Who knew the denizens of Victorian London were so fond of locking their secrets behind intricate logic puzzles?  You will encounter around two-dozen puzzles throughout the course of completing the game, and while I didn't find the puzzles particularly difficult once I understood them, the rules and operations of the puzzles were sometimes vague, so it wasn't always obvious to me what I was supposed to do, or if it was obvious, it wasn't obvious exactly how I was supposed to go about doing it.  I suppose that's part of the gameplay experience, figuring out exactly what the puzzle is and how to solve it, but there were times I honestly wasn't sure if this was intentional or simply poor game design.  No matter, walk throughs are easy enough to find on the internet these days if you need a prod in the right direction; alternatively, the game does present the option to simply skip a puzzle if you're well and truly stumped, but what self-respecting gamer would choose that route?\n\nThere are also the more traditional adventure game puzzles that have you exploring your environment for clues, picking up everything you possibly can, and occasionally combining various objects in your inventory so you can proceed.  Thankfully, the game has a "Sixth Sense" feature where you press the spacebar to momentarily have points of interest highlighted for you which eliminates the frustrating pixel hunt.\n\nThe presentation is a somewhat mixed bag.  The environments and character models are generally oustanding with great attention to detail and lots of atmospheric touches that really make Victorian London come to life.  The overall character animations are good for the most part, but the lipsynching is atrocious with the characters frequently flapping their lips for a few seconds after delivering their lines, which I found distracting, and the voice acting is average at best.  I never really took to Watson's melodramatic delivery where every line is spoken with an awkward urgency, and Holmes speaks in a drone, sounding almost bored at times, as if the whole business of crime solving no longer interested him.  Curiously, the bit players you encounter throughout the game are often better acted and sound more convincing then the stars of the show.\n\nThe game controls well enough with a mouse and keyboard, although the mouse movements felt somewhat sluggish even with the sensitivity turned up to maximum in the settings. I played mostly from the third-person perspective which gives you a good view of your surroundings, and while a traditional adventure game perspective is offered, I found the controls too awkward (although people with a gamepad seem to have good success playing from this perspective).  I'd like to pass on a couple of tips on controlling the game since I'm not sure if it's mentioned in the manual: 1) you can use the mouse wheel to quickly scroll through individual items in your inventory; this is a lot faster and more convenient than opening your inventory screen, although you still have to open it if you want to combine one object with another; 2) if you have a bunch of hotspots clustered together, you can click the left-mouse button to highlight one and then use the WASD keys to cycle through them until you've highlighted the one you want; click the left-mouse button a second time to activate it; otherwise it's just way too fiddly to try and maneuver your character into the right position.\n\nI realize this review might seem overly critical, but none of the criticisms I've noted are fatal, and I did spend an enjoyable 14-hours completing this game.  With the noted exceptions, the puzzles are clever and fun to solve, and I have to say again that I found the art design to be terrific making each area a joy to explore, particularly when I came across obscure references to the original Conan Doyle stories.  If you're a fan of adventrue games, and especially Sherlock Holmes, and you think you could look past the weaknesses I've noted, then I would recommend this game.","January 12, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It's just a bad game.\n\nInvestigations are poor, with absolutely ludicrous pixel hunting. The sixth sense ability is supposed to assist you in locating interactive hotspots, but it only seems to work if an object is in a direct line of vision, which means if an object is obscured on your screen, it won't show up, leading you to do the ALWAYS FUN GAMEPLAY MECHANIC of running around a room in circles trying to find the one item necessary to trigger the next cutscene.\n\nYou do a lot of pointless stuff in this game, that is supposed to reflect poorly on Holmes' credibility, but feels instead like story padding. Whitechapel feels practically like running errands. Back and forth and back and forth. In the prison, back and forth and back and forth. Backtracking is nothing new to adventure games but because every area of the game is its own chapter, you're not backtracking to other locations, you're backtracking within the same location, which just adds to the tedium.\n\nThe story wants you to take itself seriously but yikes. (SPOILERS!) Why are there saturday morning cartoon scenes in an attic with hilarious looking 3d models during this game about vicious murders? Why is Watson fooled by the warden's sudden RIDICULOUS FORCED GERMAN ACCENT? Since when did Moriarty become Kefka from Final Fantasy 6?  There are times when the story in this game felt sillier than the Cthulhu game, but at least the Cthulhu game knew it was camp! There's always been ridiculous elements to Sherlock Holmes cases, but this game wants you to believe it's the darkest and grimest game yet-- but it's so goofy!!\n\nMaybe the engine just doesn't hold up anymore. Or maybe Sherlock Holmes needs to shed the current construct of puzzles and busywork. Perhaps a game more along the lines of Walking Dead/Gone Home but with a detective/invstigation slant? All I know is the gameplay of Testament is flat out bad and the story doesn't save it, and I enjoyed it far less than Awakened, Nemesis, and Jack the Ripper.","August 3, 2014","false","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Good voice-acting (especially in Holmes's case) and a fairly cool and menacing storyline keep the player engaged in the puzzles and clue-finding expeditions.\n\nThe only thing that keeps this game from being grand is that all the interesting twists and turns don't necessarily add up to a breath-taking ending. It's still pretty good, just maybe not as satisfying as you'd expect it to be given how well the game teases out some of the bizarre clues along the way.","December 22, 2013","true","25.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I loved that it had more gore than other Sherlock Holmes games, adding a bit more realism. The story is good and in depth, with a good plot twist. I had to look up solutions a couple of times but it was not too difficult to make it unplayable and it was not even close to easy enough to make it not fun. It was also nice to have the modern graphics and controller support. I used an Xbox controller 99% of the time and I thought it was more enjoyable than using the keyboard.","December 22, 2013","true","23.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of the best story lines and mysteries that I have played. The game is gorgeous and fun to play but sometimes frustrating with obscure objects needed which is typical for point and click but what makes it annoying is the required order to pick up thing to activate items.  This makes it so you pretty much need a walkthrough unless you want to spend countless hours looking for that one item to click on.  Reccomend playing with walkthrough. Grab it on sale. One point of advice look up the blackmail achvement. It is easilly missable and have to replay whole game to get it.","July 26, 2013","true","26.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For the most part I have no problem with the graphics, a touch old-fashioned though they may be.  The poor lip-syncing and the harrowingly dead eyes of everyone except perhaps Holmes, however, are annoying. Not to mention those pictures of the judges, which were just embarrassing...\n\nThe plot is interesting and suitably grim, although there were some parts which made little sense. The frame story, I'm sorry to say, I didn't care for at all. The dialogue is interesting, occasionally even quite funny, and there isn't an excess of pointless blather. Holmes' witty retorts deserve a mention of their own, and I quite liked his voice-actor. I also liked the fact that you get to play several characters, not just him. However, there were instances where I wish I had been given freer hands to interrogate people and arrive at conclusions.\n\nThe puzzles aren't patronisingly easy, nor nerve-wrackingly difficult. Nor are they repetitive. There were a couple which I chose to skip after three or four tries simply because they didn't exactly fall within my field of expertise. Some might find the lack of instructions a nuisance, but I didn't mind.\n\nAll in all, I quite enjoyed it, even if occasionally I did get frustrated. 7/10\n\n\n+ You actually get to do some deducing.\n+ The sixth sense is a wonderful aid when you feel like you have reached an impasse.\n\n- Oh, Watson, won't you get out of my way!\n- There are only so many faces in London, apparently. I wish the creators would have been more inventive so that at least all the characters somewhat relevant to the plot would have their own unique faces.\n- There were one or two factual errors.","January 1, 2014","true","17.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some puzzles involve a bit of a leap in logic and the voice acting can be pretty bad. The story is actually being told by 3 kids who find a Shrelock Holmes book in their attic. It's pretty dumb and the child voice actors give me AIDS.

Basically all you have to do is search for clickable spots. Boring!\n\nIn the second mystery you're presented to the "Deduction Board" in which your findings are noted and you are supposed to figure how all things connect by yourself. This part is more rewarding. But you're also presented to a puzzle in which you have to move a chess piece though a chessboard  (it has to land on every single one of the 25 spots of the chessboard and not land on the same spot more than once) . Though it's easily solved by trial and error and taking notes not to try the same solution multiple times, it's tedious.\n\nAnd then come more puzzles... Just when I was about to give the game up there came another Deduction Board to make me feel rewarded again!\n\nAnd more puzzles...\n\nAnd then again Holmes shows off his skills while all I had to do was find clickable spots.\n\nAnd then I'm off to another exciting (not!) hunt for more clickable spots with no clue as to what I'm supposed to find. I find mostly everything very quickly... but then walk around aimlessly for around 30 minutes until I finally find the last clickable spot, which grants me access to more... puzzles!!!\n\nThen the game told me I was supposed to control a dog. I assumed that I was supposed to go on another hunt for more clickable spots and that later Holmes would make sense of everything I found, so that was it for me! I gave up!\n\nSo, if you're into solving puzzles and finding clickable spots, this game is for you!\n\nIf you're into mystery solving you're better off reading a book. Since I now despise everything related to Holmes, I'd recommend Agatha Christie's novels.","June 14, 2015","false","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, I didn't like the game very much because of three reasons:\n\n1. The Characters: I went into this game not knowing much about Sherlock Holmes (I never read any of the stories and only knew him as a famous detective). He, in my opinion, is nothing but an arrogant a**hole who talks down to everyone while making himself out to be hot sh*t. He goes around constantly breaking the law in the name of his investigations and then expects everyone to accept his deductions. A perfect example of this is in the beginning of the game (minor spoiler) when he lockpicks a bishop's office all by himself and expects everyone to believe in what he's found. Dr. Waston isn't much better because he, in my opinion, is a yes man who serves as Holmes' bottom b*itch; he is constantly manipulated by Holmes and the game does have him question some of Holmes' decisions, but in the end, he still blindly follow Holmes because of reasons. Also, you switch control between these two sometimes, but there is absolutely no point because they control EXACTLY the same.\n\n2. The Story: I must admit, I was first intrigued by the beginning (A high ranking bishop was tortured and killed), but as it progressed, it got convoluted to the point of being stupid. Spoiler warning: The overall story is that Moriarty was hired by someone (We never know by who) to overthrow the Queen and replace her with the Prince through magic poison (No, I'm not kidding) and bombs. Plot points are thrown at you with no explanation (Or that Holmes won't tell you until the end) and when he finally tells you everything in an exposition dump,  it doesn't make much sense and he tell you in a very smug tone to imply that he is the only one who can stop them.\n\n3. The Puzzles: The exploring parts were ok (Think of the Walking Dead movement scheme). The sixth sense button was a nice idea, but it worked when it wanted to (Sometimes, I clicked it and no buttons came up until I was right next to the object I was supposed to look at). The actual puzzles were hit or miss with mostly misses because most of the puzzles came with no explanations on the actual mechanics of them (Meaning that the puzzle would be "figure out the mysterious substance in the test tube" and it didn't explain how to actually do that. I found myself randomly clicking around in most puzzles, stumped on what to do until the skip puzzle button appeared.\n\nAll in all, I would rate this game a 3 out of 10 and would highly suggest you buy this game for $5.00 and not for the $19.99 full price.\n","October 13, 2014","false","9.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not to mention the fact that they clearly don't know how to properly write this kind of stuff. Watson sounds like an imbecile gawking in awe of the "great" sherlock, who did nothing but walk around and look at the crime scene, and while yes that's what he does in the the rest of the stuff, there was to presentation of what sherlock actually does, which is observe. Instead we get Sherlock wandering around a room clicking on anything with a magnefying glass and then when he has to reveal the big secret? a Monkey did it. ooh, spoilers, sorry for ruining the tutorial for you.

I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  It too me about 14 hours to complete.\n\nAlthough the story is dark and not for children, it largely feels like something a modern Sir AC Doyle would write (which I thought was good).  At times, its tone can be off-putting, but once you reach the final act, it moves along quite well.  The end left me with an unresolved question though...\n\nThe visuals are particularly good with rich textures and high-quality models of people and late-19th century London.  The lip-sync algorithm is rather poor for parts of the game.  Any facial effects on the kids from the intro scene look bad.\n\nCharacter control is clunky when turning in small quarters.  In open areas, it's just fine.\n\nThe game's puzzles range from a couple quite simple ones to some which are complex.  When stuck in an environment puzzle, make sure to check if you can combine items in your inventory as well as checking the local area for items you may have missed.","May 7, 2013","true","15.7"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I also liked the puzzles - none of them were impossible to pass and at least some were actually pretty amusing :) ... though in particular, I found the recurring "lockpick" puzzle unnecessary - as simple as it was, I found it more of a nuisance than a pleasant deviation from the storytelling... I couldn't help comparing that to an excellently designed lockpick puzzle from "Still Life" and even the purely manual lockpicking from the new "Fallout" games was more believable than that in TTOSH... I didn't like the "chemistry" puzzles too much either...\n\nwhat I liked most, I think, apart, of course, from the more sophisticated locking mechanisms on various containers as mentioned above, were the deduction puzzles. even though you could theoretically solve them by randomly ticking options, they still actually made you think about how to connect all pieces together...\n\nthe graphics was pleasant, nothing too fancy but nothing particularly bad either - still looking pretty good though maybe not very sophisticated given its 2012 release date... I liked it...\n\nwhat I didn't like then .... the linearity... yeah, I know, it's neither the first not the last point-and-click that does that but there were a few moments where being very artificially bound to the one location you're in at the moment was particularly jarring...\n\nthe whole "story read by the creepily-modelled kids in the attic" arc - what purpose did that serve?...\n\nthe glitches (the game crashed on me more than a couple of times in just less than 20 hours of gameplay and, in one place, almost blocking me from playing further), the simplistic inventory-based puzzles, the place where you played _a_ _dog_ ...\n\nall in all, yeah, as I said, I did enjoy this game, it did have a few nice moments and amusing puzzles... but would I recommend it? no, not really .... I don't know... maybe I set my expectations too high but I just simply don't feel it's up to the hopes other recommendations here suggested... and given its price, and provided you haven't already played it, I really think another sleuth-themed title - the "LA Noire" is a much better bargain ...

Although its predecessors were also very intriguing, their plots twists and endings were somewhat obvious, because most gamers were very familiar with stories of Arsene Lupin, Jack the Ripper and Lovecraft. This one kept me interested and guessing throughout the game and I was pleasantly surprised with the ending. Some small details may put you off in the beginning but rest assured that all will be very neatly explained towards the end a la Sherlock Holmes fashion. It is very nicely paced also and character driven instead of the usual murder mystery thriller style, which works very well with the theme and feels fresh.\nApart from the story, the gameplay is easy to get used to but you can still see the console port forced in there when you look at the user interfaces.  A point&click camera angle can be used to bypass this effect but the menus remain the same of course.\n\nLooking at the mechanics involved (besides the puzzles), one thing that really fascinates me is that almost every Sherlock Holmes game tries to invent some new gameplay element. Don't get me wrong I don't mind designers experimenting with the gameplay but I expect the see the good ones becoming permanent mechanics in the series. For example, the Ripper murder scene investigation method is gone now, which is a pity. There seems to be a dialogue wheel present in the game which serves no purpose whatsoever. Deduction board is still fun and there is a very good puzzle element involved with it. But sadly the game does not use it very often, for reasons unknown to this reviewer. Inventory puzzles are not annoying contrary to the rest of the genre. But pixel hunting nightmares strike once or twice during the game (I encourage gamers to consult a walkthough at these points because they're not worth wasting time over, you should just get on with the story instead). The game would have been a better one without them sure but none of these gets in our way of enjoying the story and marveling at Sherlock’s wit and prowess.\n\nPutting aside all these bumps, the game plays well and is long enough to satisfy the average user (15 hours).  Board puzzles are nicely done and interact with the world in a sensible way (as far as these sort of games go).  Watson and Sherlock’s dialogues are smart and funny as always and the delivery is very good, though the pace is a bit off; you get too long pauses between some lines that were obviously meant to be interrupting each other. You are still being provided with lots of documents and papers throughout the game (which is nice), some of which you need to read and understand in order to solve puzzles. Locations look very nice but they aren’t many but the Baker St. flat is there as always. Familiar faces pop up once in a while if you know who’s who. The murders are very gruesome and creative. The game is not very difficult also so in a way it feels like a smooth ride if you can overlook stuff mentioned above.\n\nSo all in all, Testament of S. Holmes is good follow up to his predecessors and if you’re a fan of the previous games, you should definitely get it. If you like point&click adventures, the story is enough reason to pick this one up. But if you’re new to the genre, don’t start here.\n\nPros: very good story, well designed puzzles, true to its source material, familiar voice acting, long gameplay,\n\nCons: UI looks very old, locations are sparse, some near misses with gameplay mechanics\n\nVerdict: 4/5","July 15, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've read reviews of other Holmes games that say that the voice acting is not good, but the Holmes and Wastson characters here are very good. If you love puzzles and sleuthing, this is the game for you. If you love non-stop action, this game would disappoint you. One tip: You CAN click a button for "hints" on how to proceed, but don't do that because you lose points for not being able to solve the problem yourself.

I was skeptical at first, because I originally bought it in a $5 bin at a game store (and this was just after it had been released). I can only guess as to why this is, but after playing the game, it would be a very educated guess. Since then, I have voraciously consumed the series, and any games developed by Frogwares. I had falsely believed that a Russian developer could not do the character justice, and I apologize to them for this prejudgement. My review is not all blind praise, however. Some of the puzzles are very difficult, which is normally preferred in a puzzle game, but many of the puzzles do not even state the objective. I found myself spending nearly 45 minutes trying to figure out what was being asked of me as I placed blocks on a lockbox in a childrens classroom. Mostly, these puzzles give an overwhelming sense of satisfaction once you've mastered the objective. The story left nothing to be desired, true to form for the great detective, and although the visuals are less than Next-Generation, I found myself enraptured by the characters and deduction involved. I sincerely felt as Dr. John Watson feels: compelled to follow and trust Holmes, and severely angered when it seems he betrays my trust. Ever since I first played Maniac Mansion, I have been a fan of Point-and-Click adventures, but this series turned me into a full fledged fanatic. If you crave good storylines, enjoy Sherlock Holmes (who doesn't?), or just Love puzzle games, you can't go wrong with The Testament of Sherlock Holmes.

Indeed! I've read all the books, worked on many of his cases when I was a kid. Without saying, it is obvious I am a BIG Sherlock fan and if you've read a good amount you will see all the wonderful references to his prior adventures in this game. Also here, they pull no punches, you are expected to not only solve cases based on logical deduction, but also puzzles which averages a solid 5-7 minutes. All puzzles are self contained, no need for google.\n\nPros:\nGreat Logical exercise\nExcellent Story\nTrue to the Original (Well mostly)\nMakes you feel like the ultimate detective himself.\nCons:\nA bit too short. Finished within 24 hours.\nNeeds more deductive board cases (These were the most fun)\nThough beautiful graphics, it doesnt build on it like modern games (Not a huge negative really)\n\nConclusion: Great Game!

Although its predecessors were also very intriguing, their plots twists and endings were somewhat obvious, because most gamers were very familiar with stories of Arsene Lupin, Jack the Ripper and Lovecraft. This one kept me interested and guessing throughout the game and I was pleasantly surprised with the ending. Some small details may put you off in the beginning but rest assured that all will be very neatly explained towards the end a la Sherlock Holmes fashion. It is very nicely paced also and character driven instead of the usual murder mystery thriller style, which works very well with the theme and feels fresh.\nApart from the story, the gameplay is easy to get used to but you can still see the console port forced in there when you look at the user interfaces.  A point&click camera angle can be used to bypass this effect but the menus remain the same of course.\n\nLooking at the mechanics involved (besides the puzzles), one thing that really fascinates me is that almost every Sherlock Holmes game tries to invent some new gameplay element. Don't get me wrong I don't mind designers experimenting with the gameplay but I expect the see the good ones becoming permanent mechanics in the series. For example, the Ripper murder scene investigation method is gone now, which is a pity. There seems to be a dialogue wheel present in the game which serves no purpose whatsoever. Deduction board is still fun and there is a very good puzzle element involved with it. But sadly the game does not use it very often, for reasons unknown to this reviewer. Inventory puzzles are not annoying contrary to the rest of the genre. But pixel hunting nightmares strike once or twice during the game (I encourage gamers to consult a walkthough at these points because they're not worth wasting time over, you should just get on with the story instead). The game would have been a better one without them sure but none of these gets in our way of enjoying the story and marveling at Sherlock’s wit and prowess.\n\nPutting aside all these bumps, the game plays well and is long enough to satisfy the average user (15 hours).  Board puzzles are nicely done and interact with the world in a sensible way (as far as these sort of games go).  Watson and Sherlock’s dialogues are smart and funny as always and the delivery is very good, though the pace is a bit off; you get too long pauses between some lines that were obviously meant to be interrupting each other. You are still being provided with lots of documents and papers throughout the game (which is nice), some of which you need to read and understand in order to solve puzzles. Locations look very nice but they aren’t many but the Baker St. flat is there as always. Familiar faces pop up once in a while if you know who’s who. The murders are very gruesome and creative. The game is not very difficult also so in a way it feels like a smooth ride if you can overlook stuff mentioned above.\n\nSo all in all, Testament of S. Holmes is good follow up to his predecessors and if you’re a fan of the previous games, you should definitely get it. If you like point&click adventures, the story is enough reason to pick this one up. But if you’re new to the genre, don’t start here.\n\nPros: very good story, well designed puzzles, true to its source material, familiar voice acting, long gameplay,\n\nCons: UI looks very old, locations are sparse, some near misses with gameplay mechanics\n\nVerdict: 4/5","July 15, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trevdak/recommended/205650/","trevdak","Sv.trevdak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trevdak/","268 products in account","Meh.\n\nPros:\nThe story was, in it's entirety, quite good.... very similar to the Reichenbach Fall. I was dubious about how this game would be playable at all, because the charm of Sherlock Holmes is that his mind functions completely differently from a normal human being. Putting yourself in his place kinda defeats the purpose of Sherlock because his one awesome trait is gutted. They did a good job of allowing the player to experience the workings of his mind as an outsider.\n\nCons:\nThere were points in this game where I felt myself actually falling asleep. My playtime isn't anything close to 25 hours, there were a couple occasions where I found myself closing my eyes and just went to bed without closing the game. Also, even when you save your game, it takes you back to the start of the level, which means it makes more sense to just leave the game running in the background instead of quitting because you'll lose a good chunk of your progress. This game is similar to the Telltage Games where it's basically a point and click adventure. Everything is very linear, there's no real gameplay beyond a few really simple logic puzzles and clicking around on things. The voice acting is very, very, VERY wooden. The UI is pretty terrible. The maps are very static.... With rare exception, nothing movies, nobody interacts with the environment, and the vast majority of those exceptions are during cutscenes. I was shocked that such a small game took something like 9gb to install. I think we're advanced enough that we could have a dynamic room to actually pick around and gather clues instead of a very-static room. It felt almostl ike 7th guest, which I played 20 years ago. You'd think we would have moved on past that.\n\nThere's no replay value unless you want to speedrun it, and then you must be really bored.\n\nAlso, during the final credits, it plays a new song and does these really aweesome Guy Ritchie stylized credits. It makes you wonder "Why the hell did they put so much creativity and effort into the credits when the game is bad enough that very few people actually bother getting to them? Why did I have to listen to the same 1 or 2 songs when they had this pretty awesome song just waiting for the rare times that someone gets to the credits?\n\n2/5","October 18, 2015","false","25.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely would recommend for fans of Sherlock Holmes and point and clicks.","October 27, 2015","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dr Watson is at it again with his spooky "in your face" appearance but he is a wonderful contribute to this game and without him it would not be the same.

I honestly can say that my absolute favorite part is where you play the hound Toby - I love that dog in the books, movies and now this game. It was great fun sniffing around! The only hang ups with the game are story line related as well as character portrayal. Holmes was a bit more of an obvious pompous smart-♥♥♥ than normal. Can't really talk about the story line as that would have spoilers! But besides that, it was a decent game, solid story line that plays out for about 13+ hours if you play casually.

The beginning of the game is very engaging with the investigations and logic, but as it goes on the narratives moves towards more typical adventure game scenarios where you are frustratingly stuck trying to figure out the logic of the game. The maps for the levels are beautiful and the puzzles are overall at the right level of challenging without being impossible, although you sometimes may need to look up HOW to solve them online due to vague explanations. The story and character models/animations are the weakest part of the game.\n\nOverall, the game feels like it suffered from an overestimated budget and had to compensate through development.

The voice-acting of Holmes himself has greatly improved, though many of the other voices in the game still sound weird most of the time. Nonetheless, the voice acting of Holmes is wonderful and really fits the character. The mysteries that Holmes and Watson have to face this time aren't all too complicated to solve, but the puzzles in this game are different. They range from incredibly easy to ridiculously hard in some cases, though this experience may be very different for other players. Luckily, there is always the option of skipping a puzzle if one cannot solve it after trying for some time.\nThe Testament's storyline, while slow and a bit frustrating at some times, has its captivating and even moving moments. The friendship between Holmes and Watson shows strongly throughout the story, as the bonds between them are tested by the mysterious events that seem to point out that the great detective himself may have become a criminal. The conclusion of the game is a moving and fitting end to this story which, as a whole, I highly recommend to fans of the world's greatest detective and those who enjoy a challenging adventure.","July 11, 2015","true","18.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The previous game was enjoyable in spite of the clunky way of moving through the environment. Good story and enjoyable puzzles. The Testament of Sherlock Holmes, however, was an inelegant clickfest from start to finish: clumsy interface, trivial puzzles, extremely awkward navigation through the environment, and a risible storyline full of plot holes, anachronisms, and non sequiturs. (And poor fact checking. For example: Did you know that hygrogen peroxide is called "bleach?" Of course you didn't, because even though it is a bleaching agent, no one calls it bleach. Bleach is sodium hypochlorite.) The game was a shoddy exercise in frustration to be blunt. About the only positive thing I can say is that the voice acting, like previous titles, was quite good.

Thankfully, the game quickly improves and turns into a fairly interesting Sherlock Holmes mystery which is very reminiscent of some of the original tales. Just please, skip the painful cutscenes with the creepy attic children.\n\nKeep in mind that while there are a few "deduction boards" and puzzles that require deduction, that this is primarily a fairly traditional adventure game. Expect lots of running around, trying to find the random items that the game has decided you should be able to pick up, and then the using of those items (sometimes after some combining) on various locations. Also present are a fair number of (mostly) generic "toy" puzzles, some of which you've probably seen before if you've played any Professor Layton/mobile puzzle games. Think (very basic) chess-themed puzzles, unraveling a bunch of "tangled" ropes, or determining which person is in which position (based on a set of hints).\n\nWhile the game is far from perfect, and there are definitely some awkward moments within, it's overall a fairly enjoyable mystery-themed adventure game.","August 20, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually I feel it is a bit too far out there at times.\n\nYou can choose to play from a 3rd person perspective or 1st person. Because of the somewhat clunky controls and movement I ended up playing it in 1st person to not become too frustrated. You alternate between controlling Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson through the story and even Toby the dog. Especially Toby here felt out of place and especially clunky and odd. Not only did that part feel unrealistic to the point of ridiculousness, but for he most part it did not even make any sense. I do not want to spoil too many details, but let's just say don't get caught up in where the tracks lead you. Half the time they didn't even show up. At least not until you'd been going back and forth several times. It is good to see that a developer is trying something new and original, but this was not a success in my eyes.\n\nWhat really stands out in this game, in my opinion, is the voice acting. They were just really really good. I don't know if it is because the British language just seems more dramatic and sincere or what it is, but everyone felt very believable.\n\nThere's a good mix of search and find, puzzles, mini-games and exploration. I found the deduction boards to be creative and fun and the puzzle boxes to be less so. Either way I enjoyed the game as a whole and would easily recommend it to anyone enjoying these types of games.\n\nI rate the game 7/10\n\nHappy Gaming!","February 5, 2014","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Normally I'm not into adventures genre, just to be clear on that.\n\nI've finished the game now and I have to admit that it was rather disapointing. The further you get in the game, the less meaning you find in everyone's actions and even when they tell you the reasons it seems rather silly. Graphics is quite alright, but animations and acting in general could be way better (especially the scenes with kids... RARGH!!!).\n\nNow for the main thing: the puzzles. First I found them rather challenging (the chessmates puzzles took me a while to figure out), but then it went so smooth that I didn't feel challenged except the very first glance at the puzzle. In the beginning the gameplay felt consistent, but later it turned into pixel-scanning and collecting everything you can without a clear idea why you need to put this huge piano into a pocket of your coat... Somebody wrote here that he was disappointed that most of the puzzles are not well explained. I think that's actually the only challenge in puzzles, because once you figure out what you're supposed to do, it is basically solved.","January 8, 2014","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All the other games in this series came out before 2008, so the old graphic prevented me from playing the game through.  That is why I was delighted when I saw the trailer for this game on TV.  Wow, an adventure game making a TV spot!  It must be good!  I guess the fact the BBC mini-series was so popular helped.\n\nI bought this game on Steam when it was on sale through Humble Bundle in Oct 2013, and it took me about 3 month on and off to finish it.  I guess my mind has been too used to fast paced shooters and could never play for more than 30-60 minutes at a time.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed the time.  It took me about 17 hours to finish and that is with the help of looking up answer online.\nThere are a lot of puzzles, but I suppose that is what you want in a thinking game.  Sherlock has to unlock a lot of… well locks.  The puzzle basically all makes sense, but a LOT of them does not give instruction on how to solve it.  I guess that is real life, there is no instructional manual.\nIf you stare at a puzzle for about 5 minutes, then the game give you a chance to just skip the puzzle and get on with story.\n\nThis game does feature a nice story.  As I play through it I do enjoy the twist and turn.  You get to play Sherlock, Watson, and even their dog Toby.  You cannot die in the game, nor is there any timed puzzle.  Despite the trailer showing a lot of brandishing of guns, and a lot of graphic depiction of dead bodies, most of the game involves non-violent solution where you have to trap someone or create distraction to sneak past an obstacle.\n\nThere are some confusing story plot points.  One is the chase of the suspect Henry to Wharf 321, for me it did not make sense how it fit into the main plot.  Another one is when Sherlock brought cake to Judge Beckett’s house, it is the only times in the game where you see him carry something, but why would he carry cake?   I know about the plot twist in the end but it was never explained well.\n\nIt is fun to see Sherlock and all the gothic element of the Victorian era.  Watson came off as a well-rounded character; he did serve in the Afghan War and definitely uses his medical skill in the game.  Sherlock is cool as always.  The graphic is pretty good.  So play it if you are an adventure fan, and play it if you like a good mystery, just know there is no arcade action at all in here.\n\n===Spoilers, if the plot does not make sense, you can watch the in-game recap of it at the end of this video\nPart 12 of 16 The Testament Of Sherlock Holmes Entire Game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmWoLmm_r3k\nAlso a nice trailer for the game here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPJ2ak1oj6s\n","March 12, 2014","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was deep and immersive with unpredictable twists and turns.  Too many games lead down the same take it or leave it, predictable path but this game grips you and doesn't let go until the very last, moving cut scene.  This is the first Sherlock Holmes game I've played and I'm so pleased I chose this one as I can't see any others matching or surpassing this one.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the way the games AI populated the Victorian world with an array of believable and authentic looking people, whether they be poverty stricken waifs and strays or high society.  I love just looking out the windows of their Baker Street room and watching the world pass by!\n\nThere's just one niggle that spoiled the gameplay at times and that was the AI controlling Watson.  When you're controlling Holmes, and Watson isn't off completing his own mission, Watson has this urge to get right up close to Holmes which often impedes Holmes' movement.  After a while you start to anticipate this behaviour and you go round him before he corners you.  It's an annoyance but overall didn't spoil the game and there are plenty of locations where they explore separately and hence this isn't an issue.\n\nPros:\n\n*Character Driven Storyline\n*Rich, Detailed Locations\n*Excellent Voice Acting\n*Cinematic Cut Scenes\n*Perfect Soundtrack\n*Thought Provoking Puzzles\n*20+ Hours Gameplay\n\nCons:\n\n*AI - Character Movement\n\nIf you enjoy adventure games you'd be a fool not to play this one!","March 20, 2014","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I also liked the puzzles - none of them were impossible to pass and at least some were actually pretty amusing :) ... though in particular, I found the recurring "lockpick" puzzle unnecessary - as simple as it was, I found it more of a nuisance than a pleasant deviation from the storytelling... I couldn't help comparing that to an excellently designed lockpick puzzle from "Still Life" and even the purely manual lockpicking from the new "Fallout" games was more believable than that in TTOSH... I didn't like the "chemistry" puzzles too much either...\n\nwhat I liked most, I think, apart, of course, from the more sophisticated locking mechanisms on various containers as mentioned above, were the deduction puzzles. even though you could theoretically solve them by randomly ticking options, they still actually made you think about how to connect all pieces together...\n\nthe graphics was pleasant, nothing too fancy but nothing particularly bad either - still looking pretty good though maybe not very sophisticated given its 2012 release date... I liked it...\n\nwhat I didn't like then .... the linearity... yeah, I know, it's neither the first not the last point-and-click that does that but there were a few moments where being very artificially bound to the one location you're in at the moment was particularly jarring...\n\nthe whole "story read by the creepily-modelled kids in the attic" arc - what purpose did that serve?...\n\nthe glitches (the game crashed on me more than a couple of times in just less than 20 hours of gameplay and, in one place, almost blocking me from playing further), the simplistic inventory-based puzzles, the place where you played _a_ _dog_ ...\n\nall in all, yeah, as I said, I did enjoy this game, it did have a few nice moments and amusing puzzles... but would I recommend it? no, not really .... I don't know... maybe I set my expectations too high but I just simply don't feel it's up to the hopes other recommendations here suggested... and given its price, and provided you haven't already played it, I really think another sleuth-themed title - the "LA Noire" is a much better bargain ...

Dr Watson is at it again with his spooky "in your face" appearance but he is a wonderful contribute to this game and without him it would not be the same.

I was skeptical at first, because I originally bought it in a $5 bin at a game store (and this was just after it had been released). I can only guess as to why this is, but after playing the game, it would be a very educated guess. Since then, I have voraciously consumed the series, and any games developed by Frogwares. I had falsely believed that a Russian developer could not do the character justice, and I apologize to them for this prejudgement. My review is not all blind praise, however. Some of the puzzles are very difficult, which is normally preferred in a puzzle game, but many of the puzzles do not even state the objective. I found myself spending nearly 45 minutes trying to figure out what was being asked of me as I placed blocks on a lockbox in a childrens classroom. Mostly, these puzzles give an overwhelming sense of satisfaction once you've mastered the objective. The story left nothing to be desired, true to form for the great detective, and although the visuals are less than Next-Generation, I found myself enraptured by the characters and deduction involved. I sincerely felt as Dr. John Watson feels: compelled to follow and trust Holmes, and severely angered when it seems he betrays my trust. Ever since I first played Maniac Mansion, I have been a fan of Point-and-Click adventures, but this series turned me into a full fledged fanatic. If you crave good storylines, enjoy Sherlock Holmes (who doesn't?), or just Love puzzle games, you can't go wrong with The Testament of Sherlock Holmes.

It has some technical flaws, which make it not the greatest game, but I'm glad I played it.\n\nPros:\n+ The game has a really good, really strong Sherlock Holmes feel. This is not a game that they slapped a Sherlock skin on top of. It's got that special something that makes it Sherlock Holmes. This was the most important reason why I enjoyed the game overall, in spite of some flaws.\n+ Good story. Nice twists an turns.\n+ Good mixture of point and click, puzzle, and deduction elements. The deduction puzzles make it feel very Sherlocky.\n\nCons:\n- A little too much pixel-hunting in the point and click. A couple of times I had to consult a walkthrough because I missed picking up some tiny item in a large level. A couple of the point and click puzzles are annoying.\n- The story (while good overall) is framed with a really stupid meta-narration that kills the mood from time to time. Also I did not like the ending at all.\n- Game starts to drag a little towards the end, where there is an extended and annoying last level.

I was dubious about how this game would be playable at all, because the charm of Sherlock Holmes is that his mind functions completely differently from a normal human being. Putting yourself in his place kinda defeats the purpose of Sherlock because his one awesome trait is gutted. They did a good job of allowing the player to experience the workings of his mind as an outsider.\n\nCons:\nThere were points in this game where I felt myself actually falling asleep. My playtime isn't anything close to 25 hours, there were a couple occasions where I found myself closing my eyes and just went to bed without closing the game. Also, even when you save your game, it takes you back to the start of the level, which means it makes more sense to just leave the game running in the background instead of quitting because you'll lose a good chunk of your progress. This game is similar to the Telltage Games where it's basically a point and click adventure. Everything is very linear, there's no real gameplay beyond a few really simple logic puzzles and clicking around on things. The voice acting is very, very, VERY wooden. The UI is pretty terrible. The maps are very static.... With rare exception, nothing movies, nobody interacts with the environment, and the vast majority of those exceptions are during cutscenes. I was shocked that such a small game took something like 9gb to install. I think we're advanced enough that we could have a dynamic room to actually pick around and gather clues instead of a very-static room. It felt almostl ike 7th guest, which I played 20 years ago. You'd think we would have moved on past that.\n\nThere's no replay value unless you want to speedrun it, and then you must be really bored.\n\nAlso, during the final credits, it plays a new song and does these really aweesome Guy Ritchie stylized credits. It makes you wonder "Why the hell did they put so much creativity and effort into the credits when the game is bad enough that very few people actually bother getting to them? Why did I have to listen to the same 1 or 2 songs when they had this pretty awesome song just waiting for the rare times that someone gets to the credits?\n\n2/5","October 18, 2015","false","25.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The lighting is poor, the lip-syncing is terrible, and the locations feel like movie sets rather Victorian London.\n\nThere are only 3-4 deduction board sequences and their questions are either ridiculously easy or you are not provided with enough information (for example, the information you are given to solve it matches several of the possible answers). There is no penalty for guessing wrong, so you just answer the easy ones and guess on the others until they're correct. Most of the puzzles in the game are combination puzzles. It is absolutely laughable how many people in 19th Century London owned puzzle lock boxes, I think 1 in 2 NPCs in this game have one. The game begins to take the ♥♥♥♥ when a door in the sewers has a puzzle lock. There are also some very silly padding sequences, like when you are given control of Toby the bloodhound.\n\nIt is often condescending, provides an insulting portrayal of Holmes and Watson, and is just generally a very poor game. I should have stayed away from these 3D Holmes games after the first two were so bad. I miss the old Mythos Software series.","August 18, 2015","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thankfully, the game quickly improves and turns into a fairly interesting Sherlock Holmes mystery which is very reminiscent of some of the original tales. Just please, skip the painful cutscenes with the creepy attic children.\n\nKeep in mind that while there are a few "deduction boards" and puzzles that require deduction, that this is primarily a fairly traditional adventure game. Expect lots of running around, trying to find the random items that the game has decided you should be able to pick up, and then the using of those items (sometimes after some combining) on various locations. Also present are a fair number of (mostly) generic "toy" puzzles, some of which you've probably seen before if you've played any Professor Layton/mobile puzzle games. Think (very basic) chess-themed puzzles, unraveling a bunch of "tangled" ropes, or determining which person is in which position (based on a set of hints).\n\nWhile the game is far from perfect, and there are definitely some awkward moments within, it's overall a fairly enjoyable mystery-themed adventure game.","August 20, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also better than its sequel which emphasizes too much on the new-era style.\n\nThe variety of the puzzles is enjoyable and almost everyone is decently implemented. The good thing is that every puzzle is integrated in the scenario and not here just for the purpose or making your brain working (I do not like point and click games like Myst). The difficulty is also not too high and not too low, decently made overall even if the difficulty does not improve over time.\n\nThe gameplay is really good if you play on first person mode, OK at third person. I chose the last option because I like viewing my character but sometimes I switched to FP mode because of the limitations of the TP mode. In fact, it's harder to target a location sometimes while in TP mode. Still, it's not horrible to play, just a bit harder. I played it with both gamepad and mouse/keybord and I prefer the first option even if I'm an old PC player.\n\nThe graphics are OK technically speaking and retranscribe well the londonish atmosphere. English voices (which were impossible to pair with french subtitles - which was not a problem because I understand english - even with the developpers tips for steam version) are really well made, especially Holmes voice which retranscribes well the personality of the character.\n\nThe narrative part is nice even if some events seem far-fetched like what we can see in spectacular american movies. I enjoyed the whole plot and the narrative which is really above the pack for this type of games (without the sacrifice of the gameplay like in telltale games). The whole story is well critten and I admit I doubted about Holmes loyalty. Maybe the last chapter in the amusement park was a bit disappointing but still good.\n\nFinally, this game is really solid. I recommend it strongly to people who enjoy a good mix between narrative and old-style puzzles. Sherlock Holmes games are really the best adventure games series nowadays  even if the last episode orientation is disturbing.","August 31, 2015","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a primarily point and click puzzle solving game, the puzzles start off fairly easy, but by the end are some of the most diabolical I've seen in a game. This is not a game for those easily frustrated by difficult and vague puzzles. However, if you can handle the brain strain, or cop out and skip the puzzles altogether, you will find a story that is gripping until the very end. There were many times where I was genuinly excited to see where the story would turn next, and how the next twist would come into play.

Instead, it was just me hunting down clues and the game character connecting the dots. I didn't feel like Sherlock at all. I felt like his errand boy.\n\nHolmes would frequently explain how he figured something out *after* we reached the conclusion. Meanwhile, I was confused as hell as to why I was doing any of it. I had little to do with solving the mysteries.\n\nThe dialogue was mostly in cutscenes. There is occasionally a "dialogue wheel" that tries to act like you have control of the character's conversation, but there are no actual choices to make. It was kind of obsurd. The only real brainwork is in the mini-puzzles, which seem like they're designed more for tedium than to flex your mind, and have absolutely nothing to do with the story or theme.\n\nIt just wasn't worth my time.

The story would be passable, if it had some element of gameplay, But there is ABSOLUTELY no game involved. You don't have choices to make, you can't leave one room to get to another until you uncover all the clues, in the correct order, and there is no possible way to get them wrong. Some of the puzzles are boarder line impossible, well, not really, but they take a long time to figure out. But again, you can't fail, and you can just skip them. For the story, there is no way to die, no way to get caught, no way to fail, no way to move on to a different objective until the one your on is done. There are no choices to make, no deviation from a very linear story. Even in the conversations where it looks like you have options, you don't, it just rotates through the options until you get to the correct one.\n\nThere is one fairly funny point, where as watson, you're talking to this landlady, and the conversation goes\n"I'm a medical doctor and I'm here to see a patient who is losing his teeth, it's highly contagious"\nshe replies "leave, or you'll be one losing your teeth"\nso he says "I'm with the department of health to inspect the neighborhood for (something, I forget)"\nand she says "something something, get out of here"\nso he says "I'm a painter, here to paint your portrait"\n\nSo far, three times I've been wandering around trying to figure out why I can't move forward in the story, and looked in my inventory to see I have three peices of rope, but haven't combined all 3 to make a longer rope, or I have a bottle of water and a dry cloth, but the quest needs a damp cloth... or that you have the wrong item highlighted in the corner of the screen, so while you need to cut something, it's not the knife, it's the clippers, or that you need to pick up the pipe to hit the glass, but you inspected the pipe before inspecting the note, so you didn't pick it up, and after reading the note, you have to go back and inspect the pipe again, this time picking it up, even though nothing in the note had anything to do with the pipe, it just wasn't in the required, pre-determined order.\n\nLuckily, half way into the game, after about 3 hours of mindlessly clicking on every blue (luckily they turn green after you've finished the sequence in the correct order, but also turn from blue to green and back to blue if done out of order when you unlock the sequence you should have done them in, which gets frustrating) and an hour or two of puzzles (there's really only about 6 in total, one of them, the roman numeral box, can be done correctly, but not the "correct" correct way, which was also frustrating) they have about a 20 minute cutscene to recap what actually happened in the story up to that point. Which is pretty much necessary, because you're so mindbent on mindless clicking and backtracking (if that's possible never leaving the same place, more just walking in circles to the same objects over and over) that you have no idea how all the broken fragments of the story are supposed to fit together. I completely forgot who the guy I was following was in the third act of the first scene.\n\nEven in what I assume to be the final act, which is a stealth mission, sort of, you can't get caught. You can run into view of the guard, and you just get turned around to look for the blue icon you haven't finished. By this point, they've even given up explaining why you're looking for them or how they work, you just run along the edges of the room until you see a blue icon, then rotate through the 3-4 things in your inventory until one of them works.\n\nThe achievements in this game even get annoying. Since you can't do anything outside of the pre-determined linear story mode, you finish the last blue icon, and you get the achievement for that area... but there is still no way to not get the achievement.\n\nAnyways, the game is good enough for a time waster, and has some good puzzles, but just realize there is absolutely ZERO game in this game. The story is fine, it's pretty bland, but for a sherlock holmes story, it goes exactly how you would imagine. Sadly, you have absolutely no contribution to this story, no matter what you do, how hard you try to succeed or intentionally fail, you just can't. You either do things exactly how they were programmed and go on to the next chapter, or you stand there, and wait, until you do things how they are programmed and move on to the next chapter.","March 4","false","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd recommend purchasing this game if its on a good sale, and if you enjoy other Sherlock Holmes games.  Just use the sixth sense to bypass the tediousness of the point and click searching in the later game.\n\nAlso the mini-puzzles can be skipped if you wait long enough for the skip button to appear while in the puzzle.","January 14","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not in-game, mind you. Just trying to get it to work is a mystery! I have been having an issue that it seems a lot of of players are having, the Blue Screen after the very first cutscene. My computer is well above standards for the game, and it seems the root of the issue is from nVidia drivers. Because I am fully up to date with my drivers, I still have the Blue Screen. Because of this, I highly recommend not purchasing the game. I'm a giant Sherlock Holmes fan and had great expectations for this game. This made me quickly think otherwise, and I'm very disappointed.","June 25, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","1"

I really enjoyed it because of the story and the beautiful graphics and the puzzles can at times can be pretty challenging, so far I've only had to cheat at 1 puzzle (the animal cards, it was crazy hard).\nI'm more of a person who enjoys reading dialog in games (over skipping it and getting straight to the game), so if you are also like that then this is for you. If you are one who likes straight action without much thought this isn't the game for you.\nOverall I would play this through again because there is so much to take in, it is worth the money :]\n\nPros:\n-Graphics are pretty snazzy\n-You can play as Sherlock and Watson at times (even Toby!)\n-Puzzles get progressively harder (which is nice)\n-The areas you explore are pretty stimulating\n-Voice acting was executed very well\n-If you can't solve a puzzle you can skip it but you risk not getting acheivements\n\nCons:\n-Some items you have to find can be tough espeically in darker/night time scenes even with brightness up all the way\n-Sometimes I was left not knowing what to do (rarely happened but frusturating when it does happen)\n-After SOMETHING happens near the end there is soooo much dialog (even for me). It is for explaining things but it was just too much.\n-Gameplay is kinda of hard if you don't have a mouse because you need it to look around everywhere and you can't run properly if you are using a laptop trackpad.","June 19, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimharrison/recommended/205650/","hiimharrison","Harris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hiimharrison/","44 products in account","Spoilers Ahead.\n\nFirst of all, I just want to thank Frogwares for making this game. I for one am I Sherlock Holmes fan, and have played most of Frogware's titles. The thing about their previous games within my experience are, they tend to glitch out at the point where I'm not able to proceed and finish the game. The Silver Earrings. I got stuck in the master's office. The Awakened. Watson wasn't able to follow up in order for the cutscene. Jack the Ripper. It didn't allow me to interact with clues without pulling me into the inspection of A. Chapman. This is the 2nd title I've finish from Frogwares. The 1st being Sherlock Holmes vs. Nemesis (Arsen Lupin). What I'd like to point out about Frogwares is that within their storylines, they tend to blow things out of proportion and pulling straws out of the blue in order to progress. In this game, they've managed to do the same thing with very nice and touching plot twists.\nThe gameplay portion of it surely improved a lot from the previous games. The interface is beautiful, along with the enhanced graphics and such. From its predecessors, it was from an omniscience point of view. First-person was then added in the series, finally third-person. It gave their gamers a versatile choice. Allowing to use mouse only, keyboard only, and mouse and keyboard. It's an improved feature, but some of the time you'll have to switch between the views in order to interact with some of the clues. I did enjoy the 360 angle inspection feature, truely great idea. All in all, they certainly evolved this series from a point-and-click adventure to something similar to L.A. Noire, another great title. The only thing you really need a guide for are the puzzles, anything else is self-explained and you just need to explore and interact more.\nMoving along with the storyline. Now with this game's story, it's not neccesary for playing some of the older games; however, it'll be somewhat helpful to understand just a bit. The story just slowly let's the gamers view that Sherlock does some questionable things. Slowly tarnishing his name and reputation, also making some of the gamers not liking him. The authors surely did a great job doing so, in order for some plot twists. Then there's the whole taking things out of proportion. First scene shows of three toddlers, and how they're connected to Sherlock and John. Moving on with the story it appears to be that they're grand children of Sherlock and John. How Sherlock, one of the greatest minds can also become the greatest criminal, ruined his reputation by handling the rich with a fake heirloom, rigging a bomb to murder a judge, and murdering an inspector. Here comes the first great plot twist as it was Moriarty whom set to frame Sherlock. Graspped from the straws, because in the previous games (The Awakned) Moriarty has lost his mind and was in an asylum. Though it did eliminated the possibility of him being behind all of it. Then it was grasping straws by pulling in the Prince by teaming him with Moriarity. Second great plot tiwst was that Moriarty has been hiding a child of his own all this time. After his last breathe, he told only Sherlock is worthy of teaching her. Sherlock moved by it raised the child from child to adult. From a beautiful young woman, to a married woman. The girl then birthed a child, a young girl. The girl from the first scene. This was a great scene, as it showed Sherlock didn't turn away from one of his most ignored subject.

While they changed the voice actor for Sherlock from the previous games, he still fits the character, and it still nods to the older adventures in the series. It has a very enticing and dark story. The game had a really good ending, and much more eventful than some of Frogware's previous installments. The puzzles are very challenging, fun, and like to use tricks or red herrings. The visuals are a great improvement over the rest of the games. Doctor Watson finally gets some good action, and is able to show that he's not just someone to bounce ideas off of.\n\nCONS: I really enjoyed the deduction board in Sherlock Holmes versus Jack the Ripper, and it felt much more dumbed down and plain in this game.\n\n10/10 would investigate a third time","May 26","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
