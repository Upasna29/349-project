Someone who holds that passion at heart for Great racing.\nThe more you love Motorsport the better iRacing will fit into your life and becomes a Hobby that trandsend general gaming in terms of long term enjoyment.\n\nIn the beginning for me the buisness model was very odd, after buying stuff like rFactor, Race07-Evo etc then playing those over time it was the weirdest thing to pop up and i was one of the decenters. "WTF is this- etc"\nThen after a few months things became shockingly clear, rFactor, Race07 etc weren't updated.... iRacing was.\nSimply as that my mind changed as i realized they were in it for the long haul, every season iRacers get an update, Big or small it either adds content after months of development or more functionality with tweaks etc.\nEvery $ i've spent in iRacing has been worth it, over the years we got pieces of content bit by bit and with so much more to come the list is getting bigger. To look at iRacing now with fresh eyes the money added up must be daunting, for me i waited impatiently for months and years in some cases for a Track/ Car to the point that the $12 i payed for them over the course of months was nothing. Anyway.\n\niRacing at its core is a Motorsport Simulator, so excitment comes in spikes just like watching F1 these days.\nThe first few laps are crazy and exciting then things settle down a bit with some sparatic fighting with a decent climax at the end.\nWhen you are the one in the car this dynamic is the same but there is an added challenge, getting er done.\nYou're responsable for the outcome of your race, if you make a mistake you suffer the consiquences, if you're slow it's up to you to learn more and improve.\nEverything is up to and on you.\nAs a result overall it's a fantastic challenge, to start from the very bottom and make your way up that ladder, from fighting scrubs to meeting people on your level then above. Over time iRacing becomes less and less of a gaming dynamic and more of a forum for personal improvement.\n\nEither way in the end as a fan of motorsport, facing the same challenge as the drivers i watch on track has added a fantastic dynamic to my life. To watch F1 then run a race with 35 people from all over the world at the very top is superb.\n\nChallenging, Exciting and Fulfilling.","January 22, 2015","true","47.2"," 200 of 231 people (87%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","87","200","231","13","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flammen/recommended/266410/","flammen","bzrkR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flammen/","198 products in account","First off, I've had iRacing for years now, and I was one of those in the early days of owning it to blow my load on all of the content, so I do know where I am coming from here.\n\nI vote no, the price is NOT justified, it's actually a WORSE physics experience than Assetto Corsa for a start, but lets give a full list of the reasons why I would NOT recommend this game.\n\n\n1. The Physics : Whilst they are more realistic than most of the games people are used to this can barely be called simulation, whilst things have improved and continue to improve, the game lacks fundamental tire model elements that would define this title as a simulation. Fundamentally the iRacing engine is based off the Nascar Racing 2003 game engine, which in turn was based off the Grand Prix Legends engine of 1997.\n\nSo in a nut shell this core engine is almost 20 years old. The company themselves and most definitely the players and community like to believe the simulation models tire wear which it doesn't, all it models is that an overheated tyre is a slippy tire so basically one or two sideways moments in a lap, requires potentially 5 corners afterwards on knife-edge oversteer to let the tires cool down again [exactly the same game engine tyre properties that were there on GPL] - which in real life just isn't the case and if you're used to real life racing physics and simulation you will be fighting the car on corner entry as braking and turning on iRacing seems to overwhelm the game engine and generally send you into a low speed spin, again something that wouldn't happen in real life. Despite these short-falls they are more interested in variable weather conditions than fixing the core issues of the game engine.\n\n2. The Price : Under no circumstance is the price of this title acceptable. Not only does it require monthly subscription but also the purchase of tracks and cars. Enjoy racing the skip barber on the North American circuits? Well next time they release a new track you can be it will be on the skip schedule almost forcing you to buy it. You don't 'purchase what you want/can' you end up being forced to make purchases whilst being given the impression it was the customers choice. 300$ plus change for all of the content. For a game? You'd expect such a price for a high end commercial simulator, but it's not, it's a nigh on 20year old game essentially and for this, it's a joke.  The tracks are the service's most acclaimed piece, but realistically they botch their laser scans, the Monza oval for instance is in no way in a scanable condition, so they have essentially just created a track on the fly, not to mention the 'tech tracks'. Lets not forget, iRacing aren't the only ones who laser scan tracks now, do Assetto Corsa charge extortionate amounts because they laser scan their tracks? And IMO do a better job of it.\n\nYou can get just the same enjoyment at a tenth of the price with Assetto Corsa, or even rFactor 2 if you find a private LEAGUE to race in, rather than just trying to join some public server full of wreckers and then complain about the community of that game. Anyone who tries justify the price I garentee has most, if not ALL of the content and feels that natural urge to protect their investment [I mean nobody wants to feel like an idiot for spending 300$ on a video game do they?] which brings me on to point 3 .\n\n3. The cult : After spending so much money on iRacing for all of the necessary content people in the community then have this natural defense mechanism on their 'investment' and will defend iRacing on all levels unjustly, refusing to listen to logical critique and hyperpraising things such as the tracks [one of the things they love to do is pretend that iRacing models tire wear, which it definitely does not].\n\ntl;dr you pay 300$+ to get the less overall enjoyment with substandard physics than you would in a private rFactor 2 or Assetto Corsa league with. Do not confuse immersion with simulation guys! Shiney tracks and a decent public service still do not justify the price!","June 28, 2015","false","91.7"," 389 of 512 people (76%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","76","389","512","28","97"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fbthpg/recommended/266410/","fbthpg","FBTHPG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fbthpg/","177 products in account",""Internet racing is a fun, easy, and inexpensive way for race fans, simracers and gamers alike to enjoy the thrill of the racetrack " - This is iRacings description of their game.  I'm going to break it down.\nFun: YES! The level of courtesy and professionalism of drivers in this community is unparalelled.  It makes for very fun, competitive, and thrilling racing.  Even in the Rookie leagues, the number of drivers that care about the safety rating system is absolutely untouchable by any internet racing community.  AC is good, but not this good.\n\nInexpensive: ABSOLUTELY NOT!  Talk about a money pit.  It's not only a monthly/yearly subscription, it's also a LITERAL F*CKTON OF DLC.  Once you have ascended from the Rookie ranks in this game, the cost increases dramatically.   As of yesterday, the total for all content in Rookie Class and Class D is $580.61 (including a $193.54 multi-purchase discount).  Class A, B, and C continue to add to the DLC money pit, but I'm going to skip the calculation.    Granted, there are a few cars and a few tracks that come with the subscription.  However, the price of each track or car is between $12 and $15.  For instance, the 2007 version of Daytona Intl Speedway is included with subscription, but the 2011(?) version is not. Nurbergring Nordschleife and the Grand Prix Strecke are separate $15 purchases.  But remember, it's only $99.99/yr, which is more than some racing sims without subscription fees and all DLC combined.  For that amount of money, they better have something better than the terribly clunky and slow web UI they currently implement (Read: it launches sessions from a website).  The fact it's based on a game from 2003, which has been continuously modified. Also, if you want to race against your friends - for fun - you need to rent server time from them, or just hope you get matched in the same race.  Absolutely no fun for those who want to race with friends.\n\nEasy:  No.  Just no.  Winning is not easy.  Driving is not easy.  Proper car setup (not done in Rookie class) is not easy.  The tracks and drivers are challenging.  VERY challenging.  With that challenge comes reward, if you do well.\n\nRace fan, Sim racer, and Gamer alike:  I don't recommend playing this game with anything but a proper racing wheel.  Not for the gamer who just wants to create spectacular crashes.  This game is for the serious racers and the community reflects that.  If you're into just watching, they have a youtube channel that broadcasts the races, and they could really use some of those sale profits to increase production quality there.  It sounds like 12-15 y/o kids trying to sound like overly professional and dry race announcers - except one is in the studio and the other is voice chatting over skype.  You watch the races from the same cameras and jerkyness that comes from the instant replay cameras that you get in game (like a single person is just operating it to watch the race).  They desparately need someone who has worked in broadcast to help ramp up the production value.  Words cannot describe how terribly boring and unprofessional these really are.\n\nOverall:  2/5.  The community and safety rating system are the only things holding this game together, imho.  Besides them just now (March 2016) updating to DX11, the cost of DLC, terrible web interface/sever load, being based on a game from 2003, bad broadcast production quality, inablity to race with friends, and subscription costs are enough for me to hate the game.  I got a yearly subscription on sale for $30-something, will not buy any DLC due to cost, and own a racing wheel.  When my year is up, or I get bored of the provided content, I will cancel this subscription (again).  The only reason I ever come back is to race with people who aren't starting wrecks like bored children.\n\nEdit: Added costs. Emphasized sh*tty server load/webUI. Added comments on (not) playing with friends.  Lowered overall score.  I also recently purchased an HTC Vive - it seems that iRacing has completely removed their VR support (even oculus), so that is yet another deal breaker for me.  Technically no racing sim supports the Vive, but that's not to say I don't have some of them working.","January 13","false","71.3"," 271 of 358 people (76%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","76","271","358","23","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NghtFox17/recommended/266410/","NghtFox17","NghtFox17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NghtFox17/","30 products in account","There seems to be a lot of confusion on What iRacing is.  Although it's commonly called a 'Racing Game', it is really a Simulation Service.  You don't own the program, you purchase the rights to use the content.  Very little of the program is stored on your computer, as most of it is handled by the iRacing servers.\n\nWhy no 'trial version'? Well server time cost money, and hosting a solely massively multiplayer experience that is constantly improving is very expensive. However iRacing does provide a 50% one time discount for new members.  You can try the service for 1 months for $6.  not a limited scope version, but the total service!  If you are not sure if a dedicated simulation service is for you, it's a good way to get your feet wet.\n\nHowever if you are willing to invest in iRacing (yes invest, like any Adult Hobby it cost money to play) Coming from R/C Racing, and knowing others who race full size cars, this provides a similar experience with greater convenience, and much lower cost (over time). For example one race Day at most R/C Tracks is typically $5-$20 USD,  If you only ran 20 weeks (once per week), at $5 USD, that would equal the price of one year of iRacing which provides 52 weeks of unlimited racing.\n\nIn terms of Graphics, sure it's not the prettiest sim on the market, but if you are truly looking for a motorsports sim, then this probably isn't a priority for you. But because the graphics aren't there, that means more processing power can be focused on physics (where it is paramount for a sim)\n\nGameplay, it's a steep learning curve. It starts off simple with Fixed series early on, but the setups get detailed quickly. Each car handles specifically, and it takes some serious seat time to be competitive. You will want to put in several hours of practice before your first race. For the best experience a mounted wheel and pedal setup is ideal (approx. $350-$500+ setup providing on the equipment you get and if you build your base to mount your equipment. There are several How-To guides available to us as guides for building your rig. However you can get by with a wheel stand, or just mount the wheel to your desk and have the pedals against the wall.  You can use a controller or Keyboard/Mouse, but it will limit how far you will go, because these mediums do not allow the precision required to drive some of the higher powered cars.  The cheepest route is buy a hybrid wheel/controller (ie Microsoft Speed Wheel)  The MS Speed Wheel requires the XBOX 360 Dongle for PC to work, but will give the best option for someone not ready or able to get their wheel/pedal set in the beginning.\n\nPhysics, can be summed in two words, NOT FORGIVING! this isn't like the Sim-Lite, or Psuedo Sims, where you can make mistakes and easily recover. Mistakes can be costly (even end your race, if it's bad enough)  RaceRoom Racing Experience is pretty close in terms of how unforgiving iRacing is for mistakes, if you want to get a general idea.\n\nCommunity is the one area there isn't one competitor has yet to truly compete. iRacing has some of the nicest, helpful, well mannered, and mature drivers overall out there. The ages range widely, and most are dedicated to a few disciplines. The iRacing Forum (only open to members of the iRacing service) is a wealth of knowledge, with shared setups, tips, hints, and other helpful advice. There is a place within the service for League Racing outside of Official iRacing Series.\n\nBut the community thrives because at it's foundation is the iRating and Safety Rating. A driver's iRacing is a numeric value of your skill as a driver (max is 10,000 iR) This is what the iRacing Service uses to match you with other drivers with a similar skill level.  The Second, Safety Rating, is how clean you drive. So if you put tires off track, spin out, hit a wall, or another driver, you gain 'incident points'. Each incident point counts against your Safety Rating. Each event has a maximum allowed incident points per driver. Typically it's 17x (or 17 incident points) . If a driver gains the maximum allowed incident points, they are disqualified from the race and removed from the track.  So those drivers you have to deal with who constantly wreck others? they are typically Disqualified.\n\nThe other factor Safety Rating has, is it determines what series you are eligible for. Safety Rating Class License are as follows: Rookie, D, C, B, A, Pro.  For example, to run in the GT3 Series, you have to hold and maintain a B-Class License.   Yes Maintain. Outside of Rookie and D Class License, you can lose your License Class, if you drive recklessly enough.  It's not a perfect system, but it's far superior than what is offered by other programs on the market.\n\nIn closing, IF you are looking for a Simulation First Service, which takes a time investment to be fast (like in real life) loaded with other like minded individuals. And a service which provides matched racing to YOUR skill level, iRacing is for you. Just keep in mind, there is NO Single Player career experience.  Many on the iRacing Service use Psuedo Sims or Sim-Lite games for this activity.  However if you want to just jump in a variety of different cars and race all over the place and run quick with minimal time in practice, this is probably not the direction for you.\n\nI hope you find this review helpful in determining if iRacing is for you.","May 13, 2015","true","767.5"," 106 of 123 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","106","123","4","6"

Each season is 12 weeks long with 1 intermittent week between each season. Throughout a season, the tracks being raced change every week. The way race sessions work is on scheduled times. So let's say you want to race in the 4:00pm MX-5 Cup race. You register for that race anytime before 4:00pm and either join the pre-race practice or just join the race session when it starts at 4:00pm. Simple as that.\n\nDepending on the car you want to race, there are mutliple series to choose from. Your license class determines what series you can participate in. Your iRating determines the split you are put in to keep the competition even. Some series are for fun and do not count against your iRating or safety rating. You can join open practice sessions at any time where safety rating is not in effect.\n\nTHOUGHTS\nI have been a part of the iRacing service for 4+ years now. I was never really into any racing games prior to that nor ever cared to watch anything of the like on TV either. I was more into the CS competetive scene and just other FPS games in general. Shortly after trying iRacing I was hooked and got into watching F1, WEC, IMSA, V8S, BTCC etc. I never realized how exhilarating wheel-to-wheel racing could be. iRacing is hands down one of the most competetive video games I have ever played. There quite simply is nothing like it in comparison.\n\nI love absolutely everything about this game. It is constantly improving and it is the only racing game with fully sanctioned online championships and series. It costs a subscription fee and requires you to purchase new cars and tracks if you want to race in the more advanced series, or you can just pay the subscription fee and only race using the base content. Provided you race the majority of a season in any series that is D license or higher, you can receive in-game credit to use towards cars, tracks, and your subscription fee.\n\nI joined a rental kart league in real life after about a year of being on iRacing and in my first season I placed 4th out of 39 people whom most of which had much more experience than me in real life motor racing. I owe it to iRacing for teaching me certain skills that I was able to transfer over to a real life scenario. If you have a wheel and pedals, please just do yourself a favor and give the game a try. If you don't, then consider buying some if you're looking for a different form of competetive gaming. Look for promo deals online if you don't want to pay the Steam price. There are places where you can get 3-month subscriptions for $5 or sometimes even free trials. You can link any iRacing account to any Steam account.

Whoever is reading this, I know what your biggest concern is you think iracing is too expensive. But hear me out I subscribe on cristmas for $49 per year, during this year there are 4 seasons, in each season you can earn $10 by just participating in championships, you also get $5 anniversary credits, that leaves you at a price of $4 per year. This might seem as squeezing pennies from you but it is done because the iracing system works better the more regular participation there is. You might also need to buy a few tracks and cars but how is that different than paying $50 every year for the same F1 game from codemasters for example. The only difference is codemasters charge you every year for the same crappy content while in iracing they release new content every 3 months and it is bloody awesome - laser scanned tracks and cars. It may not have the flashiest graphics effects but the laser scanning ensures that now you can feel every little bump and see every little detail of the track. The cars are build with real life data and every single one of them feels different to drive.\n\nAnd the content is not even the best part of iracing - it is the one of a kind multiplayer system. This is the only place where you can have close, clean racing with random strangers. The racing courtesy is close if not better than in league racing thanks to the safety rating and the protesting systems. And while in league racing you can have a race each week, in iracing there are races all the time and in all kinds of series - oval, open wheel, gt, vintage etc.\nCurrently there are about 40 different series separated in 6 license levels - rookie, D, C, B, A and pro. Everything in rookie license is free and comes with the basic subscription. You don't need to worry about buying cars or tracks until you upgrade your license. To upgrade it, you need to be a safe driver i.e. not participate in many incidents. Each type of incident has a different weight. Going off track is worth 1 incident point, losing control=2inc. points, heavy contact with a track object=2inc points, heavy contact with another car=4inc points, the light contact with cars and objects are worth 0 inc points. Every next license level has a steeper requirements for the amount of incidents you can score. If this system is not enough to keep the races clean you can also protest any deliberate wrecking, blocking or cheating to the racing steward who can give out punishments.","March 6, 2015","true","286.9"," 87 of 114 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","87","114","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baumkindsounds/recommended/266410/","baumkindsounds","Kawa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baumkindsounds/","148 products in account","I started iRacing about a year ago. I was always into racing, but never could afford a decent wheel/pedal setup.\n\nI found out about iRacing right before my birthday and the idea of fair internet racing fascinated me... so i built myself a rig and jumped into the world of online racing. Ill sum up some of my expiriences with the simulation in this review, trying to give you some insight on how your view will change when you get better and better.\n\n\nPrior racing games/simulations:\n\nI've been driving the oldschool NFS titles (the old Hot Pursuit and so on) and some F1 titles, but always with a game pad so i had no prior wheel expirience approaching iRacing (hell, i didnt even have a driving license at that time).\n\n\nMy first weeks at iRacing:\n\nI started out with the Mazda MX5 which is free from the beginning and got right into the frey. I started a privat test session and drove a few laps, quickly realising this was not comparable to anything i had ever driven before.\nI immediatly learned that you have to invest time in iRacing to become save and good enough to drive on a racetrack with others. And thats before you even think about doing competetive laptimes.\nWhile this is a starting obstacle you have to overcome it is also deeply satisfying to finally get into your first race after proper training. I started out of the pits and propably was driving on my own at the back of the field, but i did my first race and the feeling when crossing the finish line unharmed was absolutley great.\n\nI went on to practised on and quickly climbed through the license levels. Getting from Rookie to a D license was my first big acomplishment and i was proud as f***. :P\n\nAn important note about license levels: They are not about how fast you are, they are about how save you are! That is a huge difference. I'd rather have a slower driver in the field, who has his car under control instead of a guy who is quick as hell, but will most likely crash after 5 laps. If you just keep your nose out of trouble and work on your driving skills, advancing from Rookie to an A class driver is not that hard.\n\nMy driving expirience now (about 10 months after my initial start - by now i am using an Oculus Rift DK2):\n\nI am having an absolute blast. Really. I don't even dare to call iRacing a game anymore, its a racing simulation and it does an incredible job. I am mostly driving the GT3 cars and i actually am quite good at them, being able to drive highly competetive laptimes. I can still get the other cars around the track, but i wont win a race in them.\nPutting my focus on a single car helped me to become a very save and quick driver in the GT3 series. I shifted from the official races to Community leagues and am now mostly racing endurance events with 4hours + racing time with my teammate.\n\nThere are some races where i crash out, there are some races where i get taken out, there are some races where i just hotlap for half an hour because everyone else is either quicker or slower than me. And then i have those amazing 45 minutes battles other drivers which are at my exact pace. And everytime i am in such a race, i have a huge idiotic grin all over my face when im done. Its just such a great feeling when you are driving close to your limits and have a fair battle with someone else. You will litteraly start to shake and sweat and when you are leading a race for the first time you might become so nervous that you drop out of your chair. And it feels great!\n\nEven now i still get nervous at starts of big, important races. When im standing somewhere in the mid-front of a 60 car field at Spa and am waiting for the Safety car to drive us through the warm-up lap i still shake. In my mind i am already racing down the hill towards Eau-Rouge and get crazily excited. I remind myself that ive got a 2 hours race ahead of me and that i only have to survive the start. The engines start spitting... and everything from there on is in my hands.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: Here is a list of what i love about this game and about what is a little bit annoying.\n\nPro:\n\n+ Great physics, really fun to drive\n+ Good graphics (and they will become even better)\n+ Friendly Community on the Road side, i dont know much about Ovals\n+ Amazing, clean races (yes you will crash at times, but thats racing my friend)\n+ A huge track pool and a lot of cars that feel completly different from each other\n+ An extremly high level of competition at the top\n+ Racing with people that have your pace, no matter if you are super quick or just having a chilled sunset drive\n+ The amazing feeling that you actually achieved something, when you win your first race after hours of training\n+ In deep setup building (the faster the car, the more options you get)\n+ The game sound (way better than AC imo).\n\nCons:\n- You will have to invest training time to become good, but training is also fun, especially with others on the track!\n- iRacing is not cheap, but in case that you cant afford real live racing, it gets as close as can be.\n- Its adicting.\n\n\nThis review sounds really positive does it? Well, thats because i am absolutley in love with iRacing. I spent 200+ hours in the BMW alone and i am not the quickest guy yet. Time to head back into a practise session, cya folks!","March 14, 2015","true","52.3"," 56 of 68 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","56","68","0","1"

The game updates its physics quite often, but not across all cars at the same time so some cars behave better than others. During loss of grip, the feedback in this game is quite poor, so it's more difficult to counter than other games. I had to use real world scale FOV and headtracking in order to improve this.\n\nIf you really want a super hardcore online racing simulator, I do recommend iRacing. But not through Steam.\n\n(If you want better graphics, just as good if not better physics and laser scanning, but a bit worse online, I highly recommend getting Assetto Corsa instead, which will also save you a lot of money.)","March 17, 2015","false","79.7"," 224 of 343 people (65%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","65","224","343","30","12"

RFactor 2 is a better sim, Assetto Corsa looks prettier, but neither has the quality of racing you'll find on iRacing.\n\nThe Safety Rating system, while not perfect, means that if people drive badly, there is a consequence. This generally keeps people honest, along with a protest system that allows bad drivers to be coached, warned or removed from the service. Meanwhile iRating gives everyone a reason to keep racing, unlike in a typical public server where one often finds that anyone not in a battle for the lead disappears on lap 3. Finally, due to the new car/track combo each week and regular races structure, most series you can get a good race every hour on a track you and your competitors will have practiced on, compared to most public server racing being either a 3-car field on a track you don't know against guys who also don't know it, or everyone racing on Spa in touring cars.\n\nI've had some of the most extraordinarily fun experiences in iRacing, the adrenaline rush beating fellow competitors knowing how hard they work to beat you, knowing that some of them are VERY VERY good (admittedly some aren't), is like nothing else. Sim racing is the best thing you can do with your computer and iRacing is the best place to do it.\n\nIn short, not the best sim, but by far the best racing.","February 27, 2015","true","8.9"," 79 of 110 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","79","110","7","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/devchar96/recommended/266410/","devchar96","Dehvun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/devchar96/","63 products in account","Realistic, competitive, multiplayer racing. It's what other racing sims try to be. Instead of worrying about perfecting an AI, the developers of iRacing have spent their resources creating real tracks down to the smallest change in pavement with 3D laser mapping technology. The effort that goes into their services is astonishing. But in the end, iRacing is hard to look at as a "game." It is a subscription-based simulator service originally based on the engine of NASCAR Racing 2003 Season. If you are looking for a game similar to Need for Speed, Burnout, or even other racing sims, iRacing may not be for you. The subscription model requires you to purchase cars and tracks as you advance your racing license, awarding safe and competitive racing along the way, and this has been a major turn-off to a lot of non-simracers.\n\nSimilarly, you really need a racing wheel to be competitive in this game. Wheels are not cheap. Playing with an Xbox One controller, I can do fine in rookie class, but when I advance to race in sanctioned series within Class D, I struggle greatly to be competitive.\n\nIn a world where your setup means everything, people who play with a wheel/gearbox/pedals simply are at an advantage. And there's no reason to nerf that to compensate for the people who go into this game expecting to dominate with a controller. I am perfectly content to participate with a controller, fully aware that I will probably never win a race. The fun comes from fighting the car to stay off the wall, avoid crashing into your opponents, and run the best line, lap-after-lap, in an attempt to keep it together long enough to see the checkered flag.\n\nFor me, as a huge fan of stock car racing, these aformented things are all things I liked. There are very little things I dislike about iRacing. The tracks and cars are great, the compatibility with controller schemes and layouts are some of the best, the community is excellent (there are a lot of good sports out there), and the game itself feels like real racing. The stock livery editor is decent, and you can expand it infinitely using programs like Paint.NET to customize your own paint scheme. The things I dislike are mainly nitpicks, such as that I wish there were more tracks offered in the rookie class races. I wish there was a larger variety of series available to low-level license holders that use more of the cars and tracks included in the basic membership. But honestly, that's it.\n\nIn the end, iRacing wasn't built for Steam. It was built for racing enthusiasts to go against one another virtually without the risk, cost, and other factors associated with racing in real life. If you aren't a racing enthusiast or a simracer, iRacing is probably not what you're looking for. There's nothing quite like iRacing.\n\nDISCLAIMER: As you probably have guessed, I primarily play iRacing on oval tracks. I have ran on some road courses and most of my review remains relevant, however I can not speak for a lot of tracks or cars that are in the game as I am not investing in advancing my license rank outside of oval series. I'd almost certainly need a wheel to do that.","May 15","true","50.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/divineemu/recommended/266410/","divineemu","Octavarium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/divineemu/","715 products in account","The best motorsport simulation that exists. Period.\n\nBear in mind, I'm not talking about a "game". I'm talking about motorsport. If you are expecting an experience similar to Forza or other games in that sense, you'll be bewildered at what iRacing is offering. iRacing isn't as much a game as it is a motorsport simulation. From licensing to competing in various series, iRacing is more about long-term development as a driver than it is about jumping in and just winning races like you'd do in Forza. You won't win your first race. You porbably won't win a race in your first 30 starts. You're going to have to work at it, and thats what makes iRacing special.\n\nThere's a couple major things you should know;\n\n1) You'll start in a rookie series with other drives learning to drive. It can be chaotic, but focus less on simply getting out of the rookie series and more on improving your driving craft. Over time, you will develop and once you move out of rookies you will feel much more confident in the higher license levels. The driving is more predictable in the higher brackets as well.\n\n2) If you intend on playing the game with a keyboard, or a gamepad for that matter, you are not going to have a good experience at all. You NEED to use a wheel/pedal set. You simply won't be able to properly compete (or enjoy the game for that matter) without a proper setup. Whats the point of immersing yourself in a motorsport simulation without taking that first big step and using a wheel? Trust me, you'll enjoy it so much more.\n\n3) You will be slow. Practice and you'll get better, I promise. As a rookie, you'll only have to master one or two cars, and only a handfull of tracks. MASTER THEM! Once you do this, QUALIFY! If you are finding that there are tons of wrecks all around you and you're getting caught in them, qualifying with a lot of practice will often put you near the front of the pack, and the wrecks will safely happen in your rear-view mirror.\n\n4) Use the forums! Honestly, there are a ton of super helpful people who are willing to help you. Especially when you start to learn about setups and making tweaks to your car. The forums are a HUGE asset.\n\n5) Don't get frustrated! Practice! The results will come.\n\nIf you have any questions about iRacing, don't hesitate to ask by commenting on this review. I will respond and do my best to help you out.","March 14, 2015","true","88.0"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","32","43","2","3"

Iâm not a huge fan of these types of menus, but the devs integrated this very well. Once i was finished figuring out the web interface, i went into a game and was faced with another set-up.

Whilst the graphics are slighty dated in comparison to games such as AC they are still 'very' good on max settings. The only thing you really need to ask yourself when deciding whether to buy this game is....."is your main enjoyment Online Racing?" If the answer is 'yes' then there there is no other game that comes even remotely close to what iracing offers for online competitive racing.\n\nWhen you first start out and race in the rookie series it can seem no better than other online racing games ..a total crash fest, but once you raise your irating so that you're no longer in the lower splits, it becomes real racing.\n\nThe 'Safety Rating', 'Irating' and Points you earn in whatever season chamionship you've entered, all make each race 'mean' something. All stats of your races are saved so that you can review your entire career and see how you 've improved. Save replays of any race or practice session and watch it from the perspective of any other driver.\n\nIf enjoy online racing ...get iracing!! ....end of story! i cannot recommend this game enough for its online competitive racing!\n\nCouple of extra things to note: -\n\n- Check the actual website before buying it through steam, as there may be discounts on the site that are not on steam.\n\n- Although it may initially seem expensive buying cars and tracks there is a discount for bulk purchases, and a couple of times a year there are discounts on subsciption / iracing dollars, which brings the price down quite a bit.\n\n","March 7, 2015","true","82.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

I would not recommend iRacing in its current state.\n\nThe physics are far from great, something that was (okay) in 2009 but to todays standards they are far from good. That said the online pickup racing is probably the only reason worth having iRacing right now, but even with the pickup racing being a plus, the lack of choices to run do to most cars being just about completely undrivable on the Road side, and on the Oval side the only time there is a decent amount of people to race is if you wait until a series is at Daytona or Talladega.\nWhich is a shame because of the sheer amount of laser scanned tracks that are pretty amazing most of the time.\n\nAnd dont get me started on the community, most of them have their heads so far up their own asses they can barely get out of their own way on the track.\n\nPros:\n-Easy pickup racing.\n-Only up to date Sim to race Oval racing at the moment.\n-The web based interface is nice most of the time.\n-Laser Scanned Tracks\n\nCons:\n-Sub-Par Physics.\n-Lack of Offline play, (Nothing at all).\n-Most of their big event crash the servers and then end up getting canceled.\n-The Community\n-Lack of choices in series to race, (do to lack of participation).\n\nAll in all I give it a 4/10 in its curent state as of 3/23/2015","March 22, 2015","false","55.6"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","42","72","2","4"

Some years ago I tried Live For Speed and was hooked on it for several months, I can say that this was my first true simulation experience. In that time I played some NetKar, rFactor, F1 and SimBin games too.\n\nFrom then, my wheel and pedals had been quietly standing in a box. Until I tried out Assetto Corsa recently, which got me instantly hooked.\n\nI progressed in the career, did some hotlapping, the sim is amazing. Then I tried the multiplayer... and well, I was disappointed. In some races I was leading, and near the end some wrecker would take me down smiling. Trying to kick this guys from the server, no one votes, no one cares. No sanctioning whatsoever.\n\nI saw iRacing with a 3 months free promo, and just WOW... this is a completely different story. From the start, from the behaviour of the car you can notice that it is a simulation, and not something made to entertain. And when you figure out the way the races are structured, the licences, the leagues, you forget everything else.\n\nTo progress in the sim you have to BE SAFE, you don't have to be fast. This is a requirement, and surely helps teaching new players how to behave in the track. You start out in the rookie class, and you'll wanna get out of it as soon as possible, since this class acts as a "filter", all the wreckers-who-wanna-win-in-the-first-corner are there. As soon as you progress to D class, the quality of the drivers is noticeable better. You can easily achieve this in 1 or 2 days.\n\nClean racing, fairplay. This is what separates iRacing from the rest.\n\nThe netcode is by far the best I ever tried. All the servers belong to iRacing, so this also helps to deliver the best experience, almost without lags and dissapearing cars.\n\nIn relation to pricing, I probably end up saving money. Instead of buying that random Steam game that eventually I wouldnt even play, the only thing I spend now is on iRacing.\n\nBut in the end, they deserve every penny, because you get quality from the service. In any case, you don't have to buy anything in the beginning. You can progress as you'll like, and stay with the included cars and tracks only. You'll have plenty of time to decide on which career path you wanna follow (open wheel/close wheel, oval/road racing, etc).\n\nThis is a simulator that demands true effort, but it pays back with the best racing moments you'll ever get from a computer.\n\nWarning: Expect to be completely addicted and spending MUCH more time that you've predicted, on this game. You've been warned! :)","July 27, 2015","true","84.3"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","27","44","2","2"

I absolutely love it.\n\nToo expensive, you say? I spend 4$ a year to play iRacing. At this point, I have all the tracks/cars that I need, so my expenses for the future will be my 4$ yearly subscription. If you race 8 races a season in the any of the B/A class races, and 8 in the D/C series, you receive 10$ participation credits a season(4 times a year so $40).With the yearly 5$ anniversary credits and the 49$ yearly subscription sales they have, I get away from it cheaply.\n\nOn to the racing, thats why Im here. I don't have all the time in the world to play because of life, but the time I do get to spend, I don't waste because of the quality of racing in this simulation. The races are set to a certain time schedule so that theres a race almost always about to start. You jump right into a field of racers that are similiar to your skill level. I recently joined a league, which has only increased the experience. The irating and the safety rating systems they have in place make it so people are required to race a certain way, or be punished by the intense drops in safety rating. Which then drops the license class and you wont be able to race the stuff you want to race.\n\nI joined iRacing because of road racing. I wasn't an oval fan before iRacing, but now I'm completely in love. I used to think there was nothing to oval racing, and even described NASCAR as an "adult male soap opera. Left turn, left turn."  The actual difficulty of pack racing around a superspeedway cleanly, the difference that .5 degrees of negative Caster on your front left tire has on your tire wear over a 15 lap run at Dover, the effect a 0x tail whip into the wall actually makes on your lap times,(I literally could just continue to go)  and the overall utter enjoyment of what Im doing has made me appreciate oval racing a bit more. Any type of racing you want to do, its here.\n\nA wheel is a must, in my opinion. I started with a g27, have since upgraded to a t500rs with shifter. This sim has made me make the change to triple monitors, which I suggest to every video gamer because it has improved the experience almost all of the games I play.\n\nIf your not sure you should try this, look around for a promo code. Theres typically a promo code for 3 months for $5, or cheaper. But take it from me, if you don't want to give up every video game you've purchased on Steam because of a racing service you found online, then don't even bother trying iRacing, because it'll hook you!!","August 30, 2015","true","847.2"," 52 of 92 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","52","92","5","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/00donkey/recommended/266410/","00donkey","00Donkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/00donkey/","183 products in account","DONT EVEN CALL IT A GAME!\n\nBecause it's not, This is a Tool for training how to drive REAL race cars at fast speeds! Profesional drivers use iRacing, to LEARN a race track that they may have never been to in real life yet, weeks in advance of traveling there in real life! Dale Earnhardt Jr. is one of those professional Drivers who has Attested to having done exactly that! iRacing is so accurate to real life, that the same Cracks, Bumps and Grooves that are in the pavement that you can see on T.V.  and see in the famous Indianapolis Raceway, Are there in iRacing IN EXACT DETAIL down to the MILIMETER! They use Laser Scanning to make an IDENTICAL COPY of the real track! So tracks that maybe have small Banking on a 90 degree turn in real life, you might race that same track in Forza or Asseto Corsa, and be forced to take that turn WAY SLOWER than in real life thus negatively affecting your lap times, and you cannot compare your lap times in whatever car you just drove on that track to the professionals who drive that track in that identical car in real life!  Whereas with iRacing you can take a lap time at say Daytona Speedway in an Actual GEN-6 NASCAR RaceCar or Indy Car, and then Compare it to ANY Real Nascar or INDY driver's REAL Qualifying TIME on that track in that same car in real life to see how you stack up! NO OTHER RACING GAME HERE ON STEAM CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM and truely back it up, time after time...on track after track!\nSo i say again, Dont go thinking this is a "GAME" because this.... if anything, is a way for you to develop real life skills that you could take into a real life race car and start a racing career with. (if you dont believe it, look up iRacings World champions, Many of them have done exactly that, and used iRacing as a launchng point for their real life racing career's!\n\nSo basically, if you like Arcade style racing games but dont like watching competitive MotorSports in real life, Wishing you could be the guy or girl driving that car at 200 plus miles an hour,.....Then iRacing may not be for you. And the reason i say this is, in iRacing there is no Rewinding time if you hit a wall or something, theres no buying PARTS UPGRADES, theres no cheat codes or "TURBO BOOST BUTTON", And if you dont have a steering wheel and aren't prepared to race the way a REAL driver would race, then you will seriously be having a hard time with it when you rise out of your Rookie License's in both Road and Oval Racing! (Although every once in a while people on X-Box controlers can do QUITE decently, BUT, it takes A LOT LONGER to get good at mastering an X-box's Joystick to get through a particular turn's "Apex" without missing a beat, And to be comepletely honest here....Most of the people i've talked to who started out on X-Box Controllers like that, IMMEDIATELY went and bought a steering wheel and pedals!Which despite being a bit of an Investment, you need to remember you're investing in Real Life skills you can use Every day to drive safer, OR Even take these skills into a real Race car in real life! So is that worth a few hundred dollars?...You BET IT IS!)\n\n\nOne thing i learned EARLY ON in my still very young iRacing Career, which was something SO OBVIOUS, i completely "FACEPALMED" myself once i truely REALIZED that i was so Naive' to believe it!....And this was how i've been SubConciously TRAINED over the years without realizing it, that all these Movies and "arcade style" racing games make you think that you can just FLOOR the gas pedal through a wreck, and things like touching a wall with the front fender does no damage to the car, or, driving alongside another car and you bump his Left Rear Fender, and nothing happens whereas in real life the wreck that you would cause Could be catastrophic to ALL cars involved!, And in those games and movies you catch the competition pretty fast if you fall behind because they have "catch up speed" toggle-able! Or if theres a wreck up ahead you can just Floor the gas pedal and push the other cars out of your way!....\n\nAnd in iracing NONE OF THAT IS TRUE! This is REAL DEAL, REAL LIFE RACING AGAINST REAL DRIVERS (Some of whom Race on weekends at their Local Track in Real life, and have Years of Training over your skills!) And you must Drive as competitively as you can WITHOUT  making contact with other cars & walls as best you can! Touch a wall and spin out and cause  damage to your car? If that happens you can't just expect to pull a manuever like when playing  "NEED FOR SPEED" and pull back out, onto the track and race right back up to first place!\n\nYour damage has REAL AFFECTS on your engine performance, Wheel alignment, and Aerodynamics! If all of that car isn't in pristine condition, you are SEVERELY HINDERING yourself! And in most cases a pit-in or Towing all the way back into the pits is necessary, and just be prepared that in "ROOKIES" you will see it happen multiple times per race where someone will spin, cause a wreck with another car, and then get back and keep going, not realizing that the now damaged car they are driving is slower and now a danger to others as they try to pass that damaged car at high speed!\n\nNow as for Pricing: There are those who complain about the price, but the prices they charge AREN'T to line their pockets with money like these $60 dollar a game, Arcade Style Racing games! When iracing Charges you THE MINIMUM PRICE THAT THEY CAN, Give you A BUNCH OF FREE CONTENT WITH YOUR FIRST PURCHASE of the service, And EVEN Allow your Races to contribute to your "Store Credit"!! They do all of that, Just so after you pay about $40. Dollars to get started with iRacing, you have pretty much all the tracks and Cars you need to compete for a few months without having to pay anything else! But when iRacing charges me. $11.95 for a car that i want to race that season $14.95 for a track, i HAPPILY pay that because iRacing is setup to charge each driver the MINIMUM it can in order for our purchases of those cars and tracks to fund the development of FUTURE TRACKS AND CARS!\n\nSo imagine Like me you live on a Disability income and since like me you live near Laguna Seca (Or whatever Real life track near you, that you wished you could've Competed at!), you've wished your whole life you could get into Racing Profesionally, But Like me, Despite your parents WANTING to get you into the sport, couldn't afford it for you when you were young...\n\nNow picture for Roughly $40 bucks and the Price of a Decent Steering wheel and pedal setup, i can take a Porsche out on that track and finally LIVE THAT DREAM! And finally, for MUCH CHEAPER than it costs to drive a REAL RaceCar, i can Learn, and study from Professional Drivers! I can even Race AGAINST REAL PRO's IF  I KEEP practicing and get good enough! About a year ago a 17yr old Kid who won the Iracing Championship NASCAR series is now Announced plans to get into racing in Real life! And he's only been Racing in iRacing for 5 or 6 years! And it shows that this isnt some "GAME" to go play to unwind, This is a severely competitive Adrenaline rush inducing Simulation of the REAL THING!\n\n\nIn Closing, the rule of thumb you can apply to both real life racing and iRacing is that much like Real life Racing the Competitive level is REAL! NO OTHER RACING GAME OR ANY VIDEO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED, has EVER truely given me "BUTTERFLIES" just from the level of sheer excitement you get in a rolling start before that green flag drops!  Especially since you are being given the  opportunity to drive against people who are just as fast, or if not faster than you are!\n\nNo other Racing Game or Even Regular Computer Game has EVER been able to TRUELY provide that "BUTTERFLIES IN THE STOMACH" Feeling to drivers and gamers alike! Not in the way that iRacing does! And i can attest to it, having nearly 200 steam Games, that Despite it being a bold statement it is 100% TRUE!","March 26, 2015","true","182.9"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","22","36","8","0"

Everyone has to use thier real names, giving a sense of accountability for each person.\n\nDriving/Physics\nThe physics teach you how to properly drive a race car. Asseto Corsa and Project Cars offer a simulation-esque physics engine but allow you to get away with certain maneuvers which would never work in the real world or iRacing. iRacing forces you to learn to do things right.\n\nThe number of real life opportunities that have been opened up because of iRacing is a testement to how it prepares us as race car drivers. See MX5 challenge, NASCAR Peack Challenge, Greggor Huttu getting to test a star mazda car, michael conti getting to test a NASCAR car after winning the world championship. The list goes on...\n\nRacing/Competition\nThis is the #1 thing that sets iRacing apart from all other sims on the market. The racing & competition is unmatched. If you want close, clean, hard racing, you will get it here at any level. From Rookie MX5 to F1 or street stocks to Gen6 NASCAR. The racing is amazing at all levels as long as you have worked your way out of the bottom splits & shown you are a competent driver.\n\nSetting yourself personal goals and working towards them is really the purpose of iRacing. Theres always someone better then you which gives you motivation to work harder.\n\nSpecial Events\nThe special events with thousands of drivers all competing at the same time across 20 or 30 splits is unique in the online sim racing world. Getting to race a proper 24 hour Team event was one of the best experiences Ive ever had sim racing and i'm a primary oval racer. Having the presssue of taking over the car from your teammate and trying not to wreck out is something so incredible.\n\nConsWebsite\nThe current website is clunky and not intutive for new users. Take the time to poke around and see where everything is and how everything works. The good news is that the website in its current form is in its last days. iRacing staff is well aware that its old and need of refresh and is actively rebuilding it from the ground up. This new Website is due out sometime this year along with a refreshed Sim UI. So things should be better in the near future.\n\nCost\nYes, the costs CAN be high. They dont need to be though. If you plan your purchases and take advantage of the twice a year 50% off deals, you can make it very affordable.\n\nI decided to think of iRacing as a hobby rather than a video game. When looked at from this perspective, its a very very affordable hobby compared to real racing or golf for example. Ive spent far more on my golf hobby than I have on iRacing in the last 3 years. So its money well spent knowing iRacing as a business is in it for the long haul and they plan on being around for many years to come.\n\nIf your on a tight budget, plenty of fun can be had from the base subscription content & rookie series. You can stay racing in those series forever if you wish to not spend a dime on any DLC content.\n\nGraphics/Atmosphere\nThis is one area that iRacing could use some improvements. They just released a beta build of their DX11 engine which sets the foundation for newer, better graphics. The tracks are 100% laser scanned accurate but most seem very bare outside of the walls. Luckily you dont notice it much when your in the heat of the battle so its not a big deal. It will be nice to see some more life added outside of the ropes in the future.\n\nIf you have the computer power to max the graphics right now, it looks pretty stunning but if your forced to turn things down, the graphics fidelity falls off pretty significantly giving it a pretty dated look.\n\nDay/Night transitions are missing but are one of the top priorities now that DX11 has been implemented. Fingers crossed that we see it before 2017 to make the 24.\n\nSummaryHighly recommended if you are a race fan or serious about true sim racing.","March 16","true","8.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

Iâm a fairly fit guy, I work out a lot and ride mountain bikes in my spare time. I once, for fun, had my pulse watch monitoring my heart rate during a race and it peaked at 137 bpm! That is a lot, it is actually insanely high. For comparison, I was riding my mountain bike out in the woods for a couple of hours with an average heart rate of 169 bpm.\nIf you find ANY game that beats this level of excitement and adrenaline please tell me, I NEED to try it!\nNow about the sim itself. The racing is close, I run the Blancpain Sprint Series which is a GT3 racing series. You might have heard that name before. That is because it is an officially licensed racing series that, also runs in the real world. That series adds to the list of Indycars and NASCAR and perhaps more, those are the two I can remember off the top of my head. That is cool. So the actual racing comes as close to real life as you can get in front of a computer (for now).\nSome critics of the game say the physics arenât right, and a couple of years back it was nicknamed âIceRacingâ.  I never agreed. I would like to know what qualifies those critics to actually comment on that. I bet only very few people have actually driven the real life counterparts to the cars in iRacing. iRacing updates every 12th week, some large and some small updates, to keep their physics top notch. Which is one of the reasons it is so expensive. Another is the officially licensed tracks and cars.\nAs I said people will crash you, but it is often avoidable if youâre smart. I avoid many accidents and have a good safety rating. So if you instead of think âThat f**king â¥â¥â¥â¥, what an idiotâ try to focus on what you couldâve done better to avoid a crash you will see your safety rating improve and you wonât crash as much. Iâve never seen anyone intentionally wreck anyone â but I have seen some stupid passing attempts go horribly, horribly wrong.\n\nThat is what I have to say about iRacing. It is a fantastic game! Get it!\nI only wish it was less time consuming!","March 26, 2015","true","114.5"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

Heavy investment is required to have the full experience in the form of a racing wheel and pedal set with force feedback.

I just took part in a 24 hour race with driver swaps and teammates from all over the world. Amazing experience.\n\nYou will have an irating that will aim to group you with other drivers of your ability and a safety rating that helps to ensure that safe and clean driving is promoted.

If you want a game to play with AI, or if you want to plug in an XBox controller and just bash and bang your car around a track non-stop, then this is not for you.\n\nBut if you want "as real as it gets" racing against real opponents, in laser-scanned as real as it gets tracks and cars? Then this is not at all perfect but there's just no better option than this. Not even close. There never was, there is not at the moment, and it doesn't look like anyone will get any close any time soon.\n\nTo me the choice to recommend it is easy. Firstly, because I can't stand racing against AI. This is partially because no AI is actually realistic enough, and partially because -- to me -- racing is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. There's no feeling like cracking your opponent under pressure, forcing her into a mistake, etc. This, to me, is the pinnacle of racing and it's something that is not even on the table when racing against AI.\n\nAnd secondly, because of the race organization and availability. I've been in numerous leagues that used numerous sims throughout the years. I've given up on leagues because there were always too many problems with rules, crashes, track cutting, you name it. For a league to be good, it had to stay small. If it stayed small, there weren't enough races.\n\nFrom my days in rFactor, countless leagues even migrated to iRacing. So in iRacing you get the best of both worlds, open/pick-up racing and leagues, around the clock 7 days a week.\n\nAbout cost\nIs it expensive? Yes. Although you can spend as much or as little as you'd like, and with the right mindset you can bring the subscription down to $4 a year. Yes, a year. If you think that is expensive, then this is really not for you either.\n\nAlso, one thing about this is longevity. Are you into fads that will fade in a couple of months? Do you pay $50 for the latest AAA title that will be part of history in less than a year?\n\niRacing has been around for some 7+ years and it's only growing stronger. Yes, you may spend a few hundred bucks on content if you wish. But you spend only once and that content will still be around in 5 or 10 years time. You don't pay for updates, big or small -- and iRacing is updated at least every 4 months. So the difference when it comes to iRacing's content (cars and tracks) is that (if you even want to) you'll spend that "up front". But once you do, that content is licensed to you for good. The longer you stay in iRacing, the cheaper it gets. If in 5 years you divide your expenses by 5*12 you'll see that the monthly cost is, in the end, not that much at all.\n\nIf you think it through it's pricey, yes, but can hardly be called "expensive" for what it is. Of course it can be expensive if "what it is" is not what you want, which is legit. In this case, go back to the first paragraph of this review.\n\nPros and cons\nI give iRacing a 7.5/10, really. I'm almost giving it an 8, but not quite. The main cons are probably the bad web interface that takes a while to get used to (although when you do it's ok and fairly functional) and the lack of proper information about the series and race (which is either part of the UI problem or compounded by it). The random racing weather (that should be "realistic" but it isn't) and the lack of day/night transitions (or even of a moving sun at all) could also be mentioned as cons.\n\nPhysics could have been seen as a problem a few seasons ago but updates have been constant and in the right direction. In the last year or so, all cars got more connected to the tarmac, more forgiving, easier to catch in a slide, etc. Also important to mention are the dynamic track updates (rubbering in, marbles, track temp, dirt/grass), the new visual effects (pebbles, grass blades) and revamped sound (which is still missing a lot, but again it's going in the right direction).\n\nHowever when it comes to online racing, online competition, matchmaking, pickup online racing, and anything that involves online virtual motorsports, the closest competitor is around a 4/10 at best. The best you can do then is race with mods, on non-laser-scanned tracks, on guesswork-built cars, and on a league that in all likelyhood only offers one race a week. That, compared to what iRacing offers, is just sad.\n\nPS:(if I can give you a tip though, don't buy iRacing through Steam. Go to iRacing's website and buy/subscribe there. You can still link your Steam account later, like I did, and use all functionality, overlay, etc. Trust me, you'll thank me later)","December 18, 2015","true","319.3"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","19","34","0","1"

I wish Steam would show my real hours in this sim. We are talking about 1000âs. I joined early 2009 and even I thought this is good, it wasnât my thing at the moment. Learning curve was really steep because I didnât know how to drive a race car. Rare are those who do. I was too stubborn to admit it and seek for help, yet there was a huge community to offer it if I wouldâve just asked.\nBut the worst thing was the pressure when racing. I could not take the adrenaline rush which was overwhelming. I seriously thought Iâm going to have a heart attack, and Iâm not alone with this one. No matter how well I did in practice, my hands and feet were shaking so much in race that I couldnât drive properly. If you spin or drive out of the track, nobody waits for you. If you crash, your race is done. And races arenât just 3 lap sprints, but even at the Rookie level they last for 20 minutes. You have to stay focused for the whole time, and then you should be fast also. It was too much for me and I quit.\n\nI went back to other titles, of which Iâve driven almost all since late 80âs. But I found out that they gave nothing to me anymore. There was simply no thrill in any of them. Racing or other. I felt like Iâm totally numb. After a period of time, I renewed my subscription to iRacing and thatâs been a big part of my life ever since. Now I need that thrill and I need that adrenaline rush.\n\nIracing can bite you hard sometimes. Frustration can be off the scale. But on the other hand the success feels so good youâd like to laugh and cry at the same time. I canât think of any other game that gives one so much satisfaction.\nIracing should not be approached like a game, and not because of the age old âitâs a sim, not a gameâ argument. But because itâs a hobby. Itâs not a game you play through, or even a sim-like game you play over and over again like Civ, until next version comes out. You can never play it through and it never repeats itself any more than real racing. And not like many racing games out there, youâre not buying a new version anytime soon. Major updates come 4 times a year, and iRacing is planned to be there at least next ten years. This was just recently confirmed.\n\nOne can argue over individual aspects of iRacing vs. other sims. And many times other sims win these arguments. But as a whole picture, in all that comes into one single service (and thatâs what iRacing is â a service) iRacing is without a slightest doubt the king of the hill. I do, from the bottom of my heart, wish there was some other sim that was better than iRacing. I would buy it in a heartbeat. But there isnât. So for now Iâm going with the best one out there.\n\nOne thing is astonishing about iRacing, and itâs the fact it does the open lobby gaming better than any other online game or sim out there. That is something anyone has hard time to prove wrong. And since we are talking about an online sim, that is its strongest point. Another thing is the community side. It takes quite some time to understand how strong and wide-ranging it is.\n\nIâm not going into actual âgame mechanicsâ here, since I donât want to get into frustrating arguments over people who donât take time setup their gear properly and donât understand the iRacingâs long-term development plan.\nIf you decide to give it a go, be darn sure to go to the forums and ask guys how to set up your system by telling what hardware you got. Someone will reply within 15 minutes. And then, have fun.\n","March 23, 2015","true","48.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Simwise, best thing you have out there.\n\nEddit:\n\nonly, and ONLY get this game if you're willing to dish out a LOT of money for it. I'll give you an example: For a 3 months subscription you will have to pay 30$ without discount (if you check reddit there might be some promotional codes, I got a 3 months sub for 5, but that's for new members only). Now, in rookie events you pretty much have most of the content available. After 3 days of playing I got my D license and was thinking of doing Touring Car Series. However, for those I need 9 more tracks out of 12 to participate in every race. Now, a track costs 14.95, if you buy in bulk you get a discount (cba to look it up) but it's still a lot of money, for 9 tracks you'll have to pay a one time price of 120-something dollars. And that's not even all of them, in total you can easily dish out 1.5k dollars for most of the content (yes, most, not all) and you still have to pay a subscription cost. Unless you have bags of money lying around or want to participate in something else but rookie races (where most drivers are incomptetent, just to get out of rookie classes is started doing bad qual laps and just drive at my own pace cause 50% drivers would crash and take out others with them), look somewhere else for a better deal like Assetto Corsa or rFactor.\n\nI'm still leaving a positive review cause tyre physics are great and it has cool details to the game such as tyre deterioration (leaves marbles all over the track) and racing itself feels damn good too.","March 24","true","7.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

It is great not only on the physics aspect, but on the community too. The monthly fee you pay is for the service, the uncontable different racing categories in the game, having someone that organizes that for you, the official sanctioned series and the access to the racing servers and forums.\nThe downside is that the game can become really expensive. After you get to class D (which doesn't take long) you need to buy cars and tracks that cost about u$12 each if you want to run in different series. The subscription is for the service, the cars and tracks you will need to buy. Not to mention a wheel and pedals if you want to have a real sim racing experience.\nI recommend the game, I think everyday of getting back to it, but I live outside the US and the $$ is somewhat unaffordable for me right now.\nIf you like racing and have the necessary $$...

Every race is online, with real people using real names behind the wheel. This means there's accountability for your actions. Drivers practice for hours on the track just to do one race, so nobody falls behind the field and due to the ranking systems of Safety Rating and iRating, you'll never see a bad driver again. You have to work your way to racing the best cars.\n\nI mostly enjoy racing the NASCAR iRacing Series (half length weekly NASCAR Sprint Cup races) with their 32-car fields.

There are others out there that can match or exceed iRacing in certain elements (Graphically, iRacing is not ahead of the game, but is not trailing all that far behind either). However, the arrival of DirectX 11 has been imminent for some time now, and will take care of that.\n\niRacing is a community. You only have to visit the forums to see how far everyone goes to help each other out. There is a steep learning curve to this sim, and the community have shown time and again that they will help the newbies out.\n\nIn terms of the quality of racing, this sim is unrivalled. Racers are grouped into races according to their skill level allowing for close racing that is the cleanest I've seen in any racing game or sim. People understand that they can't just divebomb into a corner and shuffle other cars off the road. In many ways you will find iRacing to be cleaner than real racing!\n\nThere is plenty of scope for personal progression too. The two most prominent rating systems are your iRating, which is influenced by your race results, and your Safety rating, influenced by your incidents per corner over a race. Balancing these two can be challenging, as no one wants to give away position, but if you're aiming to raise your licence level (done by improving your safety rating), then playing the smart game might be the order of the day.\n\nNow, iRacing is not free; far from free in fact. Additional tracks and cars will have to be individually bought, on top of the subscription fee that applies. But the trick is to not think of this as a game where you feel you have to purchase all the "DLC". There are cars and track that I'm sure I will never buy, and this is because once you've found a car and/or series you are happy with, you'll want to spend a LOT of time practicing and competing there. You really don't want to be racing in multiple cars/series' in the same season. It's not a pick up and play sim, you'll want to research what each series has to offer (the forums are amazing for this), you'll eventually need to look into the basics of mechanical tuning, and you'll need to spend a lot of time in one car to really get dialled in. The competition level here is high and you can expect that other drivers in your race will have put some time to practice a track in.\n\niRacing will draw you into racing like no other sim can. I've found myself buying books on racecraft, mechanics and god knows what else since discovering this sim. So, on the strength of what I have experienced since I joined last August, I can do nothing but highly recommend iRacing to anyone who is willing to put the time and effort into racing copmetitively.","March 14, 2015","true","71.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

You can even look at my library: I own Assetto Corsa, pCars, rFactor 2, some Grid games, etc. I've played all the Forza and GT games.\n\niRacing is a tier of it's own. It's an amazing online experience with an in-depth career: Your own. It doesn't use fancy gimmicks to create a career mode, it doesn't have a lot of silly nonsense like vehicle upgrades. Just pure motorsports. It has in-depth garage menu, allowing for a large amount of customization with your vehicles, and replicates almost all the features you would expect in the cars.\n\nBut the biggest feature it offers is it's amazing community and online racing experience. Due to how the rule structures are set, iRacing boasts one of the best online communities in terms of Admin/Player interactions, as well as how serious people will race together. I have had some of the closest races in my life in iRacing.\n\nDo I think it's the only racing game anyone should play? No. There are other games with many other features, like rFactor 2's amazing Real Road feature, but iRacing is the only multiplayer experience most people need.\n\n\nSome Pro's and Con's\n\nPros:\n-Amazing Online Community\n-Fantastic "Career" implementation. Your stats are permanent, and are kept track through iRating and Safety Rating. You work your way up from rookie series, up into the A class, which can be easy for some, or take forever (like me! Only because I don't race alot)\n-Graphics are spot on. They aren't "fancy" by any means, but they do try to accurately portray every curb, sign, and lamp post. Even going so far and getting the mailboxes at Bathurst modelled. (And a deer stand in a tree)\n-Physics are improving constantly. (Despite how people on the forum argue otherwise)\n-Amazing selection of series and cars, as well as support for many different play styles, such as Controller, wheel, or even TABLET. (Wheel is recommended though)\n\nCons:\n-Pricey compared to other games, cheap compared to real world forms of racing. (Even a decent family Go-Kart track is like $18, so iRacing is cheaper than one race at K1 Speed)\n-When newer versions of a car come out, they require you to pay for them. You keep the old ones, and they offer it at a discount, but this is due to licensing restrictions and based mostly on how many members subscribe.\n-Takes time and practice. Not good for easy pick up and play\n-Confusing web interface. Everything is done on a website. EVERYTHING. It's probably the best one out there, but still confusing for some.\n-Tracks take FOREVER to release. Becuase they're well made. But this leads to issues like Lime Rock not being updated in 3-4 years, because Lime Rock keeps CHANGING THEIR TRACK EVERY 6 MONTHS AND I BLAME LIME ROCK FOR THIS ONE.\n\n\nAnyways, Great sim. I enjoy it. If you don't want to pay a subscription, you can play rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, or ANY OTHER various games. :) But I'd at least say you should give this a try and actually talk to people.

IRacing has the best competitive model, you will never find people crashing with intent, driving backwards on the track, or any of the obnoxious and race breaking situations found on many of the lesser sims. By that I mean it is simply not allowed, and no progression in IRacing is possible if you cannot race cleanly.\n\nOnce you make the jump and commit to IRacing you will find yourself with a minimal amount of cars and tracks available. IRacing has a monthly commitment, as well as in "sim" purchases. *IRacing is not a game*\n\nYou start with minimal access (rookie class) so you can actually learn to race, it is to provide a safety net between new drivers, and experienced ones. If you want to race with the big boys, you will have to prove yourself good enough. This is accomplished through what is called a safety rating. By learning how to race cleanly, you can easily progress through the lisence classes, and race in whatever series you want. It is not advised to jump strait to class A and start in one of those series. But some thought on what you will want to race might be useful, as the financial commitment is pretty high for a single series.\n\nI would advise anyone starting in IRacing to get out of the rookie class as soon as possible. (it is there to weed out bad, and dangerous drivers, not the sort you want to be on track with)\n\n*IRacing is not a game*","March 15, 2015","true","51.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Decent graphics, great FFB, great physics, laser scanned tracks, amazing multiplayer (nothing comes close to the online experience).\n\nI played this title for a while on and off steam, and while I was active it was great. Problem is you need to have plenty of free time (which sadly I no longer have) in order to justify the cost of playing this title. If you have the time for hardcore play then this title is more than worth it. If you are the casual player and cannot adhear to scheduling beyond your control then I would recommend checking it out for a month or two to see how it blends with your real life schedule.\n\nI have nothing negative to say about this title. As many reviewers complain about the costs - it really is not any more expensive than you want it to be. You are not forced to join season championships. But if you are inclined to join such events then you must buy the cars and tracks in order to compete. But in the long run after you bought those you own them even after the events are over.  The quality of these products are of the highest calliber and are quite cheap for what you are getting.\n\nWhether you are the hardcore or casual sim racer I recommend you at least try Iracing - as it is a sim experience like no other.","August 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The tracks are $11.95 - $14.95 and two are $5.00. Two DO NOT BUY EVERY CAR AND TRACK (unless you have the money lying around). Each car needs to be mastered along with every track and each needs its own level of finess along with learning the best line for each track. But the physics and FFB ar just stunning, no other game can rival its FFB.

It's finally time I give it a solid review. First things first, iRacing is NOT your average pick-up-and-play racing game. If you think this you are WRONG. It's a racing simulator, so you need to have the proper equipment.\n\nEssentials for iRacing:\nUSB Steering Wheel and Pedals (Usually bundled together)\nWorking Headset\nShifter (Unless your Wheel comes with Paddle or Gear Shifters)\nA comfortable stationary chair. (There are a lot of races where you are going to be sitting for a while)\n\nIt's possible to see some iRacers on youtube telling you that you need something ludicrous like a triple-screen monitor, or a Force FeedBack Racing Chair system. You Don't. All you need is mentioned above and you'll be ready to race in no time.\n\nSo, now comes the gameplay. How does it fair to the rest?\n\nRacing is very enjoyable in iRacing. The Staff at iRacing really worked hard on making the best and most realistic simulator out there. For example, since iRacing laser scans each track, you'll be able to feel every bump and groove from the actual track. Each car has it's own driving style and you really do have to practice if you want to win races... I know that I've clocked at least 5 hours into this game just practicing Cornering and Turn exiting.\n\nHow's the variety of cars?\n\nThere are plenty of cars for each road and oval courses. Road courses do have more of a selection, but I am very content with Oval's selection. I have raced in both Road and Ovals and the cars relatively drive smoothly. I do tend to lean more towards the Ovals however, coming from a NR2003 Season Background. In total, there is a good enough selection of cars to choose from.\n\nWhich leads me to my final topic, Price.\n\nHow expensive will iRacing get?\n\nIn short, VERY Expensive. Cars cost $11.95 for a one-time fee. Tracks range from $11.95 to $14.95, also one-time fee.\nIf you want everything in the game, (Tracks and Cars (Road and Oval)) This will easily cost somewhere in the thousands for the game alone. But don't be alarmed. iRacing gives you a starter pack with around 5-6 cars. and 10 tracks (Don't Quote me on that but I'm pretty sure those are the numbers.) to start with for your Rookie/D-class stages. You don't have to buy everything in one series to play in that series. For example, Let's say you can buy 1 of the 3 different cars, and 1 track. Whenever the schedule changes to that track, you can then race in that series without buying the whole series itself.\n\nConclusion/TL;DR\n\niRacing is an excellent simulator experience. If you want to race side-by-side against other racers, this is absolutely the game for you. Just keep in mind of the price tag. Be ready to throw down some serious cash if you want to be racing continously in the later stages.\n\n\n","July 2, 2015","true","121.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

But Ive associated the game with Steam just to write this review.\n\nThis should  be easy:\n\n1.- Do you like racing? yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\n2.- Do you want to race against a huge multiplayer community (more than 2000 racers online all the time)? yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\n3.- Do you want to race in a well organized environment where almost every driver is worried about clean racing because if you wreck intentionally you will be kick out of the service for three months or forever? yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\n4.- Do you want to race when you want because there will be always a race active for you to join? (popular races are scheduled to start every hour, also there are private leagues, and hosts) yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\n5.- Do you like Nascar? Do you like road course racing? Do you like F1? Do you like Indycar? Do you like Touring? Do you like GT? yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\n6.- Do you want to race in perfect laser official scanned road courses and ovals? yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\n7.- Do you want to feel and race with the best car physics in the market right now? yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\n8.- Are you a old papyrus fan like me (GPL, NR2003)? yes? so, this simulator is for you\n\nSo,..... What are you waiting for!!?? sign up RIGHT NOW\n\nIm not going to lie to you, this simulator is expensive, you will have to pay a fee (monthly, 6 months or yearly, your choice) and you will have to buy the content that you want for you to complete the seasons past the rookie license, but as soon as you have what you want you will no longer have to spend a dime, because iracing pays you to race, yeah, thats right, you will be earning money, each year you will make 40$ and after the year iracing will give you another 5$ as a gift, so, that 45$ (iracing credits, only for the purchases inside the sim). So, here is the deal: In the summer or in the black friday sale you can renew the service for a year for only 49.99$, so 45$ that you have made minus 49.99$= five bucks, yep, as you can see the simulator is almost free, and trust me, if you like racing like me that price is a good deal because you will not find anything like iracing, this is by far the best simulator on the world, and the multiplayer is the best thing Ive ever seen in my entire gaming life (and Im a old fart), so well organized, lag free and the community is amazing and helpful.\n\nAlso, awnser this simple question again: do you like Nascar? yes? really?, are you a Nascar fan? look no further, this is your house, welcome my fellow Nascar racer, Ive been expecting you, this is the real deal, all the rules, the sponsors, the ovals and road courses, the cars, the trucks, and so much more, all in here in iracing.\n\nOh! and I almost forgot!! this is a ongoing project, new deals are being made with the track owners and cars manufacturers for new content (like lemans and the ring, both coming soon) and they are updating the simulation with new builds regularly (for example, dynamic heat on the track surface).\n\nLook at this as an investment for your happiness, but beware, YOU WILL BE ADDICTED and the races are intense and so real, this is not for the casual gamer, this is some serious stuff, really.","July 11, 2015","true","0.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The one thing I keep hearing from so many Steam user's, "It's too expensive."  Look, I'm telling you now, this is more for the hobbyist who wants to go do the real thing but cannot afford it.  Average local short track entry level car costs about five to six thousand dollars to build, and another 500 to a thousand dollars per year to maintain.  In comparison, iRacing is way cheaper.\n\nIf you do decide to subscribe and run, remember a few things; The system in place is meant to be challenging.  Everyone makes mistakes. Apologies are always welcome.  Race smart, three wide in any car at Texas Motor Speedway in the quadoval is never a good idea. Don't be afraid to lift.  I have seen far too many come in and try to race like this is Gran Turismo, or some other arcade racer.  The whole point is to run competive, clean, and most importantly safe.  Remember, everyone was a rookie once. Patience, perserverance, and lots of practice will get you running in the higher series.  Oh, one more thing I almost forgot, there is always going to be an a-hole in the bunch.  That one guy or gal that just never takes blame and no amount of apologies will suffice.

I couldn't even keep up in the draft.\n\n\nThe review -\n\nExcellent Simulator.\n\nThe "system" can be a little daunting and/or confusing for people who aren't already used to it but here are a few key points...\n\niRacing almost always has a 1yr deal around black friday to add one year to your subscription.  That takes the monthly cost down to less than $5.\n\nEarly on you'll have a Rookie license.  The content that is included with the subscription fee is all you need to run the rookie classes and a lot of what you need to run the Class D series races aside from purchasing a car and generally a couple tracks.  If you purchase three items at a time you get a 10% discount.  This means that after you progress beyond Rookie you'll purchase two tracks and a car or three tracks depending on the series you choose.  You can then run through that season (seasons are 12 weeks) and use your drop weeks to skip the tracks you don't have.  During those weeks you can either practice for next week or jump in another series that runs rookie content for that week to check it out.  After that season you'll buy a couple more tracks and at that point you'll likely have a full season of tracks for most Class D series.\n\nAs far as the graphics...\nA lot of people look at the other sims and see the flashy graphics and special effects and are wowed by that stuff.  I can't say as I blame them :)...  I like Dirt2-3, Dirt Rally, PCars, AC just as much as the next guy...  but those special effects don't happen in real life and in real life the color pallete we see isn't all cartoon like.  Most race sims use VERY over saturated colors.  iRacing doesn't.  It has a much more photo realistic look than other sims.  I prefer that.  Also...  You don't get more accurate car modeling (the mesh) than iRacing.  The cars are laser scanned.  iRacing just switched over to a Physically Based Rendering system.  It's the new hotness.  Star Citizen just moved in that direction too.  They absolutely are keeping up with the jones's when it comes to graphics...  they're just doing it in a different way compared to the cartoon look of other sims.\n\nOn the physics...\nA real complaint that many people have is that the low speed (like less than 15MPH) physics feel a tad wonky when over the limit and that the grip on grass is too low.  They've made HUGE strides on the low speed feel with the latest version of the tire model (V6) and...  to be honest...  I don't generally try to get over the limit at less than about 15MPH and once I'm on the grass I'm more interested in coming up with new swear words to mutter at myself than I am about how realistic my grip level is at that particular point.  The cars are a little difficult to drift (but not impossible with the right setup and a car with good steering lock) but slides and proper levels of racing slip are quite nice to feel/deal with.\n\nThe sound is excellent.\n\nThe FFB is different to many of the other sims out there.  To be honest I'm a little on the fence about this one.  I like the FFB in iRacing.  It's very accurate...  But...  Other sims offer a more usable feeling when the fronts are scrubbing (You're turning the wheel too far) and when the rears break loose (the FFB "releases" a bit) but those effects in other games aren't realistic...  they're over done in order to replace that seat of the pants feel you'd get in those situations in a real race car.  iRacing isn't "bad" in it's front tire scrubbing feedback.  It's realistic.  In a real race car you wheel tension builds and builds as you turn the wheel until the fronts start to slide...  At that point the wheel tension doesn't really fall off much...  it just doesn't build more or it falls of a little.  This is exactly what iracing does.  In other sims the tension falloff is exaggerated.  Sometimes I wish iRacing would do that because it makes it a little easier to drive and maybe a little more fun.  Other sims model the slip angle of the rear tires into the FFB.  This is unrealistic.  It makes the other sims easier to do big slides with...  but it isn't realistic.  iRacing doesn't do this.  Therefor...  Slides are a bit hard to catch until you get pretty decent at it.   Again...  Sometimes I wish iracing would do this too...  but I completely understand why they don't.\n\nThe racing service is TOP NOTCH.  No other sim has anything that even begins to come close to almost touching the racing service.  You can jump on any time day or night and get into a race.  Sometimes there are more people than others but there are always people to race.  The most populated series are the Skip Barber, the Star Mazda, the Mazda MX5, and the BlancPain GT3 series (Ford GT, BMW Z4, McLaren MP412C, RUF RT12 and soon to be the Merc AMG GT3).  I'm not sure which Oval series are the most populated but I believe it's the late model and the Craftsman truck series.\n\niRacing has a Safety Rating and an iRating for each driver.  When you are involved in an incident (No matter who's fault it is) you are given incident points.  iracing chose this "no fault" system because in real racing when you get hit or hit someone the results are the same...  You still have to pay to fix your own damn car no matter who'se fault it is.  This will make your safety rating go down.  This affects your license level.  If you don't keep your license level up (it's not that hard) you CAN NOT race the higher class race series.  This does a SUPERB job of keeping people honest.  That's not to say you'll never get hit by someone.  Far from it.  But if you're interested in clean racing you'll get to the higher license classes and you'll have a GREAT time racing :).  The iRating is a metric that keeps very accurate track of preperation level.  Many feel it's a reflection of skill but that's not quite right.  If someone who is VERY good regularly just jumps into whatever race series they want to without practicing and preparing for that series they'll finish at a certain level.  This will reduce their iRating relative to their potential.  If someone who's mid-pack spends a lot of time preparing they can enter a race and finish far ahead of someone who would be faster with more preparation and end up with a higher iRating.  That said...  The racers with low iRatings tend to be slow and not prep well...  and the people with high iRatings tend to be fast AND prep well.\n\nIt's not too expensive to try it.  Do it.  You'll like it :).  Make sure you poke around on the forums to get your FFB setup correctly for your wheel type.  Don't race in the Rookie class.  Just concentrate on getting your Safety Rating up so you can get into a Class D series as soon as you can.\n\nHere are a few testimonials from some people you may have heard of...\n\nhttp://www.iracing.com/testimonials/","June 10, 2015","true","86.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

In other games, when you crash there's no real consequences. In iRacing, if you crash you lose iRating and Safety Rating. If you crash enough you get demoted and can't drive the series you want to drive. It makes a huge difference in the quality of the racing.\n\niRacing is a bit expensive as you have to buy all the content seperately but if you take advantage of all the deals that are offered, it's not bad at all. Being expensive does have it's bright side that it weeds out most of the crashers. When you're in a race, you can be pretty sure everyone around you is a serious racer, atleast compared to other games. And  I love how every few months there's an update that improves all different aspects of the sim. The sim is constantly evolving with new features added every few months.\n\niRacing is not for everyone though. It has a very steep learning curve. If you're the type that needs instant gratification, then this game is not for you. Be prepared to practice for hours before you can hang with the slower guys. And much much longer before you can safely battle side by side with other drivers. But when you do, it's an amazing feeling. Even fighting for 15th place is great fun when battling with a clean and fair competitor, although fighting for 1st is a bit better, sometimes its impossible as there's some impossibly fast drivers on iRacing.\n\nFor those people that enjoy a challenge and love to push one self to the limit, you have to give iRacing a try. I've been a subscriber for 3 years and I plan on being a subscriber for many more years. Would be nice to have a real competitor to iRacing but I think the market for hardcore racing sims is not big enough to support it.","June 25, 2015","true","321.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

This is by far the closest you'll ever get to racing without actually being in a real car. Nothing else compares. Yes the price will scare you but once you've bought the cars and track you want, you never need to purchase them again. All I pay now is for the subscription and that's it. Just think of guys who spend 60 bucks on Madden every year. To me it's no different. Get your self a G27 and iRacing and you'll have a blast with iRacing.\nFeel free to contact me if you want advice.\n-As far as the actually sim goes. Just know it takes a lot of getting used to if all your used to is arcade style racing life Forza and NASCAR 15. You really have to focus on your techniques and the car around you. Unlike a lot of other games.\n-The lag is pretty much non existent unless you have a horrible connection or you're racing people from around the world.\n-To me this has the best community of members. They have a forum with easy access. You can ask for advice on anything relating to the sim or even life in general believe it or not.\nAbove all, just remember it's a sim, not a standard arcade game. It takes time and focus. But after you get a hang of it, it will become the best sim racing experience you've ever had.","September 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Been playing for a while now. It just keeps getting better. If you're looking for a sim and not interested in arcade style racing, this is for you. Community is real helpful and lots of leagues. One of my favorite features is the safety rating. To get promoted to the next class, you have to race clean. When you hit another car or put a tire off road your safety rating will get dinged. My biggest complaint about online racing is that racers don't race as if it really matters if you crash. The safety rating makes drivers race clean, more or less. I have a whole new found respect for oval track racing now too.","May 10","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I've spent well over $1,200 dollars in iRacing over the years with content and sub fees, Each car costs $11.95 and track $14.95 unless it is an tech track like Long Beach.\n\nOnce or twice a year the subscription will reduce in price to $49 dollars this is the time to obviously resub for the next year, if you race in "offical races" throughout the season in one series you earn credits.. If you race in enough series' you can get enough credits to make the subscription cost I think four or five dollars.   Also, once you buy a certain about of content (all oval, or road) You start to recieve discounts per purchase.\n\niRacing honestly has one of the best multiplayer menus I've ever seen, it's fairly easy to find a race to join and start racing.  I myself only race in leagues and race a couple times a week, it's as simple as finding the right server and entering the password (if it's passworded).\n\niRacing's physics are a constant WIP and to be honest it's missing quite a few things that have been in sim's for the past 10+ years.  Brake fade, parts failures, multiple groove racing, are all non existant in iRacing. Though they are being worked on there is NO reason it shouldn't be in it already after 7+ years on the market.\n\nThe 2nd week of March a new build was released, to be honest it was one of the better builds released in a while but with the goods there are always bads.. iRacing once again tweaked the draft model, while it drives decent in the A car (NASCAR sprint cup cars) the B and C cars (Xfinity and Truck series respectively) are both broke.. The draft model now on super speedways aren't as effective as it should be and if you are the last car in line you will lose the draft, my teammate wasn't even a half of a car lenght behind me and lost the draft which is very unrealistic.\n\nThe good parts of the recent build update was we finally got the new Chevrolet Silverado and Toyota Tundra and Monza.  Both the trucks look great and I haven't been able to try out Monza as of yet.  Also for leagues that like to use "fast repairs" (resets car damage) there is finally an option to uncheck that if you don't want to use it after slight contact.  There also was massive changes to the Sprint Cup car bringing it up to date with the current 2015 Rules package.\n\nWhat I look forward to most is finally getting the next evolution in directX and seeing active race tracks like rFactor 2 has with a live groove.  I also look forward to 24 hour races with day to night transitions and weather that changes throughout the race.\n\nIn summary iRacing is a fun "simulation"  that has very long development times between updating the graphics and physics.  It is unlike your typical game where you pay a set fee and price for content, iRacing WILL be expensive but at the same time it help pays for itself.  I would recommend this to sim racing fans only if you intend on spending quite a bit of money.\n\n\n\n\n","March 13, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I only recently added it on Steam, but after 250 odd starts, both on oval and the road side, I think I'm qualified to write a little review.\n\nSo, what is iRacing about? It's a simulator. A true simulator. There are no arcade options or ways to turn down the difficulty. Once you're in it, there really is no going back.. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nThe cars vary from a stock Mazda MX5 to GT3 cars and an F1 car on the road side, and from a Street Stock to Gen6 Sprint Cup cars on the oval side. What I am saying is that there's definitely a car for you to like and enjoy. It's the same when it comes to tracks. Monza was recently added, and with the Nordschleife somewhere in the pipelines.. Well, you know what that means.\n\nThe community, especially the forums, is also really good. People will willingly share their knowledge and setups if you ask in a nice, polite manner. There have been some issues with rudeness in game, but that is very, very rare.\n\nThere are some drawbacks with iRacing. First off: It's subscription based. The clever thing, though, is that iRacing gives you credit back for both loyalty and for racing in offical series. So if you claim what they want to give you, as well as take advantage of the sales events (around Black Friday, most often), the subscription fee won't be too bad.\n\nSecondly: Cars and tracks have to be bought. I don't mind this, as the work put into cars and tracks is simply staggering. Everything is laser-scanned and perfect down to an inch. It's a small price to pay for hours of fun.\n\n","March 18, 2015","true","19.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Get your license high enough, and you can start to fulfill the requirement to earn $40 worth of iRacing credits a year. This can cover the costs of cars and tracks, or, it can let you grab a year's subscription for $10 + the $40 in credits. A whole year for just $10!

You either hate it or like it. Overall I'm on the plus side, but I will admit that there are some shortomings to iRacing, as with any sim. I've listed the pros and cons, and then offer my conclusion.\n\n\n|Pros|\n-Online: The online is the best there is. From the structured races to the actually enforced rules, iRacing provides the best competetive experience out there. People race to win/finish and will take you and others seriously. Those who don't are shunned and reported and usally don't stay long. Apart from the offical iRacing series's there are also plenty of casual to hard hardcore leagues that you can join.\n\n-Detail: Both the cars and the tracks are modelled with exceptional care. The laser scanned tracks deliver a level of fidelity that is unparalleled, not just of the road, but also the surrounding area. Inside the cars the cockpit is modeled with proper textures and every last detail is captured.\n\n-Physics (the good): iRacing delivers solid physics. Suspension and engine are handled well and the tires flex and grip accordingly. Setups matter a lot and will affect your racing quite a bit. Aero is simulated as well and drafting is possible/necessary. Force feedback is adequate and gives you a good feel of what the car is doing. Your car will take visual and simulated damage. Dynamic track temperature and grip levels are simulated. Very used tracks even build up marbles, although they don't visually accumulate on the tires.\n\n-Career: While this falls somewhat under the online segment, your career is logged and official. Your SR and IR both affect your license level and what series' you can compete in. It makes for very rewarding gameplay and means every race counts.\n\n-Graphics: I feel this is generally a secondary item of what makes a sim good and I feel like iRacing has a good basis for this. It's not terribly graphics intensive and runs on relatively cheap systems, which allows many different people to compete. To me, it's important that the eye candy doesn't get in the way of racing, and iRacing does this well without cutting out visual detail. FOV, multiscreen, and Oculus support are properly implemented and work well.\n\n\n|Cons|\n-Cost: As the youtuber EmptyBox described in one of his videos, iRacing is more of a service than a sim. You pay for subscription and for every car and track. Is it expensive? Yes, at least if you want to race more than one series. Make sure to plan your career accordingly. You can get away with only a little money, but if you're really into it, money flies out the window quickly.\n\n-Physics (the bad): Tires. Yes, the most important part of the phyics is part of the bad too. Tire degredation is nearly nonexistent and instead everything builds up in terms of heat. It's frustrating to know that your tires begin to lull after a few laps and it is nowhere near as good as AC or rF1/2. You cannot develop flatspots nor deflate your tires. iRacing is also notorious for having difficult snap oversteer and it requires more precision than in other sims to catch a slide. Brake temperature and some other fine engine/vehicle systems aren't simulated, nor can you mess with the said systems (more engine cooling, tire compounds). Rain is nonexistent either. Night/Day cycles do not cycle yet either.\n\n-Camera: Since you can't feel the car move and rotate, I feel that it's important to get as much visual feedback as possible. For me, rF2 sets the standard for this, as the head shakes and moves according to the motion of the car. iRacing's default camera delivers very little feedback, even if third party programs can allow this.\n\n\n|Conclusion|\niRacing is a solid simulator who's physics fall short compared to AC and rF2, but earns all it's points in the online PvP races. If you're looking for the most accurate phyics, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a casual hop-in to play, tune, and customize your car, this isn't for you either. But if you're looking for a serious racing environment against other people, iRacing is your thing. All new racers should make sure to do the monthly trial first to get a feel for the sim (start with some offline testing and then move into some rookie racing).","December 11, 2015","true","88.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Consider what is important to you and how you like to go about your racing.

So it's not like you're going to go out there and race everything, meaning you don't have to buy everything. Being fast is not everything, you need to be able to race safely to be respected. Racing safely is a new beast to tame for every car and track.\n\nTake it slow and you'll have tons of fun and you won't spend too much.

The physics are good but there is no AI. Tracks cost between $10 and $15 each, vehicles cost $12 each. The track changes every week so if you want to continue racing you have to invest a lot of money in the first season (12 weeks -> 12 tracks, you own maybe 4 of them. So that's 8x $10 = $80 best case scenario.)\n\nOnce you are on the track it is awesome. The car selection isn't really my cup of tea and very GT3 and Nascar centric. Some of the series are pretty dead and you can only find races on the weekend/evening. That's the reason I stopped playing because I can't schedule my life around iRacing. I would be fine with it and still use it if they removed the monthly sub fee of $12 so I can come back for free and use the content I already bought.","November 14, 2015","true","20.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You have to be prepared to walk away with a bruised ego, especially in the beginning, to get the most out of iRacing. Early on you will need to dedicate a good portion of time to practice, to become familiar with the car, the tracks, & the physics. This is a true simulation, so it's not very forgiving. That being said, once you do start to see progress in your abilities, it is one of the most rewarding pay-offs of any "game" experience you can find.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend playing this game with a steering wheel that has Force Feedback, and more importantly, a decent set of pedals. It may not seem like it, but good pedals will make you faster than a good wheel, so if you have to choose where to spend your money, pay more for good pedals.\n\niRacing is not plug & play, but once you get past the setuup it's the most fun & competitive simulation racer out there.","March 25","true","380.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Keep in mind you will have to have played for a yr before getting a cheaper membership.\n\nCons:\n$11 for a car, $14 per track along with an annual $99 subscription which you can get for $45 on sale once a yr.

I am in awe at the skill and racecraft shown by the majority of the iRacing members. The Community is awesome. Active members can view the exclusive forums flooded with everything SIM you could ask about.\nThis is Not a game so much. If you would rather a plethora of concept cars or fanatasy tracks, occasionally playing on weekends, maybe this is not for you.\n\nPros\n-In my opinion second to none.\n-Supremely Realistic physics.\n-Strong accurate Force feedback.\n-Great PC apps available -iSpeed/trading paints for e.g.\n-Exciting youtube channel featuring live professional races with commentry. It's more exiting than most real world races\n-Ghost mode during an official  race. See how fast/slow you go with out getting in the way.\n-Can drive extremely drunk / don't need seatbelt.\n-License system encourages safety to progress. Regularly bans trolls or people basically crashing into everyone.\n-V8 Holden Commodore  + Mount Panorama. (Huge Pro if your Aussie).\n\nCons\n-No Nudity or A.I.\n-Time Sink. You'll need to practice to be competitive. Your GF may get a tad lonely. Your dog will miss a walk or two.\n-Get a basic set of cars and tracks. You're eventually forced into buying more content just to be eligable to enter races.\n-You may be tempted to try out your new found sim skills in your car.(Hope your insured).\n-Don't expect to race immediately. You may/should spend a week mucking around with settings and finding your feet.\n-Some 12 year old drivers will beat you... with ease.\n-No Wheel ......no deal. Xbox 360 controller won't cut it. If it does than this is definately not the game for you.\n-Requires a subscription and internet connection to use (Just like my GF)","December 1, 2015","true","57.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

Not much is available to you once you rank up either unless you shell out $15 per car and $15 per track.\n\nThe best part is the crash system which leads to you being penalised if someone decides to bump you off the road, better hope you don't go off the track when that happens too as then you'll just get even more penalty points which can be incredibly frustrating as some incidents you just coudln't of avoided (during one of my races a guy purposely wrecked someone just because of the country he was from)\n\nIf it wasn't for the business model and the extremely negative experiences I've had with the iRacing community I could of seen me paying for it.

The people racing in street stocks with controllers and joysticks is disgusting. I think you can even race with your mouse. Last time I checked you couldn't race a car with a joystick or keyboard. The talent in the lower series is non-existing. People race like the game WreckFest and don't know how to let lead lap cars around. They are mostly degenerate numbskulls who can't race without causing huge accidents. iRacing reporting is currently not working or they just don't care. There are way to many hot headed fools in this game who know nothing about racing or physics. The sim is fantastic but the racer quality is terrible. You cannot have a good time racing the entry level series because of people with 0 talent. The ability to increase your license from a lower status is impossible because everyone races like demoltion derby. I am glad I haven't purchased any other tracks or cars because of this. It's horrible. The physics and game itself is wonderful but the racer quality and pairing with others is not so good. If you wan't clean races I've had better clean races in WreckFest more so than this sim. It's in sad shape.","June 23, 2015","false","13.9"," 12 of 32 people (38%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","38","12","32","4","5"

It's all ridiculously expensive.\n\nSo after you pay your $100AU/Year (I paid $18), and you've paid your $12AU PER CAR and $15AU PER TRACK for the ability to even do anything remotely like playing this game, you find that its menu system is labyrinthine and ineffective.\n\nThe game has no native compatibility with most racing wheels, requiring the mind-bogglingly outdated menus to be used for hours and hours to get your wheel to just work like it does with most other sims right out of the gate.\n\nSims that don't charge hundreds to get a basic amount of content.\n\nEven the amount of content you can buy is pathetic, and the quality of it is completely unacceptable, especially for the price.\n\nThe ONLY thing this game has going for it is its online, supposedly, and it's usually completely deserted for Australians. There are server and lag issues, and it's very hard to even get into an event, let alone with others.\n\nThe physics engine is simply not as good as a lot of other sims out there.\n\nIt is nowhere near on the level of Assetto Corsa, which is significantly cheaper and includes far more content.\n\nI am absolutely appalled that this got as many players as it supposedly did, its physics are nowhere near as good as even GT6 in the new update, and that's only debatably a simulator in the true sense of the word.\n\nI am also appalled at the low level of quality and usefulness of this "game".\n\n1/10 for at least managing to swindle some people.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: It's also worth mentioning that this game automatically opts you in for 3rd party advertisements by default, and you cannot play without signing up.\n\n\nThe comments should be indicative of the attittudes of the iRacing community.","June 22, 2015","false","0.2"," 15 of 43 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","15","43","0","10"

But this game is not for those with little money, little time, or little commitment. Indeed, the money this game costs to play directly correlates with how much time you're expected to put in to be competitive.\n\nIf you have the money and the equipment, are willing to put in 10-20 hours of practice every fortnight and are interested in sim racing, you will not get a better experience than here.\n\nEveryone else should be cautious and spend a couple weeks with the trial before making any commitments.","March 15","true","71.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
