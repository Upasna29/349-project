To me, 2K12 was the peak of the series so far. This year though, it seems like they're taking advantage of no competition and are taking it easy. Why?\n\n- Players feel much less flexible/agile than in previous years\n- They changed the controls, again. 2k13 probably had the best gamepad config to date\n- Players are much more sloppy with regards to ball handling. Rebounds go through their hands, silly collisions cause players to lose the ball, sometimes players will randomly animate in ways not appropriate to the situation (sometime causing out of bounds calls)\n- Inexplicably consistent blowing layups and dunks, sometimes with completely clear path\n- Physics sometimes act weird. Going for a steal sometimes you'll knock the ball out the other side of the court or even into the crowd. This has an unintended funny side effect of making some blocks look way more spectacular than they should be\n\nStill, even having said that laundry list of things that bother me, I'd recommend the game (unless you want to manually patch the new rosters into 2K13). I'm hoping we get a mid-season patch like we did last year to fix these annoyances.\n\nThese opinions only cover single player mode.","November 25, 2013","true","239.0"," 163 of 222 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","163","222","0","3"

Though I know this may not be the next-gen port, this game still does not meet my personal expectations and feels worse as compared to previous titles and years of the NBA2K franchise.\n\nOver the course of my playing time, I have experienced many frustrating issues with the game. Here are some of the examples.\n1. Player stats are not consistent. How is it that MyPlayer, who has maxed out his stats, miss a wide open 3-point shot with no defenders, with the shot feedback showing A+ on Shot Selection and Excellent on Release? I dont know either. This major issue happens too often that I have resorted to give up on shooting the ball, and drive it in instead.\n\n2. Opponents are too over-powered. Though this may sound like I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, or suck at the game, but this is a major issue that I've felt playing NBA 2K14. The opposing team seems to have stats that are not accurate to their real-life counter-parts. How is it that a CENTER is able to intercept my bounce pass when he is not quick enough to react to it? Do you really think every player is aware of a pass and is able to react to it quickly enough to steal it? I don't think so. I have experienced countless possessions that ended up in turnovers because of the over-powered oppenents.\nAnother stat issue is with the speed. Do you really think that a center can outrun me? A 6'8 SF with 90 speed? Yeah, of course he can! (sarcasm)\nThe stats in the game are not realistic, and it gives players abilities they do not possess.\n\n3. There seems to be an issue with ball control. For some reason, MyPlayer, who has maxed out his dribble attributes, can't keep the ball in his hands without having to pass it to some other player. Even with my stats maxed, there seems to be a way for my opponents to take the ball for me. No wonder I average 4 turnovers a game.\n\n4. Association mode is terrible. That's just to make it simple. There seems to be no way for me to get a good running team that has over 80% of team chemistry without making one of the players the STAR role that they want, even if they don't perform like a star. I had a bench player who averages 2ppg asking for a starting spot. Really now? Like that's going to happen.\n\n5. Too many false goaltending calls! I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that 2K has made the goaltending calls more sensitive. I have been called for goaltending, even though I know for a fact that it is a clean and legit block. DUMB ♥♥♥ REFS!\n\n6. Online is ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nI sadly regret getting this game for its full-price of $29.99. This game shouldn't even be worth $5. Terrible job 2K, if only ya'll cared about the PC players, then maybe more people will buy it.\n\nI would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this game.\n\nI'm still going to play it though since it's the newest 2K title.\n\nHope I don't break my keyboard.","June 21, 2014","false","82.8"," 60 of 84 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","60","84","0","0"

We've come a long way in some regards--- there are finally rookie players that can make an immediate impact, intuitive trading mechanics, and subtle nuances that add great levels of realism, depth, and nearly infinite strategic options. 2K does a much better job of this than any other studio has, and continues to build on that each year. Last year, EA's NBA Live was so bad that they decided not to even release the product, much to my surprise--- credit due to them for at least recognizing that their product was ♥♥♥♥ and saving me a few bucks in the process. Anyhow, it now appears that 2K has become complacent in the absence of competition and have added only one feature, from what I can tell. That feature is called something like "Lebron mode" where you battle a receding hairline and try to keep your teammates from sleeping with your mother. Lebron may be great at basketball, but this is really not a feature and while I do enjoy the game, I can't possibly recommend it to PC gamers, since 2K has neglected the PC version of this game so badly. I went to play online blacktop (streetball mode) and there were exactly 5 people online playing the game in the early evening on a weekend (which was generally the peak time on 2K13 for PS3). I didn't bother even joining a game at that point and just returned to single player. The actual basketball gameplay works pretty well, although the controls feel a bit clunky (360 controller on Windows 8). If you're not sure whether to get the game or not--- don't. It's overpriced, poorly supported, and neglected. I don't think I'll be buying any more 2K basketball games after this one unless they really show that they give a damn about PC gamers.","May 6, 2014","false","133.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The gameplay is fantastic and all of the voice commentary is taken from actual NBA games so it makes it feel very real. However, if you are a HUGE fan of playing the NBA All-Star weekend, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nThe dunk contest controls are absolutely awful. Guitar Hero controls make absolutely no sense whatsoever in terms of replicating the feel of someone completing a slam dunk. Further, the controls were meant to be "fun friendly", for casual gamers to pick up and succeed. In contrast, I actually found completing a dunk and winning a contest in 2K13 was much more difficult in both regards than its predecessors found in previous 2K's. And again, at no point do we ever feel we're in control of what's happening on the court. Absolutely no correlation.\n\nThe 3pt. Contest was just incredibly clunky. There was, in fact, a shooting groove to be found. But, under no circumstances do I feel a gamer's lack of ability to find a groove should be punished with complete controller unresponsiveness. In short, the mode offered virtually no fun, just frustration and confusion.\n\nIn summary I only recommend this game if you don't care about the NBA All-Star weekend, if that aspect doesn't interest you then this game is absolutely amazing, if they can fix this for future games then it would be near perfect.","December 30, 2013","true","16.7"," 87 of 153 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","87","153","0","1"

I've almost given up on passing completely, you have to select the person you pass to, and almost every time, right before you're about to pass, the game just says, "Here, pass to this guy in the middle of the other team where it will get stolen". MyCareer is just ridiculous at times, giving you impossible challenges, ex: If you're team is getting destroyed, it will give you the challenge to get your team within 5 points, which is impossible. Other times, it tells you to get a basket, a steal, a rebound, and an assist, and it always puts you on the bench.\n\nThe commentators don't shut up and repeat themselves every few minutes, and always interrupt time outs with stupid stats and other crap that delay your gametime. they always jump to some lady named "Doris Burke" who has the most painful voice ever. When Halftime comes, it throws the Sprint logo and says "AND NOW THE SPRINT HALFTIME REPORT PRESENTED BY SPRINT" and after you spam the enter button to just get it to go away it comes back with "THE SPRINT HALFTIME REPORT PRESENTED BY SPRINT" again.  While you're playing, especially when playing the Heat, they always talk about how gatorade was in the Chalice of Jesus and is the liquid of the fountain of youth and how lebron drinks his gatorade every morning. Honestly they're so over-advertised I don't want to drink Gatorade anymore.\n\nThis game is just a headache on PC, get a PS4 and buy it for that, its so much better.","July 11, 2014","false","387.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

This is a big deal for me i used to play on the ps3 with black top and everything dont expect that here, From what im seeing/hearing its similar to nba 2k13 just with a fewminor commentary changes.\nThe Controls. Why why why 2k you just had to screw it up and change the dame controls the controls for 2k13 was great shooting pick and roll was great. I get on 2k14 and cant even do a ally-opp anymore!

Hopefully, 2K15 will be better on the PC.\n(2) Online multiplayer gets frustrating because\n(a) network problems will automatically stop a good ongoing game\n(b) some network problems will penalize you with a loss on your record which is really annoying\n(c) there is no way of optimizing locations and regions which may cause severe lag with some players\n(d) the online multiplayer headcount is always wrong, there are times where it displays 4 or 12 players only\n(3) I have completed achievements for 2K12 and 13 (http://lamban0g.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/nba-2k12-and-2k13/) and I am wondering what happened to all the achievements in this PC version.\n\nIf (1) - (3) don't bother you so much then I would recommend this game.

It definitely has more pros than cons and I would definately recommend it. On the upside, it has an extremely addictive career mode and will leave you playing game after game. The graphics are pretty awesome, but watching Chris Smoove play it on the next gen makes me extremely jealous of the eco-motion that pc does not include. Also, the career mode lacks the realism that next-gen brought with cut-scenes that make it seem like your actually living within the dream of being a rookie in the NBA. Whether its meeting with an All-Star on the court before the game,  getting in someones face at practice, or even dealing with your agents issues. Whats not to love... Its extremely depressing that PC gamers were deprived of this greatness and I pray for these qualities to be on 2k15 for PC.

That being said, I still enjoy myself playing this iteration of NBA 2k as I really enjoy playing a NBA GM and creating my own dynasty. The association although lacking in comparison to other sports games does have a somewhat good logic as it is very stingy with what trades the computer will accept from you.

Discretion is advised when making this purchase, It's not even orth the promotion prices.

That is just ridiculous. 2K stop taking advantage of not having competition and tighten up these small things and you will be gods. give the option to let someone have the possiblility of being a #1 pick and being awesome.","May 24, 2014","true","88.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is rage-inducing, triumphant, anything. Whatever you want to say about it can be said, I don't care. This game is epic. The only thing they could do to make it better is give the PC version the next-gen version of the game, the one that is played on the PS4 and Xbox One instead of the PS3 and Xbox 360. If you're playing this game you probably have a PC that can handle the next-gen version. I know I do.\n\nOne thing is you MUST use a controller of some sort unless you have a keyboard layout that suits you, because keyboard default controls are awful.\n\nSo get this game if you like basketball, but fair warning, you won't feel like watching the games on TV, you'll be in a seperate room playing them on NBA Today.","May 25, 2014","true","249.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crippknottick/recommended/255480/","crippknottick","crippknottick","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crippknottick/","390 products in account","Performance:\nThe game runs wonderful on any semi-modern system. You can even add in some SSAO and what not via ENB, sweetfx, or driver settings on a modern system with no fps loss at all.\n\nGameplay:\nThe devs at VC decided to change things up quite a bit. The new 'pro-stick' (right analog stick) is pretty intuitive by combining dribbling and shooting without any modifiers. Tap a direction to juke, hold a direction to shoot. Pretty neat.\n\nThe post game really sucks though, as it is akin to playing Mortal Kombat with dial-in maneuvers. There is no fluidity to post moves like with dribbling/iso/shooting on the pro-stick. In fact the only way to get the full post game experience is to switch the 'pro-stick' back to 'isomotion/shot' stick like in 2K13. (Hold LT and use the right stick to strut your fancy footwork in the post.)\n\nUsing the 2K13 right-stick settings has draw backs as the pass controls rely on the new 'pro-stck'. You cannot throw alley-oops or fancy passes as the controls for it under the 2k13 stick literally do not exist and was acknowledged by 2K/VC developer Mike Wang. If you are like me and love the low post to do Olajuwon-type moves you either have to sacrifice alley-oops or learn to play "Enter Fatality combo in the low-post Kombat".\n\nOther than that gameplay looks like 2K13 and feels more like 2K11, which I love.\n\nNiches:\nLebron James\n\nI'm no fan of Lebron. As an Orlando fan it is and has always been my sworn duty to hate the Miami Heat no matter who is on their roster. But Lebron has had this cover and theme a long time coming. It's way past due for us to have an NBA 2K game cover with Lebron on it.\n\nBugs:\nI haven't played all the game modes yet. I usually just get right into an Association mode. One thing I have noticed about 12 games into the regular season, 90% of players on my team and around the league suddenly had their block and steal ratings upped ('progressed') to 96. Ninety-frigging-six! I can't possibly manually fix every player's rating without some reference spreadsheet in front of me, nor should I have to. Plus, after fixing it, what would prevent it from happening again another 12 games into the season? This totally ruined the association mode for me and I literally just gave up and deleted my saved game. What a waste of time!\n\nMyPlayer, according to practically everybody on the 2K forums is broken (as usual).\n\nOnline:\nI haven't tried online yet. I usually buy this game for the association mode, but I understand 2K's track record with online support on the PC. So it is a mediocre rating of 3 by default.\n\nGraphics:\nSame as 2K13. Exactly the same. It was good then and is good enough now (I guess). Bynum still rocks the faux-hawk.\n\nGraphics for the PC version by the way are last-gen and nothing like the Xbox One and PS4.\n\nAudio:\nThe commentary in the game is a lot of what was in 2k13 with some additions to the color commentary. It was good then and is good enough now.\n\nReplay Value:\nIt is NBA 2K. This game can occupy you for years.\n\nConclusion:\nPerformance: 10\nGame Play: 5\nNiches: 8\nBugs: 1\nOnline: 3\nGraphics: 5\nAudio: 7\nReplay Value: 10\nOverall: 6.1\n\nIf you already have 2K13 and aren't in dire need of a roster update then save your money on this one. I for one was enjoying this game up until I discovered player progression in Association mode is so broken it ruins the entirety of it. I live and breathe that mode for this franchise so it is a deal breaker for me.\n\nThere is no word of any PC patches coming any time soon or at all. Don't expect these bugs to be fixed.\n\n2K has also decided to drop roster updates on all current gen platforms (PC, 360, PS3) and during the current life cycle of the game too. It's not even the playoffs yet and they abandoned this game.","April 3, 2014","false","115.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The league was hit by a force of nature no analyst could have ever predicted. Smith destroyed rookie records for scoring and steals, these feats garnered him Rookie of the Year honors but unfortunately his incredible run was stopped by The Big 3 in the Easten Conference Finals. Adam had always aspired to play in the Big D and requested a transfer. Little did he know that he wasn't the only acquisition the Mavericks would make that offseason. Dallas had managed to acquire Lebron James and Smith in a 3 team trade involving Dallas, Miami, and Atlanta. Smith's second year was almost better than his first; in fact it was statistically better but the spotlight had been shifted. Smith finished 2nd in MVP voting to his colleague James. The Mavericks did manage to land the franchises second championship, a fabulous concession. Smith would learn to love this series of events as four seasons passed, each with a similar storyline. He was a valuable asset to the team but he could never quite keep the spotlight. Two more championships, top five in MVP voting for each of those four seasons. His seventh season was the breakout season he was looking for; he made it a mission to finally be the MVP. This was a contract year, he needed to perform. He was the league top scorer that season; in fact he had outscored the entire rest of his team combined. Smith finished with an outstanding 50+ points/game average and a career low in assists. The Mavericks finished ninth in the West barely missing the playoffs; but he had done it. Smith was the MVP. The administration was not happy with his selfish play and the decline in the team's performance and quickly dealt him away to the Pelicans on a max guaranteed contract. Smith was the star, the golden boy of basketball at last. The glory was lost even faster than it was earned after three pitiful seasons in New Orleans. Many insiders blame the fall on addiction and questionable off-the-court decisions. Smith chose to retire after his contract ended that season. Methamphetamine had utterly consumed the future hall of fame candidate; all of us wish Adam 'The Maverick' Smith the best and truly hope he can turn his life around. It is possible he may have another MVP season in him.\n\n10/10 would dunk again.","May 26","true","209.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of my major gripes about this game is how the 2K servers are constantly down. I have owned a number of 2K basketball games, mostly on the Xbox 360 and while their servers are also notoriously bad they are amazing compared to the 2K's PC servers. I have had the game for about a week and i have tried every day and still have not been able to play online even once... While MyCareer and the other non-online gamemodes can be fun, there aren't that many changes from NBA 2K13 - you could that this game is NBA 2K13 v2. It is honestly not worth $30 and barely worth the $10 that i paid. If you have NBA 2K13 DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you see this on sale and enjoy playing MyPlayer or other single player gamemodes and don't own NBA 2K13 that i would that it would be worth the purchase, otherwise avoid it.

Second of all, it  is either very easy or very hard to make a shot, what I mean is if you turn the game slider everything above 60% on offense, you will make every single shot. But if you put below 50%, then you bascially miss the shot. you can't really make everything balance where sometime you make the shot or sometime you miss the shot. another problem is that the sever is always offline even I'm online.\n\nIt seem that every game I play that on PC that the server of a game is always offline. The commentary is not too bad, althought the commentary keep talking about what happen last year almost like they don't even care a game is going on. The music in the game is great, most of the song was my favorite song.\n\nI only play the carrer mode in this game so far. it could at time could get very addicted, but at time it could be fustrated and bad. First of all, the amount of skill point we get is way to low. there are thousand of upgrade and improve your team chemistry. But you bascally can only spend small amount of level of upgrade per game. and also sometime the upgrade doesn't really affect your playing skill when you play in a game which is outraged.\n\nAnother thing is whenever you get on the court, you doesn't really affect the outcome of the game unless you are pro at this game. In fact for me, when I sub in the game, I make the game even worst for my team. But the most important is that the AI teammate (I think that what it's called) are horrendous. They at time always miss the shot even when they're wide open. But the worst thing is that they could not defent the paint at all. they're allowing wait too many easy lay-up in the paint, which at time is very frustrating because thay could not make those shot themselves in the post. The AI oppoenet can also sometime be frustrating too. sometime thwey can make every shot, every steal, every block, and grab every offense and defense of rebound. If you really want to buy this game, I really recommened you buying on the XboX one or PS4, because there are few thing missing and left out for the PC version","January 4, 2014","false","260.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's one of those.  You like sports games, and you want it to be good, so the bar isn't even set particularly high.  At first, you brush off some of the awkward controls and the occassional completely non-sensical thing the computer does.  But then they really start to add up.  And then they really start to ♥♥♥♥ you and you get angry.\n\nYou get situations like:\n\n-Your center dribbling the ball with 7 secs left on the shot clock, refusing to pass.  In fact, the game PENALIZES your in game rating for "calling for the ball to much".  And then the center clanks hard on a 3 pt attempt as the clock expires.\n\n-Try to pass to a guy cutting to the hoop for an easy dunk, but instead pass it to a guy 2 feet to your right.  Who will then dribble right into you and have the ball go off your knee and right to the opponent to start a fast break.  And then the game will penalize you for "allowing your man to score".\n\n-The game will offer an in game challenge, like "Tie the game before half" or "Comeback and Win", and then sub you out of the game.  And you'll return with like 35 seconds left in the half.  Down 6.  Without the ball.  And don't worry, the game will figure out some way to penalize your score for something in those 35 seconds.\n\n-The tendency on Pick and Rolls, for the pick guy to not really pick anyone.  or roll anywhere.  or even go to the correct side of the defender.  So all he really did was start a double team.  And you will be penalized for a bad pass and turnover, or try to do some sort of silly circus shot on a relatively straight layup that clanks hard.  Either way, you start a fast break.\n\n-And then just some of the teams or players will start to be just rediculous...like 13 of 15 from 3 point range, or your team blowing 9 straight layups.\n\nEventually, you just start wanting to rage quit, because you'll be up 4, get subbed out, and come back in down 19, and you're just like "Well ♥♥♥♥ you too game, restart".  After doing that 3 or 4 times over 2 or 3 games, you just stop playing for the night.","January 22, 2014","false","33.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The controls are abysmal, they are on the level of the worst play controls for any game I've ever played.  Trying to control your players is like trying to control someone with a 2 second reaction time on the slickest of ice.  Nothing makes intuitive sense in this game AT ALL.  From the times you will press the pass button and instead of passing to the most obvious wide open player in front of you, it throws it across the court to a guy in double coverage, to the times when your guy is tripping over his own feet for 3+ seconds while you are unable to pass it to the painfully wide open guy - this game is just awful.\n\nRunning a play from the play book is comical, good luck trying to execute any of that in a timely fashion.  The game doesn't even feel finished - and it's like the 10th incarnation of this trash so there's absolutely zero excuse.\n\nThe MyCareer mode is a complete joke.  Playing offense is atrocious enough with your completely gimped player, but defense is just beyond believable.  How do people put up with this ♥♥♥♥?  I guess I forget the demographic that typically gets sold on this game hasn't necessarily seen a good game before to know how comparitively awful of an experience this game provides compared to even the most mediocre of games out there.  I played perfect defense (which is hard enough to do in a game that provides no good way to defend a ball handler) and was up in a guys face the whole time, all the way until the point where I'm directly on him and jumping up to block his shot, perfectly right in front of his face.  Shot ♥♥♥♥ violation.  Do I get "team points" for forcing the violation?  Nah.  But what do I see as the screen refreshes and the ball is being inbounded?  Yep - I lost team points for "Bad shot block attempt"  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??\n\nIf you have any self respect at all, don't throw your money at this sorry excuse for a game.  Even getting it on sale for 7 bucks was not worth it in the slightest.  These game devs must be laughing all the way to the bank with this trash, it's even worse than Madden if you could believe it.","May 7, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is by far the worst addition to the 2K franchise I personally have ever played.\n\nLet me break down this abysmal, ghetto, BET soap opera of a game.\n\nStarting with the controls; the addition of the dribble stick is pointless.  Seeing how it's near impossible to, what brotha's call "cross over" your opponent--since the AI is programmed to stick to you like ♥♥♥♥ing black on Kenyan.  2K switches up the controls from previous entries for no apparent reason.  Weird button and analog combinations for all the various moves prove too complicated, especially for this game's target audience.  I have a extremely high win-rate in 2K14 along with over five-hundred games played and have yet to learn how to "Eurostep."  The button combination to Eurostep in 2K13 was "X-X", that simple.\n\nNext, the music.  For perfect execution of a flawless soundtrack look back at 2K13.  They had legendary producer Jay-Z arrange a masterpiece of 20 black songs and Coldplay.  But now, in 2K14, where supposedly all songs were taken from LeBron James' iPod we see a drastic change as we take a look into the mind of LeBron.  The entire soundtrack is one perpetual ego-stroke, non-stop "♥♥♥♥ da haters!" songs as we're forced to listen to "Started From The Bottom" by Aubrey Graham during the startup loading screen.\n\nNow most importantly, the multiplayer.  Listen when I say this, 2K14, and 2K in general, has the most broken multiplayer you will ever witness in a video game.  The multiplayer is random, meaning no matter what you do it doesn't affect the outcome of the game.  Let me explain.  Say you miss five wide open shots, your opponent grabs the rebound, prances down the court, does a 360, contested three point attempt, with three guys in his face while fading away out of bounds...and makes the shot.

This review would be a maybe, but I just can't recommend it with a "YES", because the game would disappoint anyone that expects the player behavior on the court to be even remotely realistic. Also, the controls really stink. :]\n\nYou know what basketball is, right? Well, this game tries to emulate it and sell it as a simulation, but I've never seen a real basketball game situation where 3 players are guarding the same guy... often, 2 of my computer controlled teammates will leave their defensive positions and start obstructing me while I'm guarding my own target, which leaves the area around my basket and 2 opposition players totally unguarded.\nThe player switching mechanic is just primitive, press A (360 control scheme) to switch/scroll! through your players, and maybe the game will pick a player you want to control in time to prevent the other team from scoring (right stick, 2K! Have you heard of it motherfu... well, yes you have, but I mean outside of your ridiculous menu). There is another way to switch players, but it's even harder to navigate, press RB (360 controls) and then press the button displayed above the head of the player you want to control (there is no way to do it in time to prevent the other team from scoring, and some of your players will often be out of view, along with the button prompt above their head, so it's worse than the A button solution).\nThe player physics feel really stiff, for example when you want to go for a quick counter-attack after stealing the ball, when you pass the ball to the player that's in front, the ball passing player first completely stops and then passes the ball, usually giving the opposition enough time to set up their defense. Another example (my favorite) is when you knock the ball out of the opposition player's hands, and it falls behind him, your player will often not pick up the ball, even though you are holding that direction with your controller (he just won't move for 1 - 2 seconds), and the same opposition player that lost the ball will recover, turn around and take the ball before you are able to. You can usually expect delayed response from your players from any directional inputs you give them, and I think it's because of the motion capture, this game takes it's physics and animations seriously, or at least it tries to, I had a few situations where the opposition players would go through me with their ball dribbling hand and score.\nThe game's menu is probably the worst menu I've ever had to navigate in any game, ever! I don't even know how to explain the way it works.\nYou can't turn off auto subs, the game's coach decides to take out LeBron "motherflippin" James and put in Andersen and there's nothing you can do to prevent it, the best you can do is wait till you have the ball again and reverse the stupid decisions made by the coach.\n\nThat would be all that's bad and horrible and inexcusable about this game, I think... (haven't touched the online modes, but I've read that you can't play against your friends unless the game graciously pits you against your friend while you both search for an online game at the same time).\n\nThe game can be fun when it's working, and it's a shame that so many issues are plaguing it (I'm not risking buying NBA 2K15 because of this, I don't care about the graphics, 2K14 still looks fine graphically IMO, so I don't feel the need to upgrade/update), and it's probably worth the money on a 75% off sale if you like arcadey sports games and don't care about NBA roster updates (or slightly, yes, just slightly worse graphics than the new game).\n\nScore 6.5/10","October 13, 2014","false","11.7"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

This series is very dominant in the basketball video game market, easily outshining competititors such as NBA Live. To put it into perspective, imagine a team of five Stephen Currys playing against a blindfolded and dehydrated JaVale McGee. This is NBA 2K vs NBA Live. NBA 2K has always been a reliable series, releasing quality games year after year, which makes it such a popular choice in the sports video game genre. NBA 2K14 is yet another stellar release. Meanwhile, the developers at EA Sports were probably stroking, combing and styling each other's pubic hairs while they were producing NBA Live 14, as it is a (figurative) piece of sh*t. Sloppy gameplay combined with clunky controls and terrible graphics can only mean that the developers were either very unfocused in the production of the game, or they were actually trying their best to create an unpolished (again, figurative) piece of dog turd. Either possibility should not be ruled out.\n\nBefore I give my final rating, I would like to provide another analogy of NBA 2K vs NBA Live. Imagine Matthew Dellavedova is taking a dump in one of the toilets at the Quicken Loans Arena. Suddenly, Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr. pops right out of the S-bend and swats all of his faeces out of the toilet, sending it flying all the way to Australia. Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr. then bellows viciously "get that weak sh*t (haha sh*t, geddit?) out of here!". Matthew Dellavedova stares back at the sopping wet Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr. in total disbelief, tears streaming down his bearded cheeks. I understand that this is quite a vivid description, however I wanted to make clear the distinction between the NBA 2K and NBA Live series. In this case, NBA Live is Matthew Dellavedova and NBA 2K is Hyland DeAndre Jordan, Jr.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to congratulate the developers of NBA 2K on another successful release. I can't say the same for NBA Live, however. In fact, I would very much like to challenge the entire development team responsible for NBA Live to a battle of wits, however I fear they are unarmed. I would probably go to as far as to say that LeBron James could have produced better games by smashing his d*ck[pbs.twimg.com] around on a keyboard.\n\nFinal rating for NBA 2K14: 10/10\n\nTo trigger a hidden celebration, press the shoot key 15 times in a row quickly, after a made free throw from your player. He will pull down his shorts and begin to "helicopter" his d*ck around in a circular motion. Be careful though!

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043151144/recommended/255480/","76561198043151144","Ded Cuz I Killed It","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043151144/","38 products in account","*EDITED REVIEW\nIn my last review I stated that this game was the worst game I had ever played; this is true, however, as you can tell by the number of hours I've put in to this steaming pile of trash, you can tell I've played it.  Well, that's because this is the only basketball game that is under $50 at this time, so I'm stuck with this ALMOST UNPLAYABLE PIECE OF DOG ♥♥♥♥.\nHere we begin the large list of everything wrong with this game:\n- An awful port, basically demands a controller.\n- Doesn't tell you how to play.  No joke.  They have a "Training Camp" option, but many of the mechanics don't work.\n- RS and X (Xbox controller) are both shoot; this means when you try to attempt a crossover, many times you just end up making a terrible shot.\n- The release system is pointless.  You can get wide-open shots, hitting "Excellent A+ Quality", and clunk!  Also, it tells you to release when you see a flash around the ring of your player, but releasing on the flash makes it "Slightly Late" basically every time.\n- No multiplayer, so you're stuck with the infuriating task of playing against the AI, which is the most frusterating thing ever.\n- Here's why the AI is the most frusterating thing ever:  When you're playing a game against the AI, your defense will not effect them in any way, not kidding.  They will throw alley-oops nonstop, and they will almost never fail - dunking over your best defender, sometimes even two.  This would be fair if you could do it, but you can't.  The AI's defense is solid (which can actually be fun and challenging), but your team-mates sit there with their thumbs up their ♥♥♥, not doing anything - THEY WON'T EVEN THROW A HAND IN THE SHOOTERS FACE!\n- You go on cold streaks for no reason.  You'll get five open looks, get five perfect releases, and none of them will splash, and then that player is useless for the rest of the game.\n- MyCareer is about as enjoyable as stapling your scrotum to your stomach.  You start out as the most horrible player to ever step on the court: you miss wide-open shots, you can't pass, you try to steal and it's a reach-in-foul, you try to block and it's a foul.  Your coach is constantly changing who you're guarding, so you'll switch from the person that you're actually guarding, to a guy wide open (and unlike your team the opposing AI team will always make their open looks), and then your team grade goes down AN ENTIRE LETTER.  If you slip-up once you're basically crucified!  And the grind for points to upgrade is like cutting your own fingers off.  Without-a-doubt, MyCareer has been the worst part of every single NBA 2k game, EVER!\n- A disgusting lack of classic teams.  They do have a good selection of teams to choose from, but they're missing so many.\n- Post offense is OP.  To score in this game all you have to do is pass it to the bigman, and he'll hook it in every single time from the post.  No joke, you'll shoot atleast 50%, guaranteed.  Doesn't matter if they're being triple-teamed, it will somehow by the grace of God, make it's way MAGICALLY into the basket.\n- This game looks like a flashy PS2 game.\nDon't buy this. This game contributes nothing to my time but frustration and anger.  Buy 2k16 or 2k15 instead.  Proabably 2k15 since that's the only one I'd call good.  sports games suck, never buy any sports game before doing heavy research into it first.  They don't care about you, but I'm sure you've deduced that over the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t they've pulled over the past few years.","May 29, 2015","false","259.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are so many problems and glitches that I get drowsy just thinking about it.\n\nLet's start with teammate AI:  it's horrible.  Players do not behave like basketball players.  They won't take open shots, they won't attack the basket when they should, and they don't seek open space when rolling off a pick.  On defense, you'll find yourself screened by your own guys, who will proceed to just move out of the way of a driving opponent instead of providing help or making the correct switch.\n\nShooting is so bad.  I can't stress just how ridiculous it is.  You can have a player with 100/100 shooting from all ranges, take wide open A+ shots, get Excellent timing and still miss more than you make.  No average NBA player is going to miss more than half of their wide open mid range jumpers, so when a player who should be among the greatest pure shooters of all time is missing constantly IT IS A SERIOUS PROGRAMMING PROBLEM.\n\nDon't even get me started on lay-ups and putbacks rimming out.  This game has seriously made me wonder if there is such a thing as a "high-percentage shot."\n\nThe computer's recovery speed on defense is way too fast.  You can break their ankles and they still recover in time to block your shot, unless you get them to fall down completely.  The same is true on a fast break.  You can have a sizeable lead, sprint with a very fast player, and slower men will magically show up in time to get in your way.\n\nYou can't adjust the sliders in game modes like "My Career," because they'd hate for anyone to tamper with these gamebreaking problems.  Believe me, there are more, but I'm not going to continue listing them.\n\nI haven't even bothered with the multiplayer because they didn't think a "play with a friend" option was important enough to include.\n\nSeriously, who are these morons?  Is this the standard in sports gaming?  This ♥♥♥♥ would not fly in other genres; they'd have to label it "pre-release."\n\nThe game isn't completely terrible overall, it's still playable and if you can ignore it's glaring, frustrating faults then it can be enjoyable... but I can't recommend it.  There are just too many problems that should have been fixed before this game ever saw the light of day.  Now they're surely on the verge of pumping out NBA2k15, which will have the same problems because people just continue to buy it.  Glad I didn't pay full price.","September 10, 2014","false","218.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The only problem I have with this game is that it's EXACTLY like NBA 2K13 and possibly NBA 2K12. The only differences would be the music, menu layout, and the rosters. The draft mode is exactly the same down to the letter. The same teams interview you, they ask you the same exact questions, and you give the same exact answers (from what I can tell). The draft mode is kind of annoying. There's no way to skip through it, so if you feel like you might be a late pick, go ahead and take a nap or something. They also added in live recordings from the actual draft along side the game sound, which ruins the experience.\n\nI can recommend this game on sale just to have a sports game to play, but look at the earlier titles first and pick them up if they're cheaper.","March 13, 2014","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then after they score my player jumps! HAHAHA !\n\nI mean, great basketball game. But there's no competition out there. Maybe this year EA will have something good.\n\nLove the oldschool teams, using Magic, Zeke, Jordan. Making my own Roster reppin' my City is cool. Lebron's path mode is the closest thing to role playing (story mode) that this game has. Which will keep you coming back watching his story unfold.\n\nPretty much the same as 2k13 but with a crappier soundtrack. Plus 2K loves shutting down its old servers to make way for the next year's game. I can't play 2k13 online anymore, the same shall soon be said for this title here. So only buy it if you're going to play single player or co-op on the same screen.\n\nGood game, but don't buy it. Wait for 2k15 which is NEXT GEN on PC, then you'll have access to all the features like the game was intended to have. And what is a game (at least in this generation) without in-game purchases?! Virtual Currency? Crap...\n\nPS. These non-next gen versions of 2k14 are not compatible with the MOBILE GAME, and cannot be synced unless you have next gen. You can still play the MOBILE GAME, but you can't do extra stuff because you have a crappy Ps3 port on the PC.","October 2, 2014","false","164.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That should be a refundable purchase if I ever heard of one. The best part of this game is laughing at how crappy it is.\n\n-If you actually want to play the game make sure to turn all the rules off because if you don't ever 10 seconds you will get a foul or some other stupid crap that is annoying enough that you will wish you had a gun in game where you could just pop these suckas when it happens.\n\n-Graphics looks like a good PS2 game, most crowd is sprites or cubey people and there are no settings to chance graphical settings that I could find. Aliasing is a huge issue! You would have to force it via drivers if you really cared to play this game but you won't because its ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Telling distances and positions on the feild is difficult, partially due to graphics and due to the strange feeling camera angle that does not assist in viewing the game area in any way aside from being more cinematic.\n\n-AI are either cheating or are able to get past the bad controls and design aspects. I say the fuggers are cheating.\n\n-UI design is atroucious. Whoever designed the UI should be dragged through a pit of a million camel spiders. The way its setup trying to do anything brings up a menu that would make you think it would be a menu you quit the game from or exit out of something but instead that menu is the menu you use to do anything aside from the first 2 options in the startup menu. Its just bad. ♥♥♥♥ 2k. 2k sucks.\n\n-The actual gameplay isn't good. Blocking feels completely random based as does most the game. Shooting comes down to letting go of the button at the right time which feels cheap as heck and its pretty random at that. AI will almost always land shots and actually block anyone is difficult as you tend to be either to far one way or another or your chracter decides he want to jump in a random direction and leave this world behind.\n\n-Buttons change randomly without any indication or parrallels so one minute you might have to hold the button to pass the ball to another player, but next you don't hold the button its now a toggle.\n\n-Entire feeling of being a janky and crappy feeling game\n\n-Career mode is to much filler and to much crap and not enough basketball, but after one game they probably realised no one would want to play much more of that.\n\n+Character creation let me make a freak\n\nThese types of sports games NEED euphoria physics or some parrallel to that as without it just looks like crap especially this game though. I would rather play an old College basketball game I had for the PS2 made by EA because thats more fun and better in every way than this game but both games feel flat and emotionless.\n\nIt sucks, don't buy it even for $5. Its not good at all.","June 24, 2014","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game looks beautiful despite its many shortcomings (look cons section). Myplayer mode lets you play the game using a custom player, pretty good to immerse yourself in the game, but this mode has its flaws.\nCONS: Player models look funny, since the game uses the same engine as its previous iteration. The next gen graphic is only available on console, pretty stupid move 2K. Myplayer mode still lacks immersion, the better mode is only available in Xbone and PS4, way to discriminate your user base 2K. The AI teammates in Myplayer mode is beyond useless. They can't defend, leaving you to do a lot of the defense yourself sometimes to no avail. They miss wide open shot, sometimes they dont even take wide open shot, they can't run fast break often time running themselves out of bound. The AI opponent in Myplayer mode however can be godlike adding to your frustration. They can ignore your defense and put the ball pass it by forcing their way to it, their 3 points ability is beyond ludicrous, 4/6 3pt FG attempt per quarter is common. So you have to REALLY enjoy MyPlayer mode to get past these obvious flaws.\nEDIT: I can't take it anymore. The teammates AI is beyond useless. 2 consecutive out of bounds when you passed to them. These are supposedly world class players in KD and Westbrook. They can't defend if their life depends on it, Ibaka can't receive pass and shoot mid range. Waste of money. Never again 2K.\nCONCLUSION: I decided to get the game after playing 2K13 and thought it was awesome. 2K14 isn't awesome. The MyPlayer mode drives you nuts. The only salvation this game has is its good pvp mode.","July 15, 2014","false","243.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But since you can trade teams, then theres a lot here. Also, there's 5 different positions to play meaning multiple play-throughs. There is also some pretty tense games with buzzer-beaters, and when you get to the playoffs, it feels like the CPU or AI really bring their A-Game. I have 70 hours currently (while writing this review) and I haven't won a champonship yet. There is also many goals to complete. Like getting into the hall of fame, and giving your speech. Maybe you want to set a record for most points, assists, block ect, in a game. With 30 teams and 5 different positions to play, theres a lot here. You can sign with a shoe company too. In my opinion you sign to quickly into your season, but you can make custom shoes, which is awesome for sneakerheads. I'd give this game an 9.5/10. There's only one downside in my perspective, and thats that you need to know how to play proper basketball.","February 1, 2015","true","180.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a black 360 controller and a very fast and powerful PC as well as broadband and this game seems to have a little lag for buttons.\n\nGameplay is what you expect from this series, except they still have not fixed (they are getting like EA) the small things that make the game annoying.  You man being immobilized after almost every move is annoying.  I know in real life there is a delay to guys getting back up to speed, but not for every move.  If this doe not happen, then there is the'sliding' that your man does, often leading to 'out of bounds' calls!\n\nOf course, there are way too many 'kick ball violations' which you hardly see in a real NBA game.  One real annoying thig (at least while palying online) is that the game (or cheaters) will change your man that you are controlling, not allowing you to keep your defense!  The game also fails to pass the ball to your intended target on the fly a lot of times, often at the wrong time!  This makes me think that this is done on purpose as the game (like EA) likes to control the flow and game type and possible outcome.\n\nCheaters online is a big concern so I will buy a PS4 and the news game to prevent them from cheating.  It is annoying and weird to think that someone wakes up, wants to play a game and can only do so by cheating, as if they are winning a prize.  I hope that 2K can crack down on cheaters on PC and console and penalize them.    Others quit when they are losing.  I get the win, but still.  It appears as if the system can tell when bums pull the plug on their internet conntection, but they still do it.\n\nNow my final issue is with the controller (black 360).  I do not know if it is the game of Steam, but if someone pops up and takes me to the desktop or I switch to it, I can no longer use the controller unless I restart my PC.  It just started happening lately and more often.  As of writing this review, it has happened after none of the previous occurred.  I assumed that Steam updates games to the latest version auotmatically, but mine still says "1.0.0" and I have to assume that updates were done since then.  I hate to say that I do not like Steam, but I need to be sure that games can be updated.  I like my PC gaming, but I think I will buy a console.  I expect PC games to take advatange of ALL PCs, not just be cheap ports with more resolution.","July 20, 2014","true","277.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reason I did this is 2K15 isn't going to be 'next gen' for the pc, so I will probably never buy a sports game on PC again, as our hands are being forced to console. That being said, rarely can I play 2k14 online without lag. Not sure if it's server problem, or people I am playing against. The single player is about what you'd expect. Basic gameplay, no out of this world graphics, and just a minimal difference from previous years. If you can't find the game for $5 or less, move on and never look back.\n\nEdit: I've read, from multiple sources, 2K15 for the PC, will be based off the ps3/360, and not the ps4/Xbone. Not saying that is 100%, but I've seen enough to believe it.","July 20, 2014","false","30.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The other specialties are hard as hell, for me.\n\nThe other modes are fine, especially Association mode.\n\nAs for the online experience, no. Not working for me, at least. Very laggy.

Yes, rage. games. This and the earlier parts of the series were the first to make me consider committing arson to the 2K HQ. I don't usually play the team vs. team matches (didn't appeal to me), instead, I play this for the MyPlayer experience, so what I can say about this game comes heavily from that mode. So, what I can say is:\n\n1. As a whole, there was little to no effort put into improving the game compared to 2K13, such that the staff fail to see that investing on actually releasing 'good' PC versions pay off.\n\n2. They didn't only give no effort, they didn't care. Limited Online Play, Online Servers were garbage, No major addition of content, and yet they put a relatively large price tag.\n\n3. Every single time I play for a team in MyPlayer, whether it's the OKC Thunder or the Utah Jazz, they will suddenly play idiotically, while the opponents suddenly become gods in comparison.\n\n4. Hibbert, Ibaka, Favors, any great Center/PF out there, as long as they are in your side, their opposing big man will play double digits for rebounds and points while they struggle to get even 5.\n\n5. Apparently stealing the ball requires more than 10 seconds. Enough for the opponent to circle around me before the animation is over.\n\n6. God. Damn. Animation. Forever. Stuck. In. Animation.\n\n7. Your team will always get caught in close defense animations, especially in drives or crossover attempts, while the opposing will get away... even centers.\n\n8. Press Conferences. Yeah? No. Especially since there's no skip, watching my player go 'oh I was awesome but...' while his turnovers, fail passes, etc. being etched in my brain just feels so wrong. 'Oh, I did well but the team was...' 'Oh stfu, you damn fool'.\n\n9. Sometimes passing is just... what. You try to icon pass to the PG, yet you pass to your guarded Center, turnover. 'Outlet' (?) pass, to the SF, nope... Power Forward out of bounds.\n\n10. You want to go left, no you'll go back while going left, respect the arc. Just a little nudge to the right, nope... run 2 meters to the right leading to a turnover.\n\n11. I'm done. Why are you still here? Your popcorn should be done by now.","July 4, 2014","false","188.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The backgrounds are simply the same animations with different colors... the crowd is still awfully designed. But there are many improvement. Defense finally has some UMPH! In this years game, you have to actually play some good offense. You have to create open/easier shots. In 13, you could get your my player to a certain skill and then basically dominate. On 14 you still have to play ball all career long. The physics are much smoother and the controls are slightly varied - but for the better. If you liked 13, you'll like this. It will take some time to adjust to the new shot percentages but definitely good game.

Im not sure if that is just client-side, but 2k support is aweful and did not help whatsoever. Overall if you did not buy NBA2k13, maybe you could get this.

I don't watch sports and I'm not a fan of the NBA but I do like games. This simulator can be enjoyable either way. I like to fantasize  I have a basketball team that destroys everyone and wins the championship or whatever it's called. I like to pretend to be an all-star player and smash balls in faces or whatever. For that this game is perfect. It's very fluent and the graphics are beautiful. That's all there is to say about the pros; if you like basketball then this game will be thoroughly enjoyed. Now one major complaint I have is the draft with a new character. It is the most boring nonsense I've ever endured in my life. I had to experience it again when I created a new character. Why would there not be an option to skip this garbage. The graphics are terrible during these scenes and remind me of the old Wrestlemania games when you could go backstage and it was all underdeveloped. Another issue are the mandatory questions for the press after the game. They are a total waste of time and completely basic and thoughtless. There should be an option to skip for those of us unfamiliar with ESPN news and don't care to live out the fantasy to that extent. If you can tolerate it that far then you have to deal with the incredible difficulty and slow process of leveling up your character so he doesn't crap away his career. Aside from those annoyances, I found this game to be a fun way to waste a little time.

Only thing i don't like in it so far is the people who i randomly match up with in the Team Up Mode. I don't get it why most of the people always go solo and dont understand how important passing is in sports.\n\nSince you control only one position yourself and someone else goes solo all the time it sucks to see whole team losing because of that.\n\nBut nonetheless the game itself is awesome and it's not the games fault that people are so selfish :)\n\nI havent played any NBA 2K games before so im really glad i finally went and tried.

I am glad to see some frustrating bugs in 2k13 get fixed (e.g. broken replays, though they should have patched 2k13 if 2k sports really cared about the fans), however there are just too many legacy issues as well as newly introduced ones to make a purchase of this game worthwhile. Here I would like to highlight 2 major problems for me:\n1. Teammate offense AI in my career. There is no improvement at all. They probably tweaked it a bit, which actually makes it worse. Your teammates routinely ignore your position on the court which means they may get in your way, or they may leave you double teamed while not creating any open shot. Your teammates will also be Shaqtin' A Fool a lot: stepping/standing out of bound, missing open layups, and setting screens against air. The AI issues will be especially annoying if your player plays a non-PG position because you won't get to call plays, which could have reduced the chance of awkward movements or spacing.\n2. A couple of "too easy to ..." issues. It is too easy to block shots or get blocked, and it's too easy to get the ball knocked loose inadvertently. Blocks, turnovers/steals, and goaltendings, their unrealistically high rate of occurance can really do damages to the overall experience sometimes.\nTo sum it up, nba 2k14 is at best just a patched 2k13 with a tiny addition of new animations, plus some slight tweaks of AI and ball physics, which in many cases make the game less fun than its recent predecessors.","January 18, 2014","false","234.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each NBA2k game seems to improve on the last (with some exceptions... sorry heaps of 2k12). Right stick now controls dribble moves and shots without a modifier and makes breakin ankles on the way to a casual tomahawk feel so nice. Player upgrades are better than they were in 2k13 and are powerful and varied enough to significantly impact the way your players play. AI is as good as it has been in the series, and while still a little prone to odd backcourt, 3 second violation or mind numbingly stupid pass, it's still an improvement.\n\nBut by far my favourite thing about 2k14 (and for the most part, the NBA2k series in general) is how team orientated it is. On lower difficulties you can carry your team. Pump up that difficulty to HoF and it becomes a strategy game, where play calling, mismatches, etc are all important. That doesn't mean you can't dunk on Dwight. Just that there might be better options.\n\nThoroughly recommended. I rarely play game modes other than MyCareer, but that's enough for me to give it the old tick++.

I haven't played a BBall game since NBA live 08 so have the benefit of not being one of those that will bash the game for being the same as NBA 2K13.\n\nIt really feels like a bball game, controls are smooth, lots to do to develop your player, really slick career mode, stunning and life-like animations and huge variety of customisation of those animations.\n\nHowever...myCareer feels really 'fixed'. It is the most enfuriating thing at times. I mean, my player has top rating and no matter what top of the league team I play for, it's as if my player is the only one that can score a basket. As soon as I get sub'd off for a quarter or so my whole team plumet and when I come back on the floor I'm down 10 points and suddenly the computer controlled team is hitting every shot whilst I hit practically nothing....and this happens more often than not, waaaay more. This is where the realism in the game takes a massive nose-dive, all you have to do is look at any end game stats record to see how the program has made it impossible for you to regain the lead your team has squandered whilst you where off the court. And the sad thing is this happens with any cruddy team you go up against, no matter how bad the team rating is, suddenly they'll be hitting 80% from the field whilst your team, a top team, hits 15-20% in the entire second half.\n\nEverything else about the game is beautiful and really enjoyable, but unfortunately for me I only play these games for the career aspect....and it's a load of pre written tosh. If you're not too bothered about career then def get this game but if like me you only bother with career then you might want to think again.....or get a load of mods to even out the performance malfunction","July 1, 2014","true","94.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are terrible without mods. Many online game modes were taken out, such as the option to play with or against a friend and MyTeam. There is also no store to buy suits, clothing, etc. NBA 2K14 for the PS3 and 360 is a watered down version of 2K14 for Xbox One and PS4. PC is a water down version of PS3 and 360. If you are buying this game it is also important to know that if you don't have a controller, it's going to be near impossible to play. One other issue that I had with framerate. I have a mid-end ($1500) PC and while the benchmark says I run near 60fps, the game's FPS dives down and makes it almost unplayable.

It was a big mistake to buy the PC version; none of the improved graphics or gamemodes are carried over in the pc port.\n\nTo top it all off, they ported the game from previous gen consoles (360, PS3), which means poor graphics, poor character customization, and basically no support whatsoever. I'm pretty sure I was still on version 1.0 or something when I uninstalled the game.\n\nThe terrible port is not even the start of it; MyCAREER becomes increasingly frustrating once the initial excitment of creating your own character and advancing it in the NBA wears off. It seemed like some games I went in my team was just designed to lose; they would turn the ball over at crucial moments, your character would become noticeably worse at everything, etc etc. I perfectly timed, open jumper would become impossible to hit, rebounds would fly out of your hands, you would skate 5m in one direction without touching the movement sticks, the list goes on. I ended up taking a horrible Milwaukee team to the finals against the Heat (and winning); but it really was against all the odds. You could be leading by 15 with 1 minute to go and the CPU would sink contested 3 after contested 3 with Mario Chalmers, and your CPU teammates would just turn the ball over at every opportunity.\n\nBasically I would recommend for non-diehard nba 2k fans to stay away from this game on PC, definitely not worth any of your money (unless its $10 or so on sale); buy it on Xbox One or PS4 (stay away from previous-gen consoles as well).\n\nA gamepad is also a MUST; Microsoft or PS3 (with a simple mod); keyboard is just horrendous.","March 17, 2014","false","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But since i really like sports games i just had to have one in my Steam account. After purchasing NBA 2K14, i noticed that some of the menus didn't work with my Xbox USB controler (had to use the mouse sometimes) . Other than that..... the graphics are pretty good. Alot more detail to some players than others. The gameplay is the same as the other NBA 2K games. They really didn't add or expand to this games already good features. The music is actually pretty good within the game. If you like the NBA 2k series i recommend this game, it's fun, easy to play and get into. The only draw back to me is that they make it so hard to earn points to upgrade your player in career mode.

I only bought it because it was $10.\n\n1st of all, it is stingy of 2K Games to not release the graphically better version of this game for PC. I assume this is so more people will buy the consoles and waste even more money. The graphics are the splitting image of 2K13, exhibiting no noticeable visual improvements.\n\n2nd of all, I do not like the increased difficulty. Rather than making the AI players better shooters and ball-handlers, they simply give all the calls and benefits of the doubt to the computer controlled team. This can be infuriating when you can see in instant replays that there was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t going on.\n\n3rd of all, the next-gen console versions of this game have their own problems, like all revolving around a created player (which I do not care for, I like to play NBA games with the actual NBA players) and that over-complicated and slows down game modes like the General Manager mode. So I choose to be gracious that it is not the same as the next-gen version.\n\nOverall, this is the best NBA game currently on the market. I would like to play with the ultra-realistic visuals of the Xbox One or PS4 version but it still looks pretty great. I really enjoy the Association mode and am glad they didn't muck it up like they did on the next-gens' MyGM mode.

I haven't played a BBall game since NBA live 08 so have the benefit of not being one of those that will bash the game for being the same as NBA 2K13.\n\nIt really feels like a bball game, controls are smooth, lots to do to develop your player, really slick career mode, stunning and life-like animations and huge variety of customisation of those animations.\n\nHowever...myCareer feels really 'fixed'. It is the most enfuriating thing at times. I mean, my player has top rating and no matter what top of the league team I play for, it's as if my player is the only one that can score a basket. As soon as I get sub'd off for a quarter or so my whole team plumet and when I come back on the floor I'm down 10 points and suddenly the computer controlled team is hitting every shot whilst I hit practically nothing....and this happens more often than not, waaaay more. This is where the realism in the game takes a massive nose-dive, all you have to do is look at any end game stats record to see how the program has made it impossible for you to regain the lead your team has squandered whilst you where off the court. And the sad thing is this happens with any cruddy team you go up against, no matter how bad the team rating is, suddenly they'll be hitting 80% from the field whilst your team, a top team, hits 15-20% in the entire second half.\n\nEverything else about the game is beautiful and really enjoyable, but unfortunately for me I only play these games for the career aspect....and it's a load of pre written tosh. If you're not too bothered about career then def get this game but if like me you only bother with career then you might want to think again.....or get a load of mods to even out the performance malfunction","July 1, 2014","true","94.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In general, it's a fun game, and it's the only option for basketball.  I bought it in spite of all the complaints of bugs because it was on sale.  I have not run into any serious ones yet, and it has been worth the 10 bucks.  It does have a lot of flaws, though.  The graphics look somewhat dated, so I can only assume this is not the same version found on the nextgen systems (the $30 base price tag backs this up).  Also, the AI is dodgy from time to time. For example, sometimes players will just dribble straight out of bounds or randomly throw the ball out of bounds, especially while inbounding against pressure.  It doesn't happen too often but enough to be noticeable and frustrating.  The game also attempts to force close games in the 4th quarter through officiating, shot percentage and the like.\n\nIf it's on sale, and you're just looking for a decent basketball game to play, I would change my review to recommended.  If you're hoping for a cutting-edge game that truly captures the NBA or a significant upgrade from 2k13, you'll likely be disappointed.  The "Not Recommended" vote is more of a warning due to the game feeling several years old and many people reporting multi-hour saved games being ruined by bugs. Lack of competition in the basketball market has apparently provided no motivation to work on major improvements, similar to the 2K baseball series and Madden football.   I've really lost faith in the 2K team over the past couple years.  They used to be one of the good guys.\n\nBottom Line:  It's a fun game if you like basketball, but it's not really worth the full price (even at $30) for this version unless you just love the NBA and absolutely must have the latest game for it on PC.","March 31, 2014","false","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There isn't a better basketball game available at the moment, so while I have my reservations sending someone else to this title it's not like there's something better I can promote. Generally speaking, since I love baskebtall, I'd really like any game developer to produce a flawless title. Apparently that can't be done, so this is what we get. Will you enjoy it? Here's what I've seen:\n\nThe refs barely call charges, even when they should. They instead call blocking fouls against defenders who aren't moving. That's not how the rule works. You can, however, fall down on defense by double-tapping B. I don't know why this option exists.\n\nYour AI teammates: 1) don't recognize iso situations, so they often crowd the lane and fail to drag their defenders away from your attack. 2) don't set picks if not prompted by your controller. 3) have trouble effectively performing basic pick and roll offenses. 4) Never throw alley-oops if not prompted, and barely throw alley-oops when prompted. In a nutshell, you have to ask for everything to happen in a MyPlayer / Player Lock situation, and it's luck of the draw as to whether any of it goes down how you envision it.\n\nThe AI defense always favors your player, regardless of his position on the court, possession of the ball, skill level / ability, etc. This likely was implemented to make up for 2K13's lack of intensity, which allowed perimeter shooters to sprint side to side to nail open 3s. Consequently, you couldn't get a back door alley oop opportunity in this game even if it was possible to make your teammates perform one, because you're never forgotten by the defense. This doesn't hold true for your team when it plays defense, however, as opponent alley-oops are frequent.\n\nYour ability to perform putback dunks are nearly nonexistent. Over 100+ hours with a 7'2" Griffin/Shaq hybrid in MyPlayer mode and I have 0 putback dunks. But I have seen the AI perform them, so there's that.\n\nMy team's offensive gameplan completely ignores its best player. Real Durant is in the hunt for the MVP title. Fake Durant has trouble getting the ball, ran out of bounds while uncontested last game, is far less effective than Westbrook or even Jeremy Lamb (who?), and doesn't get nearly enough touches even though he remotely reflects his actual skill level. He has trouble scoring 20 points a game.\n\nYour player plays garbage minutes. You'd think in a game where they implemented a fast forward feature to skip games because completing a career was nearly impossible that the developers would've recognized that your all-star juggernaught doesn't need to be on the floor in a 30-point blowout in the 4th quarter. They kind of got it right, in that they sub in all the scrubs, they just forgot the most important part - to sub you out so you don't have to wade through garbage time. I'm not that desperate for stats, I don't need to dunk on rookies I can't identifty.\n\nThis is only the next title in a long stream of basketball games that gets some things right and some things wrong about basketball. The charge flaw isn't new. I can, at least in this version of the game, get to the foul line. I can't just run away from the defense for open looks. Whether it's right for you really depends on whether these flaws sound better than earlier versions' batches of flaws.","April 4, 2014","true","190.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In general, it's a fun game, and it's the only option for basketball.  I bought it in spite of all the complaints of bugs because it was on sale.  I have not run into any serious ones yet, and it has been worth the 10 bucks.  It does have a lot of flaws, though.  The graphics look somewhat dated, so I can only assume this is not the same version found on the nextgen systems (the $30 base price tag backs this up).  Also, the AI is dodgy from time to time. For example, sometimes players will just dribble straight out of bounds or randomly throw the ball out of bounds, especially while inbounding against pressure.  It doesn't happen too often but enough to be noticeable and frustrating.  The game also attempts to force close games in the 4th quarter through officiating, shot percentage and the like.\n\nIf it's on sale, and you're just looking for a decent basketball game to play, I would change my review to recommended.  If you're hoping for a cutting-edge game that truly captures the NBA or a significant upgrade from 2k13, you'll likely be disappointed.  The "Not Recommended" vote is more of a warning due to the game feeling several years old and many people reporting multi-hour saved games being ruined by bugs. Lack of competition in the basketball market has apparently provided no motivation to work on major improvements, similar to the 2K baseball series and Madden football.   I've really lost faith in the 2K team over the past couple years.  They used to be one of the good guys.\n\nBottom Line:  It's a fun game if you like basketball, but it's not really worth the full price (even at $30) for this version unless you just love the NBA and absolutely must have the latest game for it on PC.","March 31, 2014","false","45.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But from the perspective of someone who has not played the series in atleast a decade I can safely say that this game is highly enjoyable playing the mode where you create your player, start off as a rookie and only control that character the entire time and your progression is based more on how well you played with your team and not wither you won or lost, or heck even scored the entire game, a big part of the "SP" (might as well be XP) that you earn is based on your grade you get playing the game which is based on making good passes, turnovers, and just being in the right place when your suppose to, yes scoring helps raise the grade, but missing lowers it worse so until you gain enough stats to make more shots then you miss its almost better to not shoot at all and be more of the person to pass and block.\n\nThe controls while a bit confusing if you don't play the tutorials or look at the control scheme do feel good even if sometimes  its hard to remember how to do "move x" since there is a lot of "wiggle the right anolog stick in a certain way compaired to where the key is" controls and so until you know how the controls work it is really easy to accidently move the analog stick the oposite direction of the move you wanted to do. Which brings me to the only thing I do not care for about the game, it is blatently designed for controller in mind and the keyboard and mouse controls are iffy. I would never play any sports game without a controller anyways, but atleast put some effort into making the game playable with keyboard and mouse.\n\nAll in all I would only play this game for the gameplay of controlling only the rookie you create and working on improving and getting better contracts and sponserships and what not, I would not play it for the more arcady mode of you playing as all characters because well that feels the exact same as it did a decade ago. (Then again I am also the type of person who prefered and played better in the 1st person view gamemode of NFL 2K2(?), I more enjoy playing modes that are not the same thing every year and give a feel more of the entire team needs to work well together and not the arcady feel of you controlling everything to where the AI really doesn't factor into how well you do at all.\n\nSteam really needs to add an option for Yes/No/NA as to wither you recomend a game or not when writing a "review" because parts of the game I would, parts I would not, and not everything has a yes or no answer when it comes to recomending something. With that said my "Yes I would recomend this game" I have to append on only if you have not played a recent NBA 2K game but enjoy RPG like elements in your sports games where your a single player and have to figure out how to work with the AI to do better. Because I would not recomend this game if you like to play it like how every NBA 2K arcade mode has played for over a decade, pick up a older cheaper NBA 2K game if you want that because it doesn't feel any different in 13 years for that mode.","March 2, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sorry EA but your game s*** B*lls\n\nSo yeah if you want to play good ball buy this game.. Roster is updated all year long (of course stop updating when the next game comes out but you might still be able to find the roster in downloadable content online) The gameplay is pretty easy to start with,, u will be able to take control of any team and play right away. If you want to get better at it there is tutorial with NBA Legends to help you master dribbling skills, shots, play calling, and post move.\n\nFranchise mode allows you to play a complete dynasty by drafting a team or by taking control of an already existing team. Fight your way to the playoffs and afterward you will have to use your scout skills to recrut the best rookies available for your team. There is much more waiting for you in this mode.\n\nUnfortunatly 2K cancelled all of the all star week end, except the all star game. So if you're lucky enough to get a early access pass you might have the chance of getting access to the all star week end.. Otherwise, you will have to play old nba games to do a slam dunk contest, and 3 pts shooting contest.\n\nOverall :\n7-8/10 because it is an awesome basketball games and not a 9 or a 10 since they took of one of the most cool thing available , i.e. doing slam dunk contest with MJ against, Erving, Wilkins and Webbs.\n\nSoz for my english","June 20, 2014","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even if you have no interest in basketball, it's a very good game.\n\nHowever the people who sell the game have decided to charge more to play the game if you live outside the us than if you live inside. Have no doubt, basketball is a US orientated sport yet they've chosen to charge everyone else a premium for this game, last time I checked 1.5X as much.\n\nTo me this game is absolutely worth every penny (that's a British term btw) but then I already played a stupid amount of time on 2k12 and more than got my money's worth out of that.\n\nAll in all if you aren't American and aren't that interested in the latest rosters etc, don't buy this game. Do buy 2k12. They don't charge you extra just for being from a non basketball country and it's hlaf the price and 95% as good.\n\nIf you are american and/or a basketball fan then by all means get the latest version.","June 21, 2014","true","82.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
