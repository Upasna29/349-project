The story was fun and engaging, and it felt like there were plenty of choices to be made. If you are a fan of Fantasy/Adventure I highly recommend you give it a try.\n\nThere were a couple of complaints I had though. One is that there were a number of typos and errors. Not game breaking, but annoying none the less. Another is that the choices you were given did not always match up well with what was in the text. Again, not huge, but annoying.\n\nMy final complaint is not so much with this game in particular, but with Choice of games in general. There is no way to easily go back a page or remake a choice, You have to restart the entire story in order to reread anything or change any choice. It does not take too long to quickly remake your choices and catch up to where you left off, but doing so can be very tedious. A simple back button or save option would go a long way to making these games (Books?) more enjoyable for those of us who like to quickly explore different options and paths.","March 14, 2015","true","5.1"," 76 of 97 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","76","97","2","3"

You play as an up and coming hero who travels to the city of Kendrickstone in search of glory. Instead, you are met with banditry, starvation, and other misfortune as the city is slowly being attacked. It is up to you to either save the city, or let it die in the grasp of the enemy.\n\n\nPros +Plenty of choices/actions for your character to choose, with added consequences for certain choices you make.\n+Reminiscent of R.L. Stine choose your adventure books\n+Achievements are easy to earn so far, though some take multiple run throughs of the game to earn.\n+Each chapter/section is relatively short.\n+Quests you are given by your benefactors will take some time to think of a strategy to be successful in them.\n+The game does not require an internet connection so you can play it when your net goes out\n+The game is very simple, you just have to like to read.\n+You can be a rogue, a bard, a warrior, or a wizard and you can customize gender, name, and certain background information about your character\n+You can do all three main quests with whichever class you choose.\n\n\nCons -No background music. The complete silence may be a game breaker for many. For others, like me, it is no issue as I can put on my favorite youtube playlist or listen to whatever is on my television.\n-There are numerous grammar and spelling errors throughout the game\n-There are no illustrations which would be nice to help one immerse themselves in the game\n-There is no easy save option so you can go back a page or two to remake a choice. You have to restart if you make a bad choice\n-Choices given to you don't always work well with how you envision your character and what is in the game.\n-The game felt very uninspired to me at times, but lets be honest, its hard to be super original in a fantasy themed game.\n-Relatively short game, even at 240,000 words\n\n\nNeutral\n+/- In the game you will undoubtedly encounter a beast or a mob who is stronger than you. You will lose. Instead of permanent death, you just get injured, then found by whomever sent you on the quest/task, and they will be disappointed but happy you're alive. I feel in choose your own adventure games, that death should be permanent.\n+/- No romance elements like one finds in most RPG games. Mixed feelings on this because the game stands on its own without it, but might be nice to have for immersion purposes.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nHonestly, its very hard to find a GOOD choose your own adventure game on steam, mostly because it's not a popular genre and is more popular in book format. Sure, there's flaws, every game has flaws. Most of these flaws are bearable and you can overlook as they aren't gamebreaking.  It has great replayability, many actions to choose from, and will remind you of your childhood when you read an R.L. Stine choose your adventure book from under the covers of your bed with a flashlight because you couldnt sleep. I recommend getting this game on a sale. While the game as it is, is cheap, the flaws of the game reduce its value. I rate this game a 7/10.","April 23, 2015","true","5.8"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","27","34","0","3"

Choice of Robots was in fact one of my favourite games of last year. However, I can't recomend The Hero of Kendrickstone beacuse it lacks a fundamental feature of games like these:\n\nChoice and Consenquence\n\nIt seems that no matter which path I go down I will always end up in the same spot. Do you chose to save the nobel knight or the innocent family from an onslaught of bandits? Really doesn't matter, as they will only show up again at the end of the game and nothing else will change (except you might get a bit more gold, depending on who your mentor is).\n\nThe only choice that affects your experience in any really big way is wether you're a Mage, Warrior, Rouge or Bard, and even then those only serve to lock you to a particular set of choices. In combat for example, a Warrior will never atempt to fight using magic, sneaky backstabs or talking the enemy to death. Instead, you'll have to opt for the melee option, as your character would get their ♥♥♥♥ kicked if you were to go with any other option.\n\nFor example, at the end of the game there is a choice that involves you going with a particular plan of action to stop a large threat. I was first excited for this and was curious to see the different effects it would have on the last portion of the game. But you know what the choices depended on? Whether you were Mage, Warrior, Rouge or Bard. They didn't even attempt to mask this, as the Royal Mage proposes the Mage plan, the Warrior the plan involving an all-out assault and ect. In fact, if you aren't a mage, one of the options is locked entirely away from you!\n\nNow, the solution might seem obvious: Multiclass! Pick two main stats to focus on (each class has its own stat) and become a Battlemage, or an Assasin Bard! Sadly, however, if you try to raise two stats at the same time, you will find you are lacking in your skills and that you aren't specialised, making it harder to pull off some of the skill checks later in the game.\n\nThis same problem was experienced in Choice of The Deathless, another Choice of Game, but that game had witty writing and good humor, good characters and a world I was interested to explore. With The Hero of Kendrickstone, the character development is almost non-existent. All the characters seem to be one thing, and one thing only, with no flaws to creat deeper, more believable characters.\n\nIn the end, I canno't recomend The Hero of Kendrickstone for these very reasons. The game lacks consenquence and your choices are, ironically, seeverly limited by the one big choice in the game, not to mention that the world in which you will be making these desicions (and its inhabitants) are all flat and boring. I tried for a long time to turn my opinion around on The Hero of Kendrickstone since I really, REALLY want to see more Chose Your Own Adventure games on Steam. But alas, I can't.\n\nThe Hero of Kendrickstone is simply not worth your purchase. If you're looking for a good CYOA, have a go at Choice of Robots, Choice of The Deathless, The Hero Rise Trilogy (particulary the last two games in the trilogy) or even some of the Hosted (not directly sponsored) games on Choice of Games website. I'd strongly sugest you check out Life of a Mobster and Life of a Wizard if you want to look into the latter.\n\nTL;DR : Restricting Choices, Lack of Consenquences, Poor World and Characters, Don't Buy\n\n","March 28, 2015","false","6.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

I played the game a few times, and found a shocking lack of consequences and evil alternative endings. I'm sure there's some out there, but with an 8% compassion rate, there should be some special options to side with the evil wizard or kill the duke.\n\nFar too short, and frankly it's an embarrassing piece of work when compared to Choice of Robots. Hardly any customization, cliche's left & right, a few errors here and there. Nothing groundbreaking.\n\nWana ignore my rant? Skip to the bottom! :D\n\n***Spoilers***\n\n\n\nIt also bothered be a lot that the main antagonist is mindlessly evil, with evil brainwashed drone bandits. I thought that he would actually take over the city - be interesting - and you'd have an epic, character-defining, individualized story that a few other choose-your own-adventure games out there offer. Instead, you get a quest from every main character (Which are hardly interesting, and you can'teven have a romance with any of them either) fight the bad guy, and Epilogue. Way too short!\n\nIt really hurts to see how basic this is, and how unnatural a lot of it feels. Why the living f*** would a knight implore the help of a wizards apprentice - that totally snubbed her by the by - to kill a vicious bear-wolvirene-badge-snake thing?\n\nThe game assumes I want to be an adventurer, and make a name for myself, which in a lot of cases, isn't true! It's very restrictive.\n\nThe world is something new-ish, I'll give them that, though riddled with cliches and hardly explored. You won't go more than a few miles away from the main city place, so if you're looking for an epic Dany from ASoIaF/GoT moving across the lands of Essos, building an army and reclaiming her throne, or a Frodo Baggins moving across Middle Earth, you best go somewhere else.\n\n\n***************\n\nFor 5 f***ing dollars, this game is not worth the buy. If it were 2 dollars, or maybe even 3, I would be alright, BUT 5?! I could probably buy a DVD of Lord of the Rings if I'm lucky. Choice of games really botched it here, and just jumped on the medieval bandwagon that blew up after Game of Thrones.\n\nI did learn what a retinue was, I was always curious about what that meant, but never looked it up.\n\nFinal verdict WITH full price:  3/10 not worth it\nFinal verdict with reduced price: 4/10 below average, but if you got time to kill, might as well, but don't plan to walk away feeling like you've gained something.\n\nI CRIED after Choice of Robots, okay? CRIED. And I'm not even a big fan of science fiction! You want to know WHY I cried? I felt attached to the character! I felt like it really was me, and I felt like I was really growing and making mistakes! You won't get anything like that out of this, no building a company then seeing it crumble and selling it because you're an idiot, or becoming a tyrant because you can, or even feeling the existential from dying as you hold the hand of your loved one. None of that here; I felt like I was controlling a drone.\n\nGo out and play D&D with some frineds, at least then you might get something out of it.\n\n","July 11, 2015","false","10.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

So many decisions to make and paths to follow surely it could be played at least 4 different times just due to the classes. However like previously stated it is extremely short and this is obviously to its detriment for an all around amazing narrative\n\nI WANT MOAR OF THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A more linear story is not necessarily the sign of a weaker writer. Contrary to popular belief, creating art in any form requires effort. While it can be a very enjoyable job, it is still a job, with all that entails.\n\nThe Hero of Kendrickstone is very, very linear. The main plot beats are always identical, what changes is almost entirely your skills and how you approach them. For some, that may be disappointing. If all you seek in games like this one is branching paths, you won't find many of them here and they probably will not differ as much as you would hope. It's all a matter of expectations.\n\nIf you hope for this game to be as flexible as some of the more diversely plotted choice of games efforts, you will  be disappointed. Your choices mostly  establish your "character class" (Warrior, Thief, Wizard, Bard), your choice of mentor if any (A knight who is a member of the nobility, the leader of a network of thieves and information gatherers, and a court wizard slavishly devoted to studying ancient artifacts), and your level of wealth and the resulting preparedness/lack of it you have to work with when situations become life-threatening. There are choices that lead to failure, injury, or even death, but if you go into this expecting myriad ways to become a corpse like in some physical choose-your-own-adventure stories, that doesn't describe The Hero of Kendrickstone either.\n\n\nFor better or worse, The Hero of Kendrickstone is simply a decent fantasy story and not much more than that. I enjoyed it regardless, and hope to see the author become more willing to take risks and make more elaborate branches in future efforts.","April 5, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is rich in content and it's ability to provoke the imagination of the reader. I highly reccomend this interactive novel to anyone interested in this specific genre or interested in fantasy/adventure based genres. A shame it had no audio but I didn't mind as I found playing certain classical songs fitted with certain chapters this provided a calm enviroment in which to read in. Story was very engaging and the characters well thought of.  A novel where YOU decide: fight or flight. I highly reccomend this to anyone hesitant to buy this.","July 14, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is written very well and flows nicely. I like to read the dialogue in voices that I think fit the character which is talking. This may inspire me to try my hand at writing a choose-your-own-adventure book just for a fun little challenge. Overall, I am happy I paid the $4.99 for this book/game because it is so well written and I can picture a lot of it in my mind.","May 6, 2015","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
