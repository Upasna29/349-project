This is an older game which does show it's age. I decided to pick it up since it was on sale for 5 bucks and I thought that Valkyrie wasn't too bad. This one I did not really enjoy. Tons of dialogue to sit through which is in Russian but at least it is subtitled. Lot's of walking back and forth which basically requires you to look at every object and discuss everything with everyone in order to move forward. Sometimes objects are missed because the cursor requires pin point accuracy. The story was long and boring and I got to the point where I was saying to myself "enough already,hurry up and get to the finish". Movement is also like a snail pace with no ability to cut to the next scene. Each new scene has to load first. The game is not terrible it just is not good in my opinion even for $5.","August 26, 2015","false","12.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"
