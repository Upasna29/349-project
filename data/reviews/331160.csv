"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamaroc/recommended/331160/","gamaroc","Gamaroc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamaroc/","26 products in account","SERIOUS NOTE - This game only works on some computers. I'm not sure why, so please be careful if you're considering on purchasing this game.\n\nSeriously, this is one of the best Disney game I've ever played! And one of the best driving games I’ve ever played :D\nI love this game!\nThe game is about Lightning McQueen and Cars.\n\nThe graphics are great. Quite appealing if you ask me. The town looks amazing with a lot of cars roaming around town, the best part is smashing into them and watching them fly and say funny quotes! The town looks like how you would expect it to look in the film. The characters look accurate to what they look like in the film which is pretty cool. The voice acting was totally awesome and pretty funny. For example, as McQueen overtakes a racer, he says "objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear", that cracked me up!\n\nThe game has free roam (best Disney Cars game IMO), you can drive as Lightning McQueen around 3 different areas including Radiator Springs, what I enjoy doing is ramming into other cars and watching them fly while they say funny things xD\nFree roam is pretty much calm and fun to explore!\n\nThe story doesn't really cover the film's story, it's kind of based on what happened after the story, so if you haven't watched the film then this game has got some spoilers for you. Spoilers, get it? The wing on the back of a car...?\n\nThere are a lot of fun tracks to race on and a variety of characters to choose from, from Lightning McQueen to Wingo, and a bunch of paint jobs to customise them with. The characters have different stats like top speed, acceleration, handling etc. The characters' personalities fit perfectly to the film, and they do make races lively with funny and memorable quotes: Like McQueen’s "KA-CHOW!" phrase xD   He says it in different ways, he shouts it and whispers it and some of them sound funny to me.\nThe bad thing about character selection is that there are some cars (like Luigi, Sarge and Fillmore etc.) who can race with you, but you can't race as them, so that kinda sucks :(\n\nThere are fun mini games added to the side, like Mater's Tractor Tipping game, where you have to wake up tractors without waking up getting caught by Frank, and also Sheriff's Pursuit, where you have to pursuit cars while they are moving fast. They are harder than they sound, but they are enjoyable. The bad part is that they are too long and take too much time, like around 10-15 minutes.\n\nThere are also Piston Cup races, each being 12 laps around. There is also a pit stop mini game with Guido as he changes the tires and refuels the car. But you could only play as the race cars in Piston Cup races, like Lightning McQueen, or Chick Hicks and Doc Hudson etc. not Mater or Ramone (lol) But I guess it makes sense, hence it being a Piston Cup race.\n\nNow onto the important part, the gameplay. The cars drive at different speeds and the drifting is handy, although it doesn't look like the drifting in the film, hence the "turn right to go left" quote. The wheel still goes in the direction you want to go, so the car just looks like it's making a hard turn instead of actually drifting. The gameplay is really fun, smooth and easy to master each track with various shortcuts.\nHowever sometimes the car decides to flip and go upside down if you try to crash yourself, it sounds funny and it makes up for it because it is funny lol.  Making contact with other racers will make your car slower which isn't what I'd expect from a racing game, but they do talk after collision which is a good thing.\n\nThis game has controller support, so you can play 2 player split-screen multiplayer with your friend, which is a pretty fun addition.\n\nThis game is friendly towards kids alright? So don't go wrecking other cars lol, because they don't show damage marks like scratches or dents.\n\nOr if you want to get straight into the action, use cheat codes to unlock all characters and race tracks and there you have it :D\nbtw there are other cheats like unlimited boost which is fun!\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing by the way, like awesome tracks from Bruno Coon and great music like "Here I Am" by the Explosion, and "Free Ride" from Edgar Winter Group, the soundtrack is addictive so listen to it if you dare XD\n\nThe only bad thing about this PC version (Steam version, not on consoles) is the lighting at night.\nBecause the game is old and wasn't really updated, when playing mini games and races in night, it's too dark to see or drive, which is annoying and is preventing me from fully completing the game. So I hope that gets fixed soon...\n\nThe game is pretty and awesome, quite classic! The graphics are pretty good for a 2006 game. I first played it on PS2 and was addicted to it due to its awesomeness! I recommend this to any Cars fan, or racing fan. Because this game is fun!","February 28, 2015","true","23.2"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","88","46","52","13","1"

I have been running it in adim with the old compatablity mode. So if you are wondering does this work. Well mine does on a 4790k,980ti, 16gig ram, and Win 10.\nGame play is good and is an upgrade to the consoles unlike Cars 2.\nGraphics are older but ok However! This game runs at 30fps with no option to turn it off and crashing into things always gives a slight pause in the hub world. You should check out Mater National if you are interested in this. Most of the game is the same but it does not support widescreen. Though it is 60fps! with much better textures. More hub world and new tracks. I perfer over this older verion.\nThat being said the story and racing is all very good. The hub world is also a nice touch.\nI still recommend this game because it is fun. And that is the most important thing.","December 22, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","4"
