A really simple concept was put forth by the developer of moving boxes and pushing buttons in order to advance to the next room. Some puzzles were simple and easy to see, other took quite a bit of thought on which boxes to be moved first and/or which box should press down that button. While these thoughts are running through your head, you also need to make sure you can swap from different forms (wolf and human) which allow you to do certain things in each form that you can't do in the other.\n\nGood humor, interesting back story, and excellent puzzles kept me hooked throughout this game and allowed me to finish it completely.\n\n10/10","February 4, 2014","true","12.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is by the same devs that did Jolly Rover which I also recommended! The game is basically tons of sokobans type of puzzles stringed together with awesome, witty, hilarious (lol at times) dialogue and a funny story. You have some pretty interesting characters and talking to them usually nets some sidequests of which there are surprisingly plenty! The game itself has quite some items to collect. Gold (loot) which are usually hidden in some weird places and comic scraps. The latter, once you collect all the scraps for a page, it unlock and turn itself into a full page colored comic! All these comics give the backstory of the main characters. I personally find them a nice touch.\n\nBy the time I completed the main story, I am only about 88% (there's a stats bar at the corner) done. There are also some hidden areas and I am not talking about those areas behind those security doors. No spoilers but there is really quite plenty to do here. Furthermore, every puzzle room you complete, upon returning, you will realize that the reset button has morphed into a commentary button. You get to read a few short lines of the devs commentary and they are quite worth reading. One little bug I had was that my achievement count for comic scraps got stuck at 3/47 but luckily upon finding all of them, the achievement triggered. Another little qualm was that upon completing the game (all of it), the stats bar shows 99%. It is a bug if you read the forums.","September 16, 2013","true","20.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

If you have a fetish for boxes you can stop reading and just buy it. The game creatively uses shapeshifting to limit and enable particular movements or abilities, eg. werewolf form you can push crates but can't cross water amongst other thing. There are nice puzzles to be found, but the difficultly level is all over the place. Fortunately the game allows you to skip rooms so you can progress with the story and you can solve the rooms later. Where the game really shines is the dialogue. It's funny/witty/stupid with the charm of all three. Because of the number of rooms the game seems to approach mundane especially as some of the harder rooms you spend a lot of time to get something simple done and just have to restart if you do a single mistake, but the dialogue, unusual characters, commentary and secrets kept me intrigued until I finished everything.","December 25, 2012","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What makes this game special is you get a medallion from a museum that allows you to transform into a wolf. This wolf form is the only way to move objects within the world, however your human form, which you can switch to and from in moonlight, allows you to hit switches swim and open doors. The story is ok but what really shines is the world and all of the side quest within it. The game has a lot of optional content and even more is made available after you complete the story. In certain areas you can unlock safes that have comic books pieces in them that when put together make a nice visual story. You can also find money that can be spent on improving your house or unlocking music and art. The puzzles start out easy but get challenging quick. Luckily there is a hint system that gives you two hints and the option to skip the puzzle and come back to solve it later. The game length really varies on what you want out of the game. If you try to tackle all of the tasks in the game you could easily get 12 hours out of it. If you want to try a block pushing puzzle game you really can't go wrong with MacGuffin's Curse.","November 27, 2013","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A puzzle game with a very interesting story full of witty humor, MacGuffin's Curse proves that an old idea can be recycled & yield an interesting result. The puzzles are accentuated by the ability to shape-shift into a werewolf & the changing scenery helps break the monotone nature of puzzle games in general. Only negative note is playing with an Xbox 360 controller: while using the analog stick it feels loose but this is expected on games with 4 axes controls. You can play with the d pad instead but that feels awkward, although it gives greater control.\n\nOverall I feel that this one will be a hidden gem as I fear that not many people will have the guts to try it.","December 24, 2013","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't a point-n-click adventure; this is over 150 9-by-11 tiled rooms of puzzle madness. Only a few of them are brain-busters, but by the time this is over, you'll probably feel tired of them. Still, the humor has its moments (but isn't for everyone) and the devs' earnestness shines through.

You play as a magacian who gets transformed into a werewolf and must save the city from the evil millionare.\nGenere: Grid based puzzle\n\nYea! The art of the game is exceptional and fits the theme very well, built in hint and room solver feature is nice. Werewolfs!\n\nMeh! Puzzle difficulty is all over the place, rooms in the begining of a section are harder while the last few puzzles of the game take almost nothing to solve. Game brags about its humor but that comes off very meh.\n\nBleh! Game quickly becomes tedious and repetitive! Quite a few times you have to move a crate run back to transform run back then repeat. Boss was a joke after the build up. Werewolf mode you cant close a door but can push a crate???\n\n\nThe lowdown: While the art direction is awesome, everything else seems to falter. The werewolf bit is a joke only there for a run of the mill story and gameplay limiter. After the first hour or two it becomes repetitive and only enjoyable in short play bursts of a few rooms at a time. Towards the end i was so bored and fed up I was just using the autosolver on the most tedious of rooms so I could finish. This game is only worth it at a huge discount and even then if your fan of this genre of puzzlers.\n\n2/5\n\n","May 24, 2014","false","6.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I liked getting gold and furnishing the apartment although it would have been nice to also spruce up the walls, floor and remove the litter laying there cuz furniture can only go so far in making your home a nice place to look and live in.\n\nMy only other pet peeve is that while I got all achievements and did what I assume are all quests and got all the comic pieces... I'm still NOT at all hundred percent.  This would mean numerous backtracking trying to figure out the one spot I somehow missed.  If only there was a percentage on the little quick map buttons that let you know which area needs the actual backtracking to.\n\nOverall, a cute little game to kill time with.","November 23, 2014","true","28.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Climb through windows, hold down switches with crates, alternate between the skillsets of man and wolf. The next room continues the story, with maybe another side-quest, treasure, or a new interaction with some great dialogue choices. Addictive, inexpensive and highly recommended.","April 24, 2012","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is definitely one of them:\nI hadn't heard of the game before and was just a bit curious what it was. I expected to be bored very soon - but couldn't play anything else until four days later, when I had completed everything.\n\nMacGuffin's Curse is puzzle game made by some witty and talented Australians. You navigate MacGuffin, an anti-hero-turned-werewolf, through lots of boxes, occasionally pushing them around to open exits and such. The story is well-crafted and offers a lot of funny as well as some touching moments. The environments are fantastic, too, and some lunatic even took the time to write a seperate description for every chair, lantern, picture or other item you come across. Needless to say, I had to read every single one so I wouldn't miss anything. The puzzles hardly ever become boring or frustrating. Another thing I really liked was the developer commentary. It is always interesting to get a little glimpse into the process that went into making a game.\n\nOverall I have nothing negative to say. Unless you really don't like puzzle games or indies you should give this one a shot!","November 22, 2012","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't stand half baked self aware humor, yet I find myself laughing at the game's flavor text. I despise cartoony and goofy characters and plots, yet I really want to get the protagonsist out of the rut he's in.\n\nThis is a game I went into expecting to hate and yet I find it consuming me late into the night. The puzzles are really good and I take great satisfaction in completing them. The plot and amusing dialogue is just icing on the cake. Mind you I haven't finished the story but even if it does take a ♥♥♥♥ it wouldn't matter because I do the puzzles because they're fun, not to avance the plot.\n\nSeriously, why I do I have to read all the flavor text in both human and werewolf form?","November 11, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/58230/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","MacGuffin's Curse is a gem of a puzzle adventure game. You steal this amulet that gets permanently attached to you which allows you to change into a werewolf using moonlight. Using that ability, you then maneuver through a maze of puzzles in which you must move a battery into a slot which powers the door to the next location. The puzzles range from simple to challenging. You have certain abilities and restrictions in wolf form such as moving objects which you can't do when in human form. But in human form, you can use terminals and move through water which you can't do in wolf form. The shape shifting element plus the different puzzle rules for each character really makes for a great mental workout.\n\nOn top of the great puzzles they throw in a cool story and a few side missions to keep things interesting. Some of the later missions seem to end up being fetch quests, but they weren't excruciatingly painful to deal with.\n\nThe game is really well balanced and has a decent coat of polish on it. It has great music too and offers a lot of attention to detail. Puzzle lovers can't go wrong here. Check it out.","January 1, 2013","true","21.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A puzzle game based around block moving, you follow the adventures of a thief that steals an amulet which let's him transform into a warewolf at will but only in moonlight. (As is commonly followed by many warewolf stories.) With an interesting cast of people and great replay experience, if you love puzzles, this will keep you entertained for hours, trying to buy every single upgrade for your house. Reccomended if you love puzzles and mystery, not if you don't like that stuff.","October 4, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
