You unlocked many weopons each time you ranked up, and had many weopon upgrades and costomizable features. Many weopons were only used in certain maps, for example, a l968 sniper rifle (I think thats the name) wasnt used on Nuketown because it would get owned by famas and galils all the time. This game needs some serios addons however, as it became boring at higher ranks. I think the upgrades that should be added are:\n1.voice comunication\n2.Larger maps\n3.more weopons & equipment\n4.rides such as tanks-jeeps-bikes\n5.more camos (the only good one is tiger)\nI hope you guys enjoyed this quick review on Black ops - mac edition.\nGOLDIE OUT!","December 24, 2013","true","11.8"," 27 of 50 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","27","50","0","6"

I mean, ive always enjoyed it, but ive never really had the chance to play it and look at all the aspects of it, but not until now (DUH DUH DUUUUUUH). For the past 7 or 8 months or so, I have been an avid player of CS:GO, and decided I needed a break. Therefore, I sold my skins and bought this game. To be honest, im pleasently surprised at the quality of this port ive gotten.\n•YES, the servers are only for mac players.\n•YES, the graphics kinda stink\n•YES, its a formulaic (that means its repetitive, guys)\n•WTF IT COSTS $40\n\nHOWEVER.\n\n•The loading times on this game are to be honest amazing for a mac. the game starts up in a few seconds, i can switch between single and multiplayer quickly, and I dont have to wait for anything. There is an option to give the shader a few seconds to warm up before you play, but you can easily turn it off and reduce the load time to a quarter of what it was.\n• Graphics dont matter. Period. Macs are crap anyway, so expect it.\n• It doesnt matter that its been done before, this game is still fun. Zombies and Multiplayer are both really fun, and yes, even singleplayer has its moments.\n• I dont really have an excuse about the whole cost thing, and it is a bit much for an old game, but its the only one with zombies on it and i would personally pay $20 just for zombies itself. (which i really kinda just sorta did.)\n• And what i believe is the most important thing, is that it DOESN'T CRASH. In terms of it's relation to cs:go, Black Ops is a much higher quality port. CS:GO for mac crashes (from personal experience) about 3 times every 2 comp games. It is really nice to have gameplay which is not randomly interrupted to be banned from the ability to play the game for several days.\n\nOverall, I give it the numerical reprisentation of the relationship between the two loveable characters Bert And Ernie on the high quality children's show Sesame Street. So basically, like a 6.5/10 for pc games and like a 9.5/10 for mac games.   If you have the money and are willing to put at least like 40 hours into the game (which is very easy to do), then i call that worth it cuz 1$=1 hour of loading screen free enjoyment.","December 10, 2014","true","22.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","3"

However, Black Ops is the most "on rails" I have ever experienced from CoD and that's saying a lot.\n\nYou know how most games (including CoD) will start with some training exercise, where some sargeant tells you to "go over there and shoot some targets. now go over there and throw a grenade"...?  In this case, Black Ops feels like that for the ENTIRE GAME.  You are moving from one cutscene to the next but in betwen you have to shoot a bunch of guys, and maybe press a special key at a special time.\n\nI liked the earlier CoD games that were more free-form and would allow you choose the order in which you complete objecttives (CoD2) or the route you choose to take.\nBlack Ops had none of that.  It is a traning exercise where the targets that appear out of nowhere happen to move around a bit.","March 9","false","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There have been few changes to make the gameplay better. Perhaps one could say the weapons are different in Black Ops, but is that really an improvement? No... The graphics are improved in this version of COD, but are nothing to the physics of Battlefield or Ghost Recon. I am not impressed.\n\nGameplay for multiplayer is great for COD, but my primary dissapointment with COD has always been the lack of dedicated servers hosted by the publisher. While Black Ops solved the issue with MW2 (where one random player became the host computer —therefore opening the door right up for hacking) by allowing one to rent a dedicated server, you still have to pay money to rent a server! Seriously?! You mean me and the many other players have to pay $15/mo for servers? Nice move.\n\nOverall, I would not reccomend this game: you deserve better. COD is meant to be a console game and is downgraded for PC/Mac. Spend a few extra dollars and get Battlefield, a game designed for computers and downgraded for consoles.","June 19, 2014","false","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The campaign is awesome (for the most part) and I love the guns in this one, they aren't crazy futuristic guns like in every other COD but they are real cool old guns. The multiplayer is fantastic in its customization and maps as well as the zombies mode which is legendary. With all of this said, I still cannot reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you just want to play multiplayer, then DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The campaign is so glitchy and most times if you die even once the game freezes and you have to force quit and restart from the beggining, it is so ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. The servers for zombie mode are ♥♥♥♥ing dead as ♥♥♥♥ so you really can only play solo because there still is no private lobbies (WTF?!?). Even the multiplayer servers are pretty much dead with there only being like 2 or 3 servers active and the hosts are constantly changing the rules for playing getting you kicked out for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason. It is so sad to see such an amazing game go down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like this just because the devs have turned a blind eye on it. So as a quick recap, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you ONLY want to play solo zombies or on a (yes I mean "a" because good luck finding another lobby to play in) faccist ruled server for multiplayer.","February 7","false","14.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

(£30.00 for a 3 year game?!?!?) Which was a terrible mistake.                                                                                                             The first thing that comes to mind is that there is no steam support, the game opens in a seperate window. This leads to Friend notifications being oddly placed in the corner of the screen. This can lead to the covering of vital information such as the minimap, ammo -_-. It also means I can't chat to my friends in game. In order to speak with them, I have to exit the damn game. Why? Is it that hard just to reskin the PC version of the game? That was what I was expecting and hoping for. But I digress. The Second thing that you will probably be checking is the Options menu. The first thing that pops out is that there is NO FOV SLIDER. I must have spent 10 minutes looking for it, and when I finally decided that it wasn't there, I was really annoyed. I don't see why companies don't think that having changeable FOV is not a big deal. For me it was Irritating to my eyes, and I had to take short breaks at intervals. Also, the graphics. The texture quality ONLY GOES UP TO 1200 BY 800. EVEN TEAM FORTRESS 2 HAS 2000 BY SOMETHING AND THAT GAME IS SEVEN. YEARS. OLD.                                                       Great game by the way.                                                                                                                                                               So after that, I decided to play Zombies. My internet was down at the time, and what happened next was probably the single most annoying thing in the game. I COULD NOT PLAY SOLO OFFLINE. WHY?!? What is the point of having a Solo mode if I can't play while I've taken it out? I thought that was the point of a laptop; you can take it with you when you need it.                    I tried to load up Shangri-La, one of my favourite maps because of it's challenging, yet rewarding nature. But It failed to load THREE TIMES, the game crashing on every one of them!                                                                                                                             I won't touch on how there are approximately ZERO people to play with, since I am a solo player and I don't play with randoms, as I have had several bad experiences with less experienced players. But since Aspyr was too lazy, they did not put in cross-platform support in. They really shot themselves in the foot here, as 90% of the servers that THEY HAVE BOUGHT ARE NOT BEING USED. I only found one server with players on it, and it wasn't even full. Perhaps 3 on weekdays.                         In short, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

Every time I come to what I think is supposed to be a save game screen the game crashes, forcing me to quit the game and restart.  I checked with Asypr support some time ago and they didn't help and closed the ticket without solving the problem.  This game so far was a BIG waste of money.","May 28","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
