I wish people would get serious about reviews.\n\nI was a backer during on kickstarter for this project, and let me start off by saying that this game is not worth the price.\n\nIf you are looking for something ecchi or even a good story look for other visual novels.\n\nPros:\n*Made by a western team\n*The game art brings up the game standard\n\nCons:\n*Mouth animations are way off, if done right it would be a perfect feature but this just ruins the voice acting\n*Example, when the text says Hmmm? the mouth will move as if the person were talking\n*The price is to high for the amount of gameplay.. Heh I even got this for £20 when i backed it, look at the price now\n*Rushed story\n*Total of 9 endings, 2 of which are at the start so you can barely call them a proper ending.\n*Most of the choices you make won't have a big effect on anything. Only 1 choice will really make an impact on certain endings\n*The volume of the voice acting is not leveled, it'll go from low to high in the most weird places\n*Music is tiring and doesn't add anything, would suggest turning it off\n*"A new day dawns." That is not a clock.\n*Mediocre voiceacting\n\nI was banned from the steam community of Divine slice of Life for posting about review manipulation.. So clearly trying to silence me I guess.. Don't filter opinions for the public to see..\nThe respond can be found here: http://i.imgur.com/oLO2ih1.png\nPM if you are interested in the entire post I made about the review manipulation. :>\nGiving someone the game key and writing the review for them is still manipulation, even if you want to go with the "friends" part.\nTrying to avoid a launch like Beach Bounce..

And don't make the focus "making money" over making a game for people to enjoy.","October 24, 2015","false","14.0"," 282 of 308 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","282","308","4","45"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Belgerum/recommended/348540/","Belgerum","Somebody to Love","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Belgerum/","395 products in account","To summarize, I wanted to like this game so much, but there are too many flaws to overlook. The concept is original, and the visuals are pretty, but the game lacks in length, writing quality, voice acting quality, and good, unique characters.\n\nNaming the positives of this game is easy, as they are exactly what the game flaunts most in promotions.\n\n- The artwork and visuals flow well, and look good. Some might disagree, but I like the charm, and it definitely adds to the game's quality.\n- The story concept is a relatively good one. Two goddesses suddenly attach themselves to a random guy, and he has to deal with everyday life while they call him Zeus, the king of gods, fawn on him, compete for his affections, and generally make his life a hectic mess. If the game was executed better, this would have been a fabulous opportunity for comedy gold, awkwardness aplenty, and a diverse cast.\n- The game has a good number of endings, with outcome diversity that makes them at least worthwhile to see how they differ.\n- The music is decent and fits the mood, though it isn't the highest quality I've heard from a visual novel.\n\nDespite the positives, there are many issues with the game that leave a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n- Length. The game claims to have 5-6 hours of play time if you play through all the endings. It took me closer to 4 hours, though that might be due to my reading pace. Still, however, I don't think that it's quite how much as I expected.\n- Voice acting. I'm not the best judge for voices, but those that the game used didn't sound very professional in quality. The voices weren't normalized to a set volume, clearly used recording equipment of varying quality and sound, and generally seem more thrown together as a promotional feature than crafted to enhance the story.\n\nIn my opinion, this game's writing quality is what holds it back the most. It's rushed, repetitive, and worst of all, fails to make its characters unique besides their appearance.\n\n- The game is rushed. There isn't a lot of conflict, except choosing between which girl you want to get intimate with, with a few other choices that determine good/bad endings. The game skips over time periods frequently, to the point where I lost track of what day it was many times. Plenty of things go unexplained about the goddesses' cultural differences, reduced to just a few lines of explanation. There's also a lack of casual talk and events that aren't crutial to the plot. The game just passes by, preferring to move on with the story content and choices instead of taking the time to give the reader some flavor to savor, and develop the characters.\n- The game repeats itself often. For example, in the first two endings in the game, (which happen within the first 20-30 minutes of play) the script is literally a copy+paste, with two characters swapped out, and a few names changed in the text. I would have much preferred some variety in both the characters and the script for those individual endings. I would think that The goddess of wisdom and justice would react different to the goddess of love if either is robbed of their divinity and impregnated by a dude they just met. The lines are exactly the same for the two, right down to the "You're going to get a job to support the baby!" Seriously, how hard is it to rewrite the scenes, or at least make the girl's lines differ? Maybe "To think that I could dishonor the name of the goddess of wisdom and be tricked so easily... Well, now it's time for you to face the consquences of your folly!" for Ryn, or "Dammit! With charms and magic, I could've gotten any guy I wanted, but now I'm stuck with you as a stinking mortal. Great job, loverboy!" for Yui?\nThat isn't all of it, though. Even the good endings for each of the goddesses are eerily similar, with lines that don't differ much at all. The bad endings share a lot of the same text as well. This makes replaying the game for new routes tedious in a lot of ways.\n- The characters aren't unique. While the game does have an interesting premise, it doesn't do much with its characters at all. The two goddesses seem like copies of each other in terms of personality, history and background, power level, and so many other things, that choosing between them seemed meaningless. Given how much copy+paste text they seem to share, I think I could almost replace them in my mind with one single goddess character, and the story wouldn't be much different. The other two heroines are better, but both are classmates with the protagonist, and still seem very similar. They also fall into the "childhood friend" and "popular girl" tropes pretty solidly, not trying to be much different from what consumers have seen time and again.\n\nFor consumers,\nThis game might look attractive, but it has a lot of flaws. If you really like the concept, or you're not picky about quality, you can pick it up for a decently good time, but don't expect it to leave you with a fulfilling, meaningful experience like other visual novels might.\n\nFor the game devs,\nYour game is not bad, and it gave me a good run for the time I spent with it, but you haven't put in quite the amount of effort it needs to seem professional, and worth my time and money. To improve your game, I'd highly suggest working on the script, rewriting repetitive scenes, and making the characters more unique and genuine. The script is the core of the reader's experience, and while great visuals and art improve the game, and voice acting is a lovely feature when done right, it won't compensate for lazy, repetitive writing. When you're working on your next game or improving this one, make sure to evaluate your priorities, and make sure your game is appealing in every aspect.\n\n\nNote: I played the Mangagamer Adult Version, so some differences may be apparent between that and the steam version.","October 25, 2015","false","2.5"," 62 of 73 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","62","73","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/recommended/348540/","Imban","Imban","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Imban/","1577 products in account","This is kind of like Winged Cloud's Sakura series, really, except that it's a poorly put together erotic visual novel rather than a poorly put together fanservice visual novel. On the plus side, it has English voice acting, which is a nice touch even if it's oddly quiet in a lot of scenes, such that I could barely hear it even after turning the music volume down to like 20% and leaving the voice volume at 100%. On the minus side... well, everything else.\n\nThe biggest technical complaint I had with Divine Slice of Life was how obtuse a lot of the choices are in terms of what they affect - basically every choice affects which ending you get, but it's rarely clear why or how it should when you're making it... or ever, sometimes. Beyond that, it's just clumsily written romantic/sexual hijinks over a few days, with the two main girls often sharing the same lines in different branches despite being incredibly different in personality when they get their own lines and plenty of writing that just made me think the writer was a space squid attempting to understand how human relationships work.\n\nAlso it's pretty low quality as porn if that's why you're interested in it. Steam isn't really for porns, but if you're considering this for prurient reasons you should really not do that.\n\nIt's also fairly short - despite what the designer has said about five hours, I finished up with the game in 99 minutes, a good bit of which I spent trying to figure out what choices were making me automatically pick Ryn at the end, since the ones that affect that mostly seem to have little to no bearing on anything.\n\nSo yeah. Not recommended to anyone, might well be worse than Winged Cloud's similar Sakura Angels.","November 24, 2015","false","8.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

The fac that it was made by a Western team doesn't elevate its status in the least bit, other than the fact that the art work was stellar.\n\nThe voice acting and lip-syncing were off to the point that a character would continuously make lip movements although only interjections or very short sentneces were made. The voice acting had awkward volumes at some points in the game and it wasn't even of decent quality to boot.\n\nThe story was largely unaffected by most of the choices except for a few, putting very little weight and actual thinking into each choice being made. Two of the bad endings were basically copied and pasted with different voices, which is honestly a lack of effort on AJTilley's side. The story was also rushed to the point that I had to replay it just to properly understand what happened after making a couple of choices.\n\nI'm no visual novel connoisseur, but I've played through enough of them to know this barely hits the level of mediocrety. Also if you're curious as to whether or not you should get the MG version or the Steam version, there is honestly next to no difference except for the rather soft and unfortunately forced H-scenes that pop up every here and there. You're better off spending your money on a decent on either a better visual novel on steam(I reccomend Cho Dengeki Stryker) or any other game for that matter that isn't this.\n\nP.S. Mangagamer usually does shell out pretty good content(take eden* for example) so you can check out their other works and not be disappointed by this, lack  of better words, awful visual novel.\n\n","October 25, 2015","false","0.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

It is a little hard to explain without spoiling the story, but i'll just mention that you meet 2 goddesses during the story, so it is a bit surreal.\n\nAlso, i'd like to mention that I played this game mostly to unlock the achievement, I do not really enjoy Visual Novels, but I did read every lines of text this game had to offer.\n\nThe story is fine, but it is not really interesting enough. It's just too mainstream, there's nothing really unique about it. Also i've noticed that they re-used some dialogues from one goddess to the other one. Exactly the same dialogue. That looks really lazy, but, whatever.\n\nThere is 9 endings or so and "your decisions matters", but honestly, it's like 10-15 minutes of talking and then you have to choose from 2 or 3 options. There's barely any choices to be made in this game and some endings are incredibly short. It took me 2 hours to finish all 9 endings while reading every dialogues once, it's a very short game!\n\nSome of the voiceacting was hard to hear, their volume was too low for some reason, I tried lowering the music but I quickly noticed that some dialogues were at 100% volume and some were at maybe 10-20%, coding bug, probably. The voiceacting is pretty meh either way.\n\nThe graphics and the music are both alright, there was only 1 bug that i've noticed, so that's all pretty fine. Sadly, the game falls short in the end, because the story is kind of bland and the fact that you pretty much have only about 10 choices to make during your playthrough of the game.\n\nI do not recommend Divine Slice of Life, I guess it's an ok visual novel but I did not enjoy it too much. Side note: There is no nudity in this game as suggested in the tags. I heard about patches for it, but I am not interested in those nor do I know if they really exist.","January 10","false","5.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

There are good endings and bad endings as usual. However, the game is REALLY short. It's so short, that I finished every single route and ending in 1.5 hours... The choices you make do not really affect the dialogue so when you want to go back to another route, it is the same dialogue thing over and over again. That made the game rather boring and some of the routes seemed rather forced. In fact, speaking about forced, the whole game is very forced and unnatural. There really is little character development and background provided and overall rather lackluster.\n\nOn the other hand, the game has well made visuals and the music is actually not bad at all. The pictures actually look nice unlike some other steam VNs. Another part that was nice was that there was full audio for every dialogue. Even though I say it is nice, some of the voices seemed a bit forced as well and there was no option for Japanese audio. I can't read, write, or really understand Japanese, but it seemed more natural if you have a Japanese audio option considering all the names are in Japanese and the story takes place in Japan.\n\nOverall, a very shallow game that is rather expensive for its full price. I cannot recommend this game because the rating I give to it will be too low, but it is not the worst VN on steam by far.

But this game is WAY TOO SHORT for being that expensive. Seriously, I think it’s even shorter than Beach Bounce?\nThe character development is poor, you can’t feel sympathy for any of the girls… I know it was meant to be fan service, but this VN takes it too far. And that’s it. There’s not much to talk about this game since there’s barely a good amount of gameplay. Everything feels so forced, especially the ecchi scenes. VA was ok, but kinda annoying sometimes.\n\nAlso, if this game was made by a western group, why make all the characters Japanese? VA was in English, so… Why? Maybe I’m thinking too much, I don’t know.\n\n3/10. I only gave 3 points because the art style, like I said, is good/decent. But the story, which should be the main focus, is a complete disaster. Get this game on a bundle, seriously. Or on a super sale, like -90%.

And more's the pity, actually.  If it was, it'd be more laughable at least.  The most that can be said for it is that it's weird and unnecessary.  And that sounds silly to say over a video game, which are primarily time wasters to begin with, and dating sims which tend to skew towards really freaking bizarre.  But in this case, it's the best words for it.  I love VNs and dating sims and even harem games, but nothing about this stands out at all. There was a lot of wasted potential regarding the routes and "divinity" (spoilers: You're Zeus) that just never got used (you give me a reincarnation of Athena and Aphrodite, and they do nothing with that characterization, wtf).  It's a little too cliche well beyond familiarity, and honestly, save your money and get a different one instead.  Even most of the free games of this genre are a lot better.\n\nThat said, it's still not bad, but that's what makes it so unnecessary.  It's kind of difficult to glean much other than cards out of the game tbqh.  And at the end I was simply left with a sense of "well that was weird," and nothing more.  And given that I love absolute crackfic series, it wasn't even good weird or bad weird or funny weird.  Just weird and vaguely pointless.  I do want to see more and better from the artists, but hopefully paired with better writers.","February 18","false","20.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I like the writing for the most part, and the characters are likeable, but there simply isn't enough content (certainly not enough to justify the price tag). The game description lists 5-6 hours, but I believe that only applies if you re-read everything on every route. The problem with that is that about 85-90% of the content is the same for every route, meaning you can skip most of the game on a second playthrough. It took me about an hour to finish the game once (will vary with your own reading speed) and after that another route took about 10 minutes because the large dialogue sections (the cafe scene, for example) are the same regardless of what chaoices you make. There also aren't very many choices, but again, that ties into the length issue. If you get this in a bundle (as I did), then it is worth playing at least once, but I really don't think you'll get what you expect if you pay regular price for it.\n\nAs a side note, I will say that the colouring is nice, though the art does tend to lean a little to the rudamentary side (as well there are some perspective issues, unless our protagonist is 7 feet tall). The game is built using RenPy, so it does techincally work, but if you want to hear any of the voice acting (which varies, but for the most part isn't bad) you'll need to turn down the music and crank your speakers, as the audio mix is way off.\n\nAs of right now, I've completed 2 routes. I may go back and view the others. I really wish Steam had a ratings scale instead of the binary system it currently uses, because to outright give this game a thumbs down feels unfair. That being said, I can't really justify a thumbs up either. If I were able to, I'd give this game anywhere from a 4 to a 6, depending on the moment. Do with that information what you will, but I hope you enjoy it if you decide to give it a go.","February 22","false","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I never made it to the good end with either demigodess, but the ends that I reached, inclusive of the good one with your best friend, were short.\n\nIt's strange to say that and ending was short and yet managed to be a little gratifying, but there it is. Was it pleasant and feel-good? Yeah, for sure. Satisfying? You don't have the time to get a good grasp on some characters so not entirely.\n\nAll in all, the game is longer than I had first thought as I had made the assumption that all ends were as short as the ones I stumbled upon, but there is more than meets the eye.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/luyao795/recommended/348540/","luyao795","CycloneInAmes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/luyao795/","1090 products in account","English:This is a really good visual novel with English dubs, which is not that common to see. Moreover, it certainly has some potential to become much better. Pros and cons are listed as follows: Warning: Hidden content contains spoilers.Pros:\nEnglish dubs: So far I only find three visual novels with English dubs: HuniePop (if you call it a visual novel which is not quite correct), Divine Slice of Life and Sakura Spirit (which I haven't started yet but probably will soon). It does feel weird in the beginning, but as you are playing, you can feel that it works really well.\nInteresting conversations: I have to admit that I really like conversations in this game. Most of them are really funny and some are even hilarious. I literally cannot stop laughing when Taka was asking Aaki about those two demigods Yui and Ryn.\nDecent character design: I am usually not a fan of character design of Western animes or mangas because my aesthetic standard is really different from those Western developers. However, I really love character design for this game, and combine those characters with Japanese names? Fantastic.Except the full names of Yui Aphrodite and Ryn Athena. Again, it is hilarious.Cons:\nLength of the game: This may be the most obvious flaw for anyone who purchased this game. Yes the game is too short to tell an excellent story. Don't get me wrong. It does tell a good story, but not good enough to be excellent.They can totally add much more content before Aaki had sex with Akame. Just add more funny conversations.\nFrequent use of "Why you...!": This is really a detailed little flaw. I understand "Why you...!" is strong and can reflect the feeling of the speaker, but trust me, people will get bored when hearing this sentence over and over again. Change it to some other words. Diversity of lines is really an essential aspect of an excellent visual novel.\nLack of function in choices: So far I have got 3 endings, #1, #2 and 5 times of #6. Why 5 times? Because a lot of choices you made during the game do not change the direction of the ending at all. There are only probably about 7-8 choices for eaching complete game and at least half of them won't change the direction whatsoever. Again, please add more content and increase the diversity for both lines and choices. That would be an amazing game.Conclusion:\nThat being said, unless you are a big fan of visual novels with English dubs, I still do not recommend you to pick this up for full retail price. That doesn't mean that this game is bad, it is definitely not. It only means that this game has a great potential to become much better and by that time, people will be more willing to buy this game without hesitation because it is a fabulous game.\n\n简体中文：非常好的一部难得一见的英文配音的视觉小说。但是这款游戏还有潜力变得更好。优缺点将在下方一一列出： 警告：隐藏内容包含剧透！优点：\n英文配音：目前为止我只见过三部英文配音的视觉小说：HuniePop（如果你把这游戏也算作是视觉小说的话）、Divine Slice of Life和Sakura Spirit（很惭愧文明观球的游戏至今还没玩过）。刚开始玩的话确实会感觉有些别扭但是慢慢玩下去就会发现其实配音和游戏融合得非常好。\n有趣的对话：这游戏的对话确实是非常有意思。 大多数都还挺搞笑的而且有些对话简直逗比到极点... Taka问主人公Aaki关于那两个半神Yui和Ryn的时候真心是笑得停不下来>_<\n精美的人物形象：通常我并不喜欢西方动漫和漫画中的人物形象因为我个人的审美观和制作者的审美观差别实在是有点大。 但是这游戏的人物形象做得非常符合我的审美，而且把这人物形象和日本名字结合起来简直酷炫。当然Yui Aphrodite和Ryn Athena的全名不算…… 但是她们的全名相当搞笑～缺点：\n游戏长度：这应该是每个买了这个游戏的人能发现的最明显的缺陷了。没错，游戏长度太短以至于并没有讲述出一个非常精美的故事。当然我不是说这游戏的故事讲得不好。故事还是挺不错的，但是还没好到精美的程度。拜托啊在Aaki和Akame嘿咻之前明明可以多加一些内容的好不好！ 只要加一些有意思的对话就好了。\n"Why you...!"的频繁使用：这个缺点其实挺小，挺细节的。我能理解"Why you...!"语气很强烈，能反映出说话人的感情，但是我真不骗你，听多了是个人都会觉得烦……其实只要换个方式表达就好。台词多样性绝对是一款成功的视觉小说的必备要素。\n有些选项对结局导向没有任何作用： 目前为止我已经打出了3个结局：#1, #2和#6（6号结局打出来了五遍= =）。为什么会打出来五遍呢？因为很多选项对最后结局的导向起不到任何作用。走一边流程也就只有七八次选择选项的机会，然而至少有一半的选择都不会影响剧情走向。多加点分支好不好啊制作组！剧情和剧本的多样性很重要哒！如果能做到这点这游戏就非常好了。总结：\n也就是说，除非你是英文配音的视觉小说的狂热粉，否则我还是不建议原价入这款游戏。当然这不是说这款游戏不好，这游戏其实还蛮好的。我只是想说这游戏还有很大的提升潜力，当制作组真的用心改进了这款游戏的时候，大家才会更愿意毫不犹豫地点击“购买”按钮。","October 27, 2015","true","6.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","0"

Probably one of the best release by Ajtilley.\n\nI've been supporting western visual novel developers on Steam and Kickstarter for a while so obviously I enjoy those types of games.\n\nThe Art is great, some of the best I saw from an indie visual novel developer.\nVoice acting can be hit or miss but I quited enjoyed the talent.\nThe music is pretty nice, that's a pretty good and diverse soundtrack for the length of the novel.\nWhile some of the endings can be similar, having 9 is a nice addition.\nScript seems solid, did not notice any typo.\nThe voices volume can be low and different characters volumes are not always balanced. Understandable considering it's not done by a big voice acting studio but should be mentionned since it can bother some people.\nDespite the quality, It's quite short. I've been reading visual novels for years so I can be faster than normal but it took me only about 2 hours to get all the endings.\nConsidering the quality of this visual novel, it's a shame that it is so short, the story and characters could have potential for a bigger story. It was a nice take on the highschool harem but mixed with divine elements. There are not that many characters but they all have their roles and personalities. Having a voiced male character was interesting considering it seems pretty rare in smaller visual novels, especially when it's not the protagonist. It was a minor role but still a nice touch.\n\nBuyers also should remember that Ajtilley is a developer but also a publisher. Beach Bounce script was plagued with error at release but was patched quite fast. This game is directly developed and you can see the difference in release quality. I'm not affiliated in any way but I see potential and I don't want it spoiled by too much negativity.","October 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

I think the whole story could have been developed more and given the player more choices. The multiple endings was interesting. I played the first time thru slowly reading everything. I played the next four times thru quickly until I got to new material and got to the end. The story conspet was still a good one and I still enjoyied two of the endings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keikurono21/recommended/348540/","keikurono21","Kei-chan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keikurono21/","129 products in account","A short VN with a harem ending? What else can I say, right?\n\nWell, Divine Slice of Life is not what I actually expected. It's a Visual Novel developed by former studio A.J.Tilley (now known as Dharker Studio) about the life of a "normal" university guy and the relationships with his classmates and a couple of newcomers (girls as you can imagine). Normally one could say is a common and very usual VN and you wouldn't be that wrong. However, what makes DSoL a bit more interesting story is the whole ancient greek gods background; yes, ancient greek gods, that in fact is not that breathtaking as it sounds and not so interesting either.\n\nI agree with the many people here on Steam with the "Meh" button, it should exist. At least this VN deserves it.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics, although their not what many of us are used to, they are nice and well done, both characters and backgrounds.\n- Trading cards?\n- Has an epilogue that can count as a way of extending the story.\n- R18 patch?\n\nCons:\n- Mouth animations. Off AF, it's kind of weird actually and somewhat distracting and boring.\n- Is short. Even for 9 endings the story isn't as long as one could imagine, and depending on the choices made is even shorter.\n- The R18 patch adds something that the story doesn't need per se. And some of the scenes feel to forced to be even there.\n\nSo, why am I recommending this? There is no "meh" button in Steam.\n\nAnd so, if you want to get this game, wait for a sale.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

It's alright, but far too short, and as some other reviewers have said, too cookie-cutter with some of the endings, could have used a lot more variety. For what it was, and the fact that I paid $4 for a bundle with 6 other games in it, I liked it a bit, but there's no way I would have paid full price for it.

Also there is no incomplete-achievement-tax on your library for partial completion.\n\nCons are more numerous. The UI is pretty limited as far as VNs go. The voice acting is low quality with unrealistic  inflections in voicing, and the dialogue is irregularly voice-acted over the story. A lot of the dialogue is simply cringy, particularly Ronan's. Dialogue being reused between the characters was probably the biggest letdown.","March 31","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Story goes fair with theme, voice actors are experienced as I heard few in diffrent games. What more can I say about the game... it simply works well together and I dont care if it is shorter then it should be, or if the beginning is not entertaining (it may not be since our main protagonist is rather boring faceless person without background of life). I have fun with this just because of female gods introduced in the game. Thats completelly enough for giving it recomend, as they are core fun of the game and voice actors did good job there giving characters peculiar way of behaving.\n\nThink about buying it around 5 Euro prize.\n\nPS: After all writing style kinda pisses me of... and other then Ryn and Yui voice acting is low.\nIt deserves mixed reviews.

What an... Interesting VN. (That includes H-rated scenes with the patch mind you)\nYou take the role of the reincarnation of Zeus. You do not know this until two Demi-goddesses injure you in a fight for well... you.\nYou must decide between the two Goddesses, your childhood friend, and two other girls.\nAnd well... Besides the H-rated content... There really isn't that much of a story... Or atleast, not a very long one...\nI did complete it (even with the H-rated scenes) within 40 minutes. Of course, playing back through the game to get the other ends will be about 110 minutes. So essentially, this is a VN, even with it's H-rated scenes is less then 2 hours...?\n\nI would love to see well... The developer actually come back to this and add more story to it. Everything is somewhat rushed, I wished the goddesses were introduced later, and perhaps we could have more time to decide which one we like more. As well, I would've liked to have spent more time with each girl.\n\nThis is one of those times I wish Steam had an option BETWEEN Yes and No. Divine Slice of Life is an alright Visual Novel (Which really does require it's H-rated scenes) but it is WAY to RUSHED and is too SHORT!\n\nI reccommend you get this on a sale like I did. It's not worth full price, but if you can get it perhaps at 25% or 50% off, it's worth it if your into Visual Novels with adult content (please know, you need to get the patch online. Don't worry, it's free).\n\nIf I had to rate this from 1 - 10, with Nekopara being a 10, I would rate it 5.5, with the H-rated scenes. 4.5 without them. It's seriously needed more... Substance... More... Depth... More... Actual interaction with these girls. Boobs and girls obsessing over the main character doesn't make a Visual Novel, which is all that this VN seemed to have been going for.","April 5","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This VN will have gods and goddess themes which I really enjoyed in this VN.\n\nI had a fun time playing this VN despite the game being about who Aaki gets to choose which girl to be with.\n\nI enjoyed the story and the characters. The art and BG was really nice. The music was really nice too. The voice acting was really nice with some parts just meh. Yup u read right that this VN atcually has an English VA.\n\nBut this VN does have it's problems. I really wish that the VN was longer. Story excecuted better probably would of made the story even better than what was presented here.\n\nSome of the endings could of benefitted from a longer ending. Also the first two endings that u can get should of had different dialouge.\n\nThe lip synching on the characters are not good. Though it didn't bother me that much since I would look at the dialouge box than the mouths most of the time.\n\nThis is probably the most that bugged me about the game. It was the voice acting fluctuation a lot. Half of the time the voices got soooooo low u couldn't hear what they say. This made me sad because u don't get a lot of VN where a company dubs a VN English.\n\nPlus another thing that bugged me is that Ronan is not shown a lot in this VN. U would think after the first two endings u can get Ronan would of gotten his character fleshed out. It's too bad because I would of loved a Ronan ending. Same with Akame but at least she gets an ending. Her ending is just there in my opinion.\n\nLast but not least this VN does have a 18+ patch. If u want all images u have to play both the censored and uncensored patch. But for some reason I still cannot unlock a few last images like Ryu, Yui, Taka, Sakyua.\n\nI honestly recommend getting this VN only on a discount or a bundle. I got this through a bundle. As others have said this VN had a lot of potential to be even better. Too bad it wasn't:(\n","April 21","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
