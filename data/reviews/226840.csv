It stays true to the style and feel of the previous games in the series, while also embracing some of the more modern elements in the 4X genre. Some may find the game a bit "simplistic" compared to other 4x games, but this is misleading. While this game is very easy to learn, and keeps most of the numbers and math pretty simple, there is an incredible amount of strategic depth to this game, and even after over 500 hours played, with 90% of that focusing on just *one* class, I am still learning new things.\n\nThe game itself takes place on about 3 different levels. The most prominent level is the tactical combat itself. This is unmatched by any other game in the 4x genre. In truth, it's more akin to the Total War series than anything, except turn based. It is not an understatement to say that this is the best combat system in any of the modern 4x games, bar none.\n\nThe second level is strategic movement. Many reviewers and players alike who only play this game for a bit do not understand just how much thought goes into something as simple as moving troops around. Each hex has different movement costs, which affects how fast units can move across them. But the movement costs are variable based on race, unit type itself, and even what the player has researched. Furthermore, different types of units may benefit from terrain features, such as Druids and Rogues who have units with Concealment. This allows some of their units to be rendered invisible in forest tiles. Compounding this issue is how classes and races interact. For instance, Dwarven Rogues are the only combination in the game with access to mountain concealment from the beginning, and this allows for some rather unique strategies involving raiding parties in the early game. While many will say that the tactical combat in this game is what stands out, at the intermediate skill level, the strategic level may actually be more important. After all, you can't actually GET to tactical combat if your enemy utilizes terrain to outrun you, or to reach your cities before your main army can get there to repel them.\n\nThe third layer is the empire management layer. This layer is pretty much what your typical 4x player expects to be the bulk of the game, as games like Civ largely ignore the first 2 to focus entirely on management. To those who have played and enjoyed the Civilization series: be warned. Age of Wonders 3 handles city management *vastly* differently than most other 4x games. The key difference lies in how cities work. Unlike civilization, there are no wonders or structures that can be built in cities to give them a specialized role. But don't worry, there absolutely are ways to make cities unique. Where this game differs from most others is that cities are largely defined by the terrain features within their domain. This creates a very different feel to empire management than other 4x games, in that the single most important factor of a city lies in where it is placed. In fact, a city placed on the right structure can often unlock units that cannot be accessed normally, or allow unusual and powerful modifiers to your armies. Some even give massive bonuses to income, or research.\n\nWhile each layer is important, it is worth noting that this game is still very much different from many other 4x games. The focus is of the game is, at its heart, a wargame. While the diplomacy is functional, the predominant strategy will always be to crush your enemies, and annex their cities. Make no mistake, though. Although the goal is the same in every game, the methods are as variable as your imagination.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that there are players in the multiplayer community who have reputations for using an iconic style or strategy, that is almost entirely their own. The sheer number of options in character creation means that a player could very well run a strategy that is truly unique.\n\nSo if you're looking for a fantasy 4x wargame, you will not find a better one out there. Age of Wonders 3 is simply the best at what it does.","November 8, 2014","true","921.9"," 481 of 510 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","481","510","7","5"

(Which is voluntary, and invites were sent based off of forum participation.)\n\nI like TBS games, generally ones with interesting combat systems, and the last one I genuinely liked was XCOM. I've spent the past years lamenting every TBS game that came out, because of the combat systems that resolve the battle in damage exchanges on the World Map. So I was excited about Fallen Enchantress, and I played it for a while, but it had no multiplayer which inevitably killed it for me.\n\nSo, I was overjoyed to hear that Age of Wonders was returning with all the Tactical Combat and multiplayer features that I so loved.\n\nI've played each of the games in the series, I thought that AoW1 was excellent, AoW2 was abysmal and Shadow Magic was great. For whatever reason, I actually expected to be disappointed by this entry and was considering not buying it. After playing the beta, I can see that my initial instincts were unfounded.\n\nThere are obvious graphical improvements, and I can't really fault them, beyond what I feel is an issue with the change to lower tier unit parties. Though each of the models is well detailed, because they are stood together in a tight stack I feel the units lose a bit of their definition, this might be because of the level at which I zoom out to, but at the end of the day I need to do that to see a practical amount of the battle.\n\nI think the time it takes to enact tactical combat is good, there are speed settings to allow you to increase unit movement and attacks if you're in a hurry, and I generally am. The game ran smooth for the most part, and my biggest issue, which is fairly minor, with the combat is that the hitting animations don't feel particularly visceral in terms of sound, graphical action and reaction. (Some do, but for the T1/T2 melee clashes I didn't feel it was as brutal as the earlier games.)\n\nI prefer the combat system to any TBS that I have played in the past years, and it allows for larger scale battles as well in beautiful settings. (When I compare it to HoMM, which I dislike, or XCOM's, which I loved, or Civ's, which I found boring as I'm sure I would Warlock, etc.)\n\nEach of your Heroes/Leaders has access to a number of upgrades when they level up, leveling up is fairly easy and painless compared to the earlier games (where you had to get the final hit to get the exp) so your heroes become quite strong, quite quickly, but still steps below higher tier units until they reach higher levels. Each hero has it's own class, which grants it access to class specific upgrades, but they all share access to basic upgrades to upgrade stats like Defense, Attack etc. which are fairly straight forward.\n\nEach Hero can become a spell caster, and each class has its own subset of spells, though only one spell can be cast a turn (regardless of how many spell casts you have in a battle) which prevents the issue of your army getting instantly destroyed by a barrage of spells in the first round.\n\nYour heroes have items slots, and you can get items from exploring dungeons etc. You can also make your own items if your city is advanced enough. I felt that there the items available were interesting, particularly the range of mounts (which unlike other gear displays graphically) that allow you to fly about, in the case of wyverns or manticores, and offer other abilities.\n\nI thought the leveling system for heroes was quite good, I found myself often upgrading the default stats and I didn't feel that there was much variation between each hero class type, though there were some cool melee orientated abilities for the Warlord and some interesting ones for the Theocrat, as well as the Rogue. A lot of abilities amounted to global damage reduction to your party, and so the differences amounted to a change in damage type.\n\nThe class you choose for your leader (which has its own levelling/point allocations and is quite similar to a hero) will determine what research/units you will have available to you through the game, as well as three sub-specialitions you can choose when creating your hero which can give you access to new schools of magic, or more practical exploratory/empire building skills. In that regard I thought that there was a good variation of research/summons/units across the six classes and the sub-specializations added extra replayability/variation to that.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't had time to play the multiplayer.\n\nI thought that one of the campaigns was excellent, and that one of them was good, I had some issues with it, but I expect those will be resolved before release. Both of the campaigns were a cut above any TBS campaign I've played in the past, featured interesting protagonists, solid writing, and excellent voice acting.\n\nEach campaign has a text, voice-acted prologue, and an epilogue for each mission, and throughout each mission there are text pop-outs for dialogue from your enemies and allies. In both campaigns there is a branching point where you have to choose sides so I believe that would result in at least four different endings, though I'm not sure.\n\nEither way, there should be a good amount of replayability and entertainment value from the campaigns, and I'm sure that there will be more to come (both from the developers, and users using the editor), and the excellent mechanics of the games themselves (combat, beautiful world design, variety of units and strategies) will add to the enjoyment of those campaigns.\n\nThere are currently six races, each has different benefits/negatives to its racial units, there are some instances where lower tier units are quite similar, but I think that's to be expected. Overall, I thought there was a good range of units available and that each of the races/class combinations offered a good variety of choice. Across the campaign you play multiple leaders (races/classes) though your main character always sticks with you, either as the leader or as an accompanying hero.\n\nI would recommend the game simply for playing the campaign, or for playing the scenarios available or using the random map generator. If you enjoy TBS games then you'll probably like this one, and it should provide you with hours of entertainment. I intend to play the multiplayer when it comes out, and I imagine it's going to be fun, but as I haven't played it I can't really say for sure.\n","March 2, 2014","true","48.5"," 854 of 966 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","854","966","0","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/recommended/226840/","fancyfishie","Fancy Fish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancyfishie/","796 products in account","AGE OF WONDERS III - Good Turn based tactical combat, Hero RPG elements and Empire building 4X strategy\n|| 8 ||    Score    Comment        Graphics    8    Nice graphics and detail on the strategic map and even better graphics for units, terrain and magical effects in combat. UI is nice, detailed and easy to use      Audio    6    Music gets a little repetitive - maybe a little more variety needed, sound effects are good but nothing special.    Gameplay    8    Age of Wonders III is a turn based, 4X strategy game based in a fantasy setting. The tactical combat view (when your army's battle) is excellent, you really feel like you are head to head with the AI (which seems to do a good job most of the time) in a battle of wits. Casting a well timed spell or outmanoeuvring your enemy can sometimes turn the tide of a battle, unfortunately usually the outcome of a battle is a forgone conclusion due to the relative strength of the units involved, but even when this is the case its still fun to crush your enemy and minimise your losses. The strength of the Units in your army really plays such a large part of the battles that you can actually choose to skip the tactical battle entirely and have the computer automatically calculate the results. Some of the units have somewhat of a balance issue with the higher level units often being able to take down whole armies by themselves with little damage or risk. This inevitably results in a race to upgrade your city buildings to create these higher level creatures. AI at the strategic level is a little predictable but there is still fun to be had placing your cities and grabbing as many resources as possible to fund your economy. One thing I noticed at the strategic level is there doesn't seem to be any downside to city spamming (covering the map in loads of your cities) as you gain resources (mana, gold, research) for each city. Ruins, shrines and artefacts are scattered throughout the maps and these will often require you to fight a monster to claim the reward for your Hero. Hero's are your army leaders you get a main one and then can hire more for gold. Hero's have a selection of spells they can use to aid you in battle, summon monsters or benefit your cities. Items you collect / make can be given to your hero's to increase their stats and they also get skills as they earn xp through battles.        Story    7    The game contains a number of well written scenario's which are fairly fun to play through. Overall I think I preferred playing the random maps though.         Replayability    7    If you enjoy the game you will probably want to play it again, random maps and steam workshop adds more community made content.        Overall    8    A fan of this genre will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. While not as complex or detailed as others of the same type what it does it does well. Hotseat mode (a mode I loved from Civilisation) is a great addition to this game and playing with friends is a lot of fun.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

This is equivalent to the default mode of most 4X games like Civilization, and that's what I'll talk about here.\n\nUnlike most 4X games which start you off with a single settler in a mostly empty undeveloped world, the default mode (normal game flow) of AoW3 starts you off in a populated world which already has roads, cities and armies. In these games you can get stuck into the action quickly and may not need to build any cities at all, just capture existing ones. These games can be a lot quicker to play than other 4X games.\n\nHowever, the random map games are extremely customisable, much more than Civ. There are three other preset modes - Battle, Empire Building and Adventure - which provide very different game experiences. Better still, go into the advanced setup screens and you can tweak the details to your heart's content. You can start with nothing more than a settler and a leader in a completely empty world, just like Civ, if that's what you want, or you can fill it with as much or as little of the different options that are available. You can also tweak the geography, altering the quantities of different terrain types that will appear on the map.\n\nThe graphics are superb, they blow away the old AoW games and are better than most current 4X games IMO. The music is excellent too, one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game, making it well worth getting the Deluxe version for the 2 hours of music, not to mention the huge 8 player scenario Dragon's Throne.\n\nThe huge variety of units in the game, and the many different unit abilities and spells, provide for an awesome variety of strategy and tactics. The game is far more detailed than previous versions, and while the older games were great in their own right, AoW3 takes it to a whole new level. I can't go back to the old games anymore. It's a game you can get sucked into for many, many hours of your life.\n\nThe two expansion packs - Golden Realms and Eternal Lords - are real expansions, not shallow cash grabbing DLCs like in many games these days. They add a lot of real content, not just new races and campaigns, but many new rules and game mechanics.\n\nI highly recommend this game, one of the best 4X games ever in my opinion.","April 16, 2015","true","124.3"," 205 of 218 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","205","218","8","4"

I have a feeling that in 15 years or so I will still be playing Age of Wonders 3. I make this prediction because once in a while I still  play the original AoW and it came out in 1999. So unless they come out with an AoW4 or standalone expansion that is even better in every aspect I think this game will stay on my computer and my next computer and the VR headset after... a long time.\n\nMy favorite part of AoW3 is its focus on tactical combat while still including all the 4 Xs (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) plus RPG elements. There are cities to form into an empire, heroes to level up, spells to research, dungeons to loot, resources to manage, etc... On top of it all players are engaged in battles early and often. The battles are killer fun tactical experiences that take place on their own maps separate from the primary strategy map. When a hex is attacked on the strategy map the armies/stacks in that hex and all neighboring hexes get pulled into the tactical battle. This means there could be 42 units (7 hexes x 6 units/hex) in the same battle and they could even belong to several different players! The combat mechanics like attacks of opportunity, flanking, guarding, and 3 action points to use for movement, multiple attacks, or multiple reactions are very well done. When playing single player I almost always choose to fight each battle manually because they are so much fun, but there is an option to automatically resolve them if you wish.\n\nThe only bad thing I can say about AoW3 is that it feels like the morale systems need to be flushed out a little more. My wish for morale is that your starting/ruling race should have more influence on the morale of your cities and units and diplomatic relations with independent cities. It was important in past AoW games. These things will probably get improved with some patches, and should not stop anyone from buying the game. *** This review is based on the BETA version of the game. ***\n\nThere was a period of years where I played a lot of Civ4 and some Civ5. Eventually I found myself thinking - I wish there was more action in these games and battles were more realistic like... Age of Wonders. Before AoW3 was announced, I searched for recent games with gameplay similar to AoW but nothing seemed to be on the same level. Warlock was too simple and too Civ-y... Total War just didn't draw me in... Others didn't even look worth buying. Age of Wonders seems to fill a special niche that no others do.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be let into the beta for AoW3, and I must say that Triumph Studios has outdone themselves even in the beta version. AoW3 takes many of the best parts of its predecessors plus some new goodness to create a masterpiece of the TBS/4X genre.\n\nedit: Forgot to mention one of the things that makes AoW games so replayable - the races. Past AoW games had at least 12 races, but AoW3 is releasing with 6 which is a little disappointing at first glance. However, this is made up by the new class system which did not exist in previous AoW games. The developers have done an amazing job making both race and class matter. An elven archdruid feels different than a draconian archdruid or an elven warlord. Thus, instead of having simply 12 races to choose from you have 36 race/class combos (6 races x 6 classes). There are also specializations/spheres that further customize your leader and playing experience, similar to previous AoW games. I expect more races to be added in DLC or an expansion and am fine with that.","March 26, 2014","true","98.7"," 403 of 467 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","403","467","0","15"

It always feels like something is lost when a great game from years ago is brought into the modern age. Things get prettier, bigger, and more streamlined, but many times it feels like some essential chemistry is lost. Some of us blame nostalgia, others simply write the developers off as appealing to the largest audience or the lowest common denominator. Sequels always lose something.\n\nWhich is why Triumph Studios had no right to produce such a perfect game.\n\nThis is the perfect sparkling bouquet of what made the original great, combined with the streamlined production quality we've come to expect from a quality modern game. It's asymmetrical and unfair in the most balanced ways possible. Whether you're outfitting your heroes or designing your player class, you'll find great satisfaction in trying to break the game. You'll be very good at some things, and very bad at others, but it will always make sense and it will always feel right.\n\nThe unit design deserves special mention. Each unit is deeply well-crafted and unique, even when comparing racial units of the same role. The attention to synergy is unmatched, both between units of the same race and in the way that race and class combine to make a whole. Leveling up often provides interesting new abilities that also tend to synergize, instead of simply providing better stats.\n\nThis game has a lot of everything, and all of it affects everything else. You'll build cities, research and cast spells, and train units. You'll command armies on the beautiful strategic map, and when you explore dungeons or fight another army, you'll go down to fight on equally beautiful tilesets. Tactical combat is reasonably simple but very deep. This game has not been casualized. The A.I. is maddeningly clever, and you won't take this statement seriously until you've experienced it. You'll fight skirmishes in the woods with bandits, and you'll fight in truly massive sieges to conquer cities. Your heroes will explore dungeons, find and equip items, and lead your armies into battle.\n\nYou will build your strategy, and then get excited about other strategies you think could work. They probably will. Your race, your class, and your specializations all fundamentally change the way you need to approach the game. It takes a long time to bloom into a full understanding of how the various parts of the game work together, but the journey is pleasant, and you can absorb it by playing.\n\nThe campaign probably deserves it's own review. It's gloriously cheesy golden-age high fantasy. The campaign follows branching questlines, so you can end up doing different missions. The base game has two campaigns of eight missions. Eight does not sound like a lot but you can easily spend an entire day playing one mission. They're huge. Think of them more like chapters. The expansion packs can add another two campaigns.\n\nThere are also a number of scenarios which are like competitive missions for X players. The "real" Age of Wonders though is in the procedurally generated random map mode, where you can fight other players or the AI. There are a huge number of random features on the maps, such as "dwellings" where you can purchase units from a non-player faction like Giants or Pixies. You'll need to play many games before you've seen everything you can find. Also of note, Age of Wonders has an underground map, full of caves, tunnels, and the cities of the Goblins and Dwarves.\n\nTriumph is confident enough in the mastery of their game to give the player enormous freedoms to explore how to play. Their own mastery is evident in the careful design of how every element acts together. If you find anything this game does interesting, play it for that reason, but be prepared to fall in love with the rest.\n\nThis is what a strategy game should be.\n\n10/10","September 17, 2015","true","387.0"," 173 of 185 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","173","185","8","1"

No poor low resolution console port, plenty of game options, and loads key bind customization to be found. Performance is a dream and the game is beautiful whether raiding dungeons relieving dragons of their loot or sacking major cities, and doing so right outside their gates seeing the city itself in all it's 3d model glory on the battlefield.\n\nOne of the greatest PC games of all time. More factions and content to come via expansions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079336898/recommended/226840/","76561198079336898","Donuts StrongJaw","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079336898/","103 products in account","Let me preface this by saying that AoWIII is a very polished game; it looks quite nice, has few glitches, and it seems like the Devs put a lot of thought and work into this game.\n\nHowever, I cannot recomend it. Why? It's simply not an enjoyable experience for me. Now, don't get me wrong: I've always been fond of TBS games. I loved Civs 3-5, and have played quite a bit of Fallen Enchantress, as well as some Galactic Civilizations. I'm acquainted with the genre, but am by no means an aficionado.\n\nSo, why don't I enjoy this game? Well, a large part of stems from how narrow your in-game options are. There are plenty of choices between class and race, and those choices feel significant enough, really, but once you actually start playing the game, you realize that there's really only one way to win: expansion and conquest. I knew going in that this game would be more heavily conflict oriented, but to the point where that's the only means of victory? Not exactly what I had in mind, though I can certainly get by with that.\n\nBut it's not just that you'll have to go to war to win. It's more holistic than that: everything in this game is about conquest. The only real purpose of your cities is to produce soldiers, in some form or fashion. You build buildings to unlock units to fight wars. You conduct research to unlock units to fight wars. You manufacture "merchandise" to fund your wars. You "build housing" to increase your domain to capture "resource nodes" (that only provide a slight buff to production rather than serving as actual resources) to more quickly produce units to...wait for it...fight wars. Now, fighting wars isn't necessarily a bad thing. The combat is very well designed and has a good deal of depth to it, especially when you take into account the racial and class distinctions. But, this generally superior combat seems to come at the cost of the depth of everything else.\n\nAnd that's just the problem: this game lacks depth. There is no real economy management, no real resources to capture (the only two "currencies" are gold and mana, the former of which is over abundant and the latter of which is often too scarce), and no real tech tree to navigate. You just plop your identical cities down to increase you GPT to support a bigger army. There's nothing else to it. You don't have to worry about acquiring special resources or developing advanced industry to train particularly powerful units, you just unlock them via research. And you can complete that research very quickly (late game starts at around turn 50 in a standard game, though the overall pacing can be sped up/slowed down during setup). By the time you've done that, you've rendered most every other standard unit in the game obsolete. You can really spam your way to victory against the AI (assuming they're not doing the same; otherwise you just get caught in a gridlock). And so, you lose that depth again.\n\nIf you love TBS combat, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you're looking for something more well-rounded, consider picking it up on sale. If you're expecting something akin to Civ V, check out GalCiv III (maybe; it's really expensive and still early access).\n\nADDENDUM 1: Since patch 1.093 (I think), pacing has been slightly improved through the addition of new production-related buildings and other changes. However, there have been no major changes made to the other mechanics, so, take it for what you will. Mana has been capped as well, which helps to prevent surpluses. T4 spam is still prevalent, though it occurs about 20 turns later for non-summoning classes.\n\nADDENDUM 2: Since patch 1.12 (or something, I dunno), different races have received different buffs/nerfs, and different gamespeeds have been added. This does indeed help with pacing, and provides more strategic depth to the potentially longer early/mid-game. However, economy and diplomacy are still pitifully simplistic, meaning that my core issues with the game (the near single-minded focus on combat) remain. The late-game is still shallow, even when opponents are on fairly even footing.\n\nADDENDUM 3: A new expansion has been announced, Golden Realms (I guess? Heck if I know.), that adds a new shorter campaign and race. It's Halflings, and it's only three episodes long, compared to Vanilla's 6? So, basically, it's half-sized, just for the Halflings. It's pretty clever. More importantly, (to me, anyway), it's supposed to bring a lot more to the table in regards to empire management, like special, competitive city projects, new, powerful effects for "special tiles" like treasure sites, and exclusive racial defensive improvements. A new victory condition has been added, as well. Unsure as to what they'll be doing with diplomacy. Iffy on the price, too. Something to think about, though.\n\nADDENDUM 4: Golden Realms is out and it can be yours for a cool ten dollars. If you're American. Not quite sure about the pricing in other regions, as Steam doesn't do direct conversions. I've played a teensy, tiny amount of the new campaign but, to be honest, I really couldn't get back into it. Diplomacy has been upgraded (for free) as well, as part of patch 2.4 (I never get these right). It's an improvement, but you simply won't see specialized treaties or tech trading a la Fallen Enchantress or Endless Legend. No manipulating multi-national councils, either, even though they exist per in-game lore.\n\nADDENDUM THE LAST: Late to the party, but that Necromancy expac, Eternal Lords, released and, if you're willing to drop whatever they're asking for on it (~$20 up front, less on sale), the game definitely becomes robust enough to where I can call it a worthy 4X title. The new Necromancer class does a good job of shaking things up (as most necro-oriented civs do), and the new races (Tigrans and Frostlings, both returning from previous AoW titles) are surprisingly distinct from each other and the rest of the cast as far as units and aesthetics are concerned. Diplomacy received a hefty overhaul, with the inclusion of a new racial diplomacy system and related victory conditions. Play nice with races and you can construct wonders cementing their allegiance, or somesuch. You also unlock various empire-wide policies in the process, which adds another layer to empire management. It's fairly simple, but the overall concept's a pretty novel approach to diplo.\n\nThe game's pretty much where I want it to be now, though you have to invest in it to get there. I'd say it's better than Endless Legend + DLC now, but that's just my opinion. I'm leaving the review as "not recommended" if only because most of the core problems in the review can only be alleviated with DLC. Unless the modding scene fixed that. Did I mention, they added workshop support. Pretty nifty.","April 3, 2014","false","88.6"," 757 of 1,024 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","757","1","5","77"

However I'm not an employee of Triumph Studios, only a community volunteer.\n- This review was written post Eternal Lords and 1.5 patch releases.\n\n\nAge of Wonders III is a turn based hex based fantasy 4x game that is a lot more combat focused compared to something like the Civilization series but also quite a bit more strategically and tactically involved than let's say Heroes of Might & Magic which can be both good or bad depending on your personal preferences.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nCompared to the previous games AoWIII retains most of the series' fundamentals but also iterates and adds to the formula.\n\nThe most notable change is the way yor faction is presented via the class system. Your research tree and unit roster are not only determined by spell school and starting race picks but by your leader class (warlords, sorcerer, archdruid, dreadnaught, etc.), starting race as well as specializations which are akin to the previous game's spell spheres and leader skills. Your base unit list is thus determined by the race of the towns you own as well as your chosen class.\n\nComparing it to AoWII the class system in a way separates the racial aspect of a faction from the  gameplay theme of it. For example, in AoW2 Elves were always Druids with nature themed units, Archons were always Theocrats with their religious and holy theme, Dwarves were Dreadnoughts due to their technological prowes, Orcs were Warlords with strong physical combatants and so on.\n\nThe AoWIII class system separates race and theme so Elves can be steampunk-ish technologists, Dwarves can wield druidic powers while Goblins can be religious crusaders. Thematically this allows you to create both stereotypical combinations (wizard elves) as well as some unusual ones (holy angelic goblins).\n\nGameplay wise the trio of race, class and specialization (additional mini tech trees) allows for a myriad of different play styles and strategies and a very diverse meta game which encourages experimentation and greately enhances replayability.\n\nEach class comes with a unique tech tree which consists of special class units which can have their own racial variations as well as a large number of combat or strategic spells and passive upgrades that enhance your empire as well as units.\n\n\nCustomization\n\nAoWIII features a leader creation process which allows for detailed aesthetic and gameplay customization. Visual options are akin to rpg games like Dragon Age allowing for changes to race, gender, clothing, accessories, hair style and color, skin color,  eyes, hats masks, postures, background scenery, portrait poses, coat of arms, etc.\n\nGameplay-wise the options include race, class and 3 slots for specializations that can be magic oriented or more mundane empire upgrades.\n\nGame settings include numerous tweaks to the random map generator like map type (land, continents, islands), map size (s, m, l, xl), geographical settings (types of terrain and climate, existence of the underground layer), starting town/army, amount of resources, treasure sites, independent monsters, etc.\n\nFurthermore various game parameters can be tweaked like the number of heroes, hero level cap, hero race, game pace, starting resources, turn progression (classic i-go-you-go or simultanious), empire quests, map events, victory conditions, type and number of opponents, preference for manual or auto-combat and so on.\n\nMuch effort was made to cater to different preferences and play styles.\n\n\nCombat\n\nLike in Heroes of Might & Magic for example, combat in AoWIII happens on a separate tactical map that is derived from the participating units' position on the strategic map. If the units were standing on a snowy arctic hex the tactical map will also have snow on it for example. Same with forests, swamps, etc. Not only that but various sites like cities, farms, dungeons, mines, tombs, etc. are all represented on the tactical map and can have different effects like providing obstacles, choke points, magical effects and so on.\n\nCompared to AoWII combat in AoWIII has less randomness and is more dependent on the player making the right moves. Attacks will always hit for example (except under special circumstances) but the damage can still vary and there is the possibility of criticals or fumbles.\n\nThere are many things to keep an eye on in combat like move points (usually the less you have the less attacks you get but not always), limited retaliations, defensive stances, attacks of opportunity, flanking attacks, distances, unit position and facing, range, the presence of obstacles or city walls, types of movement (walking, floating, flying) and so on.\n\nAnd this is without taking into account unit stats (physical attack vs. defence, magical/elemental attack vs. resistance), traits, special abilities, morale (which influences critical chance), combat spells, unit and battlefield enchantments, unit types, etc.\n\nThe basics of combat are simple. Click on a unit, right click to attack an enemy unit. But is the enemy unit far enough to trigger the charge ability, can I flank it, what's the chance of my special effect triggering, what elemental protections does it have, how many retaliations does it have remaining, does it have first strike, is it a polearm unit and will my cavalry take extra damage, can I weaken it prior to attack and how, can I kill it, will my unit survive the next turn after it attacks...there are many questions you could end up asking yourself.\n\nLearning about the units, what abilities they have and how they can be used and combined for maximum effectiveness is necessary for mastering the game but learning can be achieved in gradual steps.\n\nAoWIII retains the adjacency rule of previous games so all armies that are adjacent to the hex being attacked will also participate in combat which can result in some pretty large battles. Thankfully animation speed in battle can be adjusted during combat.\n\nUnits and heroes that perform well and survive will accumulate experience points and become stronger acquiring new abilities as they level up and grow into valued veterans.\n\n\nStrategy\n\nOn the strategic level you build up your empire by settling or capturing new cities and expanding your borders in order to bring more and more resources under your control. There are resource sites to be captured, treasure sites to be explored, artifacts to be found, neutral creatures, cities and enemy leaders to be subdued. All in all the world is a dangerous place and venturing forth requires combat worthy armies and leaders. Luckily there is a beautiful cloth map to be zoomed out to in order to get an overview of the situation.\n\nResource gathering and exploration primarily serve the goal of building up armies that can defeat the dangers that lie beyond your borders.\n\nA new addition here compared to AoWII are the creature dwellings which function as minor races that offer unique units for hire as well as their own sets of buildings. These dwellings can expand your unit roster and provide unexpected tactical  and strategic options.\n\nBoth creature dwellings and independent cities can be outright conqured or negotiated with towards peaceful annexation by vooing them with money or performing quests. How you treat various towns and races can determine their attitude towards you as well as your alignment and diplomatic relations.\n\nAnother addition is that clearing out and controlling certain treasure sites can unlock special unit or town upgrades in cities controlling those sites which can make some cities more valuable than others.\n\n\nAll in all after 618 hrs of playing I have not yet experienced everything this game has to offer, so many untried combinations and strategies, which is probably the biggest endorsement I can give.","April 20, 2015","true","652.4"," 67 of 71 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","67","71","2","2"

(To be honest, I also love Heroes 5)\n\nLook at the DLC tabs and you'll only see 3. Incredible, isn't it? Only 3, developers must be lazy. No, you're wrong. These DLCs, except "Deluxe Edition", are big. They're more like "Expansion Packs", if you're a good ol' RTS player you'd know what they are (Remember Warcraft 3's Frozen Throne? That is an expansion pack!"). I'm actually impressed about this, great job on it, developers!\n\nMany other reviewers mention the "Random Map"  system and how great it is. Yeah, I admit, it's not really that very customizable by itself, but it's great nonetheless. I can imagine it being overly-complex if it was a lot more customizable anyway. And if you don't like random maps, well, there's always scenarios, community maps and so on.\n\nThat's right, for a turn-based strategy, there's actually a workshop, and it's not a "CSGO-style" or "Voteshop" workshop, where, if you want an item to be in the game, it can be as long as it gets a lot of votes. Right now, the SDK offers a good enough freedom, but I heard that it will be better on the next updates.\n\nAlso, aren't you tired of stupid, useless hotfix patches and so on? Make a hotfix, break another thing, a hotfix again, blahblahblah (NOTE: I'm not talking badly about developers who do it, there is always a bug after a patch and a hotfix may be necessary, but when there's a small patch for something so simple, useless or just decorative with no necessary bugfixes, yeah, I'm sure you know what I mean) and BOOM you may just lose interest. Luckily, AoW3 goes the Good Ol' style; only make patches when fully tested and necessary.\n\nBy the way, this may not be of high interest since not everyone is an audiophile (personal note: I tend to hate music), but the Music? This is music made by Michiel van den Bos. Name might mean something, name might mean nothing. I'll just say that if you listened to Unreal music and Overlord music AND you loved it, you WILL LOVE the music in AoWIII.

Indeed, conquering a fantasy world has never been more fun, and AoW creates beautiful situations and, thanks to the hero/civilization customizer, unique factions. Like technologically advanced elves, or druidic dwarfs. But the battles? The battles are really damn memorable, and can pin up 6 armies against each other (3vs3, or 18vs18 units). You will doing everything possible to not loose your most well trained units.\n\nAnother small, but very nice feature is that the custom heroes/civilizations you create can be used by the AI when playing a skirmish. Meaning you can meet Sauron, Tyrion or any other characters you created. (the heroes have some appearance customization options as well, though not too many)\n\nThe game will create memorable moments. Like the time when, while busy with my northern expansion, my kingdom of religious orcs was sheepishly invaded from the east by a distant (and so far peaceful) neighbour. After loosing a city, i mustered my entire armada and, like Russia on 90% Georgian sale day, invaded and conquered their entire kingdom in a matter of a few turns.\n\nBut this is were some might see a problem, and there are a few with this game:\n- AI is really not that good, not even on harder difficulties. it can stand it's own in battles, you might even loose a few if you're not careful, but the strategy map AI seems rather dumb;\n- "Classes" (aka civilizations) with a level-1 scout spell will have a massive advantage over other civs, since they will get a good scouting unit early and cheap;\n- Multiplayer does not have "Simultaneous Turns" options, which in PvP makes sense, since the battles need to take place, but it also makes Coop (players vs AI) almost impossible, unless you like waiting 6-7 minutes in the end-game for your buddy to take his turn;\n- zooming out to maximum displays a beautifully crafted map... that displays no borders unless the area is in your line of sigh (minor, personal, grudge). you'd think that, if X kingdom conquered Y city, word would reach my court, eventually.","May 5","true","60.2"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","56","64","5","1"

Orc civilians were rushing around, gathering belongings and fleeing their homes. On the horizon, six Ogres were marching forward. I had corralled every unit available in the area into the city, in a last-ditch effort to kill at least one or two of the foul creatures. The force consisted of 2 Musketmen, an Engineer, an Orc Priest and a Dread Monkey. None of those units could take a single Ogre on in a fight, but it was all we could muster. The plan was to force as many casualties on the Ogre's side, fighting them to the death, before our glorious leader came to avenge the fallen with his siege cannons and Juggernaut landships.\n\nI instructed the men to pour burning pitch made from Dragon Oil around the walls, in the hopes it would slow them down, and perhaps damage them further. Our leader cast a Mass Curse on the Ogres from across the world, using up all of his magical power for the time, which weakened their armor and resistance a little bit, but also, unwittingly, it seemed to drop their morale down from a high standing. The Ogres charged the city walls, and became immolated from the pitch. They yelled out in pain and anger, but all struck the walls with their fearsome clubs, shaking the very foundations. It seems the pitch wasn't enough to make these beasts think twice. I ordered the musketmen to fire down upon the beasts, and one fell in the initial volley, while the engineer handed one squad a set of freshly loaded muskets so they could fire again immediately.\n\nAnd then the Dread Monkeys began to fling their own excrement at these lumbering beasts. A foul, uncivilized tactic, but it proved to be too much for our would-be conquerors.\n\nThe Ogre it landed on stopped everything it was doing, and tried desperately to rub off all the filth. The stench was horrific. Nearby Ogres were so repulsed by it that they fumbled, barely damaging the walls they were attempting to tear down. The burning pitch continued to sear their flesh, as the Musketmen fired volley after volley at the hapless monsters. The monkeys danced around, giggling and chattering in glee. Before the dastardly cretins could fling more of their filth at the Ogres, there were none left. All that remained were the charred, punctured corpses of what was once an impressive invasion, and not one of my men had fallen.\n\n\nTL;DR version: Dread Monkeys fling poo at an invading force of Ogres and demoralised them just enough that my ragtag group of defenders held onto a key city instead of being absolutely slaughtered.\n\n10/10 would fling poo again.","October 4, 2015","true","56.7"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","89","54","61","51","0"

There are a lot of supporting mechanics, such as spellcasting, flanking, and varying unit types and abilities, but what it all adds up to are tactical battles where you always have interesting choices to make. The battles are fun to watch unfold even after playing for hundreds of hours.\n\nThe game comes with two fairly long single player campaigns, a random map generator, and an editor that allows you to make your own maps, scenerios, and campaigns.\n\nMultiplayer works well, but unfortunately the tactical battles can cause things to grind to a halt. I don't recommend trying to play more than a one on one multiplayer game unless you and your opponent have entire days worth of free time. It's unfortunte since Endless Legend, another fantasy 4x, integrates tactical battles into the strategic layer nicely and supports multiple tactical battles at once, something Age of Wonders 3 can't manage.\n\nAoW3 also has PBEM mode, which I play a lot of. Unforuntately you can't control the player vs player battles in this mode, it's autoresolve only.\n\nOverall this is a great game. I also recommend the two expansion DLC that have been released.","May 31, 2015","true","372.3"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","43","45","0","0"

The franchise left some big shoes to fill when they released Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic 11 years ago, and Age of Wonders 3 fills them admirably.\n\nAt its core the Age of Wonders series are turn-based strategy games with turn-based strategic battles set in a fantasy world full of fantastic creatures and magic. You pick between different races, create your leader, build an empire and set out to claim the land as your own. You can forge alliances with other leaders (both AI or other players, if you play multiplayer matches) or try to conquer the world on your own. Your leader and hireable heroes are different to your main army in that they can level up and gain a plethora of new abilities and equippable items. Magic is an always-present factor in Age of Wonders. You constantly research new sorceries and in battle you will most often find yourself flinging powerful spells with your heroes while the rest of your army engages in more traditional combat, which also has its own nuances with line-of-sight penalties and flanking mechanics, on top of other things.\n\n\nAge of Wonders 3 stays true to the spirit of the previous titles while bringing new features to the table. The most game-changing feature is the introduction of classes. When you start a game you pick a leader, race, class and specialization. Each class gets many dedicated units that are restricted to this class only, for example Arch-druids can get hunters while Mages can summon wisps. The same is true for spells, a Warlord could get a spell that sends an enemy unit into a fit of rage, making it unable to tell friend from foe, while a Rogue might send a plague of brigands upon an enemy city.\n\nHere are some of the features you can expect:\n\n+ 6 playable races, all with their benefits and drawbacks (Draconian, Dwarves, High-Elves, Goblins, Humans, Orcs)\n+ Many different spells and units to research, depending on your chosen race, class and specialization\n+ Units can level up and gain increased stats, while heroes gain new abilities\n+ Neutral cities and dwellings that offer quests and access to unique units and items for your heroes\n+ 2 full campaigns serving as a tutorial\n+ Random map generator with a plethora of changeable settings to tailor maps to your liking\n+ 8 pre-built scenarios of varying sizes with their unique twists, for multiplayer as well as singleplayer\n+ Multiplayer with up to 8 players\n+ Ships with the same level editor the developers use\n\nIf you are into turn-based strategy games you owe it to yourself to at least take a closer look at Age of Wonders 3!","April 6, 2014","true","357.2"," 63 of 83 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","63","83","0","0"

Also I review the game with all DLCs so far (Necromancer was the last), but only the single layer part.\n\nThis game is really fantastic :) I have now almost 200 hours in gemeplay and still have not finished the last campaign (and not even started smaller maps or MP).\n\nPro\n+ Tactical fight is great. With the same stack of unit(s) you can either loose all or win with no loss. It's all about preparation and tactics.\n+ I like the storytelling and the voices are quite nice (especially the halfling hero)\n+ The maps are very different and made with much love\n+ Really overwhelming (in a good way) amount of units, monsters and heroes\n+ The ingame help is fantastic. Press F1 and simply search. With a few exceptions everthing is explained very good.\n+ The graphics lack detail and are kind of old, but very athmospheric\n+ I get bored easily, but this game suprises me even after 200 hours of gameplay with new units, new skills. new game concepts, races, monsters....\n+ 18 months after release there are still new DLCs with quite heavy modifications and also free updates with new game concepts\n\nCon (mostly only minor)\n- The UI just sows you two ros of skills for your hero. I discovered only in the last cmapaign that not more skills than 12 are shown. You cann access them with clicking on your heros portrait but I sure missed some before. This could be easily solved with pressing of alt and shift to swap between more skills. Developers?\n- not all things are explained in the ingame help. What is "weakness 5"?\n- Diplomacy is very basic and can be exploited by evil heroes (breaking peace = bonus points)\n- The necromancer seem to be not as balanced as the other classes. One of it's main features is reanimation of your troops, your hero or other troops. This can simply be stopeed by placing living units on top of an (un)dead stack\n\nIf you lke turn based exploring and combat and love good tactics, I really recommend this game to you.","September 12, 2015","true","204.6"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","34","40","6","0"

The negatives aren't all bashers, the positives aren't all fanboi's.  You'll get a good picture of what this game offers and where it is lacking.  This is my take.\n\nPro's:\nThe hex-7 combat. You can flank prior to engaging, but you may leave an army vulnerable to attack (it affects placement in the battlefield.. except against a city)\n\nThe hero "Leader" capabilities.  Each army (group of 6 units including hero) can have a hero as a leader.  Heros can pick from abilites to strenghten themselves or provide army-wide bonuses.\n\nThe Dreadnaught Class (while overall not high on my personal list) is really neat.  They are mech-based, rather than magic.  If you use their higher special units, you need other special units to heal them.  This matters most if your empire included multiple races.  Healers can't heal machines, and workers can't heal normal units.  I like that concept. :reusgreed:\n\nSpell options are "random" which helps split up the monogamy of game play (with a few exceptions).\n\nUnderground & above ground, + teleporters, water tunnels, and 6v6 "dungeons" with unique item (Strong, Epic, Legendary, and Mythical difficulties. :ghlol: )\n\nThe graphics.\n\nCon's:\n\nThe basic race & class units are carbon copies of each other.  Slight differenced being pure damge vs a resistance-based damage type)\n\nThe buildings are all exactly the same (except the T2 & T3 class buildings.. but the resource from them isn't a game changer).\n\nThe spell system is lacking, in comparison to Master of Magic.  There are obvious "winners" for large maps/games, which are to be avoided in smaller/shorter games.\n\nAs above, there are several abilities/spells which only have true functionally in MP... thus wastes a spell slot.\n\nAgain, as above, the spells are generated "randomly" based on your leader choices.  While not entirely bad (MoM was like that also), the MultiPlayer-biased or large map-biased abilities aren't balanced out of the choices.  Likewise, they don't recive more weight in those circumstances.\n\nSo that's really just one big one, split into 3 parts and the last being a pro & con.\n\n\n--------\nI've not gotten the xpac.. but that's supposed to add a few more nice things to the game.  Worth the expansion price? Not sure yet.  Next sale though.. ;)\n\nThere are a few things they could do differently, from a deisgn standpoint, but given the origins and overal gameplay..  It's definitely a good $20-30.00 game.  Not sure about $40-45 (not counting the expansion)\n\nApparently there is a bug that can crash and lose all of your data.  I haven't run into that one yet.  It does have occasional "lag" on the large + maps.\n\nI defenitely enjoy it, so far, I'm just a bit picky about things.\n--------\n\nWhat they could do to "fix" some of the holes in the game:\n\nMake a couple of "difficult" races, that are OP'd, but  cost more.\nMake a couple of "easy" races, that are weak, but fast to max out.\n\nMix up the complexity of the city structures.  Maybe Orcs only get a shrine, not a grand temple, etc... then balance it out other ways. (can tie into above)\n\nGet rid of the "Knowledge Points" resource.  It becomes 100% worthless at some point in the game. :angrytitan: Merge "Mana Income" and "Knowledge Points" and let the player balance the resource between the two. (mana income if dor spell upkeep, unit purchase, initial spell cast, etc..  Knowledge Points only go to how fast you research spells)\n\nUnbalance the spell system some more.  Let a Mastery level always yield a really bad@$$ unit and global power.\n\nWeigh out some of the spells that favor different game maps and MP vs SP.   There shouldn't be a clear "winner" for them, on that front. (These are in the Class-specific spells, regardless of your focuses, and the one focus realm of expansionisim.)  If a balance can't be reached easily.. simply making a counterpart (with a note on each as to what they favor) that is equally beneficial in the opposite playstyle is fine.","January 22, 2015","true","50.7"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","35","42","3","1"

You are probably right and do so immediately.\n\nFor a bit more detail:\n\nI'm not even more than 170 turns on a big map,I can already tell you that this is an awesome game.\n\nAt first I thought it was just going to be another 4x clone, which are also great, don't get me wrong, but it's a lot cooler than a lot of games I have played.\n\nThe thing that sets it apart to me is that IT'S DEEP.  And while production and exloration and exploitaing are still the core of the game, there are a LOT of other elements that you REALLY have to consider if you are going to win.  It's much less of a numbers game and a lot more of a strategy game like CHESS.  It is mainly an empire conquest game as well.  There IS diplomacy, but you best be prepared to back that up with force.  It's not really a builder game, but you can totally turtle up if you want to.  If you want to survive in the world you have to maintain your empire.  And thats' before you even meet other players on the max size map.\n\nFirst off, you have to create your game.  As per most 4x games, there are a ton of options.\n\nThere are at least 4 starting modes ranging from nothing but a city builder and a couple of military units, to having a fairly established state with big armies so you can go right to combat if you want!\n\nNext, you get to create your LEADER.  Your leader has a class, and a race. You can completely customize this leader just like an MMO or RPG. There are several classes and several races so that is a lot of options and there are both racial AND class bonuses.  All the classes are "rock paper scissors".  They all have different strengths and weakneeses and they are designed to be equal, if different.  I haven't confirmed how balanced they are yet.  But if you want voral bunny rabbits defending your city, Hobbit Druid has it!  In addition to that, you can style your charcter as you want, create your own flag and colors.  You get to choose 3 major abilities for your leader, such as the power to summon fire elementals out a pool of many!  You feel an imediate connection with the character.\n\nWhen you get in the game, it's EASY to pick up if you have any experience with a 4x game and even novices can probably figure it out if they click enough things and there are tool tips on everything.  It was very easy for me to pick up.\n\nThe maps are great looking, but the cool part is that there are Volcanic, plagues, frost, and I think a couple of more types of territory and the TERRITORIES are ALSO rock paper scissors for the RACES of your leader and heros, and this factors into the game.  If you send anti volcanic troops into volcanic territory they are going to be far less efficient because moral will be low.  Things matter in this game.\n\nAnother actually cool thing is that there AREN'T these giant research build trees to go through.  You can upgrade a city to max pretty quick in easy mode, which I am playing now in order to get a better handle on the game, but I'm sure the STRATEGY racks up quick.  There are like 3 levels for most abilites.  If you want to park your city and just produce mana you can do that.  Some units can fight on water.  Heroes can and do level up, and units can gain veterancy.\n\nBuild cues are kept to a maximum of 5 cue items, either research or unit production.  Yes, it means you will visit your cue more often, but it works in this game because there are less actual cities on the map with an even spread.  There aren't a lot of city upgrades, so you can blow through them pretty quick.  BUT each of them matter a LOT.  You have to research archers if you want archers.  If you want to build a weapn forge (which crafts actual items for your heros) you have to research it first as expected.  There were about maybe 15 unit types under the hobbit units. (give or take).\n\nArmies are also streamlined because you can only have a maxium of 6 units per army (at least in the game I am playing, not sure if you can change that, but I don't think so.  This is GOOD because you are far less concerned with how BIG your armies are, but WHERE they are and what units are in them!\n\nAnother thing is that each hero or your leader in the game has their own character sheet and as they gain levels you can spend points on any NUMBER of spells and abilities and you actually USE these abilities in combat!  There is ALSO a "diablo like" item page complete with a bag, and character outfitting, and you can send items from one hero to another.   The time it takes to do that is based on the distance of the heroes from each other.  So all the gear AND the spells make this hero or charcter very unique and deployable for specifc roles in an army.\n\nIN addition to that you have a SPELL BOOK which keeps each of the spell abilties of all of your heroes in combat and also GLOBAL spells that you can use to rain fire down units, or convert plague land to fertile forests for example.  You have to SHARE mana between the strategic spells and the close combat spells so it has to be managed wisely!  You learn spells by using research points (candles!) and there are many of them!  You can only cast a certain number of strategic spells per turn, depending on what they are.\n\nAlso, the spells are somewhat dictated by RACE and CLASS!  So the spellbook is different for each game.  But some classes are bad at magic and a lot less effectve with less options.  The Warlord class for example.  But they make up for that with better armor and weapons and archers.\n\nIn addition to your basic units that you produce, when you are successful Heros offer to join, and you can have them join you for a one time fee (I think all units have maintence fees, as expected).  Once a hero joins you, they get a character sheet EXACTLY like your Leader's charcater sheet.  Every hero you get is randomized based off race, class, and abilities so they are all UNIQUE.  Sometimes you can win a unit in battle, or a random unit to town will join you.\n\nThe map is filled wtih independants and non-player kingdoms.  They can be hostile or neutral.  If you try and conquer them, some will run but some will fight.  Best be prepared if you want  to win, but stay close enough to your cites or a dragon might blow through and mess up your day!  Sometimes there is an opportunity for them to run, and you can choose between killing them or letting them run.  If you let them run you get good alignment and if you kill them you get evil.  Yes, there are good and evil abilities available when you spec your leader and for your heros.\n\nSo basically, between the several terrain types, the rock paper scissors aspect of the heros and leader as well as chaning the compositon of each 6 unit army, you get BAZILLIONS of combinations, and all of the race units are themed for that race like the Hobbit Eagle Rider.  This means just a crazy amount of replayability.\n\nFinally, the COMBAT is VERY cool!  When you zoom in to the battle (IF you choose to manually fight it out) it's an area themed for the place it is.  I went in to one battle zone in a shrine and the objects decorating the shrine created obstacles that had to be worked around in the fight!  Terrain IN the fights is absolutely factors into game play.  Flanking and charging are ALSO part of the game.  If you have a hero on a mount you can charge into an enemy.  Each spellcaster can cast 1 spell per turn, so the combat really revolves around all those abilties you chose for your character.\n\nAnyway, it's all amazing.  If you like strategy games OR RPGS OR 4x genre games, you will very likely like this one.\n\nI see many hours of gaming awesomeness ahead.\n\n","October 31, 2015","true","375.4"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

I consider myself well within the target market for AOW III, as I mostly play games along the RPG-Strategy spectrum.\n\nAs much as I hate to say it, I agree entirely with the top-rated negative review (by dacasonic). AOW III isn't bad, it just lacks depth. There are way too few units (really just one type of : light infantry, heavy, infantry, archer, cleric, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, trebuchet for everyone + 4 class units?), the research is one-dimensional (unlock a handful of units, terraforming and some spells), tactical spells are somewhat varied, but can't be used nearly enough and don't feel impactful due to a (in my opinion) mediocre resource system....\n\nIn essence, my biggest qualm with the game is how little there is to look forward to. In HOMM, I look forward to unlocking level 5 spells, top-tier creatures or upgrading my hero, because those things immediately feel impactful and rewarding. In Shogun II, I can't wait to get those hero samurais on the field or finish a massive citadel in a border city. In civilization, reaching milestones (wonders, key techs, even your first settler) feels bloody great and is immediately rewarding gameplay-wise. Even in Fallen Enchantress, a second-tier X4 game, upgrading towns, levelling heroes and reaching certain research milestones feel rather gratifying and makes the player want to go on "one more turn".\n\nThere is no equivalent in AOW III. Cities don't feel worth caring about (and it's a drag to keep them from getting overtaken by sneaky flying invaders). There are no great projects to feel excited about. Units are obtained early and the game turns into a variety-less grind within an hour of its start.\n\nMaybe the game could have been salvaged by a better hero progression and XP distribution system, to give the player something worth caring about.

I would get this game.\nWhile the genre probably could use a game to revolutionize it a bit, this game does enough new things to keep your interest if you are captivated by 4x genre.  You may be annoyed with some things here and there, but overall the balance is strong enough and they are working on improving the balance and adding more content to sink your teeth into.\n\nIf you are interested in fantasy lore, role-playing/story-making, primarily and racial interactions... I would get it on sale or wait.\nDo some research on the game first; if you find the lore interesting, purchase it if you haven't played any game in the genre or wait to see how the updates improve and add to the game in a few months.  Keep in mind you can also create some interesting quests with the map editor/maker.\n\nIf you haven't really played much strategy 4x fantasy games and are curious... I would get this game now or on sale.\nYour enjoyment of the game will be higher if you have an open-mind and like intricate game systems.\n\nIf you are looking for a fast-paced, mind-blowing, competitive game... do not purchase the game or do more research.  The pacing is similar to other strategic games like Civilization.  Also, there is nothing in here that will take your breath away, at least immediately.  The engagement relies on the stories and histories that are created from the complex systems and events that occur.\n\nOverall...\nAOW3 is a quality game that could use some improvements.  Fortunately, the developers care so improvements are on the way.  There  isn't too much else in the genre being made at the moment either and is better than its nearest fantasy-strategy competitors.  But feel free to check out games like Warlock, Fallen Enchantress, and Endless Legend as they offer slightly different fare if tactical combat is not entirely for you.","November 27, 2014","true","67.2"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","30","38","2","0"

The game is still super snowbally and overall, the mechanics still kill fun. I do, in fact, think the single player is alright now though.\n\nAgain, keep in mind that I'm going to focus on the multiplayer aspect only. I didn't play civ to play by myself, and neither did I buy this with that intent.\n\nOld content/Base game (This is now current 04/19/15):\n\nFirst, the positives:Tactical combat: This is what the game sells itself with. The concept, how it's designed is actually quite fun on its own. If you like Endless Legend's combat, you would like this.\n\nRace/Class combos: One of my favorite things for the longest time was the different race and class combos would actually cause you to play differently based on what race you put with what class. The developers have indeed succeeded in improving parity some in 1.5.\n\nMap generator: More often than not, I enjoyed the randomness, aside from predicible positioning of capitals. Powerful treasures, like production materials/scrolls are now guarded.\n\nDiverse Units: Units are diverse, and even units from the same class may have differences between races.\nNow for the bad.Balance: Dear god, balance. Heroes have always meant to be powerful, and that is fine. But the majority of experiences players you meet will use heroes as spell casters. This doesn't sound so bad, right? Well, spells, in tactical combat have infinite range. If your hero is on the battlefield, it can hit anything. Your leader can do it even if he/she isn't there for double cost. The majority of matchups will be determined by spells. If not that, you will see tactics such as run and heal. In short, play to the utmost efficiency.\n\nScouts/city mechanics: Scout wars are still annoying, and the flying ones are especially capable of taking cities, particularly the incorporeal ones. All units in any amount or strength are capable of burning any city in 2 turns, and any fort or watchtower instantly. I cannot emphasize this enough, the most central mechanic to continuing the game is the LEAST secure. This will turn your disadvantages into a landslide.\n\nThe community: The community has become somewhat insular now, as 90% or more of the lobbies are locked. Join a steam group or the forums to try and get in, don't try to meet people in lobbies.\n\nAutocombat: To be frank, to manually do every battle yourself is not feasible in this game in multiplayer. Unlike Endless legend, which is very fluid about its manual combat for the most part, manual combat in this game stops all other action for every player that is not in combat. You either get to watch or not depending on what the host decided before the game starts. So you have to use autocombat... except that the AI in autocombat tries to resolve things as quickly as possible by having both sides rush at each other, tactics be damned. Therefore the losses are always higher than they should be, and unless you've played for as long as I have, you shouldn't expect to accurately predict the results, which to my knowledge is not a common skill.\n\nFog of war: Once you initially explore the map, it shows everything happening except units. You see all changes and spell casting locations without vision if you're attentive. While this is a skill, it's not much of a fog.\nPatch 1.5:The new vassal system is actually pretty cool. You can now relinquish control of a city to the independents (vassalship is also the step before actually owning the city, too, so you can get it back). When you do this, the independents will pay you a portion of the total income and occasionally give you tributes ranging from resources to a small army (whose strength is based on the current size of the city). The vassal will also keep their city defended, which makes vassalship the answer to the player who lacks the ability to defend from silly things like wisp spam or something. It's not all good though. Much like burning a city, you can make a vassal out of any city in 2 turns no matter the size of the city, and after those two turns, the city will instantly spawn an army relative to the size of the city. Too much, too fast.\n\nGuard breaking: Now a thing.\n\nThe new race governing and race happiness system adds a bit of flavor to the game that causes the way you play to have an impact on the people in your empire, and thus affect you. Now, if you migrate for optimization, it doesn't just impact your (ignorable) alignment, you've made one race pretty happy, and really upset another one. Good luck making use of them when their units are starting out unhappy. I have nothing but good things to say about this system, although I haven't had the time to explore every option with every race.\n\nCosmic events: Adds random events to the game, which are mostly status modifiers. Some are positive, some are negative. Some only affect certain people. Some affect everyone. Fun in theory, but I find that I'm often annoyed by the results since it can cause damages to your empire through no fault of your own. The appearance of the boss drastically affects one person. The encounter is around legendary difficulty, and it roams the map. The items if you win are powerful, but I wouldn't lose a city temporarily or lose 4-5 units to secure it (in auto-combat). Overall, I think I would play with cosmic events off with other people to keep the frustration levels down for us all.\nExpansion content (yeah, I bought it to review):Necromancer is actually a rather nice addition to the game. It turns the class system a bit upside down because it has completely new mechanics added to the game (happiness and morale isn't a thing when you're dead, rushing causes your undead puppets to be destroyed instead, presumably because it's hard to rush and keep things safe, you also get population from killing things, which is kind of awesome). In practice, it plays a bit like a combination of theocrat (healing), sorcerer (supports are very important for more than just healing, and you get a decent spell selection), and warlord (with emphasis on debuffing rather than buffing, but you DO get some pretty nice battle enchantments like a warlord would).\n\nFrostlings: They play a bit like a combination of draconians and humans (I'm approximating), my two favorite races, so naturally I like them. They lose physical power in exchange for doing frost damage. Their pikemen are amazing (and tier 2). Love the race overall, but frozen flames (their support buff) will be op until it doesn't have fire resist (normally the race weakness), especially when used on frostling necromancer reanimators. (It also gives +2 fire/+2 ice damage to melee/range and inflict chilling, which is -20% ice resist/-1 defense.) Huge upsides in exchange for no healing.\n\nTigrans: Poor Tigrans. Has the exact same weaknesses as orc (with even less healing!) with almost none of the upsides. -1 resist, no healing except support once per fight self-heal, who then lose their range for the rest of the battle, low range damage on archers in exhange for bleeding (in fairness, units do more melee damage to bleeding units... but no healing). You need considerable skill to make use of their unique talents.\n\nHalflings: Fun little race. They scale a lot on unit happiness. They have -20% phys resist in exchange for Lucky. A mechanic that makes every offensive ability have a chance to miss them. Seems not worth it at first, but it includes spells and such, and actually net decreases incoming damage. They lack elemental damage though.\n\nSpecializations: Their themes are essentially chaotic magic, neutral good, neutral evil, and balance/anti-unnatural. They offer really nice tools that can offset racial and class weaknesses.\nLiterally out of space, so I hope I wrote enough to help you guys make your own impressions, guys.","October 28, 2014","false","645.8"," 267 of 452 people (59%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","59","267","452","18","39"

Coming from the Civilization series, I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of this game but I was pleasantly surprised. Age of Wonders III blends RPG and strategy mechanics together and creates a really unique experience. You can design your own character like in a real RPG game, deciding their look, race, and class which determines the types of units you can use and also the types of spells you can utilize and research (research spells instead of technology in this game). You get a massive Civilization-like map to build cities upon and explore and during combat you get to fight on a randomized map and do turn based combat with TONS of soldiers and hero units.\n\nYou can play Age of Wonders in a randomly generated scenario, campaign, or with friends in head to head multiplayer. Both of the campaigns for the game are very well done, have good voice actors, and compelling gameplay.\n\nThe only real turnoff for the game for those coming from other 4x strategy games is unlike games like Endless Space and/or Civilization, the only way to really win this game is through conquest.

Most fights come down to simply having stronger units but even if you have low tier units you can still sometimes win nearly impossible fights with a good mix of strategy and spells.\n\nIndividual battles can range from one unit vs one unit to massive wars that can take nearly an hour to complete. If you're impatient (and are sure of victory or defeat) you can also select the auto option which will measure your strength against your opponents and the computer will instantly dictate the winner of the fight.\n\nEach class rewards you with unique units and spells and each race also has specific units as well as its own strengths and weaknesses.  Some classes focus on mobility and ranged units, one focuses on spells and summoning, one focuses on resurrecting hoards of undead, one focuses on spying and debuffing, one focuses on healing and buffing, and the other simply conquers as much territory as they can to produce as many units as possible. On top of all that, when you make your hero you're also given a choice of specializations that even further customizes your spell choices and strengths/weaknesses. As you can see, this allows for nearly endless combinations of ways to play the game.

It is a mix of a few things actually, there is lite empire management (think Civilization), hero customization and - the main focus of the game - huge turn based tactical battles.\n\nFor a game of this kind it's refreshingly bug free, but there are some serious balance issues still. Nothing that can't be patched though. And even in the release state I had a real quality 40 hours of enjoyment with it already. It can only get even better from here on.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, here are the problems the game still has at the time of this review IMO:\n\n- Tier IV units are so much better than anything else, they make older units obsolete and the best tactic is rushing and spamming them. Also if you can't kill the enemy in time to prevent them from getting stacks of T IV units, you basically lost. If you have them, the battles lose their tactical depth. Just move forward and smash all opposition.\n- The heroes are super squishy and you instantly lose the game if they die (in the campaign, in custom maps they are still perma dead at least), which makes you not really want to use them, which is a shame because they are some of the most interesting units in the game\n- The economy is off, mana is practically limitless, gold is either no issue or a good sign that you'll lose within few turns if it becomes one\n- Little item variety, you'll quickly amass triple and quadruple copies of each item in your hero's inventory if you comb the map dilligently\n\n\n\n","April 9, 2014","true","41.6"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It takes most (but not quite all) of what was great about MoM, and puts it into a modern package, with a slick UI, great graphics and large single-player campaigns. It even improves significantly on some gameplay elements compared to MoM, like the tactical combat and the concept of leader domain.\n\nIf you are a fan of Master of Magic, just buy it already, don't wait another second.

Now that I have that out of the way the detail that the developers have put in this game is pretty impressive.  Each individual unit makeup and descriptions are pretty well done as well pretty funny on some of the unit discriptions, similar to Warcraft humor.  The tactical combat is a pleasure to do even though there is a option for auto-resolve. I wouldn't suggest auto resolving too much unless your cut for time, and this game is not really made to be rushed and get it done game.  Like the old saying goes its good to smell the flowers sometimes and you should do this in this game because the animation and tactical combat is a thing of beautify.  The unit detail as you battle is so detailed I had to zoom all the way to appreciate the orc's armor and color scheme,  it's that good.\n\nYou can tell they put alot of love and effort in this game.  There is so so much detail besides the units makeup, terrain, heroes, etc. etc...  I just can't go thru all of it, it was pretty much worth my hard earn money.   Gameplay is very addictive and the story is interesting and keeped me involved.\n\nNow everything isn't perfect like when siege units break down walls.  Its hard to see from the animation that the wall was destroyed or not.  I keeped attacking the same wall because of it.  Only way I knew that the wall was destroyed was that I accidently moved a unit past the castle and it moved threw the wall.  Thats probably going to be patched since this is fairly a new game.  I am sure there are other bugs but nothing I have played so far that crashes the game.  Its pretty stable and the turns are rather quick after you finish your round.  I would say it takes few secs for the next round, thats really fast, which is pretty impressive compaired  to game like Rome Total War 2. It seemed like forever to wait for your next turn the Total War game.  Yes these two games are different but just trying to point out that turns are pretty quick and fluid in Age of Wonders 3.\n\nAll in all I would highly recommend this game to any turn base strategist and fantasy buff.  The intereface is so easy I believe it might attract a wider audience besides the aftermentioned gamers.  Yes, this will suck your time like no other.  I went straight 4 hours playing and didnt even notice the time go by, thats how enjoyable this game is.  Just smell the flower and trust me dont rush threw this flower bed or you will miss the beauty of this game.\n\nNOTE: I purchased the game and was not a Beta tester or a employee of them. lol","March 31, 2014","true","16.1"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","29","43","0","1"

Man, I am not disappointed.  Personally, it keeps my interest better than Civ V because of the unpredictable variance of the random maps.  I started playing the recommended campaign, but that was right when I got it, and needed to learn how to play this game.  I quickly switched to the random maps and have been having a blast with the curve balls this game throws at you.  I took over a dwelling of giants at one point and was carefully upkeeping it before producing a giant unit due to the expensive maintenence when suddenly a city on my outer borders got attacked by a very nasty undead dragon.  The dwellings are cool if you can take them over, but are fierce opponents.  If you take over or are joined by an independent city of another race, you can make units of that race.   Learning the game is an experience that increases its replayability.  At first I thought goblins were unfairly weak, but after playing other races, I learned some goblin units are pretty darn superior for their type.  You can basically play the way you want - if you want to be warlike, go ahead and invade and break treaties, or whatnot.  There are rewards for getting an evil alignment as well as good if you want to try more diplomatic methods such as doing quests to absorb cities.  I can't say much about the campaigns or the multiplayer at this point, as I am having too much fun with the random maps to try them yet.  I totally recommend this game if you like Civ games and myth-related turn based strategies.","May 4, 2014","true","133.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

With over five hundred hours on record, and a healthy amount of those hours spent playing multiplayer with members of the Something Awful community, and most if not all the hidden things explored, I still find joy in loading this game up and taking a necromancer out for a spin as I turn the entire world into an open grave. I still find myself impressed by the swathe of modding content, adding more hours to the lifespan of this game.\n\nOn that note, it is worth emphasising, Please get the collection and not just the base game. Eternal Lords is worth the difference alone, while golden realms is also a really strong expansion. The Delux DLC is a nice bonus but the real prize is Eternal Lords. Necromancers are a very fun class but Tigrans and Frostlings are also great races to play as well.\n\nNow, lets discuss comparisons. This is not Civ, nor is it Endless Legend. In both of those games, you have a few other ways to win, you can play as an economic powerhouse who wins by driving everyone into a happy friendship circle. This is not how Age of Wonders 3 plays. War is here. War is how you win.\n\n* Drive your enemies leaders to their knees and take their thrones.\n* Find the seals of power, drive away the guardians and stand upon them, facing rival kingdoms and angry elementals until you master control of the place of power and turn it upon your foes in victory.\n* Unite races together and ignite beacons of unity, driving your enemies mad with envy as you prove your mastery of diplomacy by the sword as well as the tongue.\n\nYou do not win Age of Wonders by becoming king of treasure hill or cutting into other cultures like a knife, You win age of wonders by the sword and the spell. You will lead mighty armies of golems, backed by the might of goblin riflemen. Armies of high elf berserkers, howling furious challenge. Armies of frostling spellcasters, standing alongside summoned beasts. Armies of undead humans, still wielding spiritual fire even while bound to your dreadful will.\n\nHeroes will be at your command to be equipped by the prizes you rip from ancient tomb and bandit-infested farmstead. From swords to rings to mounts, all waiting to be claimed and lost when your rivals finally kill your promising champion and scatter their prizes to the wind.\n\nYou win in Age of Wonders in battle, and battle is what this game does very well. On this note I advise checking youtube for a few videos of the combat. Words don’t really capture it, nor do comparisons. Best to see for yourself.\n\nI think by this point I’ve said enough. There are other reviews that go into more technical details then I have, I am simply writing from a very bias place of love.\n\nThere are battles to be won, cities to be courted, inn’s to be explored, caves to be feared, lairs to be cleared, heroes to be leveled, heroes to regret losing, items to be won, armies to be lost, beacons to be lit, seals to be defended and grand spells to be cast.

I've wanted to play a game like this for some time now. I haven't played the previous AOW games but I'm glad I finally found this one. It's a great blend of Civ and HOMM.

The graphics are great and the customization of your leader are very nice. There are a ton of settings that you can adjust to enhance your game.\n\nThe multiplayer is very good. If you autofight independents then it goes by fast. There isn't a lot of waiting around for your opponent to take their turn (hello Warlock games).\n\nI haven't even played the campaigns yet. I prefer sandbox mode.\n\nThe expansion adds a lot to the game and is reasonably priced. I bought the base game on a 50% off sale. At $20 you cannot beat it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/int19h/recommended/226840/","int19h","mad kitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/int19h/","408 products in account","If you have played the past installments of the series, here's a brief overview. First of all, this is definitely AoW as we knew and loved it. Game mechanics is closer to AoW2/SM than it is to AoW1 - there are domains, you don't need siege units to take out walled cities (tho they help), lots of various buildings with a tree of what is needed for what, can build settlers and found cities etc. Overall I'd say changes to core mechanics compared to SM are relatively minor, and focus mainly on tactical combat, where we now have flanking and a more clear mechanics for ranged shots. All in all, if you liked AoW series, and especially AoW:SM, highly recommended. Personally, I still think AoW1 is the best of them all, but this one is still plenty of fun. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome and very much reminiscent of the very first game.\n\nIf you haven't played AoW before, but remember the name "Master of Magic", then you can basically think of this as a remake of MoM. Again, if you liked that game, you will probably like this.\n\nIf neither of those ring a bell, the short way to describe this would be Civilization crossed with Heroes of Might and Magic, with some special uniqueness of its own.\n\nThe Civilization part is the global map where you capture and/or build cities, manage them to grow their population, build various buildings that improve growth/production/gold/mana/research or produce units, and research spells and special abilities. There's also a HoMM-esque aspect to it as the map is littered with loot and special gold/mana/research producing buildings, typically guarded by NPC mobs. However, unlike HoMM, the global gameplay is definitely geared more towards city management.\n\nWhen it comes to combat, you can either auto-resolve it, or go into tactical mode like HoMM. Now the big difference here is that, where HoMM is basically two armies of 6 unlimited stacks of units battling on a very small map lined against each other, in AoW you get the combat map produced out of the hex that's being attacked (on the global map), plus the six hexes surrounding it - and all the armies on them! Each army consists of up to 6 units (which CANNOT be stacked), and can technically belong to a different player, or independent mobs (some of which will fight each other). So you can have up to 42 independent units in combat, controlled by anywhere from 2 to 7 players, and with a large combat map which presents plenty of opportunity for maneuver - flanking, retreating to form a line etc are all very common here and have to be learned to fight efficiently, plus the terrain is full of buildings, trees and other obstacles that can be used as cover or to break up enemy line. Consequently, battles typically last longer than in HoMM, especially large city sieges, and are far more tactically challenging - superiority in numbers by no means ensures victory.\n\nAnother HoMM-like-but-better thing is hero and leader development. You get the usual system with hero classes, experience points accumulating from kills etc, invested into various skills and traits. There is inventory, too, to be filled by loot from various ruins after evicting their occupants.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid high fantasy 4X game that is rather engaging and a lot of fun.","April 2, 2014","true","43.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"

Truth be told, I agree with you there. But the game makes for it in THE BEST way by being 5x more in depth than Civ in combat. Civ combat has got to be one of the most boring things that have turned me away from the game. Purely, if I were to play it for economic, diplomatic, and technological victories then Civ would be my ideal game.\n\nHowever, let's be real here we want to fight. We want to see Elven Arrows blasting holy damage into undead and dealing critical damage that sends zombies flying. We want to see Frostling Mammoth charging into a line of human swordsmen and send them packing or frozen solid from wizard buffs.\n\nIsn't that more interesting then your typical "right click this group because hey scissors beats paper."\n\nThe hero customization is pretty damn interesting, while you maybe thinking: "There are only a few options in the beginning what are you talking about?" The true customization begins when you are leveling up on the campaign map where you can allocate stats, and new skills unlock the higher level you are. These are all incredibly unique.\n\nAND NOW THERE IS MODDING. So even if the core selling points didn't get you (Which if they didn't you've got quite a boring taste for video games, I'm sorry) The community has made re-skin mods, unleashed whole new races, created ridiculous legendary nits for your favorite races, and more.\n\nIf you're a fan of Age of Wonders, just get the game. I usually wait for it to be on sale to buy games anyway since 30$ is a little high, but it was worth it when I got it. If you're a fan of Civ games but want to take a break, THEN TAKE A BREAK. This game IS NOT CIV. It has MUCH higher emphasis on military campaigns and military strategy, and MUCH less on building/economic strategy that Civ excels at. Don't get me wrong, I understand why Civ is a success, but this game is NOT civ so stop comparing the two, lol.","March 7","true","196.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Shallow, at most.\nDo not expect a civ4 type of depth in this game. Expect a turn based Warcraft 3. Now let me explain.\n\nFirst thing, Town management lacks real depth, there simply isn't enough tiers of buildings to keep going. Eventually your towns become "perfect" and becomes a building of RTSes where the sole purpose of building a building is to create units.\nThis is very disturbing to immersive gameplay, coupled with the fact that it is very easy to sustain whole armies of troops without having to worry about anything, as long as upkeep stays positive. Works in Warcraft, not in games like this, especially when there aren't much choices when it comes to units.\n\nYes, I said it. Sure there are a lot of them, but since a lot of units are unique to class, unique to race et cetra, when it comes down to you making the choices, it all just fall down to "class of units", archers, infantry and so on. And how many varieties do I have for each of these classes? Usually just one. The choice spectrum becomes even narrower once you realize a lot of units are too underpowered/overpowered - balancing is a big issue here.\n\nResearch is so broken as well. Imagine a bunch of research-lab-type-of-buildings in a RTS. Now hide them inside cities, and put everything into a single UI. Plus make it seemingly random. Sounds confusing? Because it is. This becomes even more frustrating once you finish your whole research tree: All of your research points are now wasted from then on.\n\nPractically the only interesting thing you can do in this game is teraforming. To sum up; if you want a couple of hours span of gameplay each session this might be one for you. If you want a couple of dozens of hours of gameplay session, look else where.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nYes, of course, Xerberus86. Bringing in the "grown-up" factor really helps in a video game debate. I hope you are grown-up enough to get the sarcasm, in case you don't, it means you should realize that the games are games, and opinions are opinions. Different people have different opinions about game they played, and they end up with different thoughts. I thought I would share mine, so that people won't jump in making the same mistakes as I did.\n\nI agree on the point that combat is the main focus on the game, but as far as I am concerned, AoW3 failed to deliver anything new on the table. The combat felt mostly like downgraded version of that of King's Bounty, if you want the whole thing in a single sentence. Let me say it again. The units are poorly balanced, the unit pool have tendency to lack "valid" variety, and units simply pour out from cities in 1 turn making combat rather tedious than fun. Think how many times you rather auto-resolve because you can't be bothered, and end up with a dead hero for no reason, then have to reload to do it manually because you know that is ridiculous.\n\nPlus, repeating what I said about rather playing Civ or mentioning the fact that research "only gives you spells and researched bonuses", just proves my point. To add on that "rant", to see how lazy the game developers were, for example, Civ series have "future tech" research option, which keeps going forever, so that all the universities and observatories you built in cities doesn't go to waste. Not a function AoW3 has. In AoW3 if you over-shoot your research capacity you are left with the feeling you wasted a lot of turns building useless buildings that do you no good. Is this a sign of good game design? Well maybe for you, but for a "grown-up gamer" like me, not a chance.\n\nLastly, I am a gamer for around 20 years now, and I do find myself occasionally falling back to SNES to enjoy some timeless classics such as Chrono Trigger or Earthbound. Having a bit of history however, doesn't mean it can bypass all the criticism. The game is out on 2014, for fu-ks sake, and it should be reviewed as any game that is out on 2014. Not 10 years ago. Hope you keep up with your fan"boy"ing to this franchise, it really helps this franchise to stop improving from 10 years ago.","April 1, 2014","false","14.3"," 167 of 300 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","167","300","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/recommended/226840/","aurumlamina","Aurumlamina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/","1108 products in account","I was pleasantly surprised and impressed when I picked up Age of Wonders III.  A fantasy 4X strategy game is something that will always catch my eye though the genre has disappointed me quite frequently lately.  Fortunately, this particular one nearly flawlessly pulls off what I would expect and lived up to its potential.  This is a fantasy conquest game with a sizable helping of RPG that you don't want to miss.\n\nThe map aspect of the game is fairly simple, though it has enough to it to keep it interesting.  There are plenty of landmarks, cities, and dungeons scattered about and, usually, plenty of space for you to construct new cities and fortresses if you so choose.  Cities can be improved with buildings to assist in growing their populations, boosting their economies, enhancing their defenses, training units, and more.  Though empire management is nowhere near as deep as something akin to Civilization, I never found myself feeling as if anything additional was needed for this particular game.  It is, after all, a conquest game, not an empire builder.\n\nCombat, on the other hand, is where the game truly stands out.  Battles take place on a zoomed in map that is generated based on the features of the terrain being defended.  The turn-based tactical engagements can involve a large number of units and, at times, a single battle can take over twenty minutes.  The AI is no joke in this game and can provide a legitimate opponent which is a breath of fresh air.\n\nProgression for you units and heroes is also an exciting aspect of Age of Wonders III.  When a hero levels, they acquire five skill points that they can purchase skills with.  These skills are from a non-linear tree that is specific to their class.  When a unit levels, it generally gains only stat bonuses, though every unit in the game has at least one unique ability that it can acquire once the required experience has been gained.  The system offers a lot of customization for your hero builds but also manages to make leveling your non-unique units fun as well.\n\nPlaying one of the campaigns in the game offer unique goals and a decently written story, though, they do limit your power over the customization of your heroes.  You are supplied with several heroes that are characters within the story who will take turns acting as the 'leader' of your faction on certain maps.  It is an excellent way to get a grasp of the game and the differing races and classes in a way that dips your toes in slowly instead of hopping in head first.  Your heroes will also carry over from map to map giving them the opportunity to reach levels that would be hard to obtain in scenario play.\n\nWhen playing a scenario, you are able to design your leader from the ground up.  This includes they and their army's race, the hero's class and specializations, and even the appearance of your hero themselves.  There are a fairly significant number of each and you could spend all day deciding which combination you want to play with.  Do you want to play an orcish archdruid and have your melee powerful units complemented by summoned nature-themed units?  Or do you want to play an elven engineer who has their line of dangerous elven archers aided by cannons and musketeers?  The combinations are a lot of fun and the class specific units have different unit models for every race.\n\nIf you couldn't tell by this point, I am quite a fan of Age of Wonders III.  It successfully fills a void that I'd felt in my soul time after time playing the games that were 'inspired' by Master of Magic but couldn't quite hit the mark.  I highly recommend this game for turn-based strategy fans, especially those who are also fans of high fantasy.\n\nRaise your sword, ready your staff, load your musket, sharpen your claws and conquer these lands for yourself!","January 26","true","63.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Though I have seen repeated unit selections, there is enough variation to edge you towards creating multiple heroes just to see what build fits your concept best.  The music has changed in pace from being dreamy to driven synth orchestra... and boasts a great selection of tracks.  The digital soundtrack package included 36 tracks, plus all the cd case art.

It's a fantasy turn-based civ-style game, which is not something you really see a lot of. The campaign leaves much to be desired, the gameplay isn't perfect, and sure, I'd like a little more from the customization options, but this game does a lot of things competently so I can't ask it to be perfect at everything. If you want just an rpg to customize characters, this isn't it. If you want your hero to also lead armies in your growing civilization in a fantasy world, this satisfies that. There's also a map/scenario editor.

The game is a 4X similar to Civilization and Master of Magic, but it takes heavy cues from Heroes of Might and Magic in that the world is littered with goodies thrown about to plunder and neutral enemies guarding them, as well as customisable hero units that you can recruit and level. The best thing about it though, is the tactical battle system. This is nothing new, as Master of Magic, Heroes of Might and Magic, as well as the original Age of Wonders games, all did this a long time ago, but here it feels so refined. Terrain has a big impact, units have cool active and passive abilities, and the strategic choices that you make in battle all feel meaningful. On top of this, the game has great variety. Not only do you have a selection of races to choose, all with their own tech trees and units, but you also have character classes and traits to choose for your leader. Your leader's class and traits will determing what extra special units you can produce, as well as the spells you have access to. The combination of both race and class makes mixing and matching fun to do, and allows you to have much more variety if you get bored of a certain setup, yet still like certain elements of your previous games. The expansions are absolutely worth it if you enjoy the game already. The Necromancer class added by Eternal Lords is amazingly fun, and plays entirely differently than the other classes, with a much more agressive play style that emphasises growing your cities and armies through combat. Over all, Age of Wonders III is one of the best in the genre to date.","April 19, 2015","true","37.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

I was worried in part by how it seemed as if your class defined the vast majority of your army but, having finally gotten the chance to play, all my fears from watching the previews have been quenched. This game feels exactly like AoW2/SM in all the right ways; next to nothing was removed mechanically and the new class and neutral city systems are simply additions, not replacements, to the old ways and they blend in perfectly.\n\nWhile it seems weird to review a game less than a day after having first played it, you should understand that I am the kind of gamer who will play a game I adore for only an hour per day when I'm "into it" and yet, with AoW3, I haven't been able to put it down. The sense of adventure and discovery I've found playing this game is unmatched, though I admit I'm looking at it through rose-coloured glasses. It really feels like a fresh take on the series, and the genre as a whole, without seeming too attached or too spiteful towards its predecessors.\n\nIt is not a flawless game by any means. I've found numerous graphic and sound bugs in the time I've been playing with some battle map terrain acquiring a strobe effect and a few attack sound effects simply missing in the ether. The map generator is still somewhat flawed, leaving a suspicious trail of grass along the edges of some maps and awkwardly placing patches of water in giant lava pools. My first encounter with an NPC in a match had me face to face with the character I had just created minutes before and was currently playing, turning the war into what looked more like bickering twins. These issues to hinder on the immersion quite a bit and hopefully they will be patched in time but it's never enough to make the game any less fun. What DOES make the game less fun is how suicidal the AI is when trying to rely on auto-combat, which is mostly a problem in multiplayer as not using auto-combat takes up a lot of time from everyone involved.\n\nTactical combat is, in my opinion, far more intricate and engaging as any of the older titles. The simple addition of the flanking and defending mechanic, as well as the reworking of the accuracy systems, was enough to vastly increase the depth of the combat but the sheer number of new units and abilities added on top of what we're already used to is almost overwhelming and it makes combat much more surprising, adaptive and satisfying.\n\nThe reworked city system is a rather significant departure from the originals and is what leads many to believe it's taken too much inspiration from Civilization. Having played Civ 5 to death as well, I can say the change does feel more in line with Civilization than the previous Age of Wonders games but it's very unintrusive and comes with a purpose. Now you have to be careful about where and how you place your cities because their growth (and, by extension, they effectiveness) is inhibated by whatever borders surround them and the structures nearby have significant rewards attached whereas, in the older games, you would place cities as close as possible because more cities just meant more gold, no more thought involved. Here, cities hold a much more strategic purpose and can lead to epic battles fought over one mostly unimpressive city just because it has a structure you want in its domain. It's exciting and thought provoking and feels natural in the evolution of the series.\n\nOverall, I love this game. I don't think it's an easy game to get into but it's clearly a game made with their fans in mind and is completely unapologetic about that. If you ever felt the other Age of Wonders game appealed to you before, chances are you will love this new installment. As a child of the AoW era, I can honestly say this has turned out to be everything I have hoped for for the past 11 years.","April 1, 2014","true","121.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

One of the big changes is the addition of a class system, each wizard chooses one of seven classes, and some of the classes take over the function of some of the old races (Dark Elves, Undead, Archons, Nomads), for example, Rogues build Shadows and Succubi and can do so for any race, and Necromancers can summon or build a lot of the iconic Undead units, as well as ghoul forms of normal racial units.\n\nEach of the seven Wizard Classes contain a variety of unique units and spells and can provide unique upgrades to their armies, each of the nine races has several unique units and a few generic units and can build class units for any class that commands them, in addition wizards can choose from several masteries similar to Spheres of Magic in AoW2 and Shadow Magic, each of which have their own spells and upgrades.\n\nNow with the recent surge of mods, it's also possible to customize your experience beyond what normal options allow, with mods that range from allowing custom wizards to wear any armor with any class, to more custom colors for wizards, to more powerful terraforming spells.\n\nThe game has a slightly greater focus on Hero Units than Shadow Magic did, but that can also be configured in settings if you don't like it. However your wizard doesn't have to sit around in a tower and will gain levels like heroes so it's usually a good idea to take it into fights.\n\nThe Building Selection is mostly just like in AoW 2 with the main focus of the game remaining on exploration and combat. Patches have added buildings based on resources within a city's domain with a variety of effects, such as unlocking special units, or increasing research speeds. A racial governance system has also been added that allows you to select one of two race wide bonuses with each upgrade.\nThe Diplomacy system is improved in many ways over Age of Wonders 2, but compared to games like Civilization 3 it still falls short, it's impossible to threaten and coerce other Wizards, and the AI is usually unwilling to participate in diplomacy unless it fully sets the terms.\n\nThere are a variety of game modes, including Play by Email. It's possible to play single player, and to my understanding local host multiplayer without creating a Triumph account, so it's not DRM, but be advised that in order to access all of the achievements and some multiplayer modes you may need to create an online account for some of the multiplayer. Multiplayer probably isn't the main reason you'd want to buy this anyway, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game enough, it's my all time favorite game,","April 20, 2015","true","203.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","0"

With Eternal Lords thrown into the mix. It just seems even better. This title has a laundry list of features, game modes, and more. Going through all the aspects of the game will take you easily more then a hundred hours to fully assimilate.\nTo break it down, Age of Wonders III is a mixture of Civ meets Masters of Magic. You will bring your spell-flinging champion into the fray against other champion leaders. The empire aspects compliment your hero. This 4X title has more of a focus on individual heroes and tactical combat. Ordering your troops around the map isn't enough in this title. You must command them in battle as well. While the combat is optional, to fully experience this title I would suggest it. Simply put Age of Wonders III: Eternal Lords is an impressive accomplishment. For such a small studio. Graphics, music, and design are all top notch here. The only true complaint one could form is the price. While it can be a bit pricey.

Ill start by saying that I own all the previous AOW games and have played them through many times.\n\nI dont like some of the differences but the game is still cool, and the devs are still working on it.\n\nThe sound tracks from the older versions were better, IMO.   Plus the lack of a customizable playlist that existed in all other AOW games bothered me.\n\nThe change from 8 to 6 units per army...  I cant say I liked that.\nFlying or floating units are no diffrent than any other now.   I understand why they changed it, but they didnt have to.\nThere is a huge gap in the power of the different teirs in 3.  Any lesser units are basically useless later.  In AOW1-2 even a tier 1 unit still had a chance to survive vs a tier 4.  Now? no way.  The power gap is too much.\nThe heroes in 3 are somewhat weaker.  Your armor and resists have a negligible effect.\nThe facing change that happens every time a unit is hit is really dumb.  Your heroes can be attacked from the rear several times because of it, it really makes your heroes feel useless when it happens and enemies always seem to focus on your heroes too.\n\nSeems that some broader game mechanics were reduced in favor of prettier graphics.  Such as the army size.\nCastle and tower walls are just graphics now.  They are pretty useless for slowing down the attackers and several times I felt that playing defence behind a wall was actually detrimental and did little to stop attacking forces.  In this regard I feel like a good defensivive strategy is a moot point.  In 1 and 2, seiging a walled city or tower was pretty difficult, as it should be.  AoW3 just has too may ways for units to circumvent or destroy the walls too easily.  I resorted to using the auto battle instead of torturing myself.\n\nMagic domains in aow 3 are also another moot point.  Your leader should not be able to use any magic outside it like it was in 1-2.  I feel like this magic domain mechanic is anti AOW, which has allways been about wizards and their domains and their armies being powerless outside of them unless the leader was physically present.\n\nIf you never played an AOW game before, then these flaws probably wont be noticable and I recommend it to you.\n\nBut if your like me, the differences and dumbed down mechanics from aow1-2 will make you not like this game as much as the originals and possibly even regret buyng it.  Ive tried playing through the campaigns twice now, and the story is interesting, but the gameplay turns me off and I get tired of it.","March 23, 2015","false","30.9"," 39 of 66 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","39","66","0","0"

I had high hopes for this title, as these types of games seem to be few and far between, especially when it come to the game raising the bar and setting a standard for its genre.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  Lets break it down:\n\nGraphics: 8\nGraphics had lots of detail, varied terrain types and meshes that blended well.\nMusic/Sound Effects/Voice acting 8.5\nHad a great musical score, character acting was top notch, sound effects and environmentals were good too.\n\nControls 8\nControls are actually good.  Small issue with some poorly placed, floating info boxes that interfere with selection choices for hero skills.\n\nGamplay 8\nThis could have been so much higher.\nThe good part is content: 2 campaigns, each with 2 different endings.  I have put about 50 hours into the first campaign finishing off both endings.  With still another campaign left, it seems there is alot of content to keep you immersed.  The game also features a multiplayer/co op multiplay option (and it aint "hotseat").  You can now finally battle it out, with or against your friends, in a 4x game turnbased strategy game.\nThe bad part is there are some issues.  I started the campaign on normal difficulty and after two or three maps I had to change the setting to easy.  On easy settings it got just as difficult and impossible to complete the last 2 maps without dying a couple dozen times and having to reload the game.  Multiplayer also has issue, infrequent game hangs, and the more frequent friend dropped from game issue.  However, the game allows you to continue with an ai friend or save the game and reload and have your friend rejoin.  Nothing gamebreaking, just a minor annoyance.\n\nOverall 8\n\nFinal thoughts\nTriumph Studio was very attentive and  helpful with any issues on launch day.  There are obvious issues that they have noted and promised a quick patch for.  I take it as a good sign if they start pumping out patches before DLC for their game.  There are also gamers who feel the game lacks customization of units or this and that.  I personally feel we have been flooded with sandbox type games, and it has become an expectation that we should be able to create our own game, with the game you give us.  You can create your own custom hero and there is a map maker/editor I have yet to mess with.  With all this to consider, the game doesn't lack, but as any game, can always be improved upon.  Let Triumph get on with the bug fixing, and be patient for the additional content that they promise to work on and deliver.  The game is complete as is and will most likely go down in history as a "classic".","April 6, 2014","true","198.7"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I had a lot of fun with this game but there are a few things you should know before buying it.\n\nThis game excel with its tactical combats and it does it very well.  And the game is developed as a war game and the developers made this game around this concept, and you should accept this game as it is, a war game, where you need to carefully maneuver your units on a battle field behind covers, flanking enemies, exploiting enemy's weakness (elemental, armour, speed etc), and the game does it really well, and the ai is also very well done which employ a variety of tactics and is challenging even on normal.\n\nNow about what this game isn't. It is not a sophisticated empire builder like Civilization. In fact, because the game is so build around the tactical combats, the designers want you to intelligently maneuver your troops tactically, that you simply cannot win by strategic planning alone. There are no super units that you can simply steam roll through your foes. There are no super spells that will wipe out an entire stack of enemy on the tactical map. It is even hard to win by economy alone because even with one city you can produce a quite powerful army, on standard map the resources are so aboundant that you simply cannot starve a city out.\n\nSome people criticize the game because it is not what they expected, a fantasy Civilization game, and you should accept this game as it is, a very well done tactical war game.\n\nI really love the presentation of this game, both the visual arts and music are full of imagination and epic. I did encounter a few freezes although they are relatively rare. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I do.","April 2, 2014","true","231.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I haven't played the previous games in the series, and I'm not the most knowledgeable gamer when it comes to this genre as a whole. I've played a couple of games each in the Civilization and Total War franchises but not much else. In my non-expert view, AoW3 is a pretty good game, and I've had some fun with it.\n\nMost concepts will be familiar to anyone who ever played a similar game. Expand your empire by creating cities, construct buildings to improve things like economy and production, research new technologies, train armies, move them around the world map and then take direct control on the battlefield.\n\nAoW3 has a strong emphasis on combat, in fact every victory condition (at least in the campaign mode) is related to conquering your enemies, Total War style. There's no equivalent of Civ's peaceful victory conditions, however if you can create a diplomatic alliance with another faction, you are allowed to win together.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a complaint, because I like AoW3's battle system. The world map is divided into a hex grid, and each army stack can hold up to 6 units. When you attack, all the units in that hex and the 6 surrounding hexes, will be included in the battle. So the positioning of your armies becomes vital, and with a little tactical planning you can create a numerical advantage before the battle even begins.\n\nThe battlefield is where the game really comes to life for me, because of the fantasy theme. I love RPGs, so I really enjoyed the use of magic spells and supernatural creatures. There's an amazing variety of units in this game. Of course you've got the standard melee, cavalry and archer units, which function pretty much the same whether they are Human, Elf or Dwarf. But then you can have dragons that fly over castle walls, giants that just bash those walls down, unicorns can teleport behind an enemy, succubus can seduce an enemy to fight for you ... and so much more.\n\nYour generals can cast spells to damage or stun the enemy, buff or heal your troops. They can equip loot, better weapons, armour and rings for passive buffs or resistance to elemental damage. They can gain XP and level up where once again, there are dozens of abilities to choose from.\n\nThe enemy AI is easily the best I've seen in this genre. Playing on normal difficulty, I was frequently punished for my mistakes. If I leave a city undefended, the enemy will capture it. I actually learned the importance of flanking the enemy for bonus damage, by watching the AI constantly doing it to me.\n\nThis is also the first strategy game that I've played that has a scripted story. Elves and Humans are at war, you can play as either side, and each chapter takes place on a different map. The story branches half way through based on a decision made by the player, and leads to one of three different endings. Dialogue is a mixture of voiced and text. And I must mention that the music is fantastic.\n\nIt took me 52 hours to complete one side of the campaign. Some of that is because I screwed up the later missions so badly that I had to restart the map and try a different tactic, but still, its long enough to make a full price purchase easily worth it. During all that time I don't recall noticing any bugs (unless you count Goblin Beetle riders ;)).","June 1, 2014","true","106.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omega_K2/recommended/226840/","Omega_K2","K2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Omega_K2/","301 products in account","TL;DR: If you like a fantasy-themed, combat focused, round based X4 go get it. It's a very good game. The Golden Realms and Eternal Lords DLC are highly recommended as well.\n\nWhen I say this a combat focused X4 I mean it - this game is probably focused mostly on the eXpand and eXterminate aspects of the X4 genre. Don't expect any deep dipomacy or city building aspect, it mainly focuses on expanding your empire and overthrowing your enemy. While the addons add additional victory conditions, still the focus is mainly on combat, however it does this very well with an insane amount of depth.\n\nBattles are extremly strategic. Positioning and composition of your units matter a lot. Units can be flanked for extra damage, many units retaliate (fight back in melee) if they are attacked, or they do attacks of oppurnity on enemies that run past them. Ranged attacks deal damage depending on range and line of sight. Many units have active abilities often also reflecting the choice in your class (like dreadnaught class, for example engineers class units can reload other class units like cannons or muskeets that could otherwise only fire every two tactical rounds, all units only available to that class).\n\nThe whole element setup and unit-ability plays a huge role as well. If you defend your city with all archers (which deal physical damage) vs units that have high protection against physical damage, you'll have a hard time if you win at all. Casting spells here might save the day, since they could give your units elemental damage or lower the enemy resistance.\n\nObviously you want to mix up your units so that you a good chance of winning over attackers. When attacking a walled city, you probably want some way to finish off the defeners on the wall, either with spells or possibly with flying units or with units that can climb the walls. Or you choose to simply destroy the walls and then move in. Instead you use units who don't get a penality when shooting up the walls and simply shoot the defenders down. .\n\nCons:\n* AI, while probably the best I've faced in a RBS 4X so far, suffers from the same problem that it can get rather predictable after a while\n* End-game can be boring (usually turns into a steamroll/spam fest)\n* Diplomacy is very basic\n* Town management, while substantially improved with Golden Realms expansion, is rather basic\n\nPros:\n* runs very smooth (on my system)\n* visually fitting for the theme and overall very appealing\n* story and lore is integrated into the game and the classes/units feel very thematic\n* good music\n* game includes character customization for your heros\n* single player campaign while short is pretty good\n* random maps have a decent amount of settings to customize\n* AI is compared to other games very capable and can pose a threat (though of course, for a seasoned player you'll figure AI exploits eventually)\n* modding toolkit/support\n* classes play very differently and have their own flavour\n* races also play somewhat differently and come with their own flavour (and strengths/weaknesses)\n* specalizations allow you to further customize your playstyle\n* spell casting\n\nFantastic:\n* the class/race/specalization combinations make things highly varied (in particular to games like civ)\n* RPG deeply integrated - units can level up, the game contains hero which are fully levelable complete with skills and equipment (which can also be found in encounters on the map as well as crafted in cities)\n* tactical combat - this makes it possible to have very deep and tactical battles that can take a while.

If you want a turn-based high-fantasy strategy game, look no further than AoW.\n\nHowever, I can say without a flinch that if you wanted to truly enjoy Age of Wonders, you should start with the earlier games. As good as this game is, it's nowhere near earlier instalments. No, this is not nostalgia kicking in, I'm actually playing Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic right now, and it has more races, more units (some will tell you AoW 3 has more units, but they'll omit the fact that a decent portion of them are literal copy-pastes).\n\nThe old games stick to a recognized lore, so you literally will not see Angel Goblins (I'm not kidding, they're called "exalted".. the struggle is real), Elvish trolls ("Warbreeds"), and other ridiculous units.\n\nBottom of line, this game is great for what it is, an attempt to revive a highly praised franchise, and although it falls short in many ways, it is still a good game for all it's worth. Fans of AoW will definitely like this entry, while newcomers may shy away from the bizarre setup.\n\nPlus, the developers are really trying to appease everyone, and they're constantly supporting and updating the game. They can literally cash in and make a new game with all the updates and DLC they've done, but they chose to support this already existing game. Triumph is no big studio, so this says a lot.\n\nThank you Triumph, this is a good game.

Anyone who enjoyed the original Age of Wonders installments would be doing themselves a disservice by ignoring this game. Improved combat (balancing, animation, visuals), Improved heroes (fewer objectively correct leveling choices, more interesting abilities), Improved main character (you are actually encouraged to use him as an aggressive unit now), Improved low level units (basic ranged units are actually worth while now, flanking allows low level melee units to maintain some relevance later in the game) and fantastic overland map rich with detail and a fantastic cloth world map ala Elemental/Fallen Enchantress. The fact that Triumph chose to keep hotseat multiplayer in the game means that it will likely have a place on my hard-drive for years to come.\nThe only things that I feel could be added to the game are more races, classes, units and spells...but who doesn't want that in any game thats enjoyable. Well done Triumph, I look forward to see what advancements you have in store for this very solid foundation.","March 31, 2014","true","432.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

If you are looking for complex building or research options, vast diplomacy networks and interactions.. then this is not the game for you. But if you are looking for fantastic, highly tactical turn-based combat in a good fantasy setting then Age of Wonders 3 is going to satisfy your needs. The strategic map has great detail and a real sense of atmosphere (the music certainly helps out a lot in this endeavor), and there are plenty of combat maps that have a beautiful layout. Unfortunately, siege maps lack variation (you will be fighting on these the most) but beyond that this game does conquest incredibly well.\n\nClasses feel distinct and allow you to focus on your own playstyle, maps offer a lot of freedom and with two decent campaigns, scenarios and a good random map generator there is plenty for you to try out.\n\nFully detailed video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKrgCj15sI","April 21, 2014","true","105.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

As i got older I still played it and it became one of my most beloved games. Now while I do have a biased point of view I will tell you this : AOW3 Feels so much like the original is frightening. It seems like Triumph decided to start with the original and flesh out what was good and shave off the bad. I feel that they did a fantastic job making this game exactly what it should be.\n\nThe overall gameplay makes you think that its a CIV knockoff but after playig it for some time I realized that its just similar, nothing more. I like the overall feel of the game and the only complaint I had was that the screen scrolling seemed quite clunky.\n\nI truly think they did a great job making the combat system emulate the original while giving it a unique feel that makes you want more. I'm excited that they kept commander (or leaders) in the game which nearly makes the game a turn based RPG. One of the best additions to this sequel is the ability to create a random map. While random maps are pretty standard now (or should be honestly) it brings a breath of longevity to the game.\n\nIf you enjoy turn based stragety games that are fun and have dynamic combat this is the game for you. I truly think you'll spend hours enjoying this game and exploring or conquering your own world!","March 31, 2014","true","27.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

There's a launcher, but you -DO NOT HAVE TO USE IT.-  Phew, one bullet dodged, sort of.\n\nGet in game, looks nice.  Music is good.  Music...sounds familiar.  Hmmmmmmmm.  Start a campaign.

Most are of great quality but due to the length of some instances (late-game world map micro-managing or lengthy battle sequences with large armies), the themes can seem to reoccur too often too quickly.\n\n- Gameplay (Leader vurnability)\nWhile defeat could come easily in Age of Wonder 1 when your leader died to a stray spell, Age of Wonders II made them too persistant with next turn revives and respawning at any city with a Wizard's Tower. Age of wonders 3 perfects this balance by granting the leader some form of revival but at a decent cost. All in all: Leaders are neither vurnable nor near-unkillable like they were in previous games, striking the perfect balance where all tactics can be considered during play to eliminate your opponent.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- Graphics\nWhile city-scapes during sieges can look amazing and army units are decent enough, there are equal as unpolished or plain bad textures as well. The leaders & heroes are the main offenders here: hair, beards and sometimes armor clipping or looking translucent, clothes or armor clipping through mounts,... Customizing your own leader has been expanded upon graphically, which I can only commend but the sore lack of extensive options makes this but a tiny timewaster rather than anything worthwhile. I confess, this is far more important in an RPG than it is in a TBS, but it looks half-♥♥♥♥♥ nonetheless (example: No skin-tone for Dark Elves whilst the High Elves race is a mixture of both Wood Elves & Dark Elves). Furthermore, while some ingame items equipped to these heroes show up on their avatar and thus offers a nice nod to detail, other items do nothing of the sort. In my opinion, either do all or none of the items lest you create the notion you hadn't the time to bother with them all.\n\nSome flying units have issues as well when fighting over lava or water. If the unit in question has an idle stance where it lands itself until ordered, it gets submerged nearly completely in said lava or water. Creating another idle animation when fighting over water or lava could have provided a solution here, as of now it just gnaws at the player's experience.\n\n\n- Content\nAge of Wonders 1 had 12 playable races, Age of Wonders 2 had 15 playable races (12 in the original, 3 extra in the expansion), Age of Wonders 3 has 6 of these races. Not only a major plunge in what you can play, but all units feel much the same with different skins. Although each races varies slightly from the standard template (Dwarves have 1 extra defense & resistance but cost 10% more gold to recruit, Orcs suffers -1 ranged damage yet gain +1 melee damage, etc...), none feel as diverse as they were in previous games. While some units do have unique abilities (Elf Unicorn Riders pack the Phase-ability, unique to them), their stats are nearly equal apart from their racial modifier! To me, the varied stats seemed to have a far greater impact in previous installments, contributing to each race's unique style. The only units I currently feel that make a unique impact over its peers are the Orc Greatsword and the Elf Gryphon Rider due to enhanced stats or extra abilities.\n\nNext comes the story, spoiler tag inserted:\n\nEven though they try to take the story into a new direction, this game only contains 6 or 7 missions per campaign to explain it. Aside from being utterly uninspired with an ending that just oozes: BUY OUR EXPANSION SINCE THIS RESOLVES NOTHING; all of these missions fall into the same tedious category of: "Build a base from scratch against overwhelming enemy numbers who rarely do anything and sit there until you grind them piece by piece into a pulp." The last and fifth mission of the Elven campaign are notorious for this in my book. Aside from a few skirmishes into your terrain, they'll just wait until you come to besiege them. A few secrets here and there spruce up the lot, but they are far too minor to sit through hours & hours of same old empire building & grinding the foe to a pulp. Since nearly every mission is played with a different leader as well, don't count on transfering your researched spells over into the next scenario like you did in Age of Wonders 2! In my opinion, endless padding. The only plus was that it forced you to play with many of the classes the game has to offer, daring players to test all it has to offer, albeit not that much.\n\n\n- Multiplayer\nAs many posts on the Age of Wonder III tech support website indicates, a tremendous amount of players is having issues even making a connection to other players. I had this same issue until I disabled my McAfee software, the ONLY game I must do this for in order to play it online even when adding said game to the exceptions list. Even though the game forwards ports automaticly in the hopes to get a connection going for the owner, I still feel this is a nuissance that could have been avoided or handled in a better way than just stating "Your router must cause the issue, call your providers to sort it out!".\n\nWhen you're finally able to get this mode to work, the only feasible tactic to win the game under an hour is to rush your opponent to oblivion. I've played multiple team sessions and Free-For-Alls, all ended in either two scenario's. A: as stated before, players rushed eachother with their starting stack and hoped to have randomly received a summoning spell at the start of the game in order to crush their foe, quiting if they lost too many units along the way. B: People played passively for an hour and then quit the game due to a lack of intrest. In short: Play with friends so you can extend the game past the hour mark or fight it out until the bitter end. There is nothing satisfying about games ending abruptly because one felt it didn't go his or her way.\n\nVERDICT:\n\nI wanted this game to be good, I truly wished for this as I am a long-time fan of the series. I adored the previous games but with all the issues & disappointments I've encountered here, I cannot urge others to buy, let alone play it. A few more months to expand the content provided would have made this game a worthy addition but for me in its current state: It falls short.\n\nI've probably missed a few things here & there, but I hope my review helped you decide if this game is worth your time & money.","May 11, 2014","false","80.6"," 37 of 66 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","37","66","0","0"

However the unit diversity, spells, and tactical battles of this game are unmatched.\n\nThe assymetrical balance via combinations of starting race and leader class really makes for truly epic dynamic compared to the copy pasted civilizations featured in other games.  Playing a Dreadnaught (engineer) leader is a whole different ball game from playing a Druid or a Theurgist.  Seeing a battlefield of up to 42 units strewn with one army of cannons, tanks, and musket men standing on a city wall vs an army of shaman and summoned beasts set to a wonderful backdrop of a massive rising city scape really brings the game to life.\n\nWorth every penny.","May 25, 2014","true","145.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Also has little skirmishes whenever you fight something, unlike CIV (You zoom into a little battle, which is entirely identical to DnD but digital). Less focused on economy and city management, more focused on combat, which is perfect for me. If you liked Civ but wanted more combat, buy this.\n\nGraphics are lovely, slightly more optomised than CIV. There are "Heros" which act as leaders, have extra spells and get an inventory in which to store loot (you get loot from raiding tombs, dungeons and ruins. Such as a musket, a staff, armour or a necklace). Theres a leveling system for all units, so fight with them and they increase in potency, which makes a good deal of effect on combat. There are parts of the game that you breese through, and some that you just get wrecked. Unlike Civ, cities dont fight for themselves, you need to put normal units in them, and any sieges against them are fought by them, with a wall being the advantage given to the defenders.\n\nAll in all, its a great game. £30 is a bit steep, so you might want to wait for a sale, anything over 10% off would seem like a decent deal to me.","July 24, 2014","true","63.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I really like that the developers chose the right path, they not only did not move towards contraction but instead they actually introduced lots of new features into the game, which was very risky in the first place, knowing how conservative are fans in such games like AOW, Disciples and HMM. But in reality, compared to Heroes of Might and Magic and especially Disciples, which both went the wrong direction, this game is a masterpiece.\n\nThe new added features make the game different on the one hand, but also more interesting. I do not want to compare this game to Age of Wonders II, which of course is a living classics, but I can tell that this game has set the bar very high. This is obvious when you look at everything - the picture is amazing, it creates an impression of a beautiful fantasy world - very often I stopped the game in order to look at the map, take a look at the river, mountains, forests, and to look at how my pocket kingdom is doing. The music is great, altough I always consider the Age of Wonders II contained the best soundtrack of all times in games, the compositions of Michiel van den Bos are very powerful, and are used when they are actually needed, very often giving an additional inspiration in difficult battles.\n\nI think the best argument which summarizes overall impression of the game is that there is always a wish to let the game go even when the map is already won. This is paradoxical on the one hand, because each map takes very long time to beat, but it was always a part of Age of Wonders gameplay, and compared to the previous games, in my opinion, it feels way faster. There are always so many things to do, do some research, build more buildings, recruit more units, build improvements, and to build new cities... So sometimes I regret that there is no single unified map like it is in Civilization, where you could develop a huge Empire and allow it to stand the test of time - this is perhaps the only bad thing about this game.\n\n\n8.5 / 10","October 27, 2015","true","137.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Sorcerers feel slightly OP. Sorcerers. Holy ♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥ing sorcerers! They start of weak then suddenly BAM! Unstoppable. But I can\'t judge AoW for that. They\'ve always been like that.\n3. Why don\'t assassins have throwing knives? Assassins without throwing knives or shuriken is like waffles without maple syrup.\n\nWhat I love:\n1. The tactics. Having to take into consideration race, class, morale, climate, terrain, and all these factors makes this game pretty damn sweet. I know it\'s not really a new concept, but it\'s a good one.\n2. The world is beautiful.\n3. The characters are beautiful.\n4. I can customise my own heroes.\n5. It saves after every turn, which is great if something goes wrong, like a blackout or a crash.\n\nAll in all I like this game a lot.","May 31","true","101.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

When I play a 4X game, campaign mode in particular, I want to be able to enjoy the setting. I want to build my cities, armies, and empire. This game is just a xenophobic sprint to tier 4 units.\n\nIf you sit back at all the AI will crush you. On normal, the AI has numerous bonuses to everything and starts to send steamroll armies at you while you are still trying to enjoy setting up your empire. If you want to progress then you have to rush as fast as possible, save often, and dump all hero points into defense.\n\nScenario is more of the same from an AI perspective. Diplomacy is pointless and random.

It consists of two parts; strategic world map and turn-based battles. I'll briefly explain each one here. There's a campaign mode which is fun but my favourite part of the game is the random map which you can customize the hell out of. There's an incredible amount of options for you to customize your own skirmish game. You can have a very short one with a small map, with huge amounts of resources and starting with large armies, or you can have a large map with lots of civilizations, slow research times, few starting resources (and few resources on the map) and so forth. You can even customize the terrain if you want to take the time, so there are a lot of options to suit your fancy.\n\nYou'll choose a race (human, orc, goblin, elf, etc.) and a class (warlord, theocrat, dradnought, sorcerer, etc) for your civilization. Each race has specific strengths and weaknesses and each class is very very different. A warlord civilization for example are focused on strong conventional armies, a dreadnought civilizationis focused on industry and powerful siege engines, a sorcerer civilization is magic based and so on. Your starting hero (which is like a leader of your overall civ and can be used as a general in your armies) will determine the class of your civilization, so choosing a warlord hero will make your civilization a warlord civ, but you can recruit other heroes of other classes as the game progresses.\n\nWorld map - this part of the game is very much like Civilization V and is wonderfully simple and easy to learn. You'll begin with a settler (or a city depending on what options you chose to start with) and your settler will set up your first city, you can choose where. Cities produce gold, production and mana resources and you can build city upgrades and recruit units from them. There are resource structures on the map and if they are inside your city's borders then they give bonuses to gold, production, mana or research. Gold is used to build upgrades in your cities, recruit units and has some functions in diplomacy (yes there's diplomacy with independent cities and other civs), production is very simple - if your city is producing 20 production and a barracks takes 100 production to build, you'll build it in 5 turns. Mana is used to cast spells and knowledge works like production except it's used to research new spells/technologies. Your cities also produce population and grow from small villages to huge metropolises. There's happiness and allignment too - if a city is happy they will throw a party in honour of you which nets you some gold, and alignment is good and evil (and neutral) and is affected by things you do on the map, such as attacking independent cities or letting enemies run when they don't want to fight you. The strategic map is also quite beautiful. Think of it as Civilization V with a fantasy, Lord of the Rings-type feel to it.\n\nThe other part of the game is the battle map. You create your armies on the strategic map and when they meet enemies the game loads the battle map. The battle map is turn based and hex based with flanking penalties. You have a variety of units to command, each with very different skills (like necromancers that can raise the dead to fight for you and curse enemies) and your hero can cast spells that he/she has learned. It's all quite easy to learn but takes a bit of time to master.\n\nAs I said I think this game is underrated and it's definitely worth buying if you like 4X type games.","August 3, 2015","true","15.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

It plays like a combination of Might & Magic and Civilization, however it differs significantly from the both of them.\n\nFirst off: do not be fooled, Civilization fans. If you're looking for a fantasy equivalent of Civilization, this isn't going to perfectly scratch that itch. While it does have highly customizable kingdoms (with races and themes to pick from - steampunk elves and druidic dwarves are both possible, for example), the kingdoms themselves serve no purpose except to produce combat units. There is no need to improve tiles, and while civilization happiness is a factor, it's generally not an issue unless enemy empires start using magic to lower happiness within your cities. The biggest thing that hampers it from being 'fantasy Civ' however, is that there is no tech tree and there are no victory conditions other than to defeat your enemies, or attempt to form an Alliance between them.\n\nThat said, if you were the sort of Civilization player who preferred scrapping with barbarian tribes and winning the game through domination of your enemies, this game may actually end up being a better alternative. It plays similarly to Civilization V, but it is entirely a wargame. It provides roaming bands of monsters to fight, and small dungeons to explore with your army and recover magical items to equip your heroes with. The independant cities (this game's version of City-States from Civ V) provide quests which can give magical item rewards, and can even reward you with joining your empire, giving you access to unique units such as fey and giants.\n\nThe game turns into a Might & Magic-esque tactical RPG when in combat, providing a large grid with terrain to utilize for cover and flanking. Might & Magic players should be happy with what is provided here, though they should keep in mind that battlefields are typically much larger than the chessboard-esque M&M battlefields. Army sizes are also typically much smaller, with most engagements having no more than six units on either side. Only city battles can exceed this limit.\n\nI highly recommend this game to M&M fans, fans of tactical RPGs, and fans of Civilization who enjoy the Domination victory condition. However, Civ players who enjoy nonviolent victory conditions should look elsewhere.","April 3, 2014","true","49.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The amount of tactical decisions to be made (terrain, movement, stats, buffs, debuffs, resistances etc.) combined with clever army builing is JUST RIGHT to let this game FLOW. In this regard, AOW3 succeeds where all the other titles (HoMM 4-6, Disciples, Fallen Enchantress) have failed miserably.\n\nCONTRA:\n- The Number 1 Mistake of new Players (and obviously the reason for a lot of bad tempered "reviews") is the misinterpretation of the way the units are represented (HP/DMG-wise).

The Number of 3d-Models in a Unit is JUST A REPRESENTATION of the Hitpoints - where low-tier units have i.e. 5 figures and high-tier units just one model..so: no, once the Orc Shock Trooper slot looses a model (HP) it does not inflict less damage. It's all a matter of interpretation.\nMy real Contra with this is that the devs did not consider the necessity of explaining this is in some sort of tutorial. It's 2014 and the kids are used to playing stupid crap where everything is chewed for them...what a good 4x game does is leaving some room for imagination, only visualizing what is necessary to establish the mood. But it's a sad fact that , in order to sell these concepts to the masses - you have to *educate* them a little bit\n- Diplomacy. Just plain boring. What i'm really missing is an AI that displays total irrational reactions (a goblin druid declaring war on you just because you captured his favoured neutral tavern; an allied dwarven theocrat who is a racist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and breaks the alliance because you have chosen not to migrate the last town you captured to your heroes race...you got the idea.\nWhere everything else in TBS is about numbers and logic - diplomacy should be about lying, cheating, egos and taste - just like real world politics :)\n- The random Map Generator needs serious tweaking. There is some sort of "Mountain Spaming" on large map types with "underground" and even player numbers...very annoying.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nThere is always a lot of work to be done. Some Unit-Stats tweaking here, some AI-Polishing there. Regarding the overall game design, AOW3 does it right. There have been lots of discussions about the typical TBS issues: Balancing the time exposure / gameflow ratio; how to avoid the stack of doom, complexity vs. laid back indulgence. The fundamentals are here, they play very well and boy - do they look good. With some more effort, this will be the best fantasy-themed TBS-Game since the days of MoM...\n","April 24, 2014","true","77.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It consists of two parts; strategic world map and turn-based battles. I'll briefly explain each one here. There's a campaign mode which is fun but my favourite part of the game is the random map which you can customize the hell out of. There's an incredible amount of options for you to customize your own skirmish game. You can have a very short one with a small map, with huge amounts of resources and starting with large armies, or you can have a large map with lots of civilizations, slow research times, few starting resources (and few resources on the map) and so forth. You can even customize the terrain if you want to take the time, so there are a lot of options to suit your fancy.\n\nYou'll choose a race (human, orc, goblin, elf, etc.) and a class (warlord, theocrat, dradnought, sorcerer, etc) for your civilization. Each race has specific strengths and weaknesses and each class is very very different. A warlord civilization for example are focused on strong conventional armies, a dreadnought civilizationis focused on industry and powerful siege engines, a sorcerer civilization is magic based and so on. Your starting hero (which is like a leader of your overall civ and can be used as a general in your armies) will determine the class of your civilization, so choosing a warlord hero will make your civilization a warlord civ, but you can recruit other heroes of other classes as the game progresses.\n\nWorld map - this part of the game is very much like Civilization V and is wonderfully simple and easy to learn. You'll begin with a settler (or a city depending on what options you chose to start with) and your settler will set up your first city, you can choose where. Cities produce gold, production and mana resources and you can build city upgrades and recruit units from them. There are resource structures on the map and if they are inside your city's borders then they give bonuses to gold, production, mana or research. Gold is used to build upgrades in your cities, recruit units and has some functions in diplomacy (yes there's diplomacy with independent cities and other civs), production is very simple - if your city is producing 20 production and a barracks takes 100 production to build, you'll build it in 5 turns. Mana is used to cast spells and knowledge works like production except it's used to research new spells/technologies. Your cities also produce population and grow from small villages to huge metropolises. There's happiness and allignment too - if a city is happy they will throw a party in honour of you which nets you some gold, and alignment is good and evil (and neutral) and is affected by things you do on the map, such as attacking independent cities or letting enemies run when they don't want to fight you. The strategic map is also quite beautiful. Think of it as Civilization V with a fantasy, Lord of the Rings-type feel to it.\n\nThe other part of the game is the battle map. You create your armies on the strategic map and when they meet enemies the game loads the battle map. The battle map is turn based and hex based with flanking penalties. You have a variety of units to command, each with very different skills (like necromancers that can raise the dead to fight for you and curse enemies) and your hero can cast spells that he/she has learned. It's all quite easy to learn but takes a bit of time to master.\n\nAs I said I think this game is underrated and it's definitely worth buying if you like 4X type games.","August 3, 2015","true","15.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

It's a game about combat, and everything, from the UI, to the city building, to diplomacy itself is entirely in service to the engine of war that this game runs on. Cities are built to build and fund more soldiers. Spells and techs are researched to give an edge in battle or allow you to get more soldiers to bring into battle. Heroes are recruited and trained and killed in the name of war. And they will die, because death comes fast.\n\nThe game's selection of Races offer little more than stat changes for your units, granting passives and and a few advantages/disadvantages here and there. Elves have better archers, but are weak to poisons. Goblins have poorer stats, but massive innate poison resist. It's not too important, but definately does shift how you play. As elves, you'll snipe from max range often. As draconians, you won't care much about non-lethal incoming damage.\n\nClasses, namely leader class, determines far more, from your tech tree to your unique units, taking much of what is traditionally race based in other, less warmongering 4x games. Rogues get access to demons, stealth spells, and plenty of tricks to force enemy cities into open revolt. Theocrats tithe for gold like it's going out of style. Dreadnoughts cover massive areas in fiery death with warmachines that outright immune poison and holy damage, but lack counter-attack ability.\n\nCombat is suprisingly quick, due to units being able to destroy eachother in short order. Even levelled heroes are able to be struck down by a few first tier archers focusing fire. As such, mistakes get punished hard.\n\nThe game has great customization for the genre, letting you tailor your tech tree, your character and diplomacy screen appearance, hero growth, and make custom equipment to fit the situation.\n\nIn summary: I wholeheartedly suggest picking this game up if you're like me and your games of GalCiv2 or Civ V regularly decend into "If it moves, kill it.". Age of Wonders 3 simply does warmongering so much better, even if it comes at the cost of alternative victory conditions.","April 11, 2014","true","181.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is really a sad point, because everything is ready in the game to do this, so it is obviously a game design choice. Amateurs of city builder will not find this enough.\n\nActually almost everything is focused around the combat. When enemy units meet, you can choose to resolve automatically or manually.

This is not the big thing, but a nice idea. For the rest of the fight, it is dejà vu, so I will not go in details.

The campaign isn't really all that in my opinion, but I never played this series primarily for the campaign. If you can get 3 or more friends (and half a day) to play with you on a small-medium map, this game is great. If you can get them to play multiple sessions, going on a larger map is better.\n\nThat being said, I can't help but say that while it is only worth getting the game while it is on sale, it IS worth getting eventually. Especially if you can get friends in on it.","April 25","true","183.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Since then, Age of Wonders have been the one game I have played continuously throughout middle school, high school, and college. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the franchise.\n\nOne of the greatest strength of Age of Wonders is its combat. In my opinion, Age of Wonders III is the best of the series in this regard. AowIII introduces new mechanics like flanking which make unit position incredibly important. A smaller army can quickly gain advantage of a stronger army just by utilizing flanking to their best ability.\nOne of strengths of Aow is the wide variety of units. AoWIII continues this trend. Abilities include dominate, seduce, faerie fire, hurl fire bomb, web, assassinate, hurl boulder, phase (teleport), and much more. These abilities make combat a very engaging and enjoyable.\n\nAoWIII introduces a new class system. These classes include the dreadnought, archdruid, rogue, sorcerer, theocrat, and warlord. Each class as their own set of combat spells, empire upgrades, and units, giving all classes a unique playstyle. As of this review, Triumph is working on a necromancer class. More information on the classes can be found on at http://ageofwonders.com/category/news/.\n\nLike previous games, AoWIII has a variety of races that the player can choose from. The original AowIII has elves, goblins, orcs, humans, dwarves, draconians. Halflings were added in the Golden Realms Expansion. Each race gets an irregular, an archer, an infantry, a cavalry, a pikeman, priest unit, and special final unit. Upon first glance, the races appear to be quite similar. However, there are subtle differences that can end up really impacting one strategy. As an example , consider the archer unit. Elf archers suffer no range penalty, allowing them to do full damage even at distance. Draconian archers laugh firebombs which damage all units in small area. Goblin archers shoot homing mosquitoes which can go through obstacle. Dwarf archers have crossbows which do better damage when they are at close range. Orcs have the worst archers with the worst range; however, they can cause units to bleed which does damage overtime. As one can see, there is a clear difference in the unit abilities.\n\nAlong with their class and race, players also choose specializations. These specializations revolve around elemental magic. Player can choose between air, fire, water, earth, creation, and destruction. Each specialization has global and combat spells as well as enchantment and summons. In the original game, there are two non-magic specializations-explorer and expander. These specializations add another level of strategy. When one considers all the race, class, and specializations, there is an astounding number of combinations and strategies to use to destroy one enemies.\n\nIn my opinion, AoWIII is the best in the series. It’s one of my favorite games. On a final note, the devs are really involved in the community. They really listen to players and incorporate suggestions in the gameplay. Triumph Studios is an amazing studio. They have put a lot of work into this game and continue to do so.\n","November 4, 2014","true","457.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

All of these options affect how you will play the game. Will you become a Dwarf Arch Druid and heal the land around your empire to reap the awards of a bountiful Harvest? Or will you become a Dragonkin Mage and call down fire and plague and destroy your rival's lands? These spells and skills also affect the combat in the game. Your heroes will have one time spells to use to decimate a particulary powerful creature or even call up a large random creature, which turns out to be a poisonous death adder.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearsmith/recommended/226840/","bearsmith","Frank The Dragoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bearsmith/","241 products in account","A fun, somewhat, competent 4x game that puts a large focus on warfare, Age of Wonders 3 is a great game if you don't look too closely at the seams. In my time playing there are a few concerns that have grown over time and kept this game from being great.\n\nAmong these is the enormous focus on warfare. In short, if you are not building towards better units you are doing the wrong thing. Powerful units are paramount for combat of course, but on top of that, there really isn't any other option. Religion? Non-existent. Economy? There are two or three buildings, tops, that will generate any sort of capital. In fact, this makes city placement one of the most important parts of the game; as they dictate what materials you can get at the city.\n\nThis brings me nicely to the second problem with the game; enemy AI. The AI in this game is hilarious. They will jump eagerly off their walls during sieges. They will run tword your town only to see that it is a bit large and then do circuits, a bit confused at what they are to do. You will repeatedly see your teammate lose battles because, for some reason, they decided to send a single hero into a group of tier three monsters. Finally, they will neglect to clear monsters from the resource nodes around their cities for literally dozens of turns thereby starving themselves of resources.\n\nAnd that is what really kills the game for me. I build up a great army (because I have too) to fight opponents too stupid to even keep their resources clear to fund an army that will literally jump from their own battlements.\n\nAll of that said, this isn't a terrible game. There is a good sense of involvement in combat, and a great deal of strategy especially due to the flanking system that is missing from other games such as FELH. Those who are expecting a full fledged 4x experience would probably be served better elsewhere, but if you are a fan of tabletop battle games then Age of Wonders Three is a very fun combat simulator for a fraction of the cost. Hopefully the upcoming patch fixes a lot of the issues so that I can change the more negative aspects of this review, but as the game stands it is a 7/10 for me. Buy it only if you are not expecting a "pure" 4x experience.\n\nEDIT UPDATE 1.09:\n\nUpdate 1.09 has hit and there have been a lot of quality of life enhancements. Enemy AI has improved dramatically in regards to walls, and sieges in general, and I have noticed my allies actively clearing nodes beyond just the first time they settle an area. It still doesn't happen as frequently as I feel it should, but that may be because I am playing on "Lord" difficulty (sort of mid tier) for the random matches.\n\nI have, however, noticed more problems that escaped me on the outset, especially in regards to diplomacy and how NPCs decide how much they like you. One of my biggest gripes at this point is that if an enemy dislikes you it is nearly impossible to have them change their opinion. This is agravated by the fact that declaring war on anything, including independent units, is looked upon very poorly by the AI. For example, I gifted an NPC money every turn for nearly twenty turns and they still were "distrustful" of me since I claimed an independent city. Furthermore, NPCs that like you think you are a god beyond reproach. I purchased half of my allies cities for a pittance (literally not even a turns worth of mana) and there wasn't even a change to his diplomatic value. Another thing to note is if you are allies and at peace with an NPC if you wish to attack them you will have to wait two full turns before being able to actually attack. This makes it so that alliances are very difficult to break, and prevents any sort of subterfuge which I find disappointing. That is definitely more of a personal issue, but it feels a bit out of place in such a war based game and prevents surprise invasions. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a carry over from the multiplayer.\n\nAnother issue I have is that certain classes and races seem to have serious advantages; specifically the druids and elves. The druid tier 4 summon has an ability called thunderstrike that can be used across the field, has a chance to stun, is an AoE, and is on a three turn cooldown. Combine this with the elf passive of not suffering the ranged damage penalty and you have a very dominate long range army even when made of low tier units. In comparison, the theocrat class seems to be very underpowered; mostly due to a more melee and passive overworld bonus focus. It just seems like a poor fit since the overworld is so disappointing overall and the siege focus late game. I would expect major changes in DLC for how this class functions.\n\nMy previous positive statements about this game still stand though and due to the better siege mechanics I will now give the game an 8/10. Sieges are now very engaging, and stressful, affairs where you will have to carefully time when and where you are going to hit the enemies defenses rather than taking pot-shots at suicidal archers. Again, this is not a game to purchase if you want to have a good overworld experience; it simply cant deliver that at this point in its life.","April 9, 2014","true","41.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The series has been my favorite when it comes to strategy games. I was extremely excited when Triumph Studios announced the third installment of the series. I have watched the status of AOW III develop from the initial announcement up until release.\n\nSo, here is my review based on 10 ours of in-game experience. I am extremely impressed with the AI. It is a much greater improvement over the original games. The AI is really taking me for run! I never had much challenge with the AI in the previous games. I like the detailed terrain and atmosphere of the maps/world. The tactical combats are sweet and prettier than the previous games. Also, the tactical AI is much smarter as well. In AOW II SM, I would lure enemies out of the gate in a siege and slaughter them... it doesn't work like that anymore. :D The AI is tough and smarter. The soundtrack is AWESOME! I wish I would have got the deluxe edition just for the soundtrack. I'll have to wait until they release it as DLC. I love how the knights look in AOW III. Their armor shines as they sit on their steeds with their lances; it brings a nice heroic personality. During the 10 hours of in-game experiences I have really enjoyed game. It is fun, exciting, and challenging. I rate it a 9/10 in my opinion.\n\nHere are some of the things I would suggest to improve AOW III. Angels... I really miss the angels from AOW II. Beautiful females, powerful, and celestial beings. They were my favorite unit, and I love how they could only be summoned. AOW III has angelic-like beings called the exalted. However, they just don't fit in the game as the female angels would. Another thing reflecting back upon the angels is that you can also get goblin angels, human angels, dwarf angels, etc... This is due to the new class system in AOW III. Angels, succubus, etc need to be unique, and preferably summoned instead of being standard recruitable creatures. I am hoping Triumph will bring back the angels from AOW II as summons. :) Another thing I would suggest is to bring back the old method of handling flying creatures. In AOW II you needed magic, another flying unit, ranged units, or for the flying unit to attack you in order to deal damage to a flying unit. Based on what I have seen all creatures whether flying or not can hit a flying unit. Lastly, I do prefer the 2d art for heroes and leaders as compared to the 3d stuff (lowest priority).\n\nIn conclusion, Age of Wonders III is a solid game that will bring an exciting and challenging experience. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to support Triumph Studio on further development of Age of Wonders III! 9/10!","April 4, 2014","true","36.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Level up your Heroes, send them afar to expand your domains and rule the land with the iron grip and brute force of the Orcs! Or dwell in the underground and patiently multiply your Goblins waiting to erupt to the surface and destroy the land of men!\nCleanse the earth and bring peace in all the Empire as the Leader of High Elves or forge incredible machines that will shake the ground beneath their wheels and crush your enemies as a Dwarven Dreadnought!\nSeriously... never had had this fun in a long time!!\nHighly recommended!","November 9, 2015","true","212.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You can customize your own avatar and the choice of talents, class and race have significant impact to how your game will play out, allowing to pick a combination most suited to your playstyle. Or just experiment if that's your thing.\n\nAs mentioned, the empire management aspects are lacking compared to the competition. Tech tree gets exhausted pretty quickly and it's pretty easy to win by overpowering the AI in early game. On the other hand this kind of setup allows for faster and more 'action' oriented multiplayer matches. However the AI is notoriously bad in terms of diplomacy and still has some bugs that make it easy to beat even on higher difficulties. Add to that an incomplete diplomatic system and the only real option to win the game outside of scripted scenarios is full on military conquest.\n\nThe best part however is the combat system. Units are carefully balanced and the combat system allows to win through superior tactics against much more powerful armies... if you know what you're doing. Finding out the various tactics to take down particularly tough units is half the fun. Defending a city surrounded assaulted by a superior foe is suitably satisfying, as is taking out defenders through tactical use of the right units.\n\nOveral: Age of Wonders 3 is a Heroes of Might and Magic meets Civilization in a Tolkien-ish inspired setting. Don't get it for the empire management or you'll be disappointed. Get it for the combat and magic system and it's loads of fun.","June 16, 2014","true","292.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You can customize your own avatar and the choice of talents, class and race have significant impact to how your game will play out, allowing to pick a combination most suited to your playstyle. Or just experiment if that's your thing.\n\nAs mentioned, the empire management aspects are lacking compared to the competition. Tech tree gets exhausted pretty quickly and it's pretty easy to win by overpowering the AI in early game. On the other hand this kind of setup allows for faster and more 'action' oriented multiplayer matches. However the AI is notoriously bad in terms of diplomacy and still has some bugs that make it easy to beat even on higher difficulties. Add to that an incomplete diplomatic system and the only real option to win the game outside of scripted scenarios is full on military conquest.\n\nThe best part however is the combat system. Units are carefully balanced and the combat system allows to win through superior tactics against much more powerful armies... if you know what you're doing. Finding out the various tactics to take down particularly tough units is half the fun. Defending a city surrounded assaulted by a superior foe is suitably satisfying, as is taking out defenders through tactical use of the right units.\n\nOveral: Age of Wonders 3 is a Heroes of Might and Magic meets Civilization in a Tolkien-ish inspired setting. Don't get it for the empire management or you'll be disappointed. Get it for the combat and magic system and it's loads of fun.","June 16, 2014","true","292.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I really like the class system and the classes do play very differently. Magical spheres are still around though they are more of a complement to the class spells and abilities now. Race has a lot less impact than class admittedly, but there are enough differences between the races that the choice matters.  That aside, the tactical combat is very good and has some interesting additions compared to the old games.\n\nThe game is in need of some patching, and could definetly use some expansions/DLC with more of the old races (Tigrans naturally) being added. One of my main annoyances however is that the unit design is fairly lazy, at least for the class units. Most theocrat and warlord units for instance are bald for all races, they could have had some variation there.

Whether youre a fan of the old series, as i am, or a newcomer who enjoys 4X games, Age of Wonders III will keep you persistently hungry for "one more turn". I have not played the campaign much (i never do in these games) but the skirmish/random map mode is exactly what i want out of games like this.\n\nExploration is very rewarding in AOW3, as each randomly generated world feels rich and large. Whatever method, pattern, or logic it is that the world generator uses, it does its job; mountains, forests, and rivers all fit very naturally together, have plenty of variety with sensibly placed climates/regions, and just look wonderful. The resources are spaced and balanced really well, and there are tons of dungeons and rare encounters to discover and conquer. I always get absorbed in roaming the world, every time.\n\nHero creation is fun. The classes are mostly what you are used to (warriors, wizards, priests, etc), but there are many combinations of race/class/specializations available whos impacts on the game are felt gradually over the course of your campaign, and every change can have a major impact on how you play, so it is easy to get excited about trying out each one. Personally, i spend almost as much time creating heroes and imagining up personalities for them as i do actually playing the game (LOL), and the fact that i can make them, not only for myself, but for the NPCs as well really gets me into the game alot more than i would be otherwise.\n\nThere are plenty of spells, including hidden ones, plenty of items and equipment, including some you make yourself, and plenty of monsters, most of which you can learn to either capture or acquire for your own armies. Some units have unique abilities when certain classes and races combine to produce them, and each hero can be customized with RPG-style level-upgrades and equipment. There are also rare units which can only be discovered through exploration, or by conquering/befreinding key locations, so even play throughs with the same customized faction will vary and feel different.\n\nThe tactical combat is better than i have seen in a 4X game in a long time. Many different unit roles exist, with a variety of strengths and positions which counter them, and each has advantages at different times. Combined with heroes and spells, there are many things to think about in battle, and many strategies to win with. The sheer number of unit abilities in this game is impressive in its own right, but once you begin to realize that every single one of them counters, and is countered by, something else, things move to a whole new level. The action-point and flanking systems ensure that you cannot simply hire a few beefy units and chop your way through hordes of enemies... there is a limit to how much one badass can do in a turn, and you WILL be outmaneuvered and killed by cheap little weaklings if you do not position your units correctly.\n\nIf i had to complain about something in this game, i could only think of two things to mention. Firstly, the diplomacy mechanics are ♥♥♥♥. To be fair, they usually are in 4X games; diplomacy rarely ever gets implimented well into games which are mostly designed around combat but, in this case, it feels especially worthless. Most NPCs will decide whether or not they are at war with you before you even open the diplomacy screen, and once it has been decided there is really nothing you can do to change things. There isnt much you can trade, and NPCs will typically never accept a trade anyway, so this much of the game may as well be removed.\n\nAnd Secondly, the difficulty of the game is spasmatic at best. One game, you may walk over everyone else as though they werent even there, and the next you may be clinging to life every turn; there seems to be no consistency even within the same difficulty levels of this game. I have had several matches where i have spent hours exploring the world only to find one of the enemy factions tucked away in a corner of the map repeatedly failing to extablish a second city for some reason or another, and i have also had matches where all of my cities were under constant siege by max level units before i had even located an enemy. It is wildly inconsistent and, if you do not limit the number of heroes a faction may have, AI factions will hire as many as they can afford to the exclusion of everything else.\n\nBut, the game is amazing and has only been getting better with each patch. As far as i am concerned, there is no better 4X available right now, and it is worth the full price of 40 dollars. If you catch this thing on sale, you would be a fool to pass it up.","May 28, 2014","true","095.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The strategic and tactical parts of the game complement each other greatly.\n\nThis game is focused on strategy and combat. Everything relates to that, from empire building to leveling your heroes. But don't be afraid, it may be a lot of combat all the time, but the combat is deep enough to be different every time. The game's classes offer you many distinct flavours on how you run your empire, on what kind of army you build, on how your strategies play out. Some classes are more mobile, some classes are better at annoying others, some classes are better at simply building up. The difference does not lie in whether they have units to wage war with, the difference lies in how strong those units are, how they reinforce your armies, how your spells reinforce your armies and wether the class is better at direct battles or sneaking past the front lines.\n\nA bit about empire building: this game is not civilization. The way you develop your cities is not based on what research you unlock and there are NOT a hundred different buildings to choose from. Instead, your building decisions are based on what units you want to unlock, what resources you need more of and how many units you need right NOW. At first, empire building will seem simple compared to other 4x games, but it ties in very well with the other parts of the game.\n\nDislaimer: I am a total fanboy. I've been part of closed beta testing and met the developers.\nWarning: This game has ruined tactical role playing games for me. It has ruined other strategy game tactical combat for me. I find those boring just because I'm used to AoWIII.","April 18, 2015","true","459.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Much of the game is great - the grpahics, interface, music and basic gameplay elements. You certainly won't lack for gameplay, the two campaigns took me well over 100 hours to finish, although I never use auto combat so battles made up most of that time.\n\nThe hate part comes from the lack of documenation and a few really terrible scenarios in the campaigns. All games should have a manual, especially games this complex, but there is no manual.\n\nThree of twelve scenarios in the campaigns are awful, some of the worst scenario designs I have encountered in decades of playing strategy games, the rest of the scenarios are lots of fun. One is horrible because it has a hidden timer. The other two, the last scenarios in each campaign are horrible because they are mind numbingly frustrating. You have far too many enemies to fight, your basic task is to fight two leaders and attack them with a particular hero. Finding the two leaders is a slow, boring process. It's an idiotic idea which pretty much ruined both campaigns for me. If you are lucky you won't have to play these scenarios, it depends on choices you make earlier in the campaigns.\n\nI do recommend this game if you are willing to put up with some frustration.","April 13, 2015","true","261.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CRIXTREME/recommended/226840/","CRIXTREME","С Г エ χ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CRIXTREME/","320 products in account","I'm going to start off this review with a couple of things:\n\nI've never played AoW 1 or 2\nAnd I'm going to compare it to HoMM3\n\n\n\nAoWIII is sorta a fantasy 4X game with very similiar gameplay to the heroes of might and magic series. You have a hero, town(s), and go around raising troops, casting spells, leveling up, exploring the map, and eventually conquering your enemy.\n\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, it's easy to tell what sort of terrain is what, units are stylistic, and overall the graphics suit the game well.  The music got boring real quick, normally with this kind of game you eventually turn off the music, but I had it off within a few days.\n\nA couple of big differences between this and HoMM are how units are handled. Gone are stacks of 5500 power liches, instead each 'stack' of units on the map can go up to 6 SEPERATE units. This means that a squad of swordsmen is treated as a single unit, and functions the same at 1 HP as it would full. I'm not sure if this good or bad, but that's just how it is.  While you might say battles would be smaller, they can actually be significantly bigger than HoMM, as you can have adjcent stacks on the map help you attack an enemy stack(s).\n\nBattles are also very different (yet) similiar compared to HoMM.  Like HoMM you can cast a spell a turn by your main hero, all your units move in a hex and have different ways to attack and special effects. However, in AoW it's more more tactical, there are flanking attacks that can potentially deny counter attacks and attacks of opportunity against the enemy if they try moving through an enemies' zone of control.\n\nAnother big difference between HoMM and AoW is towns. In HoMM towns are usually rare and extremely important objectives for either side, in AoW, you pretty much are able to build towns almost anywhere.  This is an interesting mechanic, but ultimately I found it very boring.  It isn't very difficult to  figure out where to place towns, and as the game goes on I felt I was wasting a lot of time picking what buildings to build in each of my cities, it isn't like civilization either where picking what to build can be a very strategic thing with upsides and downsides (upkeep).\n\nCompared to HoMM, the different races feel overall are way too similiar. Aside from minor stat differences and sometimes damage type differences each race will only have a couple of units that actually stand out from others.\n\nThe point fo the above is to try and place an emphasis on hero types. At the start of the map you will select/customize a hero.  You'll choice from a choice of 6 different jobs and select 3 extra magic types.  The job has the biggest effect on how you will play the game. Each one gives you access to the majority of the spells/special units that you will recruit.  This is a very interesting mechanic, however I found it to be somewhat boring in practice.\n\nFor example, playing as an archdruid will give you access to Hunters, they're basically bowmen that can charm animals, are better at crossing difficult terrain, and they wear very decorative large masks adorned with feathers.\n\nWhile playing as a draconian, they fit in perfectly with the rest of the army. However, this is how they look for ALL the races.\nNot only that but, they're almost identical no matter what race you have. Why can't goblin hunters focus on traps? Human hunters can be mounted or have tracking dogs with them?  It's even worse when you select a warlord, as two of their special units are bersekers and warkin (basically ogryn from 40k). All bersekers are bald. Even high elves. And they look absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIf they couldn't differentiate the units in abilities due to balancing issues, at least they could make the units thematically look like they belong to the faction, something HoMM did very well.\n\nAnother minor problem I have with the game is there isn't a quick access for your different heroes you might have hired, you have to bring up the overview panel then switch to your armies. This wouldn't be a problem, except for that you can't have the overview panel up at the same time as your city build orders, which is a problem, because over the course of the game you'll have both a large amount of cities and units.\n\nAdditionally, the neutral units available for fighting and recruiting/prizes feel very small, it might just be because I played HoMMIII with WoG and that offered quite a good selection. Another thing HoMM had that AoW lacks are interesting items to loot for your hero or neutral unit hexes that let you hire them. While there are a couple of special town types like dragon they function a little differently\n\n\n\nI really want to like this game. Its combat is fun, and has some really great mechanics dragged down by citiy micomanagement, race diversity, and some lazy copy\pasting unit designs\n\nEdit:\n\nSince there's been two expansions for this game, they've been absolutely great. They did a pretty good job at giving each race more unique abilities, and added more neutral units and items. I don't like necromancers though, the mechanics they have seem so gamechanging compared to the other hero classes.","June 19, 2014","true","227.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","4"

But truth be told, the actuall combat mechanics and AI leaves much to be desired. The different races all play the same, with mostly the same units to choose from, and it doesnt help that you can absorb any race into your empire and as such actaully play all races in one single game.\n\nThe different classes have some different spells and units to choose from, but spells in general are a bit of a letdown. You generally use the same two spells over and over again since there is no point in using anything else. Same with units, some units are way OP and when the enemy only build these units there is no point in creating diverse armies for the fun of it. Units dont have many special abilities, and the lower tiers become obsolete quickly.\n\nOne cool thing is that you can absorb the "special" NPC races such as dragons, giants and undead into your empire if you take one of their towns.\n\nOn a strategic note, you need to learn how to use your units to their full extent, and pay atention to flanking since this plays a major role in combat. Unfortenetly units with lots of HP generally have high dmg aswell, so using week dps units are just not an option in the long run, bigger is always better in this game.\n\nVerdict: Has some good ideas, and the game looks good. But after playing one custom map against the computer, you have basiclly experienced all there is to it.

This is 10/10 right there.","March 31, 2014","true","58.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I'm going to hit on the negatives first so that at least I can end on a positive note.\n\nNegatives:\n\nThere is basically no strategic depth. There is absolutely no reason not to use the highest tier units as soon as possible, none of the units really fill a unique role, and in the end there's really just no point in building lower-tier units if higher tiers are available. The strategy boils down to "who can get high-tier units produced the fastest". The Total War series is an example where this was usually done fairly well, though admittedly not anywhere near perfect.\n\nThe classes aren't very well balanced: Sorcerers are incredibly powerful, since they can summon tier 4 units wherever they are and it costs no gold to do so. It allows them to effectively push forward and defend anywhere at any time. On the opposite end of the spectrum are Theocrats, who have basically nothing worth using in their own trees and must rely entirely on specializations.\n\nThe specializations aren't very diverse: The elemental ones are all almost exactly parallel with each other (not in relative power, but in the fact that the powers are all the same with reskins and a number or two tweaked), the destruction and creation specializations don't do anything meaningful, and the explorer specialization is entirely useless. Honestly I think I'd've scrapped this entirely. It feels bolted-on. You can completely ignore your specialization and it'll have no effect on your gameplay most of the time.\n\nThe races all feel exactly the same. I don't know if there are differences outside small hit point variances in the units or not, but if there are any they're very minor. For an example of this done better, see Heroes of Might & Magic (2, 3, or 5, if you want a specific one, basically any but 6 because that game is sadness in game form.)\n\nThe research tree is an absolute mess: it requires rote memorization to figure out what research leads where. In some cases it's fairly obvious, in others it seems random if you haven't sunk a significant amount of time into the game. This is a really common problem in strategy and tactical games. Sins of a Solar Empire had this done fairly well, as did XCOM's newest incarnations (in different ways, obviously).\n\nTactically there are a few options, but the tactical combat is incredibly and painfully repetitive. The A.I. has been improved some, but still isn't especially good. In truth I don't have a great answer for a game where this was done exceptionally well. In RTS games it usually isn't a problem, since the computer is just made more aggressive with more resources. Turn based games are a tougher nut to crack, though. Shogun 2 was one with a reasonably good A.I., but certainly not an excellent one.\n\nMultiplayer games with simultaneous turns are abysmally un-fun. Simultaneous turns in general don't work, with some units freezing in place when attacked by an enemy (when you would normally move away before the enemy could get in close), and generally team-turns would work much better than the way simultaneous turns work now.\n\nNow for the good stuff:\n\nEach of the classes does play in a unique way. The specializations may not make much difference, but the classes are incredibly varied and have a good blend of niche and flexible abilities.\n\nThe game looks remarkably good for the most part. It's not graphically brilliant, but the art design was well put together, you have a lot of options for how your main hero will look and nothing looks cheap.\n\nWhile it's a bit of a mixed bag, the spellcasting/ability use in general is generally entertaining and can have a fairly significant effect on the tides of battle.\n\nThe UI is mostly intuitive, though it too has a few areas that would benefit from clearer labelling.\n\nThat's what I've got. Hope it helps!","September 20, 2014","false","58.5"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

On paper, it sounds great; but in reality it isnt massively interesting.  The variety in gameplay comes through the tech trees in both what your cities are producing and on the special abilities that you can impose on your empire. But both trees are relatively short and you can reach the end of both a long way before you end a game. Like a lot of empire building games, the more cities you build, the more tedious it becomes. Sadly, the combat is also repetitive - the same maps with the same enemies in the same positions. It takes a short while to get used to, but once you do, you will be applying the same tactics over and over again.\n\nIn short, there isnt much to recommend the game. Its not terribly programmed, but there just isnt enough depth to keep you interested.","January 6, 2015","false","152.4"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","21","39","4","0"

As such, it has more in common with Master of Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic III than with Civilizations 5.\n\nThe base game provides two different and quite long campaigns featuring branching paths and different endings, a few pre-generated scenarios, and a random map generator with a lot of map and game options to customize your games to your liking.\nMultiplayer is present and alive with the possibility to play with people who own the GOG version, meaning the community is not divided.\n\nYou start a game by customizing your leader by choosing his race and class between 6 different races and 6 different races, amounting to 36 different initial combinations, with each race and class having distinct spells and characteristic, providing them different optimal gameplay while still being homogeneous enough to keep things balanced. To further specialize your leader, you can also chose between 8 specialization options, such as Water adept, Fire adept, Explorer, etc.\n\nThe game is extremely fun to play and the combat system is excellent in both concept and execution. Add to that different units and spells interacting together dynamics and you get really epic battles that never feel like they are dragging on.\n\nGolden Realms Expansion:\nThe first expansion pack adds one new race, two new specializations, a new campaign, new scenarios, new units, new spells, new mechanics, and new map options, turning the game from great to amazing.\n\nHighly recommended!!!","September 23, 2014","true","170.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The problem is, the game lacks... ambition. The combat is really all there is to the game and while its fulfilling early on, it tends to drag on late game. You'll spend hours clearing the resource points of monsters and enemy camps to build a safe and sprawling empire only to realize that your empire is just to feed your warmachine, nothing else. At which its very easy to proclaim yourself the winner because what reward is there to finishing a solo game?\n\nWhich leads to the other problem, multiplayer. 4x strategy games are really meant for multiplayer matches. Its a wonderful race to see who can build what faster, stronger, and diplomatic better. However AoW 3 doesn't lend itself well to MP games because of time and lack of any real substantial diplomacy.\n-time, essentially you either sacrifice time to enjoy the game and its combat the way its meant to be played, or you turn the quick autobattles on and skip over the big tactical portion of the game. Its a lose lose either way.\n-Diplomacy is lacking because there is no real benefit to peace other than a secure border but, who's to say your peaceful neighbor won't just backstab you? As there is no consequence for breaking your word, no morale penalties, no reduced gold income or productivity, nothing. The flip side is also true, no economical advantages to being at peace :(\n\nDespite all that its still a good game and I enjoyed very much of it, its just sad to see so much potential fizzle out.\n\n+Graphics, a very rich, visually appealing game\n\n+Tactical combat is very satisfying\n\n+-Replay value is there, but late game becomes tedious management and busy work...

So coming into this as a fan of AoW2, my expectations were high, and I honestly wasn't disappointed. I love this game for so many reasons, from leader creation and customization to the way your race tints the special units your class affords you. The game is visually beautiful and fairly well-paced, and the random map generator has always delivered a world I genuinely enjoyed exploring and conquering.\n\nAoW3 suits a number of play styles and victory conditions, all of which you can toggle on or off. The battles require thought and planning a little more than raw power. A number of weak units can take down a smaller number of more powerful units if you position everyone correctly and use just the right spells at the right times. I get a genuine sense of pride every time I successfully bring down a powerful enemy army.\n\nThere are, of course, a few things that could stand to be improved. I'd like more customization options as far as hair is concerned, and there are some lighting issues and minor clipping problems on some of the unit models.

This is easily the most played game in my Steam library. (Skyrim comes in at 2nd, with about 275 hours as of this review.  And whatever is in 3rd place is so far back, it can't even see the dust from these two.)  I find this funny, since I almost passed on buying AoW3.\n\nThis is a deep game, which took me about 60 hours just to feel like I was getting the feel of all the possibilities.\n\nThe intro campaign got a bit tedious by about the 4th chapter, so I jumped into random maps.  Very enjoyable!  Just about anything you can think of is customizable, including your leader's race, specialty, and appearance; to map type, size and features (the map can be dangerous and rewarding... at the same time); to number of heros allowed and their max levels...  Oh yes, and the number, skill and specialties of your A.I. opponents are individually tweakable.  Basically, after you haved played a bit, each random map is a game you can fully and intelligently customize to optimize the challenge and maximize your own enjoyment.\n\nThe strategy level is turn-based or semi-real time (selectable) and the combat is turn-based.  Decisions you make at the strategy/map level greatly influence numbers and capabilities of troops you field.  The tactical combat is deep.  With the right skills and knowledge, you can defeat far superior opponents (or vice versa: you can get your fanny kicked by an inferior opponent).  Your opponents are scalable in toughness, and total defeat is definitely an option.  Making the right decisions at both the strategic and tactical levels makes for very satisfying play.\n\nA lot of attention was given to the audio and visual experience.  The map and game pieces are beautiful.  Every troop has its own unque sounds and animations for different actions, including combat.  There is a bit of an RPG element --> Heros and leaders get stronger if you cultivate them, have many different capabilities, based on class, and really can make a big difference in battle outcomes.\n\nDue to the fact that I think the tutorial campaign could have been a little more "teachy" AND interesting, I lower my ranking a bit below perfect, and give this game a rating of 9 out of 10.","August 27, 2015","true","342.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Me and my friend did a very large map(largest you can get) in a two vs two. We won, but it took us at least 20+ hours to finish it.\n\nYou found a city, build an army explore some dungeon areas to get some gear for heroes. Build bigger armies and vanquish your opponents. I would recommend getting the DLC even though it is pricey. It makes it more fun to spice up the game with more classes and races to play as.\n","July 3, 2015","true","152.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some of those features are clearly not in Civilization V.\n\nFor me the better game series to compare to comes from the Real Time Strategy games known as Warcraft (Age of Wonders III) and Starcraft (as opposed to Civ V). If you ever played Warcraft III you might remember the times of having a Hero unit that could (and often did) become more powerful than most other units of your army, sometimes more powerful than a small handful of units on their own.\n\nAge of Wonders III uses a Hero system in a similar concept as Turn Based Strategy game. Your heroes level up, earn abilities. You can quest, battle, or even forge your own gear (non-campaign on the forging bits) for your heroes to use in combat. Heroes can die, and when they die they drop all the items they had on them. But you do not have to say goodbye to them forever because there are ways in game to revive them, powerful revival magic (instead of hero shrines from Warcraft 3).\n\nTLDR: Ultimately, if you play the game for a single player experience you will find enjoyment in the campaigns, and for a time in the solo scenarios, random maps, and various play styles. However, combat will quickly become tedious and repetative. Against the A.I. I recommend using Auto-Battle most the time, but the true glory of the Manual Battles is when you can fight against a Human Opponent using either Online, LAN, or Hotseat as a multi-player turn based game.\n\nQuick Notes:\n\n- I recommend Turn Based with a 3 minute turn timer for small groups.\n(turn timer incase people forget to hit end turn)\n\n- There is the option to use Simultaneous turns\n(but it can feel choppy, and it can lead to logisitic problems for battle prep on the strategic map)","January 6","true","109.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, perhaps my main misgivings are just nastalgia but I find empathizing with the leaders rather meh. Early Release there were a lot of balance issues. Yet I recently got back into this game and I find it even more fun and invigorating than before. My wife has filed for a restraining order against my computer.... Looking for a gaming shack greater than 100m from my current address :)\n\nI do still find a lack of depth in regard to the spell book. While I admist some spells are OP/Amazing and all classes have equiv of this OP spell.... they arent completely balanced. For example You have spell that are individual cast on tiles to convert to forest, etc.... yet there is one spell just as in previous versions of the game that you cast and tiles will automatically expand from your domain to this unnamed type of tile. Previous versions all had this outbound growing spell of tile your race will love. Morale in this game is very well handled, even with the new DLC and the necro. I just find the customization options of GAMEPLAY, i.e. spells, quests rather lacking. Great to design your own leaders but meh..... 8/10\nWill continue to play in the future","January 11","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Diplomacy is relatively well implemented, but it does still tend to edge towards a huge us vs them war in the end unless you create fixed teams or try really hard at keeping peace with various factions.\n\nThe turn based combat works really well and makes sieges especially interesting.\n\nHighly recommended and definitely buy both of the expansions; they add even more awesome stuff to an already great game!","October 19, 2015","true","214.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was looking for a game to scratch my "Disciples: Sacred Lands" itch and found a game that played like a hybrid of the aforementioned itch and the later games of the "Civilization" franchise. Gameplay is enjoyable and well developed, but not so complicated that it detracts from the over-all experience. Animations such as the number of soldiers in a unit being a visible "health bar" for the overall unit is a nice touch, as are the animations in general. I have had much enjoyment watching my Dwarven Musketeers open fire against the flank of an Orc Spearmen unit. Or my Elven Longbowmen fire wave after wave of arrows into their foes.\n\nThe lore is well done, and not too heavy or crying out for your undivided attention, but there is enough there to get you into the game's mechanics, whilst leaving room for DLC and add on campaigns and scenarios which will help this already interesting game stay fresh. A good soundtrack with a variety of fantasy inspired tracks doesn't hurt either, I have found myself humming along to the soundtrack on more than one occasion. A privilege in strategy games previously only enjoyed by Paradox.\n\nMultiplayer is remincent of other games in the genre. I would recommend playing it with close friends, or people in the same room as big maps with strangers would be a bold, and overly optimistic state of affairs.\n\nAll in all a good experience fully worth the money advertised. I fully expect many hours to be lost to this little gem and would not lament that fact.","July 9, 2014","true","66.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They're terrible.  I'm still trying to figure out what "constraint" is and how/if it can be altered, there are icons that pop up on the map at various junctions that I haven't been able to find any explanation for, and there are compounded features on terrain that complicate other abilities to affect terrain...\n\nin short, I love the game tactically - I *hate* the ridiculously poor "manual" - as in, there IS no manual, and I'm just using what I know from previous age of wonders games, inferring from basic tactical-game tropes, and piecing together other things based on context.  This, by the way, is NOT how one should approach an empire tactical game - I feel like I should not have to be "guessing" at how to get this done, or what this term means...\n\nbut, besides that, I'm loving it so far, although I'll admit to only having played a couple of hours - so, this is an initial impressions review, not an overall game review...not yet.","April 2, 2014","true","108.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captlynch/recommended/226840/","captlynch","Dr Bright","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captlynch/","310 products in account","Ok...before I begin, I must say that AoW3 is my first foray into the age of wonders series.\n\nThe closest equivilent game I have played is Fallen Enchantress.\n\nThat said, on with the show.\n\nThe game starts off with good veriaty and a beautiful visual.  You can pick from 6 races with 6 classes for each, each one a little different.  You also get the opportunity to make your own leader using any of the races as a template, each with a modifiable look and modifiable name.\n\nThe gameplay of the game is fun.  As well as your fellow leaders running around, there is the independents, which are all the non-aligned units, ranging from monsters and bandits, to neutral towns that you can either conquer/annihilate for the lulz or convince to join your empire by paying them gold.  Doing this is quite fun despite the ease to simply buy up the cities and also allows you to, with patience to get access to ALL the races for yourcurrent class...or you can be a evil bugger and forcibly migrate your race to these cities.\n\nThis brings me to my first little niggle regarding the AI.  The AI players work with you...unless you do things that ♥♥♥♥ them off and man are they picky.\n\nThey take notes of EVERYTHING you do and it doesn;t take much to upset them to the point that they will launch war after war against you.  While they will forget about these, it takes a LONG time.  In my main game, I noted how my one war against a enemy had given a -1200 rating that would last for nearly 130 turns.\n\nThis also brings up a AI problem I noted regarding these, which involved me getting a war penalty despite the fact that the other guy started it.  That is a bug that needs to be looked at in the least.\n\nThe next part, the combat.  This is similar to Fallen enchantress in that it is a turn based fight on a special map.  Each fight takes place between the two enemies on a hex and the units in the surrounding one.  However, again, evern on dumbest setting, the AI seems suspiciously competent, sending overwelming force against their chosen target.  There is regularly little warning of an attack, meaning you'll lose at least one city before you can get a peace treaty established, which is easy to do, surprisingly.\n\nAI players will happily take a peace treaty, regardless of how well their war is going with you.  While I welcome this given how war happy my neighbours are in my current game, it is a little boring and easy to avoid a war thats going badly.\n\nUnits, research and spells are next.  Like Fallen enchantress, you get to research a series of abilities/spells and units, ranging from mounted units to the local racial units depending on what race city you have up to, the kick ♥♥♥ juggernort 'land-ship' which is basically a 'I Win' unit.  You also get a nice selection on hero units, the cap of which you can limit.\n\nSpells however are also pretty good, and are unique to your chosen magic abilities and your class.  They have good veriaty, many have useful impact and are fun (the dreadnoughts 'mana core' nuke is just fun and a great mifddle finger to give a enemy thats overwelming you), ranging from the terraforming abilities, in-battle attacks unique to your heroes and world improvement spells such as the dreadnoughts 'supress nature; that removes all terrein penalties.\n\nHowever, my biggest problem is with the story campaign.  The difficulty there is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Half way into the FIRST MISSION...I was swarm attacked by about 30 units out no nowhere by a enemy I hadn;t even met.  This NEEDS to be patched ASAP but is not too big a problem in the long term of things\n\nIn conclusion, AoW3 is a great game that sits up there with the civilization and Fallen enchantress series's.  It has some bugs but its only just been released and I have no doubt that Triumph Studioes will fix these problems and game balance issues.\n\nIf you like the sid meier games and Galactic Civilization games, you'll love this game too.\n\nFinal rating:  9/10\n\nIt loses a point due to the unbalanced AI.","April 3, 2014","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After I wrapped around the controls which for whatever reason seemed backwards (left and right mouse buttons would be vise versa if i made things lol), I got pretty into the game and keep coming back. Although I could say a lot more, I am going to summarize things in bullet form as best i can and I will likely miss some things:\n\nThinks I think that could be improved:\n\n-The research tree is still rather baffling if you want to plan ahead or unlock certain things unless you have played a lot. If it was set up like in civilization with some kind of flow chart it would be a lot easier to prioritize.\n\n-Combat animations are kinda crumby with the units (i'm just whining nothing that harms the game)\n\n-The hero cannot die clause. Warcraft 2 all over again. In the campaign you basically just keep your hero in the back away from harm and cast spells unless you want him focus'ed by the AI and to reload your save. Personally I think the hero's need more durability else they essentially just play a support role for most of the fight, cuz when they die everything stops. You aren't going to siege a city without those wonderful buffs they give all the units in the army pack nor will you go and explore ruins/want to fight if a hero isn't milking exp.\n\n-The exp system, it should essentially award everyone in the army attacking or not. Win a battle: gain most exp, lose a battle: hero gets some exp everyone else is dead lol, Run from a battle get no exp (since running could be abused). I essentially just have hero use a ranged ability to kill off whatever i can (safely) as to net more exp.\n\n-The AI during sieges, if you have 2 trebuchets you can basically funnel all the enemies through a narrow hole in the wall, ive beat a few "very likely defeat" situations abusing this with a very small army. If the enemy is more numerous then you past a certain extent they should just bum rush you out the gates and cut u off instead of hole up and get picked off.\n\n-Spellcasting seems kind of wonky, losing your hero for casting oil skin almost doesnt seem worth it... some spells should perhaps count as your cast and not your hero turn and the more powerful will take both...\n\nThings I dont understand yet....:\n\n-I still have no idea the use of teraforming whatsoever. Ive never encountered any situation where i would want to change my land type. Nor have unhappy people, nor really see any issues being good/evil.\n\n-Why we have so many damn resources, gold is fine for the most part, but mana crystals im always swimming in them early on and for the rest of the scenario.\n\nThings that shine:\n\n-Battles are really fun when in the open areas with a lot of obstacles around.\n\n-The unique units are quite diverse so far from what i see\n\n-Game isn't the prettiest but I really like the looks of everything\n\n-campaign is enjoyable and each level takes a fair bit of time to complete thoroughly and im just playing on easy mode to speed through~ u get a lot of playtime in this game!\n\n-The voice acting is quite good, I love the intro dialogues they are read very very well.\n\nIf you want my comments on anything be sure to post and ask ill give my 2 cents.\n\nHope this is useful lol","April 18, 2014","true","31.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a large scale game not unlike a fantasy version of Civilization. The games are also multi-player. Its a fantastic lan game. I used to play with a girlfriend - we would ally and take on the entire rest of the world. So far this version of the game plays very smoothly, has a lot of the original features that made the older games great and the tactical battles are fun.\n\nThe game is complex. However that is the fun of it. Spending time learning the races and what special units they have. There is a lot to learn but it is definitely fun. Eventually you will find the combinations of abilities and fun units that combine to give you the juggernaut experience you are hoping for.\n\nI am so glad I saw this announced a few months ago and pre-ordered.

Diplomatic and overworld gameplay remains similar to the Civilization series, while not quite as robust. It does make up for it with its level of creative control.\n\nCreate your own civilization leader from a host of classes and racial combinations. Both your class and race affect the type of units your empire will have access to. If you play a rogue, depend on having stealth units, assassins and the like. Play a dreadnaught? Youll have rifleman and steam tanks. A warlord? How does having a legion of berserkers sound? While you cant directly modify individual units like fallen enchantress, the sheer vareity at your disposal makes that irrelavant.\n\nIf youre looking for a high fantasy themed civilization style 4X game with RPG elements, look no further.\n\n\n\n","April 2, 2014","true","525.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They're terrible.  I'm still trying to figure out what "constraint" is and how/if it can be altered, there are icons that pop up on the map at various junctions that I haven't been able to find any explanation for, and there are compounded features on terrain that complicate other abilities to affect terrain...\n\nin short, I love the game tactically - I *hate* the ridiculously poor "manual" - as in, there IS no manual, and I'm just using what I know from previous age of wonders games, inferring from basic tactical-game tropes, and piecing together other things based on context.  This, by the way, is NOT how one should approach an empire tactical game - I feel like I should not have to be "guessing" at how to get this done, or what this term means...\n\nbut, besides that, I'm loving it so far, although I'll admit to only having played a couple of hours - so, this is an initial impressions review, not an overall game review...not yet.","April 2, 2014","true","108.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let's start with that.\n\nThe command, unlike some other games, namely Fallen Enchantress, which is the main comparrison I'll be making, is rather dull. It takes about 25-70 turns, depending on what's in its domain, to complete the city entirely, and each city has to make that trek and the only real thing that changes it is the Raze, Plunder and Migrate options for each city, which is a nice touch, since each race has its own benefits.  Compared to Fallen Enchantress, though, the cities feel... Dull. It's the same path each time, and once you get all your class specific units, the entire war units tree is useless. One main problem I have with it, and this is a personal quipe, but oh well, is that the cities just suddenly... get taken over. Anything above a city I'm practically yelling at the screen with the general rage when a group of SCOUT units, which literally are so easy to kill that a tier four takes 1 damage to them, takes over your throne city/any other metropolis. That was a major turn off for me.\n\nNow, onto the war section. The combat is probably the most fun I've had in a 4X. It's really slick, it carries weight, and the seiges are fun. The general feel of the units are amazing, with specific combinations practically winning seiges and battles. The units all have unique rolls on the battlefield, some are tanks that don't deal much damage, or a "Give them the plague!" units that makes whatever they attack weaker. And one of my favorite, and at the same time least favorite, mechanics is that each battlefield consists of six hexes that each unit on takes part in. But then comes the little problem of top teir units being stacked and being literally impossible in a city to dislodge. And the units that aren't inside the gates on the map spawning on the battlefield suddenly inside it. That irritated me that you couldn't just send an army to fight one another. But, despite the units unique to each faction, I kept feeling the same feeling of "These are rather generic units" at the end of the game, since every end game unit tends to be what you'd expect. They should flesh it out a lot more and add either entire unit customization or just athestic customization. Oh. And heroes are practically useless unless you totally defend them with everything, since they're so low health and defence.\n\nThe explore and expand elements are generally how it feels in other games, use the explore to get loot and make more of the same generic city over the map. And don't even get me started on how useless the neautral city AI are. They're there for one purpose: Be conquered!\n\nAll in all, though, I'd say it's an amazing game with its problems that can be fixed with just a smidge of effort, or if a modder is willing, they could always fix it.\n\nOverall opinion: For me, personally, I like more diplomancy and less masses of war units everywhere. 8/10. I recommend it, I got my money's worth out of it.","May 8, 2014","true","80.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For a long time though it seems like the genre has peaked with classics like Master of Magic, and Heroes of Might an Magic 3. The latter being a personal favorite of mine. Now after a long wait we are getting games that are really good again like Fallen Enchantress, and Warlock. Age of Wonders 3 however is probably my new favorite out of all of them.\n\nYou can tell when playing it that the designer has probably played all of the games I mentioned above, and more. The game takes many good ideas of those titles incorporating in with some good ideas of it's own. The result feels really solid. Almost like a greatest hits album of the genre. It's important to know though that the title is focused more on the competitive element. This isn't an empire builder like Civ where you can sit in a corner, and focus on culture or something. It's built as a war game. Those that go into understanding that, and craving it will have a better time.","June 29, 2014","true","152.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Learning the gameplay might take a tad bit but when you start playing you'll find yourself bargaining time away just so you can play one more turn. The single player is pretty much where most people start, in order to learn the game mechanics and the game does that pretty well, by the time I got to the thrid level I was already building proper armies, upgrading cities, and destroying other empires. The game's AI is smart even on easy and you will find them hitting your weak points if you underestimate them while the hardest difficulty pushes you to use everything in your power to win, also although you can build alliances with the AI it is actually very hard to do so because most of the time they're in it for themselves but then again so are we so peace most of the time will not be in your options. You can also fight the battles yourself on a field but after awhile I just kept using auto battle unless it was a battle that I needed to be won then I took control but do know that one level can take a long time to complete because you'll be managing your cities, planning strategies for the future, or something else which will take time unless you're blitzing all the time. The music really is well made, the graphics are great, the multiplayer is fun and in a nutshell this game is very entertaining","February 27","true","146.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately this game follows in the terrible footsteps of price gouging you with DLCs that should be in the original game. The default factions in the game are tiresome and repetative. I think the developers couldve done more to give you quality and depth without the DLC addons. I REALLY hate the DLC practice!\nBuilding and empire expansion is mediocre. The graphics and combat are the real strengths of this game. Is that worth it to you? I dont know. I was a huge fan of the originals and so the graphics is what hooked me, but even so I waited for a sale. I'm very happy to not buy this at full price especially after their crummy and greedy DLC releases.\nAnyway, pick it up on sale.

It is very annoying to see bugs carrying over into sequels. I've this bug on many different computers at this point so talk of graphics cards and drivers being at fault is ridiculous.

First of all, let's start off with the positives about this game. The graphics are excellent and there is a lot of replay value in this game. The storyline is very interesting if these type of RPG games interest you as this is one of those turn-based games with a somewhat unpredictable outcome. So carefull planning is advisable. I like the scenario mode the best as the Draconians is my preferred clan that I like to use that is leaded by Rish Kyan. While I am not going to spoil anything. You will have to play the game yourself to fully experience it. The game also has multiplayer mode when you can play matches against your friends. So that is some of the good parts that this game has but the major downside is with the AI as in my experiences and with two days of not much progress. From what I have learned is that if you upgrade and max out your units. The AI will be much stronger and tougher to beat and in some cases. The AI is not that well balanced from my experiences of playing this game as it is just too aggressive in easy mode for a casual gamer which can be frustrating. All in all. that is the only one major downside to an otherwise a very enjoyable game :).\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10.","May 31","true","47.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It should be a game in every X4 fans collection. To put it on something familiar, add a dose of Heroes 3, add a dose of Civilisation, add a does of roleplaying. You get Age of Wonders III.  A 9 out of 10 game right now for me. But I might be a bit biased, being a long term fan of 15 years with this series.

When it first came out it was graphically and playability-wise behind the times and very little has changed as far as I can tell. This is not to say that I think AoW3 is a bad game by any stretch, I just feel that the whole genre isn't producing anything new any more. If I had to pick a "best" out of a slew of civ clones I would likely choose Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes over this. You can go on about oldies like Master of Magic or newer attempts such as Endless Legend...none of which are BAD games...it's just...ugh..this again? When all is said and done none of them really have the depth of even the earliest Total War games and haven't progressed in any big way since the original Civilization. Learn the basics...build powerful armies, click auto resolve, repeat until so bored that you dribble like Homer Simpson thinking of gravy.

I have many games that compete for my limited game time, but this one is winning hands-down at the moment.\n\nWhile there are some definite 'Heroes of Might and Magic' parallels, it feels much more holistic. The tactical fighting is great, and just gets better the more I learn about the units and the mechanics. The leveling system for each unit is great, and makes you really try to keep the unit alive, granting better powers and giving each experienced unit a sense of being less 'replaceable' by the next newly produced unit. This means that rather than sending them to their doom just to finish the battle faster, or being too careless or clumsy, you really want to make sure they get involved (to get more xp), but keep them from sacrificing themselves for a worthless cause.\n\nThe Heroes are great, and with so much customisation as they level up, it leaves you forever wishing you had more points to throw at their skills. This also makes it juicily special when they level up. And, even better is that it can really make a difference to the battles, whether it be the spells that enhance your 'shock troopers' to take and dish-out a heap of punishment, or enhancing your hero so they themselves become a mobile game-changer wherever they tread.\n\nThe city development is interesting too. It does not boast the most exhaustive list of buildings, but in the early-mid game it promotes the development of a city so that it specialises in one or two troop types. I really like this because it means you can plan your overall strategy with more effectiveness. Including thinking about how to get your slow-moving troops to the enemy - do you build them in the close cities, or build roads between cities, or keep each city more generic and have lower level or lower tiered troops. Lots of delicious approaches.\n\nAnother big plus is the ability to play offline. Which is great as I often travel. Cloud auto-saves can also help me progress on either my PC or laptop.\n\nIf you like strategy, and multiple approaches to victory - then this game is for you. Heroes class and race make a difference, and the constant difficult choice of which spells and skills to choose is fantastic. Runs surprisingly well on low specs too.\n\nCons - can't save the game mid-way through a battle, music is not amazing (but who really plays these games for the music).\n\nPlease enjoy!","May 23, 2015","true","85.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

But I felt intrigued enough to keep playing. Then I slowly started unraveling the intricacies and the secrets and I got absolutely hooked.\n\nThe biggest draw for me, is the degree of customisation it offers. There are literally dozens of combinations of race/class/specialisation combined with random maps which are quite configurable, and a lot of different tweaks for each game map. One game you might be playing a Frostling Sorcerer with master destruction and rain death (and stun) on your foes, next game a Dwarf Theocrat rising from the caves below the surface to conquer everything, specializing in wild magic with unpredictable results. Then a Tigran Warlord Grey Guard, bashing down all opposition. Then later you might revisit the Frostling sorcerer, but be lucky enough to have a building that makes your Ice Queens practically immortal (if you end up winning the fight) inside your domain.\n\nWhat I'm getting at, is not only are all of these options extremely fun to play around with and figure out interesting and powerful combinations, but they offer a replayability rarely seen in games.\n\nReally this game is amazing and you should check it out if you are a fan of Turn Based Strategy games. If only HoMnM games were half this good these days...","June 19, 2015","true","258.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You build cities and go exploring and BATTLING.  Yeah, the game is all about the combat so if you're looking for something like CIvilization you will be sorely disappointed with this one.\n\nThe combat is excellent and strategic.  Units can level up during battles, and eventually, can become quite strong if they've been with you since the beginning of the game.  The game has flanking, attacks of opportunity, line of sight bonuses and penalties (however, no friendly fire with ranged attack, so that's a plus), Overwhelm, Status Effects, Special Movement Types... I don't know what more you could ask for in the combat part.\n\nIn terms of things that aren't combat like city management, etc... Yeah - it's limited.  Diplomacy leaves me scratching my head and there's no options to make other players necessarily like you, just peace treaties or alliance proposals.  City buildings basically fall into either resource production (for that glorious army you're building) or unit recruitment buiildings so it's easy enough to get into.\n\nIt may be rather simple, but that's how Heroes of Might and Magic II was and man if this isn't the spirtual succesor to that game I don't know what is.","April 10, 2014","true","41.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game, instead, celebrates its complexity by finely balancing it and making everything in the game be worth using, even Tier 1 units which in nearly every other game (including its predecessors) become obsolete by mid-game.\nThe turns play fast, battle auto-resolving works acceptably well and actually simulates the battles instead of making an oddball calculation based on numbers. You have the option to make your heroes survive auto-resolved battles if you win them (to avoid the strong annoyance of the CPU suiciding your heroes), thus relieving you of a lot of unwanted micromanagement.\nThe tactical battles in the game are detailed, very enjoyable, and also optional! —since the auto-resolve feature plays fine—. You can replay auto-resolved battles to learn the game's complex tactical combat by watching the computer (I learned partly that way).\n\nThe graphics, music and interface of the game are excellent. If you play with low detail graphics you may have Age of Wonders II flashbacks  =)  specially with antialiasing off. You can run this game in moderately old hardware (something other modern games can't).\n\nExcellent Turn-Based Strategy Game, a personally refreshing sight after failures like Civilization: Beyond Earth and Heroes VI. Get it on a discount sale if you're hesitant. I'm sure you'll be buying the expansions rather soon  =)\n\n( The expansions added new victory conditions and even more variety to an already spicy game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingobingonfinky/recommended/226840/","jingobingonfinky","Minitrue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jingobingonfinky/","152 products in account","A 4x fantasy game that has all the elements you could wish for, allowing it to make a real challenge at being arguably the best in its genre. But does it live up to its sparkle ?\n\nIf you're old enough to remember Master of Magic, then you will know the precursor game that AoW III has built itself on. If you're not old enough, then AoW is a game of the same family as Warlock, or any of the fantasy mods for Civ. A turn based fantasy game you will spend your time exploring a map, expanding your empire, exploiting resources and finally exterminating your enemies. A 4x to the core. Whilst there have been innumerable takes on this formula, AoW III promises to bring all these things together with a decent rub of polish and just enough depth to really please the 4x audience.\n\nAnd in many ways the game does just that - a nice tactical combat system that brings depth to the strategic map manoeuvres without overstaying its welcome. A diverse and interesting number of resources to exploit. Bucketfuls of different army units and racial types. And so on.\n\nBut despite all this, and despite it looking great, the game has some flaws. And when you get to playing it, those flaws really start to bite.\n\nThe first flaw is the simultaneous move implementation. Turn based games can turn into a tedious snore fest if they opt for a me go you go type mechanic. Fortunately in this day and age such things are rare ( with the exception of the woeful coding of Warlock ), but in AoW III the simultaneous movement has a hitch. Everything and everyone moves simultaneously - players, AI kingdoms, independents. And the AI has a beautifully machine like grief play style where it can wait for you to make a single move somewhere, before rolling forward its units to sneak in the back door and take that town from you.\n\nWoops.\n\nSo maybe you shouldn't move out of that town. At all. Ever. A bizarre nervouse mexican stand off ensues where the AI stares you down waiting for you to misclick or even just investigate a passing army before rushing in to capitalise. And it's no good clicking once you've taken that step - particularly if you are playing in a multiplayer network game - as the whole thing then lags and chugs busy processing its own fabulously griefing move whilst your frantic clicks can sit and wait.\n\nIn practice the simultaneous movement with AIs on the field of play quickly becomes irritating - and it starts to warp play into some neurotic twitch fest. It's not the first game to implement this type of nervous who clicks first simultaneous play, but here, combined with a simplistic "IS IT OK FOR ME TO ATTACK NOW" state AI, it can often prove enormously frustrating.\n\nFortunately simulaneous movement is optional.\n\nNon simultaneous movement then goes back to the tedious me go you go turn order. But at least you can go out explore something and be home for tea without the griefing AI kicking your door down mid journey. Well. Mostly.\n\nThe second flaw to the game is that towns don't have an implicit defence. That is to say, if a town is empty, anyone can just walk in and take it. Sound reasonable ? Sure. What's the problem ? Remember that hair trigger wait for you to move "IS IT OK TO ATTACK NOW" AI ? It's still here. And as soon as you even look like you are leaving somewhere empty or under strength, then with annoying regularity the AI marches an army up. I couldn't swear to it, but the AI also has an uncanny knack to "know" when you have left somewhere light, and proceeds to quickly march from over the horizon to its target goal. Meh.\n\nIn practice with the AI staring you down waiting for you to set a single foot outside your door, you end up with the gratuitous full army stack just sitting kicking its heels defending a town. FOR THE REST OF THE GAME. You can see why many games just abstract city defence away, as it's a no brainer you want to always defend a city.\n\nBut maybe you're ok with that. Seeing a stack of troops in every town, and the maintenance of them - the retiring of old redundant units, the creating of new  better ones, and the whines from their heroes as they slowly level up, and the movement difficulties getting around that fat stack is fine. No problem.\n\nThird flaw in the game. Unit balance. As you proceed up your tech tree, most units become pretty much worse than useless. In fact, if you are not spamming out your top tier units, then you're probably doing it wrong. And if those low tier units do engage those high tier ones ? Splat. Well ! That's just the march of progress ! That's to be expected ! Except it's kind of broken here. In something like Civ your units in the field will get dragged through the ages with an upgrade - that unit of Warriors you've had kicking around since 4000BC are now some fancy 20th century Infantrymen. And you will no longer be able to produce those ancient warriors. In AoW there is no such handling. Those idiot Tier I guys will still be walking around. Sucking up resources. Bloating out stacks. And you can go right on producing those stick wielding primitives right into the era of "space travel" - the highest tiers. Which is kind of pointless. And irritating. So for all those fancy units, it ends up just a race for the highest tier - with a few exceptions. The subtleties of rock paper scissors are quickly washed away in a My Tank beats EVERYTHING you have.\n\nFourth flaw in the game, and this really does spoil the game, is the nature of the AI. The AI is the worst kind of griefing AI - the kind of player that will happily sit there and repeat play the same chequers move until eternity, just so they stop you winning. It's a sad fact that to placate the human player customer base, an AI has to sometimes take the higher road, the non optimal choice and  break out of that loop of incessant taunting moves. In AoW the AI has no such good sportsmanship tendencies and will happily bounce armies back and forth as you trigger each AI decision tree. Move to the left ? Your enemy to the right will charge. Move to the right ? Your enemy to the left will charge. Quickly go back the other direction ? Your enemies will mirror your move. Rinse and repeat.\n\nSo the AI is tricky you think. What's the issue ? You're just whining about a hard AI !\n\nThe AI is not hard particularly. Just annoying. As are the other issues with the game. All of which combines in a perfect storm to produce a game that after a while becomes just plain irritating. You don't have fun. It becomes like managing an annoying spoiled nephew. Until you question why you are even playing the stupid game, and hell doesn't Civ or Warlock give a  much more enjoyable experience ?\n\nAnd there's the problem. AoW has all the right bits, all the right polish and yet... through a few interesting design choices... manages to trip over and face plant to produce an annoying not quite there game.\n\nThe irritating aspects of the game do shine through - and until recently another annoying ( And pointless ? ) aspect of game play was an AI that would endlessly spam dispells. Sound tactics ? Sure. Annoying griefy play that tends to break any possible use of global spells ? Yes. It's something that you can see hasn't really been thought about how it plays out. It's an AI which is not good at playing humans - it's good at playing itself.\n\nIf you were being very harsh, you might almost say someone looked at all the requested things for a 4x, mixed them together and baked for half an hour - but without any clue whatsoever as to what *tastes good*.\n\nAt its best there is a good game somewhere in AoW. At it's worst its an annoying experience with a minor sprinkling of bugs to spice things up a bit.\n\nPersonally I am still perservering with it - I like the bits that are good, and it can play for a while as a nice game, on the other hand I really hate the bits that fail, they really jar you out of the game and produce a frustrating, lets go play something else type vibe.","May 1, 2014","false","44.2"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MannyStillwagon/recommended/226840/","MannyStillwagon","Manny Stillwagon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MannyStillwagon/","46 products in account","In brief: A game with a fantastic concept that lacks the depth and balance to hold the player's attention.\n\nIn not so brief:\nI was really excited about this game. I saw some gameplay and got it on the Steam Winter Sale after waiting forever for the price to drop. I was excited by the combination of strategic overworld combined with tactical combat and thought it would make for dynamic and immersive gameplay. To go with the Civilization comparison I had always wished the combat there was more detailed / more engaging and I thought this was the answer. Unfortunately I fails to live up to expectations.\n\nYou choose class and race and those determine what "special units" you get and some specialized bonuses and abilities. Unfortunately, the special units are little more than reskins of the same basic types. You have infantry, calvary, and archers. And your specialized units are only "special" in a few details. Once you get to mid-game you've figured out the most efficient way to conduct your battles in the tactical map and so just rinse-and-repeat through the entire late-game. You end up hitting "auto-combat" more and more because it's no longer exctiting to spend 7 minutes to crush some bandits. And at that ponit you're no longer even playing the tactical portion. Every tactical map is effectively the same, and so each battle progresses the same way.\n\nThere is no other choice than "crush all your enemies in combat". While in Civ you can win through economics, diplomacy, or culture, in AoW III it is ONLY through conquest. Well that's fine, right? Because you came to play a fantasy strategic/tactical combat game. That's what I thought. But this affects the AI a LOT. Peace treaties are a joke. The AI will propose them, and then break them only a few turns later. There's no real penalty for doing so and in the end they have no other choice. They HAVE to fight you at some point. So forming alliances in game doesn't really work. As a result, the AI is pumping out units at a high rate. Which just turns the game into an arms race. You don't have time to focus on the unique terraforming spells or anything that's not directly combat related. It's just a sprint to get to late-game units so you can stand up to the AI. Which means you probably get there before even exploring the entire map. So the late game is dominated by just cleaning up the rest of your opponents. Sure, now you have the flexibility to play with terraforming or something, but why bother? The game is almost over.\n\nOne final thing is that some of the background game mechanics are broken. Empire Happiness is notably problematic. You gain happiness for a number of things but most importantly for conquering other cities. You lose happiness for such things as losing cities. Happiness determines how well your troops perform in combat. The result of this is that once you get an enemy on their heels it's lights out. It becomes a runaway effect where you just get better and better and they get worse and worse. Instead of long campaigns being tiring for your troops, it's almost invigorating. Additionally, your throne city is EVERYTHING. As in, if you lose that, you lose it all. Literally. Keeping your throne city is a victory requirement. So you can't turtle in a lesser city off to the side to make a brilliant comeback later. If you lose that it's game over. So the easiest way to defeat an opponent is to walk past all of their other cities, go right to their throne, and take it. The end.\n\nI could say more but this review is already overly long. I really, deeply wish I could recommend this game, but it's simply not worth it. Like I said a fantastic concept that falls flat when it comes to execution. If you want to play a turn-based strategy game, play Civ. If you want to play a turn based tactical game, play X-COM. If you want to play a fusion of the two, wait for something better to come along.","January 18, 2015","false","16.1"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","0"

It takes the core elements of great tactics style RPGs, and throws them inside a slightly simplified empire building game a la Civilization V.\n\nI can acknowledge that the strategic portion of the game lacks some of the depth that can be found in the most hardcore strategy games, but I do not feel this is a flaw. One of the greatest games ever devised, Chess, has only 6 unique pieces, and in its standard style of play, only allows for 1v1 competition. There is a delightfully simple elegance to the units and technologies available in AoWIII (which offer many more choices than Chess). Taken from a purely turn-based strategy game perspective, they would seem shallow compared to the game's peers, but in the context of a deep turn-based tactical RPG (with heroes levelling from 1-30, earning skill points to allocate each level, and spells to research, and gear to equip) it is plenty complex enough.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is how amazingly stable my multiplayer experience has been.  My first time launching online multiplayer, it checked my connectivity rating, and told me it was poor due to firewall settings. I clicked a link provided in-game, and in a totally crisp and not buggy fashion, minimized my client and sent me to the company's help page, wherein I was given the neccessary port to forward. I did so, had the game check again, and was good to go. A friend and I have long searched for a good co-operative tactical RPG experience. The best I have yet found was FFT: The Lion War for PSP. It's a shame that a hand-held game system has trumped PC for so long in this niche. XCOM lacks co-op campaign functionality, Eador is horribly buggy and unstable, and the others I've tried are all crumby. In AoWIII, I've found that harmonious combination of enjoyable gameplay and completely (and I mean 8 straight hours of addictive, no crashes or disconnections) stable multiplayer.\n\nWatch some videos of this game and decide if it suits your interests, but as for my opinion, I can give this one an A+.","September 23, 2014","true","328.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do not fret so much on the people talking so negatively about this game.\n\nIf you love long hours for one game (I have been playing the second campain mission for days now. Yea its that intense)\nbuilding or taking over cities to widen your territory for more resources, and intense turn-based battles (or auto-battle), get this game!\n\nIt has the large maps of Heroes, with the army formations of Disciples--- (6 whatevers per army including heroes and its not quantity like the 'zongz' or 'hordes' in Heroes, only one each unit (althought there can be 1,3, or 6 "people" in one unit formation)and instead of changing like they do in Disciples, they "level up" and get stronger.)--- while adding its own spin. You can make builders and settlers that make roads, cities, forts, and watchtowers. Its own spells and such.\n\nLike Heroes you have all kinds of spells you can research and use (although you do not have to build a mage guild). Unlike Heroes you do not "go into" a city, a panel just pops up and you select it. Although the city look does change over time. Sort of like a TW 2 Rome, where little houses spread out around it.\n\nSo who really wants to read every little detail. You can go watch Youtube vidoes of actaul gameplay right? Games like these arnt for gamers who want a Ryse Rome kind of game. A salute my fellow, slowly take over every inch of the map and clear it out, plus build it all up how you want, gamers! Go Warcraft 1-3 and BFME games XD\n\nI will say, at first I regretted buying this. OMG why did I buy this when I can just play my Disciples II and have basically the same thing. HA! Discpiles is (while I have not played the new one from this year (2014..drool....) no where near as intense and LONG (again think Heroes!) as AoW. Granted it is limited. Each race has the exact same building, and each unit while looks, attributes and powers are different, each tier or class (Tier 1 Calvary or Tier 3 Archer) is comparribly the same.\n\nIf you want a good, intense, in depth fighting game that you can or want to spend huge amount of time -------\n(I have put in 17.5 hours as I post this, maybe 2 of which was on the first mission, the rest on the second campain mission AND I am only half way through the map....well the top level anyhow ;) I have barely done anything on the under level. OH I FORGOT! With builders or special units like the giant beetle you can 'dig; through certain walls and explore more, while more or less combining the whole under level....be careful you arnt the only one who can :P)\n-------- get this game!\n\nEven do like me and put it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.\n\nHope this helped.

Sorry, Triumph, but what I liked about this game series was the epic-level wizardry, and you've totally dumbed it down.

The troops are all weaker, too.  Playing daconians?  No red dragons for you.  Your best unit is now... flyers.  Yay.

I have enjoyed this game very much.  The classes seem to be very similar and playing them doesn't really require a different strategy for each.  Fewer balanced classes that played differently would have been more enjoyable but very few games have ever gotten that formula right.  I also find that occasionally I can win a difficult battle with autocombat ex:  (two six man armies each led by a hero against four fliers and a hunter in a city) that I couldn't win manually and vice versa ex: (I beat an eight man army lead by a hero with three elven archers).  Not sure what that's about but if I redo a battle a bunch of times and get my butt kicked I can occasionally win it with autocombat.  Also a little frustrating when my hero doesn't get disjunction to research during a random game but oh well makes for a challenge.","September 18, 2014","true","218.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game play is 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) much like the Civilization or Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is set in a high fantasy world ripe with monstrous creatures, dungeons and undead armies. When playing a map (either a scenario, the campaign, or a randomly generated map) you start with a leader unit who, in scenarios or random maps, you create yourself and usually a small army based on one of the five races that you can choose with a city or a city building unit to start your empire. Your leader can level up as they defeat enemies with your armies and gain points to put into unique abilities based on their class and their offensive and defensive statistics. These abilities will help bolster the armies that they lead and push you ever closer to victory. The infantry units you command also gain experience and levels up to four but their abilities and stats are predetermined. Also based on the previously mentioned class and the actions you take to solidify an alignment, either good or evil, are the spells that you research along the way which is reminiscent of technology from the Civ franchise.\n\nAlong your journey you will more than likely run across heroes that will offer to join you, these characters are much like your leader, they level up the same, they gain abilities based on their class, and they are meant to lead armies. The big difference being that if you lose one of these heroes they are gone, much like other units in your army. Your leader will respawn at your throne city, assuming it's still standing, after a few turns but their friends will not. This makes the battles intense and the losses devastating. The battles are turn based on a hex map based on whatever landscape you're occupying and these maps are gorgeous. They really give you a look at the landscapes that your troops are marching through.\n\nThe class system mentioned above is a change to the series that after experiencing I can say is welcome. There are very distinct ways that each class works from the technology based, steam punkesque Dreadnaught to the classic magic juggernaut that is the Sorcerer. The Theocrat leads through belief and divine retribution with their crusaders, leading holy wars against their heretical enemies while the Rogue leads through deception, riots, and stealth. The Archdruid taps into the power of nature, summoning animal companions and nature elementals to their side while the Warlord rampages their armies with limited use of magic, ruling through blood, and battle.\n\nOverall the game is a very unique and very fun experience. The soundtrack is breathtakingly beautiful with a few songs being a throwback to the original. Clearly I don't write reviews for a living (I know. "Too many commas." "Where's the sentence structure?") but I feel like if I were to Age of Wonders would get a 5/5, 10/10, or 100/100. The only gripe I could make is the lack of a few races from the previous games but that's nothing that an expansion or two won't fix. That, and the fact that I can't buy the collectors edition of the game. But life goes on. I'll be spending hours of mine in the Age of Wonders.","April 5, 2014","true","73.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calar8/recommended/226840/","calar8","calar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calar8/","227 products in account","Ya, this game is really solid. I should preface this my saying my favorite genre of all time is turn based strategy, and while I usually prefer more focused experiences like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, every so often I like to go for a grander 4X game. That said, as a long time strategy fan, this game hits almost every note right with me.\n\nFirst off, while this game is great, it does have a few minor issues that I would like to address before betting to the good stuff. The pace of the game can get very slow, especially when running large maps with many opponents. This can be compounded by the fact that you cant auto manage your cities and my inherant distrust for auto-resolving battles. Additionally, The simultaneous turn system feels a bit funky, and will often cause you to be ambushed mid turn before you can move your armies. This of course is easily fixed by changing the turns to classic.\n\nAside from those issues, the game plays great. There is a tone of variety in units between various combinations of races and classes and tons of neutral units that you will fight in your travels. The customization of heroes is insane and will give any hardcore strategy fan something to sink their teeth into. Best off all though is the execution of strategy in battles. Units die very easily which causes you to apply proper strategy to keep your army alive. Additionally, the game averts the turtling problem of many games of the genre by allowing multiple armies to attack a single hex at a time. This creates huge epic battles that blow games like HoMM out of the water while averting the frustration that comes from having a vastly superior army but being unable to take a single well defended city. Finally, the AI feels smart and a worthy advisary to challenge your dominion.\n\nOverall, this game outpaces most of its competition in its genre. It has more than enough depth for any strategy fan while still being accessable and easy to pick up. If you are a strategy fan, you owe it to yourself to try this game.","April 9, 2014","true","94.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't recall how many hours I dumped into those games, especially the second one.  It was the reinvention of Master of Magic, and I loved it.  You get the great world map combined with many fantastic races and tactical combat on separate maps.  I could not have been happier.  It was the fantasy version of Civilization in many respects.\n\nWhen I saw AoW3, I got anxious.  Finally it released, and I got to play it.  It truly has everything to remind me of the previous versions I loved, and then some.  Random Maps, finally.  Relevant units, yay.\n\nAoW3 has random maps.  This seems normal, but previously they did not.  So after a while, it becomes mundane with the same strategies and outcomes per scenario.  You can build cities!  Couldn't do that in the old days.  It was all preset and you took what was already there.  Units are relevant now.  In AoW2 the best strategy was to raze every single building and town you took (except your starting city), then destroy the neutral armies that appeared, and farm all the xp and items you could for your starting hero. He becomes nigh invincible, even to tier 3 units, and has absurd movement with flight, so he can just zoom around the map with a scorched earth strategy.  I have not tried to do this in AoW3, but I suspect it would be ineffective.\n\nIf you liked the previous games in the series, you will still like this one. I cannot say anything bad about it. It is in line with everything I expected it to have. It stays true to the series, and offers some new things. The only thing it doesn't have, is the number of races that the priors had.  No Dark Elves, no Undead, etc... DLC right?  Seems fine.\n\nAll that being said, I would go 8/10 if you like the genre or the old games.  Personally, it's a 7 for me, and that is just because although I want to enjoy the battles and fight them manually, they become something of a chore to me and I end up auto'ing most of them, even if its a huge super important fight.  I would not have the patience anymore for multiplayer if people do manual fights, yet the prospect of not having the option to manual fight seems to gut a large aspect of the game's draw for me.\n\nSo I recommend this game overall, but you mind get a little bored with it if you have leaned towards RTS style games since playing AoW2, and maybe that's not worth the cost of the game for you.  Even so, it's a fine product and I am happy to support it, even if I don't play it as much as I thought I would.  (so many good games these days)","April 26, 2014","true","91.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game play is 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) much like the Civilization or Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is set in a high fantasy world ripe with monstrous creatures, dungeons and undead armies. When playing a map (either a scenario, the campaign, or a randomly generated map) you start with a leader unit who, in scenarios or random maps, you create yourself and usually a small army based on one of the five races that you can choose with a city or a city building unit to start your empire. Your leader can level up as they defeat enemies with your armies and gain points to put into unique abilities based on their class and their offensive and defensive statistics. These abilities will help bolster the armies that they lead and push you ever closer to victory. The infantry units you command also gain experience and levels up to four but their abilities and stats are predetermined. Also based on the previously mentioned class and the actions you take to solidify an alignment, either good or evil, are the spells that you research along the way which is reminiscent of technology from the Civ franchise.\n\nAlong your journey you will more than likely run across heroes that will offer to join you, these characters are much like your leader, they level up the same, they gain abilities based on their class, and they are meant to lead armies. The big difference being that if you lose one of these heroes they are gone, much like other units in your army. Your leader will respawn at your throne city, assuming it's still standing, after a few turns but their friends will not. This makes the battles intense and the losses devastating. The battles are turn based on a hex map based on whatever landscape you're occupying and these maps are gorgeous. They really give you a look at the landscapes that your troops are marching through.\n\nThe class system mentioned above is a change to the series that after experiencing I can say is welcome. There are very distinct ways that each class works from the technology based, steam punkesque Dreadnaught to the classic magic juggernaut that is the Sorcerer. The Theocrat leads through belief and divine retribution with their crusaders, leading holy wars against their heretical enemies while the Rogue leads through deception, riots, and stealth. The Archdruid taps into the power of nature, summoning animal companions and nature elementals to their side while the Warlord rampages their armies with limited use of magic, ruling through blood, and battle.\n\nOverall the game is a very unique and very fun experience. The soundtrack is breathtakingly beautiful with a few songs being a throwback to the original. Clearly I don't write reviews for a living (I know. "Too many commas." "Where's the sentence structure?") but I feel like if I were to Age of Wonders would get a 5/5, 10/10, or 100/100. The only gripe I could make is the lack of a few races from the previous games but that's nothing that an expansion or two won't fix. That, and the fact that I can't buy the collectors edition of the game. But life goes on. I'll be spending hours of mine in the Age of Wonders.","April 5, 2014","true","73.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

AOW III could have more in it from Wizards Throne (AOW II) , but I am trusting Triumph to get a good amount of DL content.  This game kills HOMM, and Fallen Enchantress.  It was the first game to utilize the Underworld, and Environmental spell effects.  While they have borrowed a little too much from HOMM and dumb down some of the dimensional combat, it's still a great game, could it be better?  Yes, but it is worth the money.  A Huge map will keep you busy for a few days.  The longer you play, in my estimate the more you will get into the mechanics and the depth of the game.  You can choose your own destiny Evil or Good, it all depends on whether you want to slaughter a bunch of friendly nymphs and ferries or make peace with everyone.  Graphics are good, not great but the game play makes up for everything.  If you enjoy HOMM (Hero's of Might and Magic) or Fallen Enchantress then get this game.

I've dabbled with a variety of contenders over the years but none quite hit the same mark. When Fallen Enchantress rolled out recently, I gave it a shot but found it a bit clunky and ugly as all get out. Warlock is another fine game but it's lack of customization (seriously, is there NO WAY to turn off the ridiculous, ever-spawning monsters?) and odd constraints on actual spell casting left me wanting. King's Bounty and HoMM are in the same family tree but farther removed and not particularly strategic in nature - certainly not epic games of empires and war.\n\nThe real draw on Age of Wonders is that, much like Civ V, you can play it as deeply as you like. Not interested in min-maxing out racial modifiers and terrain-based morale requirements on a unit-by-unit basis? That's fine... play against simple AI and forget about that stuff by playing joy-ride sandbox games. Alternatively, a player could spend hours fussing over the ways that all of the unit and kingdom modifiers compliment each other.\n\nDiplomacy and non-warfare tech is MUCH simpler than that of Civ V but that deficiency is offset by the unique nature of the various races and classes available. Every class and magic sphere combo opens up a tech tree of spells and skills that allow some rather unique empires to emerge and the horizon is WIDE open for future expansions.\n\nPlayers should be forewarned that even a medium-sized map can take many hours to work through but there's rarely a moment from beginning to end where the user simply hits the NEXT TURN button without making some kind of imperial decision.\n\nGreat stuff... terribly addictive but great.","April 4, 2014","true","423.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Luckily, I know a fir bit about other 4x games to fill in the blanks. But research is still a mystery to me.\n\nAlso, in  the tutorial/campaign some of the starting research options were different when I restarted (Yes, I died in 2 turns - damn auto-combat)\n\nBut does look very promising and I am enjoying it so far. I particularly like how the map changes to a drawn map when fully zoomed out.\nIt is a solid game and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/calar8/recommended/226840/","calar8","calar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calar8/","227 products in account","Ya, this game is really solid. I should preface this my saying my favorite genre of all time is turn based strategy, and while I usually prefer more focused experiences like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, every so often I like to go for a grander 4X game. That said, as a long time strategy fan, this game hits almost every note right with me.\n\nFirst off, while this game is great, it does have a few minor issues that I would like to address before betting to the good stuff. The pace of the game can get very slow, especially when running large maps with many opponents. This can be compounded by the fact that you cant auto manage your cities and my inherant distrust for auto-resolving battles. Additionally, The simultaneous turn system feels a bit funky, and will often cause you to be ambushed mid turn before you can move your armies. This of course is easily fixed by changing the turns to classic.\n\nAside from those issues, the game plays great. There is a tone of variety in units between various combinations of races and classes and tons of neutral units that you will fight in your travels. The customization of heroes is insane and will give any hardcore strategy fan something to sink their teeth into. Best off all though is the execution of strategy in battles. Units die very easily which causes you to apply proper strategy to keep your army alive. Additionally, the game averts the turtling problem of many games of the genre by allowing multiple armies to attack a single hex at a time. This creates huge epic battles that blow games like HoMM out of the water while averting the frustration that comes from having a vastly superior army but being unable to take a single well defended city. Finally, the AI feels smart and a worthy advisary to challenge your dominion.\n\nOverall, this game outpaces most of its competition in its genre. It has more than enough depth for any strategy fan while still being accessable and easy to pick up. If you are a strategy fan, you owe it to yourself to try this game.","April 9, 2014","true","94.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't recall how many hours I dumped into those games, especially the second one.  It was the reinvention of Master of Magic, and I loved it.  You get the great world map combined with many fantastic races and tactical combat on separate maps.  I could not have been happier.  It was the fantasy version of Civilization in many respects.\n\nWhen I saw AoW3, I got anxious.  Finally it released, and I got to play it.  It truly has everything to remind me of the previous versions I loved, and then some.  Random Maps, finally.  Relevant units, yay.\n\nAoW3 has random maps.  This seems normal, but previously they did not.  So after a while, it becomes mundane with the same strategies and outcomes per scenario.  You can build cities!  Couldn't do that in the old days.  It was all preset and you took what was already there.  Units are relevant now.  In AoW2 the best strategy was to raze every single building and town you took (except your starting city), then destroy the neutral armies that appeared, and farm all the xp and items you could for your starting hero. He becomes nigh invincible, even to tier 3 units, and has absurd movement with flight, so he can just zoom around the map with a scorched earth strategy.  I have not tried to do this in AoW3, but I suspect it would be ineffective.\n\nIf you liked the previous games in the series, you will still like this one. I cannot say anything bad about it. It is in line with everything I expected it to have. It stays true to the series, and offers some new things. The only thing it doesn't have, is the number of races that the priors had.  No Dark Elves, no Undead, etc... DLC right?  Seems fine.\n\nAll that being said, I would go 8/10 if you like the genre or the old games.  Personally, it's a 7 for me, and that is just because although I want to enjoy the battles and fight them manually, they become something of a chore to me and I end up auto'ing most of them, even if its a huge super important fight.  I would not have the patience anymore for multiplayer if people do manual fights, yet the prospect of not having the option to manual fight seems to gut a large aspect of the game's draw for me.\n\nSo I recommend this game overall, but you mind get a little bored with it if you have leaned towards RTS style games since playing AoW2, and maybe that's not worth the cost of the game for you.  Even so, it's a fine product and I am happy to support it, even if I don't play it as much as I thought I would.

Not a puzzler game - it is a jigsaw of likes and disklikes. It has medicore graphics (both models and effects), sound gets a bit annoying at times and the creator of the UI could learn a lot from authors of those implemented f.e. in Might and Magic Heroes VI.\n\nBUT!\n\nThe research is quite fun. The magic is awesome (and I mean owesome in an old style way; if you played Master of Magic, you'd know what i maen) and the resource system is simple and neat. Also you have bazzilion of skills for your heroes (because when they lvl up, you can experience a point based skill buying system - and it's good IMO) and the number of units in game is sick.\nThe way the map is composed is known from titles such as Civ and other 4X fantasy themed games, BUT it also contains ruins, vaults, ancient burial ground, dragon lairs, mana sources, all sort of "pick me up" goodies and more.\n\nConclusion: at first I hesitated even considering the game worth playing. But now, after some hours into it I'm happy I have it.\n\nIf there would be a scale to judge the quality of a game, I would give it a strong 78 out of 100.

Personally, it's a 7 for me, and that is just because although I want to enjoy the battles and fight them manually, they become something of a chore to me and I end up auto'ing most of them, even if its a huge super important fight.  I would not have the patience anymore for multiplayer if people do manual fights, yet the prospect of not having the option to manual fight seems to gut a large aspect of the game's draw for me.\n\nSo I recommend this game overall, but you mind get a little bored with it if you have leaned towards RTS style games since playing AoW2, and maybe that's not worth the cost of the game for you.  Even so, it's a fine product and I am happy to support it, even if I don't play it as much as I thought I would.  (so many good games these days)","April 26, 2014","true","91.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have lots of experienced with turn based strategies of all flavors, and this one holds up.\n\nSince a lot of great reviews are out there, I'll just reaffirm the ones that state this game focuses more on action and less on managemet. The city management system is fairly shallow, but deep enough to keep it interesting. The combat however is superb and the level of detail for both character design and animation is just astounding. The reverse of Endless Legend, which is much deeper with management but a fairly shallow combat system.\n\nI do love the AoW3 campaign though, great concept incorporating single player RPG's into a turn based strategy sim, I dig it.\n\nIf you like turn based games and fantasy, there's no way you can't like this game. It might not blow your socks off, but it is more than worth its asking price (especially if on sale).

Compared to other games of it's type, AW3 offers a much deeper combat system and a wide veriety of strategies and compositions. If you have a lot of spare time, love/are interested in grand strategy titles, and/or like the themes of traitional medieval fantacy, I would highly reccomend this game.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent turn based combat system that favors strategy over raw stats\n- Races and Classes feel unique to play and favor sometimes wildly different strategies. Lots of options.\n- Optional, yet deep, character customization.\n- The world is fun to explore - and very rewarding. There's always something productive to do.\n- DLC adds game changing elements that are worth investing in if you enjoy the base game\n- You CAN add more races into your empire, leading to even more wild compositions\n- Campaign mode offers a more flavorful world, and each unit has a flavorful story tied to it. World is more immersive.\n\nCons:\n- Some race/class combinations are much weaker than others.\n- Tutorial is very bad - game is hard to learn, and harder to understand.\n- Campaign maps favor rush tatics over late game strategies. Also, unfathomable gaps exist between difficult levels (easy being almost braindead, and normal being infuriatingly hard.)\n- Barebones diplomacy system.\n- The base game its all about domination. Mre options are availible with DLC, but I would advise rushing to buy something if you don't know whether or not its right for you.\n- Cities lack much thematic diversity, are like the diplomatic system are more barebone.\n- No "just one more turn" button.\n\nI give Age of Wonders 3 a 9/10. Its pros outweigh almost all of its cons, and with a more in depth diplomacy system and optional post victory gameplay, it could easily have earned a 10/10 from me.","February 27","true","153.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have been a follower of the Heroes of Might and Magic series since the beginning. Developers at the Heroes camp need to take a page out of this book and use it. The biggest thing I like about this game is the option to ally with either a human or AI opponent and then play on whatever map you like. There are no restrictions to this at all. Just like in Civ games where all the options are open and you create the game for how you want to play. Same thing here. Being able to go around the map with your hero and its accompanied army just seeking out riches and enemy armies is so cool. Also your allies can travel with you and go into battle with you. First time I have ever seen that implemented into a game before. Juat imagine taking on a enemy faction along with your buddy online or hotseat taking on whatever came your way. Casting spells and supporting each other. This game does it right. I recommend to anyone this series of games. Plus two huge dlc addons available as well.

A wonderful game for fantasy turn-based strategy gamers.  A rich fantasy world on the strategy map, plus a rich turn-based tactical combat.  It has a feeling of high quality throughout.  As I write this it is version 1.704 with two expansions, so there has been a lot of polishing.  There is sufficient richness to keep it totally aborbing at both the strategic map and tactical map levels.  I always get the "I want to take one more turn" feeling from this game.  It's like living in a rich fantasy world of the imagination.  I like this type of game more than the strategic map only games such as Fallen Enchantress, Sorcerer King, or Endless Legend.  I respect those games, but I find I spend my time playing this one.  A nice tutorial campaign and a searchable tome of knowledge make this game accessible to new  players such as myself.

Maybe in a future DLC or in a mod I may overlooked due to no rating there is a race or modification that allowes such a change however I would also like to see a custom race builder in the sense of Endless Space. You pick a template (aesthetics and native empire race (which would include the type of units)) and then be able to do a point buy system to create a varient race from the ground up. I wouldn't mind to see the same with classes but I understand that would be WAYYYYYY to difficult.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972411061/recommended/226840/","76561197972411061","Samantha :]","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972411061/","57 products in account","So, I played the original Age of Wonders and Age of Wonders 2, as well Shadow Magic, which was a stand alone expansion for Age of Wonders 2, so I was naturally quite interested when I heard Age of Wonders 3 was coming out. Somehow I'd managed to miss that it was even in production until about a month before it was released. Nevertheless, after starting to read about the game, I was a bit wary as some of the changes did not seem positive. However, being a fan of the series as a whole, I had to at least give it a try.\n\nSo... is Age of Wonders 3 a good game? Well, your answer to that would no doubt be influenced by whether you have played any of the previous games in the series. Having played them, I would say, yes this is a good game but, relative to its time, the game is perhaps not as good as the previous titles in the series.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Age of Wonder is a fantasy turn-based strategy, with large amounts of magic, heroes and different races. In Age of Wonders, your leader was a hero and he or she travelled about with your army, gaining levels, exploring ancient ruins and so on. For Age of Wonders 2, your hero became a wizard who spent all his or her time sitting in their tower casting spells. With Age of Wonders 3, the system has gone back to that of the original Age of Wonders (i.e. your leader being an active participant in the world) so in this sense it has been an improvement from 2.\n\nAlso the graphics are quite good and has a certain fantastical feel about it, I don't know if it's the shades and the hues, but it does feel quite vivid and rich. Also when you zoom out in the world screen, the view changes to a stylised map, as drawn on parchment, think the map of Middle-Earth, which I think looks really good.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I had with the game prior to getting it was the massive cut the number of races, now there are only six: Goblins, Orcs, Dwarfs, Humans, Draconians and High Elves. This basicaly means many of the races from AoW2 are gone: Dark Elves/Wood Elves (although there is an in-game reason why they no longer exist, basically they kissed and made up and reformed as the High Elves), Frostlings, Halflings, etc. And yes, I would say the lack of races is quite noticable. I've played just 2 levels in one of the campaigns and during that time I've captured and held cities belonging to every single race in the game except for the dwarves. Considering I've only just started the third level, it seems odd that I've nearly played as every single race already. So, yes, I suppose there is certainly much less variation than there was.\n\nOne of the ways that is suposed to reduce the imact of this lack of variation is by having small settlements belonging to 'minor races' which you can capture and then train units from other races. For example, I captured a fey settlement and was thus able to train various fey units, and construct buildings to improve them, as well as unlock different units that could be trained. I was actually quite surprised how much depth there was in this. You seem to be able to train 5-6 different units, and a fair number of buildings. I was expecting 2-3 different units at most. Nevertheless, they're still less in depth than a city from one of the main six races, and of course you can't build them.\n\nCombat is pretty much the same as the previous Age of Wonders games, and the additions with the new 3D engine are nice, for example having units consist of multiple men, the numbers of which go down as the unit gets injured.\n\nThe system regarding magic spheres is a bit different to the previous titles in the series. Essentially, each hero has three different specialisations and if you're creating your own hero you can pick three from a list. These consist of 6 different areas of magic (water, fire, air, earth, creation and destruction), expander and explorer. Because of this, you can select a minimum of one area of magic and a maximum of three. This influences what you can research and what can subsequently use. When you do create a hero, you get quite a lot of customisation options in terms of apperance. You also have a range of different classes you can select for your hero: dreadnaught, druid, sorcerer, etc. Each of these gives you at least one unique building (which may be upgradable) and unique unit, however apart from that there seems to be little differences between the different classes. Being one class or the other doesn't influence the specialisations you can select for example, and these specialisations seem to have a much greater influence over your character than what class they are.\n\nThe music in Age of Wonders 3 isn't anything special in my opinion. It's alright, but it's not amazingly noticable and there haven't been any songs I've particularly sat up and particularly enjoyed, compared to Age of Wonders 1 where there were a few songs I particularly liked, such as the March of the Halflings.\n\nPeople have reported having FPS issues, and I get them myself, but for me personally it's mostly fine, just a bit slow but certainly playable. The developers are aware of this and are currently working on fixing it.\n\nAlso, I have to comend the voice acting in Age of Wonders 3. I've only played one campaign but the voice acting for the main character from whose point of view the stoy is told is actually very good.\n\nI admit this review hasn't been the most well structured, but to conclude, I think Age of Wonders 3 is a good game, perhaps a very good game but not an excellent game, and not as good as the previous games in the series and it does have some flaws. It is certainly is screaming out for some kind of expansion/DLC just to add a bit more variation and depth. Even with the minor races you can find and recruit, six major races does seem a bit few but I certainly don't regret buying it.","July 4, 2014","true","42.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But under the cheery colourful exterior there is a very good game that, although with limitations, scratches almost all of my fantasy strategy empire building rpg itches. The RPG style Hero levelling and item system is well executed. The empire building is decent. The battles can be pretty fun and sometimes even quite challenging. The diplomacy is about as good as any other 4X game I've played and not as awful as some of them although I have yet to try to win diplomatically and so I am not sure if that is even an option. I have not played AoW 1 or 2 so I have no idea if they are better or worse than this installment but as I said, I think this one is addictive good fun.\n\nNow I feel that there is room for improvement. The late game is a bit of a boring grind; as your cities expand they all turn out a bit samey. The AI is not terrible and I have been beaten by it a few times but I wish they would actually do a bit of empire building on its own: they never build roads or forts for example. Perhaps it is better against human players but as I have no friends I have yet to experience that aspect of the game.\n\nAll in all, if you like your 4X's but feel that CIV V doesn't feature enough ogres, imps or kobold minions then you should defintiely give this title a go. Also the two first expansions are good additions that in my opinion adds a lot of essential content to the vanilla game so maybe wait for a sale to get the bundle.

This was my first experience with the Age of Wonders series, I was looking through the Steam store for something new, saw it and decided to give it a go. I didn't expect much given the usual quality of today's games but man was I surprised!\n\nHere is my pros and cons list based on my experience playing the base game, I haven't bought the expansion packs yet but I definitely plan to.\n\nPros :\n- Challenging gameplay that requires you to think ahead, as well as think quickly on your feet.\n- Good AI.\n- Wide variety of fantasy creatures to go up against, or enlist in your own army.\n- Active modding community on the Steam Workshop.\n- Beautiful visuals.\n- Large arsenal of spells, abilities, upgrades and equipment that make each Leader feel unique.\n- Nice soundtrack that does a good job of adding to the immersion.\n- A character creation system that offers a good deal of customization for this sort of game.\n- Boatloads of replayability.\n\nCons :\n- Some units and abilities seem rather imbalanced, but nothing gamebreaking.\n- Challenge can sometimes ramp up drastically.\n- Cities could use a bit more diversity, while it is possible to have a city that is specialized in performing a certain role, I haven't yet found that to be necessary and as a result all my cities have pretty much had the same buildings. I think this could have been improved by making a tech-tree for cities so you would have to decide what you want that city's main purpose to be. But, since the game is focused more on armies and combat rather than city building, this isn't a huge deal.\n- Very few visual changes on your Leaders and Heroes in regard to their equipment, the only items that change your appearance are your mount and your weapon. This is more of a personal desire and not so much something the game did wrong,  it IS a strategy game after all and would require alot of effort to implement. but still, I was a bit let down when I looted a very awesome looking helmet and chest piece only to find that it didn't affect my appearance.

Each match you'll take command of a faction, defined by your leader's race and class. There are 9 different races and 8 different classes, each very unique, and any combination of them can be formed. Furthermore, you can choose up to 3 specializations for your leader, allowing for a ridiculous amount of possibilities. The game focuses a lot on turn-based combat and exploration, akin to HOMM, but improves upon it on several fronts.\n\nPros:\n\n- HUGE number of unique units, heroes and spells\n- Great fantasy setting\n- Diplomacy is functional but unnecessary\n- Combat and game mechanics are easy to grasp, but deep and complex. All this complexity is hidden in a user-friendly interface, so there is no need to panic.\n- Many treasures to unlock through exploration and combat\n- Resource structures on your city domain often adds unique, important bonuses to economy or military.\n- RPG elements such as leader customization and progression through combat experience. Each unit also levels up and may gain new abilities.\n- Factions are very balanced overall\n- AI is way above average. Not perfect, but very good compared to other games\n- The world is beautiful and detailed. Graphics are very good.\n\nCons:\n\n- Multiplayer isn't so good. It lacks dynamism.\n- Higher difficulty AI receives resource bonuses rather than greater skill.\n- Some elements of the interface could be improved, such as managing your active spells.\n- Procedural map generators often create odd maps, with several different biomes not spread out in a logical way.

Bought it because another game I wanted to purchase got bad reviews and doest not seem to have been fixed.  I like the mix of city/empire building, the numerous options for heroes, and the strategic combat in this game.   There is also a reasonable amount of user created content that is easy to install and manage within the game.  The campaigns are fun and the random map generator has made some fun maps.

There more death the more powerful a nacromancer.\n\nThe presentation of the game is very good and very polished.\nThe single player campaign is a bit lacking, as the random map mode is where this game shines (similar to Civilization 5).\nUnlike Civilization series, Age of Wonders 3 focus on combat in a tatical map.\nThe tatical maps are very detailed and reflect the tiles of the strategic map that the units were on.\nUnits have many abilities.  Player can also have hero units with RPG upgrade elements.\n\nThere are only very basic diplomacy and empire building, but the battle is where this game produce the most enjoyment.\nThe DLCs are also very wonderful and included new races to play that really expanded the experience of this game.\n\nIf you like high fantasy settings (dragons, trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves, kights, magic and so on), then do give this game a try.\n","May 18","true","178.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With that in mind, I'd recommend anyone looking to buy this understand what Age of Wonders is.\n\nDespite having taken some obvious Civilization inspirations in the most recent title, Age of Wonders may be a TBS, but not a '4X' title, and never essentially has been. Diplomacy is merely functional, not a true gameplay concern. Exploitation, as far as the 4-X title is concerned, is fairly shallow. Expanding has simple mechanics behind it, leaving most of the game filling the "Explore/Exterminate" gap.\n\nExcept that doesn't tell the story. This isn't a 4X title.\n\nThis game stands up to games like Elemental: Fallen Enchantress, Warlock: Master of the Arcane, Eador: Master's of the Broken World and virtually any other fantasy Turn-Based Strategy title in the past 5, 6 or more years and presents in it a wholly more clean, professional, beautiful and, most importantly, long-lasting light. A genuine, long duo of campaigns that are story-driven and contain wide numbers of missions, an in-depth hero/leader customization options, wide variety of 'factions' by mix-and-matching Race and Class 'templates' to your own tastes and fantastic level design leaves this as a game that you can play, again and again and again again, and never grow tired, from what I've seen - much like the Age of Wonders of Old.\n\nOf course, with that in mind, if you don't want to spend $40 on a title in this genre, then I do have an alternative recommendation. Buy Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic, or even the Wizards Throne - even the ORIGINAL if you don't mind a more '90s' videogame in this genre, all of them on Steam. They're cheaper, and if you enjoy what those games has to offer you'll love this, as a very, very worthy revival.\n\nTO AGE OF WONDERS FANS:\n\nAge of Wonders 3 adds in some new mechanics that you may or may not find off-putting, but ultimately it takes a lot of the best features of Age of Wonders 1 and 2/Shadow Magic and combines them, while generally also creating a much more balanced game than the previous two - the unstoppable heroes/leaders and the sheer inability to fight high-tier creatures except with high-tier creatures of your own, most notably.\n\n"Weaker" units, as long as they're in number, have more relevance than they used to even later into the game, and the city progression, while not nearly as intuitive, has more specialization options and potential building plans than before. Combat is very similar to Shadow Magic or the Wizards Throne, but more in-depth, including additional mechanics such as how wall climbing is to work, certain non-wall terrain that can be damaged, and a PHENOMENAL "flanking" and "defense" system and a less-exploitable action/move system.\n\nI am not far enough into the game to have strong opinions on the campaign, particularly in terms of story; they've changed the themes somewhat from the earlier games, and I'm not convinced the character quality is as high, but it has some nice level design and, at the early levels, gives you a few legitimately different approaches to the same overall goal, and rewards a fair amount of exploration if you choose to take it - much like some of the better Shadow Magic campaign missions.\n\nA fantastic, fantastic game, and I urge people to give it, or even the older games in the series, a try. Even Shadow Magic, back about ten years ago, ran rings around the poorly-designed Elemental games of the modern age (Even LOOKED better, somehow) and had a way more satisying spell and combat system than, say, Warlock: Master of the Arcane.","April 2, 2014","true","180.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrsWarboys/recommended/226840/","MrsWarboys","Warboys","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrsWarboys/","266 products in account","TLDR: 7.5/10\nIt's very good but there are so many things that drive me mad that I can't honestly say it's a classic\n\nAge of Wonders is basically what Heroes of Might & Magic should have become after the countless crapfest sequels that didn't try anything new. The game has a wonderful tactical combat system that puts most regular tactical combat games to shame, it's really exciting and there are so many cool abilities and spells to use. Overall there's a lot of content (I'm just reviewing the vanilla game) and plenty of variety for a good 1-2 playthroughs of each Class.\n\nThe downsides? Well like most 4X style games, it doesn't handle scale well. The economy is super simple and isn't the focus of the game (unlike Civ V for example), so it falls into the trap of "I don't ♥♥♥♥ing care about these 6 cities I've built". I know I should care, and I need to care in the late game... it's just too much tedious management with very little impact on your game as a whole, especially compared to the early game. Likewise for armies. You start with 1x 6-unit army, including your hero, and have nice little skirmishes. Then you get Hero after Hero with army after army and before you know it you've got 10 armies you have to manage and fight with. It's just too much and I find the turns take so long and the decisions become so diluted down that I quit most games once I've killed my main rival. It's a pain to finish an Age of Wonders game.\n\nMinor gripes;  Bone Dragon independent parties flying around from outside the fog of war and destroying your entire army isn't fun. It spams you with 'This hero wants to join' every ♥♥♥♥ing turn, which is soooo god damn time consuming over the course of a 100-200 turn game. Furthermore, the extra heroes you get are very sub-standard and some, like the Dreadnaught, are basically useless as you lack the Class buildings for your cities to get any of the units that Hero would need. Auto-Combat is sometimes a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, killing dudes that obviously wouldn't have died if you'd done manual combat... then again, the combat does take so long that you find yourself using Auto for most situations that aren't an 18vs18 city siege.\n\nTiny gripes which might be my fault for sucking? I find the whole economy and tech side of the game a little shallow. It seems that for most classes it's all about just getting as many Shadow Stalkers or Eldrich Horrors as you possibly can, removing any unit diversity and relegating most units to the 'useless leagues'. The game does do a good job of keeping diversity high into the mid-game, but end-game it's just dull. Also that Call of the Wild spell that summons 3 beasts every ♥♥♥♥ing round is so stupidly good, ♥♥♥♥ dat ♥♥♥♥!","October 3, 2015","true","39.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I found it enjoyable that the Age of Wonders series brings you to this hex-based tactical view, though the previous games were heavily reliant on a random number generator, which can sometimes have your entire starting party be killed by 2 starting units.\n\nAge of Wonders 3 throws the random number generator out the window, meaning that defense/resistance actually reduces physical and magic damage. Additionally, line of sight and range penalties act as damage reductions, rather than giving ranged weapons a chance of missing entirely. Personally, i find that it's really nice that combat is no longer reliant on an in-game RNG, although I'm probably saying that because I've lost an entire party to 2 goblin militia units in Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic.\n\nAnd finally, the initial set-up (I probably should've started from here). Compared to Age of Wonders 1, it's somewhat simplified in the sense that you can't allocate your starting stats (I think this was done to prevent abuse, since you can pretty much start with 2-3 types of elemental melee damage), although this is more or less offset by the ability to choose your leader's race and class, which I felt is pretty fun to play around with.\n\nOverall, I find that Age of Wonders 3 is an awesome game for those who enjoy fantasy turn-based strategy games.","July 1, 2014","true","263.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some pros and cons so far:\n\nPros:\nEasy to learn, tutorial pages are fairly informative and not intrusive if you hate having to go through tutorials that either are too long or too detailed...or the reverse.\n\nFantasy setting is fairly straight forward (elves vs. orcs in basic campaign with human scum everywhere) but engaging storytelling and voice acting works well\n\nTurn-based design is very comfortable if you've played this type of game in the past\n\nCons:\nMore than possible to wall yourself in a corner by accident (sort of comes with the turf though)\n\nAutosave will occasionally save right before a move you really wish you hadn't taken (so save often)\n\nYMV on this but I have found on occasion that I think I'm clicking to attack one troop and get another by accident. Not sure its a game issue or operator error (probably the latter)\n\nAnyway so far a 9/10 for me would get 1 more point if the fantasy elements were more exotic and interesting but otherwise quite easy and enjoyable to get into while being challenging to overcome.

It preserves all the things that made AoW a good series so far, but it improves all the things that weren't great about previous games. The quests idea was just an annoyance in AoW2, and in this game it works far better. They are not compulsory but if you do them they improve your relations with one of the races on the map, and if they end up liking you, they will give you tributes of money or units from time to time. So quests are now worthwhile and useful. The also improved the way research works and the progression of your characters. You can no longer slide a bar to select how much goes towards research or mana, because that was exploitable. Now your mana and research are fixed and you cast spells or research stuff over a set number of turns, and you can improve this by having buildings produce extra mana or research on one of their turns. The result is that hero upgrades and research comes more gradually and steadily over the whole game, without big spikes that make things too easy.\n\nAlso experience is split amongst a whole army fighting, and the amount of points to increase certain things on a hero will increase if you keep focusing on it. So you will have enough points to make a well rounded hero, but you wont have enough to add +50 to the few things that could make them godlike in previous games.\n\nThere are other improvements too, but basically it feels like AoW 2 did but with everything refined to work properly as it should, and not like hastily added features. It also has great music and the graphics are improved too. Overall, it is a true sequel to AoW 1 and 2. It gives stuff we missed from AoW1 like a wider range of skills for heroes and more interesting upgrades for them, and it has better underground play too like AoW1. But it also has features from AoW2 like quests and better world magic, it just does them better now.\n\nGreat game.","April 23, 2015","true","29.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I found it enjoyable that the Age of Wonders series brings you to this hex-based tactical view, though the previous games were heavily reliant on a random number generator, which can sometimes have your entire starting party be killed by 2 starting units.\n\nAge of Wonders 3 throws the random number generator out the window, meaning that defense/resistance actually reduces physical and magic damage. Additionally, line of sight and range penalties act as damage reductions, rather than giving ranged weapons a chance of missing entirely. Personally, i find that it's really nice that combat is no longer reliant on an in-game RNG, although I'm probably saying that because I've lost an entire party to 2 goblin militia units in Age of Wonders: Shadow Magic.\n\nAnd finally, the initial set-up (I probably should've started from here). Compared to Age of Wonders 1, it's somewhat simplified in the sense that you can't allocate your starting stats (I think this was done to prevent abuse, since you can pretty much start with 2-3 types of elemental melee damage), although this is more or less offset by the ability to choose your leader's race and class, which I felt is pretty fun to play around with.\n\nOverall, I find that Age of Wonders 3 is an awesome game for those who enjoy fantasy turn-based strategy games.","July 1, 2014","true","263.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's no penalty to playing the good guy, so you'll pretty much always gravitate towards a Pure Good alignment unless you make a deliberate effort to be evil, and since there are distinct penalties for playing the bad guy you end up gimping yourself in the progress.\n\n- While the move to 3D certainly improved animation quality, some models (especially flying creatures) are just plain hideous to look at. I have absolutely no idea what they were trying to achieve with the gryphon, for example :P.\n\n- The loss of many staple races is a bit of a pain, although the new class-based units do help to put some of the variety back in.\n\n- Speaking of that, some things about the race/class system aren't exactly explained very well. Class units of different races do have noticably different stats, which is something you're left to find out for yourself (hint: elves, as usual, do very well with any kind of ranged attack).\n\n- And finally, there's a certain amount of interface clunkiness going on. No major showstoppers, but a lot of minor things that'll get a little annoying over time.\n\n\n\nSo...what makes this worth buying despite the flaws I just outlined?\n\n- A solid TBS experience with RPG elements.\n- A fun, if somewhat cliché'd setting.\n- Amazing music.\n- Elven musketeers.\n- The classes really do offer vastly different playstyles. If you try the approach you won with as a Warlord with an Archdruid character, you will probably fail pretty hard.\n- Character traits make a huge difference in playstyle as well.\n- Goblin angels.\n- Random map generator with good fine-tuning options provides long-term replayability.\n- The series' trademark sense of humor is still around and going strong, particularly in the unit descriptions.\n\n\n\nAll in all, a very solid game despite some flaws, and probably the best of its kind out right now.\n","April 2, 2014","true","717.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have been a fan of the AoW series since 1999, and believe that this game borrows nicely from its predecessors but also introduces fantastic new features and content.\n\nThe game is very detailed, with huge amounts of units, spells and abilities (many more than the previous games). The strategic map is beautiful, has many varied features and is always different thanks to the excellent random map generator.\n\nThe tactical map is much improved, and is similarly pleasing to the eye. Units have the ability to flank, to gang up on stronger units and tie them up; these features improve this mode greatly.\n\nThe addition of classes (e.g. rogue, Sorcerer) to the existing race based system is something that some people like and others do not. The negatives say that the emphasis is clearly on class and that choice of race doesnt matter. However, the classes arguably make up for this as they bring many different units and spells. Also, Triumph have been adding changes that improve racial diversity.\n\nOne thing to mention here is that Triumph seem to want to listen to the community. Many gripes about the game when it came out have been addressed. As a company they seem to be passionate about what they do, giving the fans what they want and not being too mercenary in their approach to DLC etc.\n\nIf I had to say what was wrong with the game, there would be two minor gripes. Firstly, while sieges look visually impressive, they are all virtually the same. Every time you must attack the same shape of city wall and seeing as sieges are so common a battleground, sometimes the game can feel (slightly) monotonous for this reason.\n\nSecondly, while multiplayer (player versus player) is exciting, it can be awkward to organise games and can be very time consuming. Basic things like an in lobby chat have been left out. The community often uses house rules like 'no attacking in the first 15 seconds of the turn' and 'do not purposefully attack my stacks of units to take my adjacent stacks out of the fight'. These make perfect sense and are used for nearly all games, but it relies on player honesty. I hope that triumph addresses this in a future patch. The signs are positive as they have implemented a number of positive changes to multiplayer already. I must say that multiplayer is a lot of fun and would recommend it for those that have patience.\n\nTo sum this game up; it has a rich fantasy setting, looks fantastic, has awesome empire building features and tactical battles, and it is genuinely improving with the additions of new patches and DLC.","April 5, 2015","true","306.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","1"

From the ttrategy, tactics, and military might of the warlord, and the sneaky cunning of the rogue to the vast arcane power of the wizard and religious/moral power of the theocrat (and several other classes, alongside the necromancer soon to be released) you have access to a vast array of balanced, interesting, and flavorful classes.\n\nBalance is both already good, and improving all the time as the developers follow the approach of Adding content, and adding power rather than simply cutting content, and nerfing to improve balance, orks not strong enough? We aughta give them a new unit option, and a damage buff, not nerf everyone else. It's wonderful, and so very productive.\n\nAll in all do I feel like I got my money's worth with this purchase? I very much do, I was worried after years without a new game that this game would fail to live up to the nostalgia of AoW Shadow Magic, instead it actually improved upon it's predecessor, and captured my attentions all over again. I'd rate this game 9.5 out of 10, the highest rating of any game in my 450+ title library. If you're a fan of 4x, rpgs, or fantasy and are even remotely considering this title I give you my absolute recommendation.\n\nWell what are you waiting for? Buy it! (if you must wait for a sale then fine, but at any price under 30 bucks this game is just too good to pass up you owe it to yourself)","April 9, 2015","true","216.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'll be honest, I probably never had higher expectations on a computer game since I endorsed both Age of Wonders II and Shadow Magic and played them throughout an entire decade ... so after my first few games with AoW 3 I got a little disappointed. The game felt too fast, the starting race was much less significant than in the previous games and so felt the pick of the magical specilazations. Also I wasn't happy with some combat simplifications like flying units that suddenly had to land, the removal of friendly fire in ranged attacks etc ...\n\nLucky for me (and for most other AoW 3 players I'd say) Triumph Studios wouldn't be Triumph Studios if they didn't listen to their community. With each patch more and more issues the playerbase initially had with the game got fixed with the result that now with it's free 1.5 patch (and the two expansions, if you bought them) the game is very convenient to play and feels very complete content-wise - just right for another ten years of gaming time ;)\n\nWhat you shouldn't expect AoW 3 to be is a civilization clone in a fantasy setting. While in civilization the main focus always has been on the empire building and management (let's say the strategical component) with Age of Wonders it's pretty much the opposite. The tactical combat is complex, demanding and offers tons of possibilities and while I personally wouldn't have sacrificed some of the mentioned combat characteristics of the previous games, Age of Wonders 3 can compensate their absence by introducing the guard mode and flanking system.","April 17, 2015","true","295.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

If you take the last game in the series and remove things you get the new game. Smaller droops stacks, less races, less units, less unit types, weaker AI, Less spells, less spellcasting (1 per turn limit), less fantasy. Combined with a poorer less useful interface and you get a vastly sub par game.\n\nThe troop stacks have been reduced from 8 to 6 removing much of the tactical play. You now place your 6 biggest units in your stack. Flying has been removed as a feature (can be attacked by ground units) and speical abilities are resisted more often. There is no room for oddball troops in your army. Spell casting is 1 per round, even if you have multiple heroes in your army.\n\nThe interface is far less user friendly? Want click through armies without orders? Can't unless you end your turn, which leads to ending your turn while some units still haven't gone. Want to accept a diplomacy negotiation? You have click 3 screens deep instead of just saying "yes" when someone askes for 100 gold for mana swap.\n\nRaces now have all the same exact units, class units differ but classes wre wildly unbalanced.\n\nThis game needs a lot of work in a lot of places. I'd rather play AOW:SM today than this new one.

However, this game was not entertaining compared to the previous titles. Besides better graphics and a new class, the game does not have that much new content to offer. Every match I found to be repetitive and slow. In previous Age of Wonders games I found each conflict to be new and require unique different ways of playing. In this release, I find myself repeating the same tactics over and over. The story in this game is not exciting and I found myself skipping through it in both campaigns. Overall, I give this game a 5/10. Pick up AoW 2 versus this title. You'll save some money and have a better experience. All in all, this game is not worth the buy.","October 31, 2014","false","9.4"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","22","43","0","0"

However take note that the crazy A.I will constant trespass on your borders and you will be FLOODED with messages about it. there is no diplomacy option to enfore or follow up on this border thing.\n\noverall i have to say it was BORING.

Having a chance to play every race and class, there seem to be perhaps the need for a few minor balancing issues.  Most of the main concerns are already underway in future patch releases.  Minor bugs exist, but nothing game-breaking from what I have seen.  The ONLY downside so far is the inability to connect directly to play with a friend.  Fiddling with the router/port forwarding, etc may be necessary to play across their servers in multiplayer.\n\nThis game gives more versatility than any of the previous games with the class/race system.  It stays simplified and is quick to pick up if having played previous games.  One new difference is the DOMAIN feature.  It sure saves from scrambling for nodes!\n\nFor those who have not played any of the previous games in this series, it is a turn-based tactical game.

But on steroids, heroin, crack, coke, meth, PCP, LSD, Acid, and even Ecstasy. No weed though. Because there is NO RELAXATION IN THIS GAME! ONLY FUN. ALL. THE.

I think it has an addiction."\nWell, my response is this: Yes. It does have an addiction. AN ADDICTION TO BEING AWESOME! Playing it is like being constantly whipping around a violent wave of addiction and shoving a spike covered molten rod of gold and for some reason diamond up your a**!

This allows leveling up for the units to improve their efficiency in combat, which makes you think twice before sacrificing a unit in a battle to gain a momentary advantage over AI. Due to leveling up, it's possible to even beat down a dragon in a combat by using a single assassin.\n\nWhile empire building is not its main focus, it is an essential part of AoW 3 due to unit upkeep costs and expensive buildings and units. The game has adopted several elements from Civilization games, such as happiness, which has significant effects on economy and science. Diplomacy is also an important factor: I've only played two random map games, but they both ended in my win through allied victory.\n\nDespite AoW 3 contains only six different races, there is much replay value due to leader class system. There are six different leader classes, which determine which special units your cities may produce. So far, I've only played Rogue and Dreadnought, but they felt balanced relative to each other.\n\nThe biggest concern for me are the lame effects of artifacts in the game. Even the artifacts hyped as 'legendary' seldom have impressive effects on the hero or the units in hero's army.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is mainly focused on spectacular tactical battles and role playing in a fantasy world, and secondarily on empire building. Well worth the €22.49 I paid.","January 2, 2015","true","56.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This addition to the series improved quite a few things but it did leave out a few things that just made the first game so fun. The combat has improved a lot throughout the series and obviously so has the graphics. Diplomacy in this game is there but it is very basic. Some things though I did not enjoy were that the races seem very similar besides their appearance. In the previous games units and spells were based on the races but in this game it is the class.

I believe it's at the moment that you start to think of the current version, rather than its predecessors, as definitive of the series.\n\nWith update 1.5 (still beta as it is) AOWIII has now reached that stage.\n\nLet me give you an example.\n\nI am a sorceror-dwarf playing on the far right of the map, and peaceful with my immediate neighbors.  Voraditius the Theocrat is on the far left and quickly disposes of his Orc-Warlord neighbour, then declares war on me. This is at about turn 60, so both sides have top-level units available. We both decide - that's the correct expression, I'm sure -  to conduct reconnaissances in force on each other's territory.  I drop a couple of Horrors into my defending stack and see his raiders off handily. It's what happens at the other end of the map that is so brilliant. Bear in mind that I'm adding a Horror to my invaders each other turn, or a erpent each turn If I run low on troops, plus various gold conventional troops totalling two stacks. at the outset.\n\nVoraditius plays like Napoleon.\n\nAttack his towns? Those anaemic looking defennders turn out to be backed up with the power of Shrine of Animation, which brings back my own troops as undead on his team. Ignominious defeat.\n\nProbe for weaknesses? He concentrates his stacks with diabolical ingenuity and sends me packing with heavy losses.\n\nI send another hero with a stack of Naga units. Same thing happens - Immobilisation is killing me. Eventually I have to rethink and send the right units and heroes to tackle the Napocrat and his omnipotent Shrines of Smiting.\n\nIt helps to sac units to distract his armies to positions where they can be picked off. I'm also sending futher troops (giants and siege equipment to tackle the walls, which I should probably have done at the start). I catch Voraditius the little Corsican in the open and send him to the void for a couple of turns, during which I can run riot, Black Prince style. At last we face other in a huge Waterloo-type battle where I have only 3 units left at the end. Voraditius capitulates. Pure Turing - no way of telling he was 'just' an AI opponent.\n\nOnly one issue; Another opponent kept declaring war on Voraditius even after he was defeated. Entirely understandable, but a little strange.\n\nAll this in simple a random scenario. Ten thumbs up - a new classic is born.\n\n\n\n","March 18, 2015","true","671.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I am mainly writing to respond to criticisms that the game lacks depth, which initially made me hestitant about the game. The sale price of 19.99 USD tipped the scales in favor of the game (I was also considering Solar Empire and Endless Space). I'm glad the sale was going on because so far this is a great purchase. For a pure 4x game, I could see a lack of depth. However, this game is a hybrid between a 4x and RPG. I find RPGs too shallow to hold my interest, but the RPG elements here add a facet to this game that I haven't seen in other 4x games. The fact that it's unique makes it interesting. True...the research tree is anemic, but I have a lot of fun learning the spells, which have a fresh and dynamic affect on every aspect of the gaming experience. But to me, the RPG-style battle engine is what takes this to the next level. It is somewhat complex and very engaging, and mixed with more traditional 4x aspects, AOW III provides a nice experience that has kept my interest through that crucial first 24 hours. It also helps that the gameplay is smooth and intuitive, and the graphics are beautiful. So far, this is my favorite purchase since Civ V. One note is that I did have a crash. However, this was after a 14-hour session.","September 21, 2014","true","27.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was the game I was looking for after being disappointed by Fallen Enchantress : Legendary Heroes.  The tactical combat in this game is much better with varying terrain and destroyable obstacles.\n\nIf you are a fan of Master of Magic, then you will probably like this.  I have just started the game so I have not seen all the features/limitations but overall it is a really good game and is actually worth full price, altho it is a bit expensive at 43$, but it is still worth it. The game is also integrated with Steam Workshop so user made maps are easily obtainable.\n\n\nedit: I also have come to find out that this game is gets regular updates that even bring in some new game mechanics and it also has to original expansion packs, not just dlc.  The same thing about updates and expansions can definatly not be said for Fallen Enchantress : Legendary Heroes.\n\nEdit: Despite looking much better than Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes, this game is better optimized and coded and doesn't suffer from any stuttering whatsoever\n\nI can't stress how much better this game is over FE: LH.  These people did a much better job than those people.\n\n\nThis game is always challenging and keeps getting better and more enjoyable for me as I become a better player.

But I decided to get his and I have to say, I don't feel bad. Endless Legend seems to put more focus into the campign map, which there is nothing wrong with, and I like the way their map is made and layed out into provinces / territories and all of that, but than this game, THIS GAME ROCKS!\n\nPeople complain about it being to balanced, but wtf do you want? One side to totally smash every other side, WELL GUESS WHAT GENIUS? EVERYONE WOULD PICK DWARVES EVERYROUND IF THAT WERE THE CASE! I am glad that the devs decided to balance it out evenly for the factions! I don't want to be a midget after all! No offence to midgets. Instead the game gives you different classes to choose from, so you could an Elven Engineer. Completely unlikely to happen in Dungeons and Dragons but who gives a darn? You can customize your character, heck you can customize the enemy!\n\nAlso a great feature is the battles, unlike in Civ or any of those games when your army attacks an enemy army you actually control individual units in a kinda like Total War but still Turn Based battle. The map can be customized ALOT. You can even make your own Map / Scenario, AND YOU CAN SCRIPT ANYTHING IN THAT MAP USING LUA! Awesome right?\n\nYou also have cool units called heros that you can recruit / hire when they pop at your door. Think of like a mix of Mount and Blades / Warcraft / Civilization.\n\nThe graphics are GREAT for a Turn Based game, the only other two I know of would be Civ V which uses sprites I think and Endless Legend. Endless Legend is more unique story (COMES FROM THE ENDLESS FRANCHISE WHICH EACH GAME FOLLOWS SAME UNIVERSE) and has better campign map but doesnt have battles. Of the three Endless Legend and Age of Wonders from what I can tell are about equally as good depending on your personal preferance. Also to wrap things up I have to mention that lots of people say "All you do is fight, fight, fight." Which is true but they are adding a new win condition in a Free DLC or something (Maybe an update) that allows a non PVP victory, even though chances are, you still will go to war at some point. Thats realistic though, cause when have people stopped fighting??\n\nSo all in all, GREAT GAME!

It's one of those games that I got on sale but wouldn't have been upset if I paid full price.\n\nAt first I was a little disappointed, there only seemed to be two campaigns. The high elves and the dwarfs, but you pick up other companions who help you and than you play their part of the campaign.   Example, first you play as a rouge Elf, but you quickly pick up a Draccon. When that part of the campaign is over it starts off as the Draccon in charge, but your high elf is still one of the leaders.\n\nAgain I was little disappointed because the first part of the campaign was long, so I figured it was over. Nope! As I said another character steps in and they become the primary champ.\n\nI'm 15 hours plus on the second part of the campaign, I had to restart a few times. It can be a little trial by era but once you learn (and this goes into the actually strategy of the game) you know the most expensive units may not be your best.\n\nYour main champs level up, but only to a certain point per campaign as well as your units but they don't carry over to the next stage of the campaign.  Basically your starting from scratch just your Champs keep their ability points and gear you might find.\n\nThe AI isn't stupid, the game has a auto match feature for annoying little battles which I didn't think I would use. Even if your likely to defeated you can pull off a win if your in a castle and play smart, and use your units properly and cast the right spells. However there are times where you have no chance in hell of winning and your goal becomes to hurt and kill your attacker as much as possible, so you can send in another force and destroy them but having a major champ in the game can cause one big bust which means you have to restart or have a back up save.\n\nThe storyline is rather weak but I'm okay with that, you get a big explanation in the start but your goal isn't always clear. Best advice is build up your money and mana before going to war if no one is attacking you. A lot of the towns you start will be useless besides for their money and mana benefits.  Basically you want to create a choke point and produce your troops from only a few locations. With that said some units take up money and mana every round so plan ahead. You can go through 20 turns with nothing really happening if you don't want it to.\n","January 9, 2015","true","169.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandmaenchen/recommended/226840/","sandmaenchen","Sandmänchen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sandmaenchen/","194 products in account","Age of Wonders III is about empire building like Civilization and Age of Empires games, turn-based tactical battles like Heroes of Might and Magic and King's Bounty, and role playing.\n\nWhat I find really attractive in AoW 3 is the importance of combat experience: in addition to heroes, other units gain experience points as well by interacting in the battle. This allows leveling up for the units to improve their efficiency in combat, which makes you think twice before sacrificing a unit in a battle to gain a momentary advantage over AI. Due to leveling up, it's possible to even beat down a dragon in a combat by using a single assassin.\n\nWhile empire building is not its main focus, it is an essential part of AoW 3 due to unit upkeep costs and expensive buildings and units. The game has adopted several elements from Civilization games, such as happiness, which has significant effects on economy and science. Diplomacy is also an important factor: I've only played two random map games, but they both ended in my win through allied victory.\n\nDespite AoW 3 contains only six different races, there is much replay value due to leader class system. There are six different leader classes, which determine which special units your cities may produce. So far, I've only played Rogue and Dreadnought, but they felt balanced relative to each other.\n\nThe biggest concern for me are the lame effects of artifacts in the game. Even the artifacts hyped as 'legendary' seldom have impressive effects on the hero or the units in hero's army.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is mainly focused on spectacular tactical battles and role playing in a fantasy world, and secondarily on empire building. Well worth the €22.49 I paid.","January 2, 2015","true","56.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The differences between the factions/races are not as different as they were in AoW2, so really doesn't matter too much which side you choose. The jumps between difficulty levels seems a little excessive too.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good game, and those who are new to it or enjoy the AoW series and others such as Heroes of Might and Magic or Kings Bounty will enjoy this too, but  after the first campaign is completed you may think twice about starting the second one so the longevity of this game is affected (in my opinion).

Especially the promise that a Play by Email function would be included, made all of us pre-buy it before it came out.\n\nSo what did we get?\nWe got an absolutely stunning turn-based game, that takes a lot of the best that all games before it had. It has this feeling of immersion that makes you want to play again and again.\nNotice that I say "a lot of the best", because it is not perfect... Yet. I'll tell you a bit about why it will be.\n\nMulti-player.\nThe online multiplayer is easy and very solid, compared to most other games. Of course, since it takes a lot of time to play a Age of Wonders III game, having several people being connected for days will eventually experience drop-outs. Getting back up unfortunately requires a full re-load and reconnect, but nothing is lost when it happens.\nTriumph has been promising us a Play be Email function since before the game came out, and it should be very close to release. When it does, multi-player games will explode in number. And to top it off, Triumph has already described some details that might make this the easiest to use PBEM function ever. You always have problems with who has the turn, but Triumph might be able to fix that problem, which I believe would be first and best in gaming history. It would be... Perfect.\n\nTactical combat\nNot much to say. It has never been done better. Every tactical battle can be approached differently, and the troops you bring to the combat changes everything. Oh, and sound and video is beautiful and interesting. AOWIII tactical is just... Perfect.\n\nDepth and content\nWhen the game released, although it was beautiful and the engine worked very well, felt like a dumbed-down version of AOW: Shadow Magic. Fewer races, the items on the map felt the same, and every game played more or less the same with an off-balanced strategy, that could win all games, so everyone did just that.\nBut it's Triumph, guys!: For every patch, DLC, upgrade and whatever they decide to call it, the game has become richer and funnier to play. The new game function of having treasure sites making specific troops types better (like a mithril source in Master of Magic) makes every city a possible specialist city to be nurtured and defended. With new races, classes, treasure huts, and stuff springing up continually, this game seems like a friendship that grows for every expansion. With the ideas already on Triumphs existing idea list, when it comes to depth and content, all these guys have to do is show up for work, and this game will be... Perfect.\n\nReplaybility\nLet's face it. Every game gets old at some point. Only a few games stand out and goes into history as "the game we played for ages". What was it that made Shadow Magic better than AOW vanilla, Fall from Heaven better than Civ 4 vanilla? Every game played out differently. Why is it that most people only plays CIV5 and CIV:Beyond Earth for a few weeks and then move on? Because every game basically plays out the same.\nAOWIII is at risk here.\nThe classes of AOWIII is the distinguishing part that does not make every game bland, but will it be enough? Fall from Heaven changed CIV4 with the interesting notion of going from "research everything" to "You can only afford one way through the research tree, so choose the path that plays well with what you have found in this particular game". And it changed everything. The research tree of AOWIII has few differences based on magical affinity, but a Tier II summon basically does the same, cost the same, and appear at the same time. There's not that much strategy, and you will typically choose the same spell strategy every time.\nCities are almost entirely the same, races don't alter things much. A bit has already been done there, giving the races racial traits. For instance, the bard is equipped with a bow. But a High Elf Bard now has a Longbow, which makes all the difference. But the other races? It's much the same. All cities function, all cities gives basically the same amount of resources. In Shadow Magic, I found myself changing populations several times a game: Only two races could grow the essential crops in shadow world, so better make it one of those. Some races had alignments that made them impossible to hold unless you did something, Cities could be physically moved away from a lost area, if you repopulated it with nomads. Elf cities hid themselves behind trees. You had choices. In AOWIII every race will join you without too much trouble and the cities are basically the same. Alignment doesn't really play a role, although the mechanic is there.\nThe general feeling is a well-known one: The new school game developers are scared about alienating the impatient youths that nothing in the game must be frustrating. Only problem is, turnbased games are too slow to hold impatient players anyways, so trying to cater for everyone just makes the game bland, instead of making possibilities soar. If you have ever played 100+ multiplayer rounds of the same game, you know that when you stop being able to surprise your opponents, you are ready to move on.\nIf, however, the developers should go all in on making things feel... different... then this game already has everything needed in place. In fact, with increased replayability, some of it already in the pipeline, this game has the potential to go from great to... absolutely perfect.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to every turn-based strategy gamer out there.","December 24, 2014","true","929.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It slows gameplay in multiplayer down considerably and manages to be a huge pain in the rear while you wait for everything to happen. Suggestion: play in borderless windowed mode and occupy yourself between turns.\n- An idiotic launcher login system with a truly godawful backend (read: no username change support short of e-mailing technical support and no registering a new account to get past that because, alas the game is linked to your Steam account).

Especially the promise that a Play by Email function would be included, made all of us pre-buy it before it came out.\n\nSo what did we get?\nWe got an absolutely stunning turn-based game, that takes a lot of the best that all games before it had. It has this feeling of immersion that makes you want to play again and again.\nNotice that I say "a lot of the best", because it is not perfect... Yet. I'll tell you a bit about why it will be.\n\nMulti-player.\nThe online multiplayer is easy and very solid, compared to most other games. Of course, since it takes a lot of time to play a Age of Wonders III game, having several people being connected for days will eventually experience drop-outs. Getting back up unfortunately requires a full re-load and reconnect, but nothing is lost when it happens.\nTriumph has been promising us a Play be Email function since before the game came out, and it should be very close to release. When it does, multi-player games will explode in number. And to top it off, Triumph has already described some details that might make this the easiest to use PBEM function ever. You always have problems with who has the turn, but Triumph might be able to fix that problem, which I believe would be first and best in gaming history. It would be... Perfect.\n\nTactical combat\nNot much to say. It has never been done better. Every tactical battle can be approached differently, and the troops you bring to the combat changes everything. Oh, and sound and video is beautiful and interesting. AOWIII tactical is just... Perfect.\n\nDepth and content\nWhen the game released, although it was beautiful and the engine worked very well, felt like a dumbed-down version of AOW: Shadow Magic. Fewer races, the items on the map felt the same, and every game played more or less the same with an off-balanced strategy, that could win all games, so everyone did just that.\nBut it's Triumph, guys!: For every patch, DLC, upgrade and whatever they decide to call it, the game has become richer and funnier to play. The new game function of having treasure sites making specific troops types better (like a mithril source in Master of Magic) makes every city a possible specialist city to be nurtured and defended. With new races, classes, treasure huts, and stuff springing up continually, this game seems like a friendship that grows for every expansion. With the ideas already on Triumphs existing idea list, when it comes to depth and content, all these guys have to do is show up for work, and this game will be... Perfect.\n\nReplaybility\nLet's face it. Every game gets old at some point. Only a few games stand out and goes into history as "the game we played for ages". What was it that made Shadow Magic better than AOW vanilla, Fall from Heaven better than Civ 4 vanilla? Every game played out differently. Why is it that most people only plays CIV5 and CIV:Beyond Earth for a few weeks and then move on? Because every game basically plays out the same.\nAOWIII is at risk here.\nThe classes of AOWIII is the distinguishing part that does not make every game bland, but will it be enough? Fall from Heaven changed CIV4 with the interesting notion of going from "research everything" to "You can only afford one way through the research tree, so choose the path that plays well with what you have found in this particular game". And it changed everything. The research tree of AOWIII has few differences based on magical affinity, but a Tier II summon basically does the same, cost the same, and appear at the same time. There's not that much strategy, and you will typically choose the same spell strategy every time.\nCities are almost entirely the same, races don't alter things much. A bit has already been done there, giving the races racial traits. For instance, the bard is equipped with a bow. But a High Elf Bard now has a Longbow, which makes all the difference. But the other races? It's much the same. All cities function, all cities gives basically the same amount of resources. In Shadow Magic, I found myself changing populations several times a game: Only two races could grow the essential crops in shadow world, so better make it one of those. Some races had alignments that made them impossible to hold unless you did something, Cities could be physically moved away from a lost area, if you repopulated it with nomads. Elf cities hid themselves behind trees. You had choices. In AOWIII every race will join you without too much trouble and the cities are basically the same. Alignment doesn't really play a role, although the mechanic is there.\nThe general feeling is a well-known one: The new school game developers are scared about alienating the impatient youths that nothing in the game must be frustrating. Only problem is, turnbased games are too slow to hold impatient players anyways, so trying to cater for everyone just makes the game bland, instead of making possibilities soar. If you have ever played 100+ multiplayer rounds of the same game, you know that when you stop being able to surprise your opponents, you are ready to move on.\nIf, however, the developers should go all in on making things feel... different... then this game already has everything needed in place. In fact, with increased replayability, some of it already in the pipeline, this game has the potential to go from great to... absolutely perfect.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to every turn-based strategy gamer out there.","December 24, 2014","true","929.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's amazing for playing with friends, whether you want to team up or go at it hammer and tongs.  Turns can take quite a while, but the game's very intuitive and well-designed.  I often forget that this is a 4x game: the depth and strategy is there, but the usual confusing complexity that accompanies it is not.  Finally, the ability to choose/create your own hero class and abilities is really fun.  Each time you pick a new class or ability, your playstyle will change dramatically, and in interesting ways.  Overall, this is currently my favorite 4x game, and one of my favorite strategy games of all time.","December 23, 2014","true","71.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a great genre for fans of strategy. After playing hours upon hours of civ 4,  a few of the total war games, warlock 2,  civ 5, then finally beyond earth, I started to get a bit bored on basic science and diplomatic based victories because I just didn't like combat in civ. I picked up Age of Wonders 3 during the past sale, and I'm really enjoying myself. Compared to civ, elements like the way tech and buildings worked took a bit to get used to, but i'm really starting to fall in love with the game. It combines the grand 4x strategy of civ, with a much better combat system similar to what you would see in a hex based strategy game like might and magic, and I feel the fusion was extremely well done. I'm doing something I haven't done in a strategy game like this in a long time, and that is seek out combat. I love the feeling of flanking opponents for massive damage, just to realize I left a commander unguarded and having to wait a few turns before it respawns, and having to build up armies again. I'm still in the middle of my first game, but I can forsee many more in my future, and would recommend this to my civ loving friends out there, especially if you're getting sick of boring combat. 9/10","December 3, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not just the heroes, but each individual military unit will have their own RPG-style stats with strengths and weaknesses and even crazier promotions than you could possibly imagine (my favorite so far is getting a flying, flame-breathing dragon mount for my leader and handing the horse off to another general)\n\nIn the war of 4X, I've seen a lot of games rise to the occasion, and a lot more of them fall flat but this one takes the cake.","November 29, 2014","true","8.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
