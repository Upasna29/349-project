"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bodyleakage/recommended/418610/","Bodyleakage","Bodyleakage ㋛","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bodyleakage/","738 products in account","So I'm going to break this down into categories for easy readin' n reviewin'\n\n------------------------------------------------\nGame was updated 27/01/2016. I'm using this space to update my review based on those changes. Original review is down below.\n\nThey have implemented WASD controls and have now made wall jumping a tad easier. This makes playing the game more comfortable and with the improvements to wall jumping less frustrating.\n\nFixed the music abruptly stopping after death. You can now finally hear the chill music track and I dig it.\n\nThey've implemented a level counter. A small change but it's nice to know you've completed a level.\n\nSmall introductions to new mechanics. Base game had no tips, more info about new mechanics is always welcome.\n\nUpdated score 7/10.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review:\n\nPros:\n\nPrice is on point - For such a simple game I feel they nailed the price point perfectly. If you enjoy challenging platformers, I feel you can get your £0.79 worth.\n\nIt's challenging - Not a surprise there! If you're like me and like a quick challenge there's something in here for you.\n\nSimplicity - You're a square avoiding death, it doesn't over complicate things, it knows what it is and sticks to it.\n\n25 levels - 25 doesn't seem like a lot but having spent an hour on just 6 levels I feel there's easily enough content.\n\nDevs listen - They're very open to feedback and have proven to change the game based on said feedback. Fantastic to see!\n\nCons:\n\n(Fixed as of 27/01/2016) - 1 Music track - Swiftly fails hard on the music front. I would like to say I've heard the whole track however when you die (And you will die a lot) the music instantly stops and starts from the beginning. Within just 9 minutes I hate to mute the game entirely and put on my own music! Extremely frustrating to listen to.\n\n(Improved as of 27/01/2016) - Controls - For the most part the controls are fine, so why is this in the cons section? Wall jumping. Yup. Wall jumping. Wall jumping is the most infuriating part of this game, it's not challenging, it's not fun, it's a wrestle with the controls and it sucks!\n\n\nImprovements:\n\n(Fixed as of 27/01/2016) - Don't restart music upon death, let that little sucker continue playing! The addition of 2 or 3 more music tracks would be extremely welcome.\n\n(Improved as of 27/01/2016) - Re-work wall jumping! I can't even put down in words how frustrating it is to mash up & left then quickly let go to mash up and right in the hopes it's timed correctly to achieve a wall jump. Make is so your square can stick to the walls for easier jumping or rework the whole wall jumping together!\n\nAchievements don't pop at the end of levels - They only pop once you go back to the menu.\n\n(Implemented as of 27/01/2016) - Add a level notification, I had no idea I had completed 5 levels till I exited to the menu. Once the player has moved to a new level and quick flash of level [number] would be welcomed.\n\nSimple leaderboads - Just to add a tiny bit of competitiveness to the game. Add a simple leaderboard of the top 10 fastest finishes. It's simple and could spur somebody on to beat that No.1 - adding a small amount of replay-ability.\n\n\nConlusion:\n\nIf you like quick, fun, challening levels I see no reason why you shouldn't pick this up. The game needs improvements there's no doubt about that. However, what we have now is still an enjoyable game despite some flaws. Overall I give Swiftly 6/10.","January 26","true","2.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","1"

But this game just doesn't play well at all.  I couldn't figure out what the hitboxes of the wheels were, making the game not just hard, but also annoying.  It wouldn't have been bad if I could have set my own controls.  Using the arrow keys to move is meh, I prefer AWSD, but using the up arrow to jump just makes this game unplayable.  Also the physics are st00pid.\n\nUnfortunately I can't recommend the game, despite the low price.  Save your pennies, folks!\n\n\nUPDATE:  So I was contacted to change my review in light of recent changes that have been made by the developer.\nOne thing I can give credit for is that the developer seems to care about constructive criticism and wants to improve upon what he has made and has as such implemented AWSD controls after my review.  Jumping however, is still a pain as I'd rather have a dedicated button that isn't part of my control pad.  Music doesn't restart upon death anymore, fortunately removing another layer of obnoxiousness.  Hitboxes are still eh.\n\nA small thing I forgot to mention in my first review was how the first checkpoint was stupid, because you need a run-up to do the next gauntlet, meaning you have to track back a little every time you die.  This doesn't make the game hard, just annoying.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that maybe I was too harsh at first and the game is just unfinished and needs some polish.  This game does have potential to be functional, and I'm sure the developer can do it!","January 26","false","0.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Personally all this game really needs is better indicators around the spikes because it doesnt look the spkies are killing you, its more of the air around the spikes. for the dallor i spent on it, it was totally worth.","January 30","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","7"

This is even more annoying when how you speed up and slow down is awkward and clunky. The hitbox's are also poorly designed and fustrating. There are many times you think you'll not get hit, but you end up getting hit anyway.\n\nThe jump button isn't mapped to its own button seperate for movement, so it gets awkward trying to get the right jump. Speaking of jump, it's always the same height, so it becomes stupidly difficult to get through some tight spaces, add the dumb hitbox's to that and...yeah.\n\nIt also gets stale level design as for all the jumps feel similar. Checkpoints are poorly placed and take forever to get to.

This game looked like it could be fun so I purchased it despite the bad reviews. Wthin minutes of playing this game I realized the potential it could have. Unfortunately I also realized that it was way to challenging for the first level. In fact it was more frustrating than fun. Luckily I paid way less than a $1 so I didn't loose much. I can't recommend this game because it is more frustrating than fun, especially at the very first level.","April 17","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, I tend to not take action when something is bothering me—messy roommates, a bad meal, terrible kissing—for the sake of harmony.\n\nHowever, I've been learning to speak up more often, as I should. In this case, I am finally able to muster the courage to not recommend this game.\n\nIt was cheap, and so I wanted to give it a chance, as I love platformers more than any other genre. Plus, I like the idea of trying out a game with mixed reviews, because I always try to find something redeeming about nearly everything.\n\nUnfortunately, ten minutes of this game did not provide any incentive to continue. The graphics, physics, poor hitboxes, controls, lacking sound design and the plainness (plain is different than minimal) are so unrewarding, that I did not want to waste any more time on it.","April 18","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
