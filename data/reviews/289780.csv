Not because it’s innovative in any mind-boggling way, but because it almost seems to take active measures in order to annoy you, the player, to a point of insanity. It's the small things, like the relentless gnat that just won't die no matter how much you swat at it. Requiem has perfected the fine art of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design. I played this game back in 2009, and it was horrible then as well. But I forgave it. “Work in progress” I thought. Well, nothing happened. The horrible programming, dull graphics, crappy hit detection, lag and unapologetic greed which constitutes this game hasn’t changed at all. Here are some examples of what Requiem has in store for you:\n\n1.Terrible unresponsiveness in the UI and pretty much everything else. Press a button and 3 sec later something might happen, or not.\nGood luck getting off your mount in any acceptable amount of time. The thought of PVP in this game is laughable.\n\n2. The programming is so lazy it’s an insult to programmers everywhere. If you’re a spell caster and try to kite a mob, they will simply register the coordinates for where you were when they first took damage and then move to that point like an idiot, even if you are several yards away by then. Oh yeah, and they will then telepathically hit you for full damage. Why? Because f**k you that’s why.\n\n3. PvE is about as much fun as watching bathroom mold cultivate. Bosses have ridiculous amounts of HP yet they hit like toddlers. Press auto attack then go and watch a documentary or something more constructive.\n\n4. Several skills are broken to the point that they are a waste to even invest in. The design of the skills are also made by someone who has never played an MMORPG.\n\n5. The quests are the typical “kill X amount of Y” but are spiced, like only Requiem can- with a cost of gold in order to get the scrolls needed. I’m serious. You get a couple “free” quests with every new area but you can forget using only them as way to level up. So you go to this agent NPC sow of a shill and are demanded to pay currency for more grind quests.\n\n6. Somewhere around lvl 30+ you run out of quests to do and are forced to go to this temple dump of a place called “blabla ruin”-something. When you are inside you need to farm mobs for about 20 lvls. No quests, nothing- just farming mobs over and over all while constantly being PK:ed since every ♥♥♥ on the server is there as well. Enjoy.\n\n7. Still reading? Ok then. Everything costs money, even basic stuff like mounts. You get one free, but it’s excruciatingly slow and the worlds are dead and huge. You do the math. When you get close to max lvl you are forced to buy premium. You can chose not to, and dedicate you entire life on reaching max lvl. You’ll hit the cap just in time to start enjoying your pension. And, oh yeah, if you die- you lose a big chunk of exp, and are then conveniently offered to buy an item which protects your hard earned exp from being lost at death. Convenient, right? This game is so greedy that it’s just embarrassing.\n\n8. The mobs do a full loop and at around lvl 45 you start seeing the same mobs as in the beginning of the game once more…\n\n9: It takes forever to get new sets of gear or to even change you appearance. Each class has 3 sets of hair and faces. You look like clones of each other.\n\n10: Glitchy and more or less impossible game to explore when it comes to environments, charging up a hill poses a very real risk of making you fall through the map. Game is terribly plagued by mob resets.\n\nI could go on forever but you get the idea. The sad part is that this game could actually be good. If only anyone on the developing team gave even a fraction of a sh*t. They obviously don’t and miss every shot at fixing the game. I have not the faintest clue to why it is now released on steam. It’s like throwing your sick younger cousin with chronic muscle spasms onto the stage at Let’s Dance and rubbing your hands at the thought of all the money he will make you.\n\nThe lack of commitment and care for this game is blatantly obvious, which is sad since it’s a good idea but how much are we as players expected to forgive?\n\n2/10\n\n\n\n","March 6, 2015","false","2.4"," 587 of 650 people (90%) found this review helpful 200 people found this review funny","90","587","650","200","20"

It had promise in 2008, and over the last 7 years I have seen the developers take a commited approach in destroying every last bit of promise this game may have had. Its a horrible game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelab1090/recommended/289780/","xelab1090","Mega Mane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelab1090/","119 products in account","Alright, a little bit of a warning as I'll update as I go, but, I played this game when it was known as Requiem: Bloodymare, but the game hasn't changed much (if at all at it's core) since I last played, and I wish to let others know of this game and give a detailed review for it, as others simply say "it's crap" or "play it". I won't make it too long, as you guys should play it and find out for yourself, but I'll touch upon the basics.\n\nRaces and Classes\nIn Requiem, you can choose from four races, and 2 classes with each race, each class diverging into two separate branches at a certain point, for a total of 16 different end game classes. I'll just give details on the initial classes.\n\nTuran (Humanoid, closest in similarity to Humans):\n\nDefender - Your basic sword and board tank. Utilizing quick stabbing abilities and threat generating taunts, you make sure other people in your group are not being eaten alive.\n\nTemplar - Magician that utilizes electricity and healing abilities. Did not play this class much.\n\nBartuk (Really Bulky Humanoid):\n\nWarrior - This game's berserker. You utilize a two handed weapon and slash your foes in two (sometimes quite literally. This game is gory, I'll touch up on that later.\n\nShaman - Utilizing flame abilities, you can give your own attacks flame power and add flame damage to others abilities. Didn't play this one much either.\n\nKruxena (Most similar to commonly recognized dark elves):\n\nRogue - Fast, brutal, and relentless. You shred your enemies to pieces with blindingly fast attacks(heh.). You use razor sharp claws or dual swords as this class.\n\nSoul Hunter - I never personally played this class, as it's a debuffing class. You magically curse and weaken your enemies.\n\nXenoa (Smaller elvish looking creatures that wear high heels....yep. Even the males.):\n\nHunter - You utilize a comically oversized blaster and abuse the physics engine by BLOWING your enemies away. Uses ammo and a launcher, chaining abilities. This is the only class I've played where the monsters fly away when they die from how "hard" you're hitting them, as a consequence I had the most fun and am most experienced with this class.\n\nBattlemagician - Good at combat assistance with elemental magic. Utilizing mainly short-range magic attacks and "throw" magic when at a distance. Only class I know of in a game that has an ability that lets your throw Hydrochloric ACID on your enemies.\n\n\nGameplay\nAlright, down to the interesting stuff. Depends upon how you look at it. When you first login, if it's your first character you're asked if you would like to go to the tutorial level. Don't skip it, it introduces you to the fundamentals of both your class and the game....well, mostly the game and it's controls, and it's always useful information to have. As you level you gain skill points, which you can use to "buy" skills by the tier for your class, earn enough points in one tier you unlock the next tier and so on. If you've bought all skills in a tier simply start upgrading the skills your already bought, as a couple in the top tier unlock skills on the third tier if fully upgraded.\n\nCombat is, for lack of a better word, slow. At least in the beginning. I was playing for about 15 minutes before I started to mow through enemies that were giving me trouble just two levels prior, as I was leveling and giving myself skills. You start with no skills as you level it becomes easier to chain combos and utilize the rotation for each class.\n\nQuests are the same monotonous dribble you get with the standard issue MMO, this one leaning more on the grinding side. After you get past level 15 it starts to slow WAY down, to the point where I bought a XP booster back in the day just to make it seem like I was still making progress. In a game where the max level is 81...this is a problem.\n\nThis game has special monsters that come out at certain times in the game at certain points of the game map, called Nightmare monsters. These monsters are tougher, have more health, and actually utilize abilities against you. To give you an example of difficulty scale, in a level 6-7 area you're liable to run across a level 10 nightmare creature, at level 16-18 you're liable to run into a 20-22 Nightmare creature. These monsters give A LOT more experience, and a higher chance of dropping better gear and loot. You will need a full party of eight people most typically at the higher levels to take them down.\n\nBecause this is a free to play game, it has an in-game cash shop where you can buy costumes, mounts, XP boosters(you'll need them if you don't want leveling to feel like a snail race), etc. I have not looked at the shop in depth to determine whether this game is in the "pay to win" category of free to play games.\n\nI never delved into the PvP aspect of the game so I cannot give a definitive review of it.\n\nGraphics\nThis game was released in 2008, and the aging graphics engine is starting to make that apparent as more time goes on. This is not an ugly game, but it is very blasé. When I was in my WoW slump back in '08 I looked at this game and it looked amazing. Now, with better graphics every where, it's outclassed in almost every facet. Textures are very low resolution, characters have too much bloom for my liking, and characters just look too....glossy. The environments have this drab shade of brown that just doesn't go away, even in snowy areas, it's just depressing to look at for long periods of time.\n\nOne thing that drew me to this game was the gore. There's buckets of it. When you kill an enemy their limbs fly off, blood sprays every where, and their body flies away. It gets a chuckle out of me to see it because of how exaggerated it is.\n\nFinal Verdict\nAlright, chances are you just scrolled down here, or you're getting tired of reading a wall of text. Fact of the matter is, this game couldn't "grab" me and keep my attention past a few weeks of intermittent playing.  If your experience is similar to mine, you'll find it fun for a couple weeks and you'll most likely find it boring.\n\nI never could push past the boredom to see what end-game was like, but I believe I'm equipped with enough experience to let you determine whether you want to give this game a shot. I did, I enjoyed it, it was fun, but there are just simply more fun games out there. Give this one a try, I can't speak for everyone.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 5.5/10\nPROS:\nGore coalescing with the physics is amusing, if only for a while.\nSkill and DNA system is fun\nNightmare monsters are scary to run into and amazingly rewarding to kill.\nCONS:\nGraphics are looking dated.\nQuesting is monotonous.\nCombat in the lower levels is slow.\nI got a item from the cash shop (free item spin wheel every day) and it transported me, a level 4, to an area with level 56 nightmare monsters. That's just bad design right there.","March 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 255 of 341 people (75%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","75","255","341","32","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleShyGuy/recommended/289780/","PurpleShyGuy","PurpleShyGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleShyGuy/","11 products in account","(WARNING) Long Review. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nOh man, where to start with this game. I used to be an avid player of Requiem. Myself and a few friends had great times and memories with this game, but for those who are looking to try this game out, you're in for a big surprise when you get to a point where you want to do high level PvE or PvP.\n\n---===[Upgrading Armor]===---\n\nUpgrading armor takes place in the form of Reinforcing, Compounding and Enchanting. Each peice of gear can be reinforced a total of 30 times. Each reinforcement increases the attributes on your armor. Each peice of armor also has a certain amount of enchanting slots depending on the grade (Ordinary, Supernous, Eximius, Carus, Maximus). You can even compound your own gear/enchants into stronger parts. Sounds cool, right? Here's the catch:\n\nThis is what we call "Pay to win". No, it has nothing to do with EXP boosts either. Once you get to a certain reinforcement level...say +20, you have to spend real life money to continue. Why? Because the success rate of the next reinforcement is so low, that you risk breaking the item, or going down reinforcement steps. I.e: Going from +20 to +13. So why is this a problem? Well, at low levels, it's not. But once you hit the Eximius grade, you risk breaking your items more often than reinforcing them, and it forces you to start over on that peice of gear. You don't get any of your gold or resources back when the item breaks. When you reach the Rare and Carus grade, it's almost impossible for a F2p player to go past +10 or +15. However, the person who spends a few hundred dollars can take each peice of gear to +30. When this happens, the person with all +10 gear gets steam rolled by the person with +30 gear because of the massive stat difference. This company has essentially allows people to PAY FOR ARMOR. The same applies to Enchanting as well. The players who pay the most get perfect enchants which further adds to the gap between F2P and Paying users.\n\n---===[Player Satisfaction]===---\n\nGravity used to be under the management of a Korean based development team which is where the Pay to Win content came from. The players pleaded for years for Gravity to give us NEW content, balance out the classes, fix important bugs, ect. However, what we got was class nerfs almost every month that forced everyone to re-roll their toons, and RECYCLED content. That's a big one. You will see the exact same mobs in 20 different areas that were simply reskinned and increased/decreased in size. Hell, most of the dungeons have the same design (Premium Dungeon for example). Over the years our suggestions were COMPLETELY ignored and Gravity added more and more items to the cash shop because that's all they cared about. But lets fast forward to now. Gravity is now owned by U.S developers. They've had creative control over the game for close to a year, if not more.\n\nWhat have they done? More harm than good just like the last development team. We're seeing more recyled content than ever, poor attempts at the new "Expansion" known as "Rise of the Reaver", and half-♥♥♥ class structuring that we have very little information about. Not only that, but they continue to cherish their precious item mall more than delivering decent content. Every event they host is broken in some way shape or form, the content they release is simply a reskin of something else, the game still runs like ♥♥♥♥ even on gaming pc's, and we have a lack of communication from the developers. Long story short, nothing has changed since the U.S developers got the game.\n\n---===[TLDR]===---\n\n- Questing is beyond Generic\n- Classes have been nerfed to oblivion\n- Outdated graphics (some people care, I personally do not)\n- Bugs that have been around since the launch of the game\n- Extremely Low Population\n- Very poor performance even on Gaming Rigs\n- Extreme gap between F2P and P2P\n- Gravity can never host an event without it being broken for the first couple of days\n\nAnd I'm just getting started, but I'm tired of typing now. My Verdict? Until Gravity cleans their mess up, 2/10. I give two points because I like Horror Themed stuff.\n\nJust remember, this game has been out since 2008. Given what you've read here, as well as other reviews, do you think this game is worth your time?\n","March 5, 2015","false","0.2"," 101 of 130 people (78%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","78","101","130","12","4"

Suddenly the developers left the game in it's current state and the Korean version of game was shut down and merged with the USA one (that explains why sometimes in notice/news there are korean notices). After some time the game had began to a exclusive Pay2Win game, where you could "enjoy" it only if you had Premium subscription, a pet to ride on it (distance to travel is long enough), a costume (form stats) and other "small" things. If you calculated the price of that things per one month it was over 15$ for sure, so it was more money eater than a P2P game. At some I left the game because the population was gone and they were left only fan-boys who give enough milk (money) to gravity.\n\nWhat surprises me is that the game wasn't shut down, because it didn't recieve really any consistent update since S2.\nBeware if you want to take this seriously because it will leave you with a bad taste after you start to see the gaps in it.","March 6, 2015","false","5.4"," 51 of 74 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","51","74","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mynio/recommended/289780/","mynio","mynio","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mynio/","290 products in account","DISCLAIMER: This review was made by an experienced Requiem player.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nSince the very start of this game I was its follower and a fan, so its 7 years already. My friend convinced me to this game  and I started to play with him. The overall experience was amazing. The graphics were not as good as other games had but it had the climate and gore not a single MMORPG cannot boast. There were two servers: Valdes PVE and Hammerine PVP. I was playing on Valdes. The mechanics were not too complicated and it was just perfect for me. Requiem: Bloodymare was the best part of this game ever. It was very demanding and challenging. For example You had no map directions whether You have to go to "that" point on a map to do "that" and ect. The only thing You had were quotes from NPCs and Yourself to read them all and complete the quest, that was very crucial but let You understand the lore of this game, which is amazing. It offers a variety of rich locations and mass of quests You can do in order to level up. Once You finished one You got 4 new, and it was never ending. The game was so good that sometimes it took entire week from my life, literally. The bosses in the game were very challenging. You had to get a big group of players to get them down, and You had to reserve 2 hours to kill it! Developers were very active in the community. They were appearing in the game and talked to players, shared their gear that was out of this world and ect. They even made boss events in the towns. I remember the game was not optimized too well and when hundreds of people gathered up for an event the game was giving me about 5 fps. Memorable thing was when admin spawned too many bosses we could not handle and they killed us all. then he immobilized them and killed in one hit, but its not why I am here to talk about.\n\nI was half way done with the max level with my friends at that point because we got more and more people playing this game... I could easily notice the big increase in game population in the brief time I was playing, then the developers announced a big patch comming out, I skimmed the patch notes and stood optimistic to those changes. The games title changed to Requiem: Memento Mori. We continued to play and noticed a signifiant ease when completing quests, an arrow was leading You to the point You had to do something and wrote You down what to do what was very dissapointing for me to see that, but it was just the beginning... the developers started to get a very bad feedback from this patch and the game community was kinda broken but still continued to level up... like I did. Then the real microtransactions were introduced. Luckily the game did not change itself to "pay 2 win" model and the overall gameplay experience was not charmed... yet.\n\nOnce again, developers introduced a patch and totally changed the game experience. It was very dull, and linear. I was sad about it and decided to give more and more feedback to developers. But unfortunately they did nothing about it. I remember just one time they did reply on my issue with one of the quests because the kill counter was stuck. They did fix it, but thats all about fixing. Developers team broke at some point and people started to quit the studio. The new ones that were a majority there and less experienced to such genre started to break the game. They made microtransactions a vital part of this game. It was totally "pay 2 win" that time. You wanted a good gear, great! You can loot it from best bosses. You want the best gear? You can upgrade it to +5 and in order to get it higher You gotta pay real money for chance amplifiers for just 20$. It was ridiculous but people bought it and got themselves up in the leaderboards quickly. I was a great pvp/pve player there but at some point I just vanished behind those outgeared players. The lucky players (like me) of Requiem: Bloodymare had the unique items that were removed from the incomming patches, well You could find the same items but their stats were drasticly lowered or entirely removed. We call them S1 (Season 1) items and once You ask for them in the game You will be welcomed with outrageous price. Those went up with the price and thats why I was able to afford some of the enchancements for my gear. Before all the patches You had to go all the way through the valleys, sometimes it took 10-20 minutes, also You could enter new towns only with a proper level that was just great and I loved it. After all that they got a flying ****ing mounts to the p2w store so You can bypass the mountains and they removed the level limit for entering towns. After 4 years of great feedback from the community, developers decided to do nothing but get as much cash of it as its possible... Then they merged servers into one and made it pvp only. Players started to furiously kill each other in towns. I remember when I first logged in to the game after that patch I was suprised by what was happening in the towns. You were killed when You were at the mail box, auctionner just browsing auctions, chatting with friends. That was just awful. Obviously... not enough. They moved all the korean players to our servers. That was the first time when hackers were introduced. Those made them practicly invincible. Speedhacks made their attack animation do not matter so they were spamming the best spells every second so it was 1-3 hits to get You down... even the best tank in the game that was my friend. After all that he quit the game, but I kept playing. Once again they "patched" the game. Since then I stopped playing. I got everything. Max lvl (85 that time), great gear that I got myself by buying off players amplifiers for in-game cash. All I got for real cash was a little companion that gave little XP bonus and something else (do not remember) for a present for my friend for 10$. Most of that time I was playing pvp arenas to get my inner beast gear and just rank up in the leaderboards.\n\nAfter a month or so I finally quit the game.\n\nNow I just noticed half an hour ago after this review was written that Requiem is on Steam... and now it's called: Requiem: Rise of the Reaver. I have no idea what that thing introduces but the previous experience tought me that that is nothing good. After all that speech You want a conclusion. All right!\n\nSo... if You wonder if this game is recommended by me... my answer is yes. It is still a great game to play, but now the community is broken and developers itself. It is fun to play solo or with friends. It has a variety of gameplay of various MMORPGs and I love it, but as soon as You hit level 60+ the gameplay will be diffrent, You will start to lack quests and You will be forced to grind. Its tiring and boring but I kept doing that, I was lucky enough to experience all those big patches that simply reset all the quests so I could do them again and that was enough to get myself leveled up and get some more quests. If You happen to buy premium service in this game, You will be eligible to enter "Premium Dungeons" that will give You multiplied anmount of experience so You will level up rapidly. Everything from the microtransactions store You can buy for in-game money from players, but You need to get it first. Getting it for real cash is simply not worth it. The game is not changing visually but what the game offers is just enough to enjoy it. Game has its own charm, and those who like survival games like me, will love it. There are many things that You cannot find in other games and that is what it makes this game unique. Once again I do recommend trying this game out and not just get 10th level... get atleast 20th and You'll see how rich is the game but it kinda ends there since You won't be indroduced to new content so often from there. Give it a try, its free!","March 5, 2015","true","0.5"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","29","52","7","0"

Keep in mind I did not play this very long, so treat this as more of a first impression.\n\nGraphics:\nI have to say that all the graphics look PS2 quality.  Now, I understand that thi game has been in and out of play for several years, but it looks like they didn't even TRY to update anything.  I like the HR Geiger feel to the world and enemies, but the low quality visuals kinda hinder it.\n\nSound:\nThere hardly is any, save for the music at the character select screen and the attack and death moan sounds the enemies make.  The only thing you will hear constantly is the sound of the wind.  I have no clue if later areas will have music or not, but I don't think I could stand playing this long enough to see.\n\nControl:\nMost click to attack mmos have you automatically face the enemy to attack, but not this one.  Not only do you have to manually face the enemy, but you must be preicise, or else the atatck won't activate.  Also, unlike most mmos, the hotkeys for various menus are switched, making it initially difficult to find what you're looking for.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game is a mess.  Firstly, there is engirsh almost everywhere, to the point that someone even didn't know that puncuation was a thing.  Sentences are frequently broken up in dialouge boxes, making it difficult to read.  Quests are a standard "go here and kill X Y times" or "collect X macguffins", all of which were quite boring.  The game is also FULL of temporary (read; 1Day or 7Day) items; the cash shop is full of it, in fact.  As for moving around, you can either hoof it, which takes a WHILE, use a plane that is available at most hubs (a SILENT plane, mind you), or get a mount.  You start with a 7Day mount, but after that, you will want to buy one becuase otherwise, travel will annoy you, like it did me.  Then you have the Possession Beast that I could not figure out how to active for the life of me.\n\nTechnical:\nI am adding this because the game seems to have a few issues.  Firstly, NEVER alt-tab.  The game will crash when you do this.  Better put it in window mode.  Also, it seems that some anti-virus software will block the game from even connecting to the internet so you have to make it exclude the game's exe file from being blocked.  Also, everytime that I logged out, the game crashed.\n\nYes this was only a first impression, but this game left a bad one with me.  Skip it unless you REALLY like the visuals.","March 17, 2015","false","3.1"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","53","17","32","4","2"

Post apocalyptic world with a load of monsters, hideous creatures and all kinds of dangerous beings that want your head torn off. Multiple dungeons, a lot of quests with interesting stories (sometimes sad, sometimes funny). Raid bosses that drop a lot of good equipment.\n\nOne thing I like most about this game - you don't need a buffer if you're on your own. Each class has all the buffs it needs to solo this dangerous world. Also the game has an interesting option for your character - once in a while you can wake up the beast within you, become more powerful for a short period of time, tear your foes limb from limb. And of course the "nightmare time" in game, when you can stand against powerful night creatures that appear only from 11:00 PM till 2:00 AM in-game time.\n\n4 races, each race has a warrior and a mage which in turn have 2 sub-classes each. A big game world with a lot of obscure and bloody stuff. Ordinary gameplay for a MMORPG, but with a few interesting things to experience.\nThe game is free, so why not give it a try?\n\n8/10","April 12, 2015","true","752.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This review is in terms of a PvE perspective as I never bothered with PvP with this game.\n\n**History**\n\nI played this game before back in 2008 back when it was called Requiem Bloodymare. The game was relatively fun and had an active (in-game) community.  Back then the game had two starting areas (1 being Kurt village [the desert area we drop into now] and the other being a snowy relatively nice looking area to enjoy). People ended up picking Kurt village as their starting point because the locations and enemies were closer and faster to get to. There were also a lot more quests to pick up from the NPC's in these starting locations than just the pickup scrolls. The user would bounce between the two starting areas just to get to level 25 before they proceeded onto map 2.\n\nFrom there, groups would form to grind for the lamenting (cry/sound) gear from the 1 dungeon to the east in Map 2. then proceed on quest tracks in the shape of the infinity symbol (∞) [starting in the center then following the path SE to NE to SW then back to NW. By this time, the user was already grinding in the dungeon slightly to the NW to get their next set armor.\n\nProceeding North to map 3 it was just a barren waste land where you had to follow the scrolls to know where to go.\n\nAs to the never ending bugs with quests, people would pickup the quest then ask for the X/Y coordinates to where/who to kill to fulfill the quest.\n\nDuring that time I made 3 characters:\nSoul Hunter -> Dominator (for minion master purposes)\nDefender -> Commander (for taunts and buffs and medium tanking)\nTemplar -> Radiant (for healing)\n\nAfter the summer of 2008, I took a break from the game due an increased work schedule and a decreased desire to grind in the game. I came back in summer 2009 when the game had (for lack of better terms) devolved into Memento. Skills that you had acquired before at earlier levels had been moved out of your reach. Having been primarily a minion master and finally unlocking the 4th summon (other than illusion) and then finding I needed to re-unlock the skills at much later levels was beyond annoying and so I moved onto my healer I had not progressed.\n\nAreas that you used to grind for gear had been stripped bare and the rate of drops had been massively decreased. If you had obtained the set armors for these in the past, their stats were not promoted and were incompatible with the newer versions of the set items that could only be equipped at later levels. The number of people still playing the game had also significantly dropped. Starter areas had been reduced to the 1 map kurt village and had maybe 3 people at a time in them. I lasted 1.5 months (only because of gear already acquired in the previous version of the game and wanting to experience the other classes)\n\nCome 2015 ... they added some non-sensible useless starter video. They added a weird tutorial dungeon that when you decide to walk through to the end of the dungeon it warps you to a much higher level area. I immediately used the town transport tool that was provided to me to go to Kurt village as I knew already that this was the starting location. I believe these transport maps list the towns in the order by level if memory serves me correctly. I proceeded to play the game for about 4 hours and by that time had made it to level 27, had over 1.6 Million in-game currency (courtesy of the 50k pog pickups they are providing). With the main quest they give you they seem to be trying to rush your character to the 2nd map and ignore the beginner area. Auction house is pretty devoid of armor/weapons. People in game are pretty much non-existent. Old quest bugs still exist. User-interface unimproved.\n\n\n**Pros/Cons**\nPros:\n1) Had a relatively enjoyable combat system\n2) Decent mail/auction house\n3) Decent Bank\n4) Gives you a good amount of bag storage (if you do the main quest)\n\nCons:\n1) Graphics outdated.\n2) Bugs don't seem to ever have been fixed from 2008/2009.\n3) Quests are still hard to navigate with/without bugs and require veteran player knowledge or wiki to progress through.\n4) The user keeps spamming the 2 attack skills they get until level 30 or so.\n5) I don't know if they changed this but before if you died in Possession Beast mode, your beast was destroyed and you had to get a new one by grinding or buying from the auction house.\n6) To re-open the miniquest window you have to toggle one of your quests in the main quest window to re-open. There is no user-key interface for the miniquest window.\n7) Monsters will generally follow you for miles outside their territory until they have been allowed to hit you once.\n8) Lack of users means no dungeons, means no progression, means game is worthless.\n\n\n**Recommendations for those that want to try it**\n1) Get a group of friends together and plan whose going to be what type of class so that you can have a full party for dungeons ... and survive. This simply must be done first and foremost if you want to get anything out of this game post level 50 solo as there is an extremely small user base with this game already let alone within the areas of your level.\n2) The game gives the new characters a 7 day exp boost / costume / mount. Whatever character your using devote yourself to this character or delete it and make it again another day if you're not intending to make full use of the exp boost/mount.\n3) The starter area has pretty much turned into a 1-2 quest chain area where they go from Kurt village in the north to the South east town in the Shape of a S. Do these quests to get your bags and gear.\n4) If you get the pog drop pickup ... just sell it it's worth 50k a piece.\n5) Don't bother with scroll quests until Map 2 (~lev 25-30). Note that this is for exp rather than the petty reward they offer.\n6) Once in Map 2 follow the the scrolls/quests in the infinity shape starting from the center going SE as explained previously in the history section. From this point on the wiki is your friend.","May 28, 2015","false","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I hate to be this harsh, but litterally! It's not worth the time it takes to download. The tutorial is short and sweet, which is something I genuinely like to see in mmorpgs.. But god damn, first thing they do is plop you out infront of some cave once your done, and gives you absolutely no direction as to where to go once you're finished. Not to mention, all the enemies you'll encounter down the one road leading outside the cave are all too high a lvl to possibly defeate. So ontop of having no clear direction leading you onward, but you gotta avoid everything you encounter in the first zone you spawn in?\n\nI have never seen anything like that in any mmo I've ever played before. So if you wanna be disappointed, go ahead and download this game! If you'd rather not, welp you'd have a lot more fun playing snakes and ladders with a four year old.","July 15, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some of the quests it gives you are stupid and are pointless when you can't find the things/creatures/persons you're looking for. I didn't even know that some creatures or characters can be found only at certain times of the day, I've had this game for several months now. The tutorial only tells you the extreme basics like reinforcing gear, how to look around, how to move, how to kill, how to open a bag, how to open quest log, and how to increase your skills when you lvl up.\n\nThere's a lot more negative things about this game that i could go on and on about (like how it doesn't describe IN GAME what the attributes/stats stand for and what the do, well, except for these few: EVASION, ACCURACY, HEALTH (CON), and MP.\nBut one of the good things i like about this game (besides its many dungeons and the vastness of the game) is the damn glitches lol. One of my favorites is the battlefield glitch, when you enter the battlefield, you are automatically made lvl 40, well guess what? Now you're lvl 40! you could have been lvl 24 outside of it, and have lvl 40 gear in your invetory, but once you are inside the battlefield, you are made lvl 40, now you can wear that lvl 40 gear. This gear doesn't come off when you leave the battlefield, it stays on until you take it off, but once you do take it off...you have to go back into the battlefield to put it back on if you're not yet lvl 40...yeah that's about the only cool glitch i have found","June 7, 2015","false","109.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I made a character, and started playing, but after the tutorial level, there is no indication of where you are supposed to go to, as well as the very odd fact that your level 3 character is suddenly in an area with Level 36 enemies who will aggro towards you should you come within a certain distance. Highly suspect. I was holding up high hopes for this game because of the developer, but I can say that I am disappointed. If I wanted a game where there is no direction on what to do, much less a usable map that gives a general idea of things, then I would make one.\n\nThis is a MAJOR disappointment.","May 24, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really, the gameplay itself is a.....aquired taste. It's more fit for those that like gothic fantasy settings. For the average ♥♥♥♥♥♥mer? Not really. Maybe 2 of 10 average ♥♥♥♥♥♥mers would find it even the slightest enjoyable. The game was dished out in 08, and combined with a bad character creator. It explains why it's dead. I aint far enough to know wether or not it's pay to win and all. But then again when I play MMORPGs I avoid the PvP. I save that stuff for shooters and RTS games. In the end, is it worth a 10/10? Maybe if You're a gothic kinda person. Otherwise general public seems to give it a low rating just cause it's a good idea that was just poorly done. My personal rating is 8 of 10. I like the gothic setting, the draby depressing enviroment. But 2 of those points is just cause the game has some potential to it. The remaining 6 is cause I enjoy the gameplay. In the end, it all comes down to prefrence. None the less, final thing is. Would I recommend this game? To a random person? No. To a couple friends? Yeah, I would.","May 6, 2015","true","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Far too many years for me to remember. For those coming to this game, and have played it before... I'll start off with it hasn't changed at all. So if you loved it, it's now on steam. If you hated it, well you know what not to do.\n\nHowever for those that have never played this, to sum this game up without some extremely long review covering every single aspect of this game, or a link to my YOUTUBE REVIEW... It's just like any other MMO. Nothing new and exciting, or revolutionary. It's an old MMO, and has been around for years. You really can't expect much more of it.\n\nTo put it simply, if you're looking for a decent, non-groundbreaking MMO, this is it. It's steady, decent grinding and overall a mellow ride. An alright MMO for anyone looking to just grind mindlessly, or play something that isn't too terrible. It has the standard login-day bonus, cash shop for boosts, and commodities. You don't even need to do anything amazing to register, it's all in-launcher, except the email verification. All that good stuff.\n\nI personally will probably be playing it for about a week or two, maybe a month before I move onto another mindless MMO. So download it if you're looking to pass the time.","March 4, 2015","true","0.4"," 36 of 74 people (49%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","49","36","74","7","1"

There are 8 classes and 4 races total. Each race only have 2 classes to chouse from. The character cuztomization is very limited, you can only have about 7 choices of your facial change, and hair change.\n\nAfter you have done creating your not so creative character, you will have to set a pass code to play a character. Yes a 4 digits pass code for each character, like we don't have account protection already.\n\nNow let's talk about the graphics. Even though I don't care much about the graphics, but this game looks realy old. During the character creation screen you can see it clearly, that this game is outdated.\n\nThe UI looked just like what you expect to see in any mmo, full of things that shouldn't be in an RPG game.\n\nWhen I joined the world, I skyped the tutorial, just so I could go and see what I could do. After I left the city, I encauntered some monsters I could fight. The game uses targeting system for it's fighting mechanics. The fighting looked realy boring, regardless if I was a lvl 1 character. Killing few flesh zombies, and seeing some blood was not entertaining, and it's definetely not a reason to play a game. If you want a gorry game, play brutal doom.\n\nEven though I played this game for only 10 minutes, I can say that if a game fails to capture my attention in 10 minutes, the game is a failure. I honesly don't care if someone would tell me that the "END GAME" is good. If that would be the truth, then why not start playing at the end game already, and skip this whole leveling mess in the first place.\n\nIf you are looking for an MMORPG to play, this game should be your last choise. It's not as polished as other crappy MMORPG's, and defenetely you should play something else instead.","March 20, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Number two this is my first negetive review for a game so...yeah ENJOY THE REVIEW! (you can skip to the bottom if you would like, I will not judge...alot)\n\nPROS: Honesty I couldn't find any...MOVING ON!!\n\nCONS:\n-Grapics are terrible.\n-Combat sytem (you click once on an enemy and basicly wait until you or the monster dies).\n-When you talk to guy,you hear the SAME EXACT sound which is a single "yo!" in the voice tone of a teenage boy even if your talking to an old man.\n-Enemies do not look very colorful even if you do start in the desert.\n-The tutorial only made a tiny bit of sense to me.\n-When your making your character at the beginning of the game there isn't alot of choices for hair styles, and faces. But there are no choice for hair,eye,or skin color.\n- The rouge (the class that I picked) looks like a stripper with almost no clothes and she had double long swords as her main weapon, I mean come on her main weapons are supposed to be daggers not long swords (it would be nice if you could equip double long swords, but not to start out with).\n\n\nNow, I really wanted to love this game because I LOVE MMORPS!! And at first this game looked amazing but if you are reading this review and Made it all the way to the end then your awesome and you get a invisable cookie.\nBUT FOR ALL THINGS HOLY DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!! If you have already played this game and need a good MMORPG to destroy that headache of despair and confusion, then I recommend Dungeons and Dragons: Neverwinter, It is much better than this piece of poo.\n\n","March 13, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

Added detail and such would be loved. As to the game, it started me off in the lowest resolution and the game crashes every time try to change it. Other than that, I find it to be a decent game.

I'm not giving a recommendation based on AVG detecting the launcher files as Malware and then removing them, causing the game to not be able to start up.  If that issue is fixed as well as added character creation content, then I will be happy to offer it up to other people as a good game.

We were trolling through the free to play games, when we came across this beauty. It was sadly the most interesting game we could find. 'Why not give it a go?' we thought.\nI am so glad we did.\nWe downloaded the game on his desktop, and his laptop. We had no idea what was in store for us.\nWe got into the game, and made a couple of characters. We wandered around a bit, and whacked some grotesque monsters in the face. It was alright. The game passed the time, but definitely wouldn't win any awards. I don't know when it happened, but something clicked. We could not stop playing the game. For hours and hours, we did quests, and leveled up our character in the strange dark environment of this game. The game wasn't great, and was the cause of much frustration, but we did nothing but play it. That one night gave way to several days of virtually nonstop play. We met a few friends, and did everything with them. Our team was unstoppable. We had played for 33 hours in the 3 days I spent at his house. In those 3 days, we made friends, and spawned countless memories and inside jokes. We went through our adventure observing and pointing out the flaws, but not really caring. (if you want some examles of the flaws, read literally any other review.) To this day, my friend still calls me a "fuggin' koont," after one of the game's enemies.\nAll in all, it was a great experience. We had fun, but after that, I never touched the game again. He went on to play it for a few hours on his own, but eventually deleted it. This was for the same reason that I do not recommend it.\nSimply, the game's a piece of ♥♥♥♥.","October 10, 2015","false","33.4"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","4","0","0"

The first time I played Requiem was around june 2008 and it was developed and published by Gravity.The game still had it touches with the dark theme and gore. The skill tree and other system is a joy for me i don't know why and the monsters rewards are amazingly better.Happy to play this game that release the young side of me BUT! The game itself now still had problems, many bugs, there's bad design and I know the game itself is still need time to patch up most of it. Requiem: Rise of the Reaver is a 2.5/5. The game developers still need do something about the bad game designs and the mass bugs in the game.","March 5, 2015","true","2.1"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","8","22","2","0"

I loved the graphics and violence then and I love it now, I felt the game died back then and the Facebook version was broken completely but this is practically how it was when I first played. Little buggy, outdated graphics because it is pretty old. I'm still going to play it here and there but for anyone looking for a new MMO to play and have never tried this just keep in mind it is very old there will be many small issues but I have never had any big glitches that could stop me playing.\n\nIf you have played Requiem in the past and hated it I do not suggest you trying this, If you played it in the past and loved it and hoped for newer content well you can try this and hope again cause who knows maybe they will?\n\nThe game is pretty easy to understand, there are little tips and hints that will be displayed for you. You do have to manually update your map to show current quest objectives by clicking an icon in the quest objective tracker. Little work nothing too strenious.\n\nExp rates are pretty high I guess as I played for bit over and hour and reacher lvl 14. Also fighting enemies on your own is not too difficult I was attacked by five enemies but with two little health packs I was able to win.\n\nIf your looking for a challenging game this may not be for you unless you stick with it and maybe further in game it will get better. I'm keeping an open mind on this and shall continue playing it.","March 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","6","18","0","0"

Requiem is an older mmo, like a lot of the mmos coming to Steam lately it seems to be trying to make a comeback using Steam users to keep its player base up. I don't see that happening. Requiem is/ was fun but it does nothing really to set itself apart from the older mmo model.  I like the setting, and the art style a lot though, and I like the game enough to recommend it even though it has the same basic gameplay as most other older free to play mmos. Overall Requiem is not bad, not really. I have seen many a worse free to play mmo. I just don't think it sets itself apart much from other games.\n\nAnother note. After coming back and playing it on Steam, the game is a serious "ghost town" I only ever saw one other player while i was here. It may improve now that the games on steam, but again, I doubt it.  Playing Requiem is light seeing a serious case of "what could have been". You should still try it though, at least if you are still interested after my "review".","March 5, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","9","25","0","0"

Sad to say I cannot  find anything of redeeming value to Requiem. I played since 2007, back when it had promise and potential. That potential has since been squandered away when content got removed to be recycled as new, nerfing classes to near oblivion while boosting others to godhood, and a plethora of bugs that never got fixed since 2007.\n\nHere is a few things that break the game for new comming players:\n\nThe character creation is limited and showcasess the buggy nature of the game with broken text descriptions that has been in existance as such for years. (that should tell you how much care is put into this title)\n\nThe tutorial is bugged at the mob drop sequence (I tried on multiple new characters none made it through without having to quit tutorial. (by the way if you do play this game and go through part of the tutorial do not simply walk through the double doors with the yellow glowy light pouring through them during the mob drop portion of the tutorial, you will end up in parness a lvl 30s region and to make matters worse the point they drop you off at is the site of some pretty mean nightmare mobs known as Arioch they will 1 shot any noobie coming out that tutorial if they happen to walk out the tutorial during nightmare. If I was fresh and knew nothing bout a game and they do that kind of thing wihtout direction toward a central hub I would uninstall this game.)\n\nThe next thing that breaks this game is the poorly textured world and badly designed mobs. Its prety sad that the best looking things in game are the characters you play as. I know this is a horror theme game but not all horrific events are exclusive to the most stark, drab and malevolent of environments but can happen in beautiful places too. Hmm games like dead island or dying light seem to get the idea more than this out dated outclassed title that should only hope to crawl into its grave soon.\n\nThe constant RECYCLING of content within the game is appaling is it too much to ask that an instance not be centered around the premium dungeon (prison mine from S1) Jacob Shrine (chast sanctum S1) Numaren reinstanced region as a higher lvl region same with a map called Crescent (which was an alternate starting map but now is the end game map)\n\nLastly is the PVP it is severely unbalanced and is heavily dependant on mall items to maximize even during 70% boost to forge events. I admit its far easier to +30 now than back when there was no such thing as ampilio anti deterioration rate xeons or these 70% events. However the problem now is the farm. There are these 2 guilds within Requiem to watch out for "Dockdo" and "Disbalance" between these two juggernauts they keep essential bosses (Mair Gal) and creatures (deadly pez for nightmare jewels) on a lock down so the common user has no chance of obtaining components to be remotely competitive unless you wish to level 4 characters to level 83 to self obtain those nightmare jewel comonents or you simply pay Dockdo or Disbalance guildies through auction for those things you need which only makes them guilds even stronger. Oh and dont dare try pvp against them they will camp you on spawn in numbers 5 or more to your 1. I personally like a game that doesnt favor a pay user over a free user since it seems the only positive reviews I see are from those notorious bullies that will kill all newcommer activity and be the death of this game.\n\nThe systemic cycle now is to introduce new gears peroidicly which forces players to part with money to remain competitive and within game to far mthese new mats which has lead to a very confusing gearing system in which you have to look up on wiki articles and forums to get answers as nothing is ever explained within game. I am sorry but not many out there want to spend time doing research than simply playing the damn game. Yeah I went there but do you think Gravity would offer a tutorial as to which compounding mall item is needed per grade of item you're wanting to compound or revamp. Or how about useless items like the anti deterioration rate xeons people could buy those accidentally and have practically wasted their money since 70% events are nullifying need for those mall items entirely.\n\nThis game has been on life support far longer than nessessary, but all means try this game for yourself and you will be amazed with how boring an mmo can be.","May 5","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
