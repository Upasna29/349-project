But still, if you're a fan of Final Fantasy or love JRPG's, then you should still pick this up, especially if you haven't played this game already.\n\nHere's a quick look video so you can see for yourself what this game is like. But if you'd rather have a simple pros/cons/unmentionables list of the game, continue below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/4O4xZ0HE56k\n\nAs promised, the pros and cons breakdown.\n\n+Good, relaxing music. FF has always been good about this.\n+The ability to customize your party to your playstyle with the flexible job system. Anybody can be anything. Why not girl warriors and guy white mages? Break those stereotypes!\n+Strategic, turn-based combat. Some may prefer action, but I count this as a plus because you play at your own pace and the battles can be close sometimes.\n+Great exploration. There's hidden passages to treasure, optional dungeons, and mazes to loot littered everywhere, even at the beginning of the game. Did I mention you get an airship early on?\n+You can quick save anywhere. Super handy for any RPG and a person always on the go.\n\n?Because of the exploration, you can wander into places you're grossly unprepared for and get stomped into the ground.\n?The story is your typical "you're the chosen one to save the world and help people along the way." I'm not really bothered by it, but some people who want something different may be turned off by it.\n\n-No options menu besides changing resolution. Square-Enix actually makes really good option menus for PC, so I was a little sad to see that there wasn't even AA to get rid of some of the jaggies.\n-Because this is an old port, though a good one, the graphics aren't exactly breath-taking like the opening CG cutsceen. Personally I don't care since the good gameplay matters to me over graphics, but a lot of people get turned off by dated graphics unfortunately, even more so when they expect more from Square-enix.\n-It's pricey for what it is. But that's the FF brand for you.\n-No voice acting. While not the end of the world, it certainly does help immerse you into the world.\n\nOverall, it's a really good game, and it's nice to have an old-school RPG every now and again.

The spells and job systems are wonderful and I enjoyed what I could of it. This version of the game is a very good game and brings back memories for me of the NES version.\nHowever I can't feel good about recommending this port. There are a LOT of game-breaking bugs in this port. Things that set back your story several hours of gameplay, some that make it so you have to beat a boss twice, thrice or more times, etc... I've managed to make it to the second-last area and can no longer continue forward because the game won't register that I have a key item that's clearly in my inventory, for example. I've run into several bugs and until the port is fixed somehow, I don't think I'll actually be able to complete the game. I know many other people have run into these bugs as well.","October 12, 2015","false","39.3"," 152 of 186 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","152","186","9","7"

If you already played the DS version, nothing new here. Please note this is the true III sequel and NOT the III that NA played on SNES.\n\nMy only two gripes are these: 1. If you play with a controller and it loses connection/power, reconnecting won't register with the game and you're forced to restart the game. 2. The last areas of the game. Not only is there no save point, but you get the final batch of new jobs so late in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/239120/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I have always enjoyed the first two Final Fantasy games, but their stories were sparse, relying more on conversations with random town folk to help fill in the blanks than to tell a proper tale. While Final Fantasy III still shows its age and might not have the sophistication found in later RPGs, it is still a worthy look back at a game that helped to continue to redefine the genre.\n\nThis version of the game on PC is based on the graphically updated version that made its way onto the Nintendo DS back in 2006. The visuals got an 3D overhaul, with a widened aspect ratio and some new features as well. If you are familiar with the DS or iPhone/iPad versions of the game this PC release will feel very familiar, but it still plays out nicely on a bigger screen.\n\nThemes that persist and remain familiar in future Final Fantasy games such as the Warriors of Light and job class systems help populate this story. The job system is bare bones compared to what we are used to now in the series (and other games that use similar systems), and the game uses it more as a second experience system. On the one hand the characters have conventional experience systems that level up their physical attributes, and then there's the job levels which represent their skills. Managing both is easy, and the system does encourage players to jump their characters through multiple jobs, though there is some grinding involved as there is a warmup process where a character needs to fight a certain number of battles with a role before they're comfortable with it and can use its skills properly. You don't want to be fighting tough enemies in such a state, so you'll generally grind through easy battles each and every time you change classes.\n\nThis is a classic Final Fantasy title, which of course has both good and bad connotations. It means lots of menus and level grinding and of course chocobos and Cid and things. It is a welcome rush of nostalgia to come back to a game like this, which has aged well despite being nearly two and a half decades old. I'd be lying if I said that the graphical overhaul didn't make the game far more palatable (or the fact that the original game was never released in English), but the core mechanics should also appeal to old school JRPG fans. The game gets off to something of a slow start, with a lot of story and limited exploration during the first dozen hours or so, but once it opens up it is every bit the exploration-filled adventure Final Fantasy is known for, filled with little secrets to find and fun and diverse characters.\n\nHaving just played Bravely Default a few months ago and seeing familiar themes such as the four different adventurers brought together by circumstance and the presence of crystals as a focal point to the story, I could not help but be amused with how timeless the narrative themes are. That being said, Bravely Default showed just how much further game storytelling has gone in making something rich out of the basic thematic construct. That is not to say that Final Fantasy III has a poor story, but compared to the more modern Japanese role-playing game, it is fascinating to see how far the medium has come.\n\nIf you have already played the DS or iOS version of this game, there may not be enough of a reason to purchase it on Steam now. However, if you missed that opportunity before and want to experience an important part of Final Fantasy's early evolution, this is an excellent way to do so. The character depth and story detail might feel somewhat lacking compared to newer JRPG titles, but there is an expansive world here that begs for exploration as you grow your characters for future challenges. The overall package is an easy one to recommend.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 2, 2015","true","112.1"," 101 of 116 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","101","116","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/recommended/239120/","michal_sivek","Sivek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/michal_sivek/","1402 products in account","Just to start off, if you're looking at this game as a potential gateway to getting into traditional JRPG's, don't bother.  It will only serve to put you off the genre all together.  There are just too many things, like lack of save points and some cheap bosses, for someone that may want to play a more old-school game and is looking at FFIII, the earliest available FF game on Steam, as the game to start out with.\n\nThat said, if you've played a lot of old RPG's growing up, you may find something more to your liking here.  The story and characters are simple.  There's no voice acting, no FMV cutscenes, no minimap or compass to point you in the right direction.  I found all of the above a benefit to the game.  The story parts would be slowed down by voice acting and the generic story would be exposed further if you had to listen to it and instead of just reading text.  While the game is fairly linear, it does a great job at points of making you wonder where to go and there's a real sense of exploration.  There's like five or more villages you don't ever have to go to for any reason that are just there, and despite them being pretty small, it's a cool little thing that you'd never see in a more modern game.\n\nThe big thing with this game is that in was the introduction of the job-swapping system found in the earlier FF's.  There are twenty plus jobs and they're handed out at set points in the story.  The big problem is the last set of jobs are unlocked extremely late in the game and this makes using them to their fullest a pain.  You can switch jobs on the fly but there's a small penalty to stats for x amount of fights.  It's not a big deal and will only hamper you for a handful of random battles.\n\nThe big downside to the game is complete lack of effort when redesigning the boss encounters and the final dungeon in its entirety.  Every boss fight boils down to the same thing.  A single enemy will have a strong physical attack that hits one character and strong magic attacks that hits everyone.  Bosses will also always use these attacks back to back without interruption.  This means any character, even with full HP, is liable to get KO'd if they get RNG unlucky when it comes to boss turns versus your characters' turns.  It's such a cheap, low-effort way to add difficulty when designing bosses.  Every turn of every boss fight eventually winds up with you casting a group heal spell on an already fully healed group just to deal with the oncoming attacks.\n\nThe last dungeon and it's surroundings is one of the worst in RPG's and I'm sure you can find detailed reasons why elsewhere.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about grinding being necessary in this game and I find that completely overblown.  I never stopped my progress for the explicit grinding of levels/ job levels and beat the game with levels in the very low 50's.  Grinding some levels would have helped for the last boss to serve as an HP buffer but it's not necessary.  As long as you don't continuously change your jobs, you should be able to handle anything the game can throw at you as long you fight every random encounter you come across.  The secret boss though would require a ton, and I mean a ton, of grinding and I didn't bother with it.\n\nAs for the port, it's a super low effort one of the mobile version, not the DS version.  This means stuff like the UI is ugly and created to be touch based, but lacking in touch suport or mouse control in menus in this version and is just poor all around.  Even things like loading your game while in-game is obtuse.  There are only three save slots for who knows what reason.  I also ran into a problem where all dialogue box text had some type of artifacting or something that I couldn't find a work around for.  All that said, it's still supposedly better the FFIV PC port, which doesn't even have the memorize battle cursor function because it wasn't included in the mobile version and has 15 FPS in battles.  I used the memorize function in FFIII so I'll be missing it when I eventually get around to playing FFIV.  Square just doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ with any of their PC ports so none of this should be a surprise.\n\nOkay, since this was really long, here's a short answer as to whether you should buy and play this game.  Don't if you have no experience with older RPG's.  If you do and are fine with not having things like save points and easily obtainable reviving items, cheap bosses and a terrible final dungeon, you'd probably get some enjoyment out of FFIII.  It's an enjoyable, but clearly flawed game.","February 15, 2015","true","26.1"," 43 of 54 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","43","54","2","5"

And that's only half true. See, I've been trying to beat the living hell out of this game ever since I bought it almost a week ago and I keep getting stopped by bugs. Below I'm going to list the four bugs I've encountered, and they're pretty catastrophic, but if you save often you'll be fine. Except that you can't save in dungeons. Luckily, none of these bugs took place in Dungeons.\n\nThe first bug I encountered: On leaving Castle Sasune I decided to go back to the starting village and see if I missed anything. When I talked to the Elder in town, the storyline restarted and I had to go back through gathering my party, whose levels had all reset to 3, 3, and 4, respectively, by going through all the cutscenes over again.\n\nThe Second bug I encountered: While on The Enterprise (Boat) I got into a battle, a lot of them, to try and level against the new monsters because YAAY DIVERSITY, only to come out of my 20th or so battle and realize I was standing in the ocean. There was no ship sprite, I was Luneth being followed by Desch.. standing on the ocean. The background music had stopped and I was unable to go back on land, and when I went past the first continent, the Big Rock that bars your passage before defeating Djinn was there again. Wee~ saved to an empty file and reloaded, bug not fixed.\n\nThe Third bug, and the funniest (in a cruel sort of way): After speaking with a friend about a treasure room just inside the crystal cave, I decided to head back there on The Enterprise (Save Often) and check it out, if only for the Achievement progress. I skipped the first village because I'd already dealt with that bug and I wasn't risking it. Go in to the cave, grab the loot and spot a hole in the floor. So I hop in, figuring the worst that could happen is that I'll have to walk through the crystal room again. NOPE. Game reverts Luneth and party to level 3, 3, 3, and 4 respectively and plays the opening cutscene again. And restarts the storyline, strips you of items and jobs unlocked. FUNNNN.\n\nThe last bug I found was upon restarting the game after the third bug: I loaded up my save and there I was in the middle fo the Ocean on The Enterprise. I decide to quickly get the hell off this boat before it glitches on me again. Got into a fight with 2 Hermits. Killed them quickly, was back on my boat, and two achievements popped up. Apparently I saved a lot of Gil, because I got both of the Gil-related achievements for nothing.\n\n\nAll in all, a great game but I have to play it in small chunks because of the ridiculous amount of bugs I've run into. Its frustrating, and I won't recommend the purchase of this game to any but the most stalwart of Final Fantasy fans.","June 2, 2014","false","12.1"," 94 of 141 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","94","141","4","5"

I received a BS response from Square-Enix, simply telling me to verify the installation/game cache integrity (yeah, because I'm *that* much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and didn't already try that... thanks for nothing!) Please note that multiple users have been having the same issues:\n\nBasically, the game bugs out so bad to where your character will be sailing in a ship one second, then walking atop the ocean the next. You will also enjoy enemy encounters every other step, chests in dungeons randomly resetting, the inability to change your characters' classes, and -- my personal favorite -- in the beginning of the game, you get trapped inside Castle Sasune because the game bugs out and SHUTS THE FRONT GATE ON YOU. INGENIOUS.\n\nThink merely restarting the game will solve the problem? Don't be fooled. The game will still be glitchy as hell, just later on, is all.

Remember this game was orginally released April 1990 ( in Japan only), to put that in perspective it, Final Fantasy 1 came out for the NES in America that year! This version is a direct port of the DS version, which updated the graphics to a 3D engine.\n\nThere is very little hand holding, often you will find yourself on the world map trying to remember a single line of dialogue from an NPC that will direct you. While the flow of the game is pretty good, there is a few times that you will need to grind out levels (and Job levels). Again, part of the old school feeling of this game.\n\nThe Job system works for the most part and is designed to suit individual playstyles. Unfortunately there is many bosses that die easier to certain group make-ups. This can be a frustrating thing. Also a few of the jobs are direct upgrades from other jobs (white mage / devout or Monk / Black belt) rendering the previous job basically  obsolete.\n\nGraphics\nWell not the best looking game the graphics do a servicable job. This will not put your system to the test that is for sure!\n\nSound\nThe music and sound effects are pretty good and definitely have that "final fantasy" feel.\n\nStory\nAs mentioned above the flow of the game is ok, but you do find yourself at certain points wondering where to go next (at least I did, anyway). Revisiting a couple of towns and talking to everyone may refresh the memory.\n\nGameplay\nOld school! Grinding levels although arguably not required is recommended. The Job levels have a different leveling system, as in they don't level up using Experience points. There is a hidden job point system that sets your levels. To accumulate these job points you perform actions in battle (attack, guard, item, magic etc.)  When JP is accumulated to 99, Job level goes up by 1. Each action (except: Front, Back, Escape, and Flee) will contribute a fixed amount of job points to the character.\nMy only real complaint is when entering a battle the camera system often scrolls through the enemies. Really it comes down to like 3 seconds but when you're grinding levels it makes each battle longer than maybe it should be, this adds up over time. Again, just a very small gripe.\nThere is very large portion of the game at the end where you are unable to save. Although I was lucky and got through it all unscathed, I can imagine the frustration of dieing and losing everything after sinking a couple of hours into the dungeon. Save and save often! Even if you don't think you need to!\n\nOverall I recommend this game especially if you're into Jrpg, and specifically ones from the past! :)\n\n8/10","March 13","true","30.4"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","21","21","2","0"

Lots of opportunity to max everything though if that's your thing\n- Bosses and new mobs can pose a threat\n- Finishing a job gets you a legendary item for that class\n\nCons\n- Some jobs are worthless\n- Zero description of Job Points - had to read a guide\n- Fastest way to level a job?  Just have all your guys Guard 7 times for an automatic job level at the end of the fight.  Should have been based on job special skills - Knights using Defend, Thief using Steal, mages using magic for the biggest boost, medium boost for normal actions like attacking, and very little for using items (unless Scholar) or Guarding.  I've maxed out a lot of the FF games and couldn't force myself to do it here.\n- Low agility characters/jobs end up at a disadvantage if you don't use the Guard method of job leveling.  They don't get to take an action and thus level slower than everyone else.\n- Legendary smith - difficult to access without looking at a guide, pops up in random places causing you to fly between two cities until she shows up at just to get your new job weapon, etc.  Poorly conceived.\n- Nothing carries over when you switch jobs.  It would be nice to keep some residual stats - Knight to White Mage should keep a little defense or vitality.\n- Save issue during the last boss.  Fight through a dungeon, fight boss, no save option except for quick save (does not allow you to resume there if you die).  Can't teleport or travel back to world map for a full save.  Enter final dungeon - if you happen to approach the final boss first like I did, you're screwed and you get one shotted meaning you lose about 20 minutes of progress and have to watch some really long cutsceens again.\n\nAll in all, glad I picked it up on sale and got to see what they did with the remake.","July 2, 2015","true","49.3"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","31","39","2","1"

As a long time fan of the Final Fantasy Series, I didn't get a chance to play FFIII till way later on an Emulator program on my PC. While I liked it immediately I lost interest after a few days because of the NES styled graphics.  With THIS release, however, the modern player will have a more enjoyable experience than with previous installments. It has improved graphics (well, DS level but definitely better than the NES), monsters are animated, music is a bit less annoying than the .midi's use to be and the way the cutscenes play out are vastly improved over their original versions.\n\nFFIII is the story of the Onion Knight, the reimergance of the Warriors of Light and the birth of Final Fantasy's Job Class System. The story is good, although the cast seems a bit "thrown together", it's really the mechanics and nostalgia that makes FFIII worth the buy. Random battles, old fashioned grinding (yes, it was popular before WoW and EQ) and FF canon like Moogles (Complete with a lackluster MogNet), Chocobo's, everyones favorite Mechanic / Airship Captain; Cid and the oddest overworld map on any FF game, ever.\n\nOverall, even as a slight fan of Mystic Quest (loved the dungeon music) and with my distaste with FFII and XI, FIII still maintains its place HIGH on my list of favoritsm for the FF Franchise.

It boasts numerous job choices and combinations similar to its NES counterpart and the tactics series.\n\nThis game is of course not without drawbacks. Among other titles in the FF series, I would rank this as slightly  above average due to one or two missing (but important) features.\n\nThe game does not have an option to adjust battle speed. This was something you could find in FF games of previous generations so it's a shame that this isn't built into the PC port of the game. Keep in mind that there's an achievement for getting all jobs to level 99 which will require a minimum of 2254 battles (that's if you're super efficient) so this particular option would have been a godsend.\n\nContent-wise, I also feel that it is below/lacking in comparison to the 2 other games which are also on Steam. This is purely subjective but I feel that the price point needs to be adjusted after considering this factor. It's a shame because the game ends before it truly begins. You get your last set of jobs way too close to the end of the game.\n\nDespite these criticisms, I can still recommend FF3. It follows a nostalgic formula that most of the other games in the series observe. The game is especially good if you are a modern gamer who missed out on the treasured experience of playing the first half of the series.","June 8, 2014","true","255.2"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","5"

Final Fantasy III is a sweet, charming, and satisfying Final Fantasy experience. The style of the music, the artwork, and the feel of the game has yet to be replicated.\n\nLuneth, Arc, Inguis, and Refia are four adventurers who become the Warriors of Light. Their roles in the party are based on which jobs you assign to them that unlock as you progress through the story. The story is simple but engaging enough to want to see through to the end.\n\nThis game is HARD, especially when you're used to the more modern FF titles. I can't sugarcoat the difficulty at all. You will rarely get a phoenix down, so trips back to town to revive fallen party members may happen frequently. If you are looking for a challenge, you will certainly find it here.\n\nIt's kinda sad that it took over a decade for this gem to see a US release, but it has already taken place as one of my favorite games of all time and one of my favorite FF titles. Completing this game is one of the most rewarding experiences ever. I recommend getting both FF3 and FF4 on Steam as both are challenging in their own ways but offer different experiences.\n\n","May 6, 2015","true","2.7"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","0"

Zoomed in so far that all you could see was the top, left quadrant of the actual image.  Game is so new that there was no troubleshooting help online.  I had to scan through 20 + reviews and forum pages just to find mention of this issue.\n\n---------*** SOLUTION For those of you with the same experience***---------\n*  Select the FF3.exe file in your steamapps folder.\n* Right-Click on .exe and select 'Compatibilty'\n* Now selct the compatibility tab from this window\n* Toggle the 'disable DPI' setting.\n.... The reason you are having this issue is because you are using a monitor that displays very high DPI.  I'm currently using Apple's Retna display and that is the highest DPI you can get right now besides 4k stuff.  But any monitor capiable of displaying over 1080p will most likley fall in this category.\n\n* The only other problem I experienced was a slight gamepad issue where my character wouldn't stop traveling west no matter what I did on the gamepad.  Unfortunatley, travelling west on the world map made me bump into a few mobs that I wasn't geared or leveled for, I died and then was sent back to my original save point which was signicantly far back in my game play.  This really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off--- so I restarted and everything was fine.  If it happens again, I'll simply unplug the controller in hopes that will make it forget the error.\n\nBesides those 2 experiences, I would say that I am loving the game.  I never played the DS version nor did have I ever played any ports besides those awful ones for psx from the late 90s.  The game looks so beautiful now that it has been upscaled for PC and looks even better on my 50" display (sitting 10 feet back of course).\n\nI really wanted to give a good review since FF are my favorite games, but unfortunately this PC release came out in 2014 and none of these issues should even exisit in the first place.  High DPI monitors are the future and no game should ever make you have to troubleshoot to find out that it is something this simple.  This game should be patched to auto-detect high DPI displays and allow users first time experience to be a plug n play situation like advertized.\n\nSQUARE:  PLEASE KEEP THE FF REMAKES COMING, JUST DO A BETTER JOB AT LAUNCH!!

Good story, with all the Final Fantasy staples thrown in throughout, and I felt engaged for a majority of it.  A job system that is vast (23 jobs), and fun to learn for each unique job. Plenty of things to do beside just level up your character.  And a fight system when mixed with the job system that became quite in depth.  By the end, I was very happy with my in game time saving the crystals as the fabled Warriors of Light.\n\nIf you are a collector of in game items, or achievements, this game is loaded with some time consuming ones or just plain hard ones --  Filling the bestiary with every monster in game.

Plenty of easy, fun achievements as well, and nothing if skipped, that would ruin the full game experience.\n\nI was very pleased with the game as a whole.

While there is a story within this game, and its a decent one, the playable characters are hardly the focus, but more about dungeon exploration and saving the world.\nWhile that might sound bad, it was actually a pleasent experience somewhat, since there are so many classes to try and experiment with for the "right" combination to beat bosses and dungeons and advance in the storyline.\n\nFor example, if you feel a dungeon might have too many locked door, maybe you should bring a thief for that extra treasure. If you experience to have a dungeon filled with monsters weak to magic you want to bring a black mage, and if you feel the need for a good tank to absorb all that physical damage and dish some of that back you may need a viking or a knight.\n\nAlso, the game doesnt hold your hand, they want you to figure out stuff and explore on your own.\n\nAnyway, it had a good strategical depth and for any rpg lover it would satisify but if you´re looking for a good story with great characters, and looking among the older rpg titles, Final Fantasy IV(4) will be a much better choice.\n\nI will still grant this game 8.0/10","January 13, 2015","true","49.0"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","20","27","3","0"

CG cutscenes are gorgeous, battle system and music is classic. Dungeons are very fun, story is as engaging as a typical fantasy game like this could be. Glad they didn't add too much excess story to this game; it feels a bit bare-bones from that, but it's preferred over additions that would stray away from original FF3.\n\nCONS: People have been dealing with technical problems in this port. I myself have run into two issues: a crash that set me back, and a story-related glitch that eventually jarred itself back into working. I'm concerned for continuing, as I fear it may rear its head again in this playthrough because of something I did that triggered it?

Thankfully this has been changed and the game got a nice faithful remake.  All I can say is WOW - I do not know how this game avoided a Western release the first time around, it was fantastic.\n\nAll the making of a traditional FF world (4 Crystals, Warriors of Light, etc. etc.) - and with enough flair and uniqueness to quite distinguish it from basically every other FF game even into modern iterations (I really liked the idea of '2 worlds' one being a floating continent).\n\nThe Job system is awesome and offers a huge variety of choices but does promote some serious grinding if you're into switching around.  If you don't like to grind then chances are you will finish the game with the default classes (Warrior et al.)\n\nProbably the biggest downside to the game is that it features the archaic 'only 3 spells per level' mechanism that existed in FF1 and 2 - this is further aggitated by the fact that the game is no longer limited to simply White and Black Magic - you also have to find room to put your Summons in one of those 3 precious slots per level.  However I can understand that the game is technically just a faithful remake, and the system is what it was when 3 released in Japan.\n\nStorywise this really feels like an early FF - and by that I mean the story is trivial at best (same as I and II).  You could text mash the whole game and you'd likely find you like it just the same as long as you like FF/JRPGs.  That being said - it's not an issue of the story being "bad" so much as the story just didn't latch for me.\n\nGraphically it isn't too bad - it stands somewhere around where 7 does graphically.  7 makes use of parallax backgrounds and imaging layers to give the impression of better 'graphics' for their environments - but when you look at the character models you can see the difference - especially in meshing.   FF7 has better environments, but FF3's character models' meshes and overall 3D details are better - textures are bit poop, but still better than FF7s in most cases.\n\nAll in all it was a positive experience and one day I'll probably play again just for the fun of it.","February 2","true","32.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

What should I say after having cleared the game? The story is well worth to be played and this game is a worth member of the Final Fantasy family. However, it should be contextualized in the years it was produced.\n\nIf you play this game with the eyes of a 80s-90s guy, you can only be amazed and positively surprised by the gameplay, the amazing storyline and the vastness of the world you will travel within, as well as the beasts you will encounter. The remake in 3D graphics maybe is not really nostalgic, but it makes the game experience far more enjoyable than in the past on NES and DS.\n\nIf you play this game with the eyes of a 2000s guy, you will be pretty disappointed: repetitive battle system, too broad job system (some jobs are completely useless, for example I'm really wondering whether anybody has ever used the job Ranger...), too many restrictions on weapons (for example, there is a job, I don't remember which, that can use basic bows and arrows at the beginning, but cannot use the advanced version of both.. Just why??), some almost impossible achievements (if you miss to open a chest or you miss to fight an enemy in some areas which you cannot get in later on, you have missed the achievements, unless you start the game from zero again and pay more attention...).\n\nI am a mixture of both kind of players, nostalgic but not refraining some criticism.\nMy final comment and impression is more than positive anyway, because I'm a huge fun of FF Saga of all eras, and because overall is a very light game which doesn't requere too much effort and time to be played well.\n\nHighly recommended to the historical fans of FF Saga, but good also to approach the JRPG world in a basic and friendly way.","May 23","true","51.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I highly recommend it if you're a fan of old school JRPGs with random encounters and turn-based battles.\n\nThe story is simple, but you have to remember that this is a remake of a game from 1990.  For me, a big part of the appeal is the character customization.  There are dozens of "jobs" (character classes) which you can switch to at any time once you've unlocked them.  Even though the story proceeds in a linear fashion, the character customization gives you a lot of freedom to do what you want - so you have nonlinear choices in that regard.\n\nThe DS version had very low resolution graphics, and it's refreshing to play on a big screen with sharp visuals.  After playing this, I don't think I can go back to the DS version.  Keep in mind that these are still the original low-polygon models.  Personally, I find the low-polygon look to be charming, but some people might not like it.\n\nI've played a lot of games including many RPGs, and this has possibly the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a game.  Yes, even when comparing it to other great soundtracks like Chrono Trigger/Cross and other Final Fantasy games.  The remade FF3 soundtrack is that good.

If you did not know about the missable stuff such as chests and biestary entries then you will probebly end up doing 2 playthroughs. By the time you are done you will most likly have 150+ hours in the game. so far 72 and counting ....\n\nAnyways enough of that. This is a final fantasy game if you already know final fantasy then you will already know the core machanics of this game. It has the turn based battles, level system,job system ( which will drain your life away later... see achievement list)   also has  a world map to explore 3 of them in fact and towns to raid for treasure  *ahem* i mean talk to people and gather information.\n\n\nThe dungeons in this game i found to be pretty straight forward some have basic paths while others later in the game will try to hide stuff via hidden passages.Unless you know your way around i may suggest using maps. ( Nes version maps are pretty accurate to use)\n\nThe story is pretty basic so do not expect anything exciting. 4 warriors of light gather. They go on a journey find the 4 fangs, go through evil barrier, kill the final boss. Granted there are some omg moments within the game. If you played ff2 then just know they followed up on what happens to people that join you  ...\n\nPc port quality is nothing to get hyped about you will be playing with black bars on the left and right side of your screen since this is not full 1920 by 1080. Which is a shame. But it should be no reason not to buy this game. It's good for what it is and should be played by all.\n\npros\n.Follows on classic final fantasy methods of leveling\n.Job system is amazing\n.Lots of places to explore\n.Dungeons are not hard to navigate for newcomers\n\n\ncons\n.I would not reccomend this game to newcomers to the series maybe play 4 or 9 first\n.Lots of grinding for those achievements (which was honestly expected)\n.not full 1920by 1080 which is forgivable because the game is still playable\n\n","February 4, 2015","true","157.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how much of an improvement this game made over the original.  Rather than make an essay about the changes, I'll go point-by-point.\n\n+ Better graphics, obviously.  Granted, the Famicom version looked marvelous in the 8-bit era, but since this is a PC-optimized port of the DS game, I'm glad to see some 3D graphics in there.\n\n+ Better story.  The plot was a lot looser in the original, and the characters had no backstory at all.  By assigning default names to each character and expanding on their origins, the plot feels more cohesive and I connect with the characters better.\n\n+ Better use of the job system.  It's still not as crisp as Final Fantasy V, but the major gripe I had playing the Famicom version is that many job types became obsolete very quickly.  Some were never useful from the start, and the Scholar job was only necessary for one boss fight.  This remake changed all of that.  More jobs are useful for longer periods of time, and even in the late-game stages you can downgrade to a lesser job and still function well.\n\n+ Better difficulty curve.  The original game was HARD.  Frankly, without a strategy guide, beating that game would have been near impossible.  But the remake softens the blow a lot and makes the game much more enjoyable.  You never feel like you're bringing the game to a screeching halt so that you can grind job levels or character levels.  It flows much more smoothly.\n\nOverall, this game was in dire need of a remake, and this one does the job quite well.  If you've never played Final Fantasy III, or if the Famicom version left a bad taste in your mouth, then I strongly recommend picking this up.  You'll be glad you did.","February 13, 2015","true","76.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

FFIII was never released in NA until a few years back, when it was brough to the Nintendo DS & later Android (I assume iOS as well).\n\nThis brings back the job system established in the first FF, with a large variety of jobs to choose from. These include the standard jobs you expect, like white/black/red mage, dark knight, dragoon; and others not commonly found in the FF series, such as viking, onion knight, and scholar. This also brings back a large world to explore, where you are not hand held and running down a hallway for 80 hours, which recent iterations of FF have unfortunatly de-evolved into.\n\nThe graphics are bright, as to be expected of something ported from the DS. No, it has not been updated for the PC, but hey, it's not 8-bit graphics and high pitched MIDI sound killing your eardrums. Character design reminds me of a simple version of those seen in Bravely Default on the 3DS.\n\nI have never been able to get into mobile gaming (the drain on battery murders my phone), and am glad this came over to Steam. If you still need to add this one to your FF collection, and have not played it yet, pick it up as you will not be disapointed.","May 28, 2014","true","61.1"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Final Fantasy IV and VI made up for it...\n\nAgain, if you hate job systems and grinding, stay away from this game.

The remake was created for the Nintendo DS, and has some enhancements. I never had an NES, maybe it was just luck, because that way the game was quite crisp for me. I lost all confidence in consoles during the early 80s and the big console crash, since that time I exclusively use computers instead of consoles.\n\nThe game has a lot of upgrades, as far as I remembered the NES game had graphics which could be compared to older RPGMaker games. This has been changed, also there is a lot more of actual interaction between the characters. And the Jobs (or Classes) have to be leveled seperately to the Skill Level. The game also has a lot of grinding, which is kind of a drawback in some times, but in this game grinding actually makes a lot of sense.\n\nPros:Enhanced Graphics, Sound and Intro. The Intro alone is quite a show.The game was updated without destroying the charm of the original, including the different jobs.The game actually is very easy to learn and offers an intuitive access to the game world.\nCons:Attention, to really and actually experience the game to it's fullest you have to grind a lot, the jobs require as much attention as the skill level and equipment itself.The story is a bit to shallow, but that's only a small drawback for the game.\nRecommended\nThe game is good and worth it's money, it will bind you for quite some time and you'll be happy to get around a large gameworld with some strange stories and even stranger history. The Final Fantasy series always has been regarded as a hallmark of Roleplaying games, even back on the NES consoles. And yes, this notion is true, this game does a lot of stuff in a very correct and user friendly way, while at the same time it tries not to overdo some critical matters. The gameplay might be called linear, right - but you still can fail, and you might have to reload the save game.","January 3","true","117.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The redsign of the game was primarily only a visual & audio makeover (updated music, '3D' environments & sprites, etc). The gameplay and construction are almost identical to the original.\n\nThis means that there really isn't much at all to the story, and the characters are pretty much completely flat. So if you're expecting the rich development you'd find in the story and characters of the later installments in the series (pretty much any of them after this one), look elsewhere.\n\nFurther, the maps used in the original games have been retained here - and that includes the limitations in design, as  So, similar to the limited story, dialogue, and characters, you'll find that they're disappointingly simple.\n\nWhile all the above might seem like a pile of complaints, it's actually not. What has been redone, has been redone well. The visuals are limited to that of a DS, however im finding that the music is really enjoyable. All in all, it's been a fun experience - just don't expect this to compare to the modern (high-budget) maserpieces that the Series produces.\n\nBottom line: if you're looking for a nostalgic feel with a bit of modern flavor, this just might hit the spot.","January 27","true","28.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game still manages to feel like an NES game with NES difficulty, but without terrible amounts of frustration.

The default keyboard controls are extremely responsive and easy to use. Every key is individually rebindable. The game itself runs flawlessly. Being a port of a 3DS game does not hold FFIII back, you get the definitive edition buying it on PC.\n\nBut it's not without some issues.

It's remakes like this that allow me to see what the first generation of Final Fantasy games were like. Heck, they were pretty good.\n\nI am fully aware that this is a port of the DS version, but it is still great to play some of the older games in this new console generation, as the current generation of FF games have not lived up to their expectations. Except A Realm Reborn. Damn that was good.\n\nFinal Fantasy III was the only FF game that was not released in NA or Europe until the 2006 DS remake, and like said above this is esentially the same game. It was also the first FF game to introduce the Jobs system, a mechanic which allows you to choose and switch between different classes in-game, a system that has been used in many Final Fantasy games in the following years.\n\nFinal Fantasy III is pretty much your standard Final Fantasy game. Magic chrystal, mystical bossfights, cliché characters and damn hard boss fights. I can see any fan of the series enjoying this game, but it's not something for new comers. If you want to get yourself into the FF universe, start off with FF VII - which is widely regarded as the best Final Fantasy game (not in my opinion, but hey)\n\nAll in all, as a fan of the series I can say I have enjoyed the DS version and this PC port.

It's highly doubtful if you're looking at this that you're not familiar with the Final Fantasy series. The fact that Square-Enix has decided to start bringing them back to PC over the year and a half or so is definitely welcome.\n\nMajor Criticisms?\n\nI have none. I'm not going to nitpick about the graphic quality, or anything like that. Apparently this is a port from the Nintendo DS version of the game? Who cares? I would be happy if it had the same graphics as the original version, as long as it's on PC and I can obtain it easily. I do have a minor gripe, which is just that the animations aren't that smooth during battles and things like that, but the graphical quality hits around that of PS1/N64-era gaming, so I'm okay with that. After all, it's the Final-friggin-Fantasy III reboot, and I don't own a DS, so I'm pleased as punch...(So to speak.)\n\nOverall\n\nI'm giving this a 10/10, because it's a Final Fantasy game. Everything about it is grape, aside from my minor gripe, and I'm not going to deduct points for that. I just hope that Square-Enix keeps these coming, because I would love to see Final Fantasy 9, 10, and 12 get thrown onto PC. I understand why they're doing them in the order that they are, and it's largely due to ease of porting each game from their respective consoles to PC.\n\nAgain, 10/10 - No major complaints.

I don't hate it, I just think it's the weakest of the first five Final Fantasy games--and the 3D remake doesn't really improve anything.\n\n\nAesthetically, I liked the chibi/Mii/MySims-looking character models more than I thought I would. Your main characters are all adorable, and the costumes for all the different classes are fairly detailed and interesting (though they look better in the menu thumbnails). But the character models are also really twitchy during battle sequences.\n\nIn general, I'm a big fan of the art style used for the Game Boy Advance remakes of these games. The smaller, more realistic sprites did a good job of capturing the dark, intricate, fantastical feel of the classical Final Fantasy universes. Look at the concept art from FFI-V. It's all weird, exotic, and unearthly, and I think the GBA remakes did a much better job capturing that feel with their overall designs. This game, however, goes for a more generic, cartoony atmosphere as part of an appeal to younger and more casual gamers.\n\nThe backgrounds to the battle sequences are the only truly appealing visual element in the game. Environments look empty and bland, both in the overworld and in towns and dungeons. Enemy models lack detail and also come across as bland. One of the advantages of the hand-drawn sprites from the GBA games is that they portray each enemy in a carefully designed, static pose, so each enemy gets to look pretty cool. In a 3D game, you see the whole enemy, and the enemy moves around even when it isn't attacking, so most enemy models come across as lackluster or unimpressive.\n\nThe transition to 3D also changes the way your character moves in the game. Instead of moving tile-by-tile, you have free range of movement--which means your character will get stuck on corners a lot. Furthermore, the near walls in every dungeon consist entirely of empty shadows, and it be difficult to see certain doors and entrances as a result (although hidden passages are usually grossly obvious).\n\nI imagine I would enjoy this game more if I played it on the DS. The default keyboard controls are about as unintuitive as possible, and you can only change the controls on the start-up menu before you actually launch the game. A GBA remake would have been even better, I think, but I still think I would consider it my least favorite original Final Fantasy game.\n\nFor one thing, while the game has a fine story, the pacing and exposition are weird. You often have to extrapolate beyond what characters say if you want to have any clue what's actually going on. Usually, a FF game's story is easy to follow despite its many twists and turns, but this game has you holding on for dear life in terms of comprehension. One problem is that the game is a little too open-ended at points. You can often start down several storylines by visiting different towns, but you may have to wait for a few dungeons and crucial plot developments before these storylines ever feature into the central plot. The game allows for a lot of exploration, which is fun in its own right, but there aren't always worthwhile rewards to finding new areas before you're "supposed" to.\n\nAlso, the game has a frustrating tendency to almost require you to switch jobs in certain ways at certain places. For instance, the game features multiple (multiple!) dungeons that require you to traverse them under the effects of the spell Mini--which essentially makes all your physical fighters useless. Other sections of the game clearly push you toward   classes like the dragoon or the dark knight by giving you loads of specialized equipment in anticipation of a boss battle or an enemy type that will be hard to deal with otherwise. These gameplay designs would make for excellent teaching tools--if this my first time playing a game with an involved job system. It's not. These sections also hurts the game's replay value, since even experienced players don't always have total freedom to experiment with the different job classes and set up the party they want to use.\n\nIn fact, the job system in this game is kind of a letdown. One problem with being able to change characters' jobs at will is keeping track of all their equipment. While there is a fair amount of overlap in terms of which jobs can use what weapons and armors, carrying around or storing all that junk gets annoying after a while. And while most jobs progress pretty quickly, there isn't too much incentive to gain job levels with most classes. At most, a higher job level changes one or two minor calculations for class-specific actions you won't always use all that often. Job level is more important for mages, since I'm pretty sure it influences the MP they gain. Unlike the job system in, say, FFV, there are no major rewards for mastering a class either. You can't take abilities or even base stats (except HP) with you when you change classes.\n\nBut I think my biggest gripe about this game is its horrendously uneven gameplay. This game expects you to grind for several levels between just about every major dungeon. Try to go straight from one plot point to the next and you will probably lose. The boss battles are the worst offenders of all--they are all really, really hard. Regardless of how easily you managed to get through a dungeon's standard enemies, when you reach the boss, there is a good chance you will get a game over. And with no mid-dungeon save points, that means replaying an entire chunk of the game. Each boss is exactly the same too--they all attack twice with either hard physical attacks (that can inflict statuses) or magic spells that hit your entire party for heavy damage. The challenge doesn't come from figuring out an optimal strategy; it comes entirely from luck, as bosses have an unusual tendency to target your weakest characters and throw you back on your heels in survival mode.\n\nThe game gets better as it goes along, fortunately, and the vast job system does provide a lot of replay value. I'm just pretty sure I would rather replay Final Fantasy I on the GBA than fight through this game again--what with all its problems and its decided lack of polish.","October 14, 2014","false","25.0"," 29 of 57 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","29","57","0","2"

If your already familiar with FF3 and merely looking to see what this PC port brings to the table, i cant recommend that the price is worth your time, equally if your looking for a decent JRPG on the PC, the poor port quality and how harsh and aged this game really is means that i cant recommend this over say child of light or Recettear.\n\nHowever if you are intruiged to see what FF3 brings to the table on its own, and dont have access to the mobile ports (which could likely be found cheaper for the exact same content) and the sounds of a tough as nails old school JRPG sound good to you, then id recommend jumping in, maybe during a sale, theres just no reason this game should cost this much, 50% off though and id say go for it,","May 28, 2014","false","0.8"," 77 of 153 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","77","153","0","6"

That's how old the mechanics/storyline are. HOWEVER, there have been quite a few tweaks made to bring it up to date with what you would expect of a good RPG ... In the 90's. As far as storyline goes, it's pretty bland and generic. Collect the crystals, beat the bad guys, save the world. It does have some hidden humorous elements in it, but they're few and far between. This game is badly dated, but it's still a solid essential for a Final Fantasy fan, and it is enjoyable up to about level 40, when the grind from 40-60 begins, it will take you about three hours on a good day, and you pretty much need to be 60 to beat the game. DO NOT go into this game thinking you will 100% every aspect of it, and if you do, for the sake of sanity, make sure you kill every sea creature while you still have your sea boat, or you'll be SOL for getting that beastiary achievement.

The only thing that requires real grinding is the secret boss, but that's pretty much to be expected. That said i personally found the game quite easy, except for the last dungeon which ends up being quite interesting. Also beware that while it has an awesome soundtrack, there is no real deep story, no voice actors and the graphic is quite old.

It was just a bunch of unspecified quadruplet twins in the original, while here they actually created the characters for you to know.

While the story suffers from a few hiccups now and then, it never feels dull or grey. This remake takes you back to a time when games were challenging, testing the skill of the player, not just giving them consquence-less respawns. Example; Modern Game: "Last boss of the dungeon! *Dies* *Respawns at entrance to boss*"\nFFIII: "Last boss of the dungeon! *Dies* ...wait...WAIT....WHAT!? I Haven't saved in hours!" This level of difficulty is shunned by most, but beloved by the rest. Games have not "Advanced". Have you noticed 95% of NEW games (2010+) are 89% cutscenes or QTE's? That's not gaming. That's proving that the gaming industry as a whole is dumbing their games down because of the apparent lack of motivation. FFIII is an example of how a game is meant to be, challenging yet rewarding. A game with a safe-fail system is in no regards challenging. It disappoints me to see the gaming companies flourish with so little effort put into their games (yes, you too Square). So please, if you want a REAL challenge, put your modern rpg away and pick this gem up.","December 17, 2014","true","18.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DCT/recommended/239120/","DCT","DCT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DCT/","559 products in account","Final Fantasy 3 has joined Final Fantasy 7 and 8 on Steam, now keep in mind this is Final Fantasy 3 and not Final Fantasy 6 which was released in the US as 3(seems some people are still confused about that). This is also a port of the iOS/Android version which in turn was a port of the DS remake which took the orginal Famicom game and gave it a upgrade with a FMV intro, 3d graphics, though ps1/N64 level 3d graphics so expect some low poly models, revamped soundtrack and a reworked storyline which is still very light in narrative and a few other changes such as not starting the game with your full party and not having access to your first set of jobs till after the second dungeon. In the original you get your first set of jobs after beating the first boss in the intro/tutorial dungeon which makes the game a bit more harder when you reach the second dungeon.\n\nNow this game is fairly old school so expect to have to do quite a bit of grinding for exp. before tackling the next dungeon or else your going to have a bad time, seriously the next dungeon after the tutorial one is packed with hard hitting undead that will wipe the floor with your party.\n\nThe game was the first in the series to make use of the "Job" system which means you pick what "job" each of your four charecters have and can change them for diffrent ones but unlike Final Fantasy 5 you really can't keep the skills learned from each job, so in other words you can have a charecter be a white mage and then become a ninja and still have access to white mage magic but you can move magic between charecters.\n\nBut despite this, the light narrative, the grinding and the old school "ask around to get clues on to what you may need to do next" style of gameplay it's pretty fun if not hard. So if you can look past the low poly models and the old school RPG mechanics this is a worth while game but not for the asking price, maybe 9.99 or so sure but not at 14.99 so you may want to wait to see if it goes on sale and grab it then.","June 4, 2014","true","8.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The game has wonderful visuals all around, and a nice difficulty. It's not easy, but it's not unbearable either. As soon as you get stuck, you just take a break, then go back and grind a few levels and you should be fine.\n\nFinal Fantasy III saw the introduction of the job system, and there's a lot to choose from so you don't really get tired of your party.

No matter where you are in the game, your story progress can be ultimately reset back to the starting town, Ur. You'll have to go through the whole story once again with three of the four characters going back to level 3/4. (Un)Fortunately, Luneth keeps his level, you keep all your items/spells, and all characters keep their job levels and current jobs.\n\nIf you still wish to buy this game, or have already bought it and are reading reviews after buying a game, just be sure to save frequently, but save carefully. If at any time you notice that your job icon is unavailable, fall back to your last save. If the job icon can't be chosen, it means that your game has been set back to the beginning of the storyline.\n\nIf you have a Nintendo DS or iOS device, or even a NES, I'd just recommend you buy it for that hardware to avoid this flaw.","January 1","false","27.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As a PC gamer I had never played FF games below 7 and never planned to. But this port changed my mind, but only for a few hours. While the battles do play out noticebly different from FF 7 to 9, the story leaves much to hope for. It all feels way too linear and predictable, perhaps due to low available memory on original platforms.\n\nOther than fulfilling achievements there is not much to strive a reward for. In the older games seeing the cinematics was one of those rewards. In this case, while the port gives extra cinematics, there is only the opening cinematic, which doesn't tell new players anything. It is as if Square Enix published this to the players of the original directly. That mistake makes me not recommend this game and question the ports of FF 5 and 6.","March 15","false","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phalthrax/recommended/239120/","phalthrax","PhalThrax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phalthrax/","118 products in account","Final Fantasy III was initially a mystery to gamers outside of Japan, having only been released on the Famicom in 1990. Since then, Final Fantasy III has been re-released several times; Nintendo DS, Playstation Portable, Wii’s Virtual Console, iOS, Android, and most recently making its way here to Steam. The game’s format and mechanics may feel a bit dated/unusual to those familiar with newer Final Fantasy titles, but I believe that the game still provides a worthwhile playing experience.\n\nMy first exposure to this game was the Nintendo DS version, which I picked up used for quite a bargain. That version is a 3D remake of the original Famicom game, and it appears that this PC version stayed loyal to that style. Due to the limited specifications on the Nintendo DS, I always felt that the game was a bit held back in the graphics and sound department. This PC version seems to have given the artwork better treatment, and appears to resemble the PSP version of the game more closely. I was concerned that the graphics would be overly pixelated due to the small resolution on handhelds, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the graphics felt right for PC.\n\nThe music, as usual in Final Fantasy titles, is superb. As a remake, they stayed very true to the themes present on the Famicom release. Many of the musical themes fit the mood of the game quite well, allowing the player to enjoy a calm stroll through a town or a hectic boss battle at the end of a dungeon. The sound quality is superb, as well, and doesn’t have the muffled sounds that the DS version provided.\n\nFinal Fantasy III’s combat system strays far from the system of its predecessor, and attempts to advance the system that was originally present in the original Final Fantasy. The player has the option to choose from a variety of jobs. As the player advances through the game and completes various quest “checkpoints” (for lack of a better word), additional jobs open up. Some of these jobs which offer a brand new range of healing, magic and utility, while some are simply upgrades to existing jobs. There are over two dozen jobs in total, giving players many chances to experiment. Along with jobs, this is the first Final Fantasy game to introduce summons. So if you’re familiar with summons in later titles such as Shiva and Bahamut, you’ll be right at home.\n\nAn immersing story has been an important part of the Final Fantasy franchise in recent years. Going back in time, however, it wasn’t always this way. In Final Fantasy III, the story is notably flat compared to the extended stories present in modern RPG titles. It’s easy to understand, rarely sees plot twists, and has a relatively small cast of characters. It’s nothing spectacular, but it was a step ahead from the two previous entries in the series. Unlike the Famicom Final Fantasy III, however, the characters in this version are given formal names. Despite the limited storytelling, I still feel it’s pleasant; just don't go in expecting a 50 hour long legendary tale.\n\nThe difficulty of this game is a bit jarring. The early game starts off quite bearable, giving players the ability to simply auto attack their way through many of the fiends. As the game progresses, the difficulty spikes up considerably. The final dungeons are notoriously difficult due to lack of save points and insufficient materials provided throughout the game. Compared to the difficulty of some modern Final Fantasy titles, the harsh difficulty in this game might turn some people away. But if you can fight through the barrage of random encounters and somehow make it through the dungeon, you’ll be rewarded with quite a sense of accomplishment.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that Final Fantasy III is a worthy purchase for those who wish to revisit the roots of the Final Fantasy franchise, and JRPGs in general. It’s difficult, but rewarding. A worthy game for the name “Final Fantasy.”","May 27, 2014","true","66.7"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jayman29/recommended/239120/","jayman29","Jayman29","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jayman29/","99 products in account","I started playing final fantasy games about 10 years ago. I started with final fantasy X and was hooked shortly after. The series is amazing but I never went back to play anything below FFX. I heard the hype behind FFVII but I never like to buy into hype because it only serves to disappoint me usually. That being said, the very early final fantasys had sprites and I was not too interested in the low detail so I stayed on the other side of FFX.\n\nNow, I saw this on sale at the Humble Store and I figured it would be a good time to try the older Final Fantasy games, given the polish this game had recieved.\n\nIt has a piece of gaming that I had missed with all the new games in the world now. It makes you want to play just because you want to discover new things. Not for the sake of driving the plot forward or saving X amount of people. It lets you do what you want and I get legitimately excited when I open a chest or find a new hidden area. It makes me feel like when I first started to play video games all so long ago and I haven't had this feeling since Valkyrie Profile:Leneth for the PSP. I actually want to grind and level my party up so I can kill monster and gain treasure. Almost a feeling akin to Skyrim but less open.\n\nI guess it plays to the basic nature that players want to get treasure and go adventuring. Not for someone else but to see a new world, take a break from reality, of only for a moment. This game gives me a feeling I sought for a while and makes me like to play with the jobs and test out different party combinations.\n\nNow, the game still has a linear story with areas opening up as you progress the role you are "destined" to fulfill but the game doesn't push that on you too hard. You know that you have to save the world or some such thing but it isn't the reason you are playing. Or at least why I am playing. It doesn't seem to be wanting to center itself around the plot. It seems to want to center itself around you doing what you wish the areas open to you leading up to the plot driven boss battle so you can continut the quest.\n\nIn conclusion, it gives you the illusion of freedom even though it blocks you off at some points. The exploring of new caves and little hidden sparkles is fun. 10/10 would review again :D","August 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","3"

The game is in 30 fps. Yes, this doesn't matter much for RPG's but it's really annoying to see the jerky battle animations at 30 fps.\n\nSound/Music - 7/10. Average sound/music for a Final Fantasy game.\n\nGameplay - 3/10. While the job system is nice (when it doesn't break, see below) it's beyond boring. Traveling around the world is a pain, and the world itself is pretty small. The dungeons were very unexciting and so were the boss fights.\n\nStory - 1/10. The story is extremely straightforward with little depth. To avoid spoilers I won't reveal anything, but I was extremely disappointed with this game's storyline. There is little to no character development.\n\n\nOverall: 3/10. Don't bother playing this one unless one of the following applies to you:\n\n1. You're a diehard Final Fantasy fan and don't have access to the DS or Famicon version\n2. You don't mind running into a game breaking bug that will make you pull your hair out\n\nThe story reset bug in this port is game breaking.\n\nExample of the bug here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rahdgTTSob4\n\nThe bug set me back 30+ hours. All I wanted to do was finish the game so I never have to play it again.

And anyone who ever played a Final Fantasy-game should probably get it. It really is a great remake of classic that took a very long time to come the rest of the world besides Japan.\n\nPro's:\n+ They kept the charm of the orginal game (when making this they really kept an eye out to how the original game was made. And especially with the game mechanics, like the job-system and battle-system they kept very close to  the orignal)\n+ Job System (The job system is a definent pro of this game, you can take on any job any time you want, as long as you have access to it. However you do need to make tactical choices for which character, you gonna lean more on magic, cause when switched you have to begin again)\n+ Music (The music is one of the plusses of the game, great masterpieces that remind you that you are really playing a JRPG)\n+ Hope for more to come (Though this might not be linked to the game, it is a pro. Seeing that they did port this game to the PC, who knows what is more to come. The library is still extensive)\n\nMaybe's:\n* Graphics (I personally am very charmed by the graphics. I like this kind of art-style. It's also why I liked a lot of the RPG's on the DS. Plus the fact that they are indeed more detailed then on the DS. But however I can understand that some people are turned of by it. Take a cllose look to the screenshots, cause this is what you gonna get)\n* Story (The story is a standard RPG-one. World is in peril and you have to save it. It doesn't have any super crazy plot twists or points, but it's more fleshed out then the orginal NES-story.)\n* Difficulty (The game has a definent steep difficulty curve at some points in the game. Sometimes you can cruise right through a dungeon, only to find out in the next one you are major underleveled. This however is easier then the orginal game. They had also a bit more severe penalties on job-switching. It is a challenge. But if you are up for it. You gonna enjoy this)\n\nCon's\n- None (Personally I don't think this game has any con's really. A few maybe's yes. But it doesn't need you to sign in to Square-Enix as Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII did. It's a real loveletter to the old classic Final Fantasy's. So yeah, it's a good game)","May 28, 2014","true","1.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

FF III Introduces the job system - a staple in later games in the series. A fair remake of an 8-bit game, with updated polygonal graphics (a port of the Nintendo DS version), modern audio, animated cut scenes, and illustrated character profiles. There are some heldover design relics though - such as a clunky interface and useless quick save system (quick saves are not persistent).\n\nAs brutal as any early Final Fantasy game if one does not know where to go for leveling. The challenge makes for rewarding advancement. Exploration is encouraged, even backtracking over previously cleared areas can reveal new items.

Although a bit on the one-dimensional side, giving the Four Light Warriors an ounce of backstory and personality was a nice touch, and doesn't diminish the minimalist charm for the tale. A couple achievements really aren't worth it, and half are just natural if you intend to complete the game. If you've beaten the DS port, the only real thing this has up on it is you don't need to use Mognet to send letters to friends to unlock equipment and bonus quests (the Mognet messages you need are cued to in-game criteria, thus not as gimmicky). It also took some manual editing of the config file to get my controller to work the way I wanted, since it currently doesn't auto-map buttons.

There isn't much to say about the game itself that hasn't been said a million times during the decades. Solid early Square JRPG, originally for the NES. If you liked FF1 and 2, this is pretty much a sure bet. (This revamp of the game is also nice because the original FF3 was never exported back in the day, so not many people got to play it.)\n\nThe graphical upgrade is interesting. They could have gone the same route as with what they did with FF1 and FF2 when they remade them for the PSP and DS, iow. keep it 2D, just with modern graphics. Instead of that, they chose simplistic PlayStation1-style "retro-3D" graphics. This was an interesting choice, and it works. It brings the extra depth that 3D provides (in more senses than just the added third dimension), but still manages to keep a nostalgic "retro" feeling to it. They could have botched it up, but it works fine.\n\nFor someone who has never played JRPGs, and especially someone who has only played modern games, the visuals and gameplay may feel appalling at first. The game may feel extremely simplistic, even boring, both from a visual and a gameplay perspective. However, if you give it a chance, I'm sure that you'll end up loving it. (And of course if you are a long-time old gamer like me, you'll probably love it right away.)\n\nWorks very well with an Xbox360 controller out-of-the-box (although the in-game hints always refer to the keyboard keys, so you have to sometimes find the buttons by trial-and-error.)","June 1, 2014","true","46.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Time hasn't been kind to it, and it remains a fairly trite roll through JPRG cliches of the last 20 years.\n\nThat's not to say it's without merit.  It's perfectably serviceable, it functions and controls well, looks fairly decent for a DS port, has interesting challenges and generally does everything it needs to satisfactorily.  If you're not looking for anything mind-blowing or deep then it's a pretty fun way to kill 20 hours or so.\n\nHowever, it is incredibly straightforward.  There's none of the emotional depth we've come to associate with the FF series, the characters are droll to the point of non-existence, the plot a simple series of macguffin fetch quests.  The job system is superficially interesting, but obtuse and grind-heavy.  The world is twee and standard, filled with cut-and-paste towns devoid of charm or character.\n\nOverall, if you're simply looking for a simple fun romp through JRPG tropes you could do a lot worse, but don't expect any more than that.  For more mature, deep or involving games, you should probably look elsewhere.","January 24","false","39.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

My main reason for saying that is because of what i said in the first line, it is nearly an exact IOS port, and in my opinion is not worth the 16ish dollars they are charging for the game. Another huge issue i have with the game that i find very frustrating is the combat. This game uses the job system, and the set up for the job system is what makes it a deal breaker for me. For you're character to get points to level up their job, they have to take action in battle. If two of you're characters kill all the foes before you're other two members get a chance to attack, then only the two who fought get the job points for that battle. So if you happen to be using the mage classes, it will be very difficult to keep them up to pace with the other jobs because they will hardly ever get points. If you are loyal FF fan and you can get past the issues, then this game might we worth picking up if it was on sale. But i paid full price for the game, and can already tell that i 100% regret it.","May 28, 2014","false","3.3"," 29 of 62 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","29","62","0","0"

It's not asking to much to put in features that have been standard for the last decade! Square lies AGAIN !   My thumbs down is more the fact that Square slapped this together and resold it as Enhanced when they really did virtualy nothing new in the game. I would be be fine with it as is if not for the claims of upgrading it for the PC. The adjustments are very minor and odds are an emulated version of the DS game would look as good if not better.  In sumation looks okish, plays good,. does NOT however meet the claims made not even close. You Dont upconvert a VHS and call it an all new HD experience on blu ray  thats just insulting.

It works pretty well and the controls can be remapped to your liking within the settings (you will want to do this as the game doesn't really do a tutorial immediately, but rather after the first "mission." I prefer to have the controls mapped to your typical wasd setting and replaced "enter" with the "f" key so I play a majority of the time with my left hand).\n\nThere are many options for resolutions, though it should be noted that the resolution is not at a 16:9 ratio but a 4:3 from the looks of things. A complaint that I have is that under settings they give you the option of playing the game in fullscreen, which is nice right? Well the game seems to default to fullscreen no matter what you put down so keep that in mind.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the price is higher than Final Fantasy VII and VIII, however I understand that the game itself is available on iOS and Android for the same price of $15, so the publisher is to blame for the high price.\n\nThe game itself is a classic within the RPG genre, and I myself enjoy the unique look that was given to this game as it differs from your typical FF art style. I would strongly recommend you consider buying the game if it dips as low as Final Fantasy VII and VIII (roughly around $11).","May 28, 2014","true","16.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

For each level of magic requires its own 'MP'. The higher your Job level the more MP you gain. Not a bad system to that point, what really lets it down is you can only have 3 spells on each level. As far as I know and I could indeed be wrong but you cannot remove the spells once learned, again dont take my word on this point but I couldn't personally, remove them.\n\nThe only way to gain MP is through 'springs' and 'resting @ an Inn'. Sometimes there are just none of either. So yeah, fustratting.\n\n\nThe Jobs part of the game is far too shallow.\n\nThe ONE thing that drives me insane and I mean INSANE is the sheer amount of 'random battles', I mean dear mother of god  you cant go a few feet but you're in yet ANOTHER battle. It makes the game incredibly annoying and you combine that with a few of the points I made above, it makes for just a pain in the butt experience.\n\nThe storyline seems decent but the game mechanics are too simple.\n\nIn short if your a die hard fan such as myself, then play this, you'll enjoy it to some extent anyway.\n\nOther than that, I dont recommend this one.","June 20, 2014","true","4.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Obviously there are more nuances there, but this is where the game truly feels its age with each character essentially being a blank canvas. The writing is interesting enough to offset the generic overtones though, it's generally something that Square are very good at. I want to emphasize that the story itself isn't bad though, you just shouldn't go in expecting something incredible.\n\n(There's nothing wrong with this trope, seeing as Square was a large part of its popularity)\n\nThe gameplay is traditional turn based, using your agility stat to determine where you appear in a queue. Some abilities have higher priorities and will therefore be used first, if your agility equals someone elses.\n\nThe development system uses the Job system, and FFIII was the first Final Fantasy that let you freely change jobs outside of battle. You have jobs like White Mage (healer), Black Mage (nuker) and Knight (tank). There are lots of jobs to use, and you can make a party of your choosing. The development system is relatively shallow, but has enough depth to keep things interesting. This system was then perfected in Final Fantasy V. (steam release please)\n\nThe Magic system is a little bit iffy, instead of having a standard MP pool, you have a number of uses tacked on to each level of magic (which raises through levels) which means you could use nine level 1 spells and still use a level 2 spell after that, assuming you had charges for level 2 magic. You're also limited to only 3 slots per level of magic, meaning you have to make a decision on which magicks you want to use (especially if you use a red mage) I feel like they improved on this in subsequent titles. (MP pool, no choosing magicks)\n\nThe difficulty curve can make the game frustrating at points and too easy at other points, but it's never unfair or completely simple.\n\nVisually the game looks OK. I've never personally been a fan of the DS esque chibi art though, so take that with a grain of salt. The game itself upscales pretty well, and looks nice on the PC unless you stare too intently and some of the textures.\n\nThe controls are ok, and very intuitive if you're using a controller and you've ever played another Final Fantasy game. The menus can be a bit sluggish sometimes, but it's never to the point of frustration. The zoom feature can be a pain sometimes too, but again it's never too bad.\n\nIs this game worth the price tag? Yes and no. You will get £11($17)'s worth of content out of the game, but it does seem a little pricey seeing as this is a port of a port, and considering that you can buy FFVII and VIII for so cheap on steam currently. If you're a fan of the series or want a solid turn based RPG to keep you busy for a while, then I'd suggest picking it up. If you're unsure then I would wait until it comes on sale.\n\nOh and the music? The music is fantastic.","May 28, 2014","true","8.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

It's like they gave one guy, one week, to get it ready for PC.\n\nI could live with the bad texturing, if that was all that was wrong. The enviroment art probably just looked low budget on the DS. It's just that when played on a larger screen, it stands out like, "LOOK AT ALL THESE SEAMS". Minecraft texture pack artists would shake their heads, and wonder how this passed quality controls at SquareEnix. Do they even have quality control for ports?\n\nThen there's the controls. No one even managed to add proper controller support. On a game that was ported from a console. How does that happen? I bought the game after a few patches, but when an on-screen prompt is displayed, it askes me to push a button on a Nintendo controller. Not a keyboard button, not an Xbox360 controller button, or a generic equivalent. Going into the menu to look them up, led to finding just a random numbering of buttons on the controller. Indie devs usually do a better job than this.\n\nAnd I am only an hour into the game. I'll probably add more to this as I play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluemagican/recommended/239120/","bluemagican","BlueMagican","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluemagican/","395 products in account","While I like the fact that Squre Enix is attempting to let people play games that they may not have had access too in the past this game sufferes from one critical flaw which to me makes it pointless to pay for... even 2 cents is too much for it.  Before I go into the negative aspects though let me touch on some of the positives.  This game has many good things going for it, the first of which I already mentioned, its a game that alot of folks never had access too.\n\nNext its based off fo the Nintnedo DS/PSP rerelease of the game, which orginially was on the Nintendo Entertainment System (well techinically the Famicom but alot of folks dont know what that is) so don't expect the new combat styles of say Final Fantasy XIII.  This is classic old school Final Fantasy goodness... and the basis of which you see reflected in many future games.  Some things such as the job system are still seen feflected in the modern games.  The graphics are nice, though the font is a little ugly, the music as always is beautiful.\n\nWhat kills this game completley for me is are simple things that Square Enix could fix and in fact I've contacted Square Enix about and they dont really care about them.  If you are playing the game with and I mean this litterally, ANY NON MICROSOFT 360 WIRED CONTROLLER then the game will lock up and freeze on you.  I worked with Square about this and their solution was to unplug my Mad Catz Wired Xbox 360 controller and plug in a Microsoft branded one.  Though playtesting I can confirm that even having the controller plugged in but not in use crashes the game.\n\nEdit:  I can confirm that a wired Xbox 360 controller works just fine.  For anyone curious as to why the Microsoft 360 Wireless controller doesn't work, its because it requires Bluetooth, even when pluged in using an USB adapter.  All the USB adapter does is charge the controller it doesn't acutally function as in the same way a wired controller does.\n\nSo in short they don't want you to pay 15 for the game.  They want you to pay 15 for the game, and approximately 40 for the controller makeing the cost of this Final Fantasy game 55 dollars.  (Edit:  You can now find the controllers for around 25 dollars on sites like Amazon, but still its an unstaded addtional cost if you want to use a controller.)  Yes I could play the game with nothing plugged in but as someone who plays a lot of diffrent games on my cast this isn't very reasonable, plus Final Fantasy Games just don't feel right being played with a keyboard.  (Edit:  In addition as many people who have problems with carpal tunnel have pointed out using a controller is much easyer on them ta hen using the keyboard.)\n\nIn short the cost of this game is 55 bucks.... I can go buy a brand new Triple A title game for that much.  I'd rather just get this while its on sale on PSN (which happens fairly regularly) or get a modded DS so I can play my DS version.  Avoid at all costs untill fixed IMHO.\n\nEdit:  Since I can now post a longer version of this I wanted to expand my review.  Another problem with this veresion of the game is that it has many bugs.  One of which is a fatal game flaw in which if characters die you can lose all your progress.  By this I mean you can lose the abilitiy to change jobs, your ships/boats which are required for travel, and other simular bugs.\n\nThis has since been verified by a caster I have a great amount of respect for: Crumps2 who is currently (as of 12/4/14) playing though all the Final Fantasy games on Twitch.tv.  This has caused him and Cereth the other caster that is playing though all the games to acutally ABANDON this game untill such time as they can get modified Nintendo DS systems to be able to play the game.  Once again, buy at your own risk.","August 12, 2014","false","10.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","4"

This is a plotless, characterless, timewasting grind.\n\nLong Review.\nLets start with the basics. I used to play the old final fantasy games on the SNES, which were great and even now worth playing on an emulator. I saw this on sale, saw the job class system and was reminded of one of my favourite FF games with the same idea. I thought i'd enjoy this game even more with the enhanced graphics and suchlike. Wrong.\n\nThe job classes\nI'm about a quarter of the way through the game and i'm about level 25 out of level 99 on my first job for each character. It is only because of reading the wiki page I find out that there is no significant benefit at all to mastering a class.\nIn the prior version, sticking with a class and mastering it was a good idea. If one of your characters mastered being a white mage, then you could select white magic as a secondary ability when you started a new class. This allowed for interesting and varied job combinations. This new version makes you start from scratch every time you start a new job. There are even better versions of the starting jobs which you will have to grind through again to make them any good since they will draw no benefit from having ground from the basic class. Utter time wasting and demoralising.\n\nThe characters\nWeak and shallow. A few lines of dialogue to establish the basic idea and then thats it. You might get one line here and there to create the illusion that the characters have any depth, but really? I've not met one person in the game which with a worthwhile personality. Even the villains which should be the driving force of a game are non-exisitant. Once you've ground through a dungeon you get to meet someone with two lines of dialogue before you kill them. Yawn. This is just endless grinding, over and over.\n\nThe plot\nWait? There's a plot? Really? A few lines from some crystal to tell you that you're the chosen one and then you're off. Um... is that it? You bet it is. Save the world? Uh... it looks fine to me. No maurading armies, no cataclysmic natural disasters, no iconic villians with master plans. Just a vague reference to darkness being imbalanced. It's like a stoned aromatherapist ate some alphabet soup and ♥♥♥♥ out a story.\n\nOverall\nIf you like endless grinding and having to start characters over again and again, not having to worry about plots, characters or indeed anything being memorable about the game, then this is the one for you.\nI'm going to be uninstalling this and finding a SNES emulator to play some decent final fantasy.","February 14, 2015","false","7.1"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

This game is hard, but that is something that grinding can fix. What really bothered me, is that you are a good level to complete everything in the game except the final boss. What made it worse is that you can't save anywhere after a certain point and this means have to play 2 hours without saving before you can try the final boss. You can beat anything else in that dungeon, even the mini bosses and then you need another 30 levels before you can even attempt the final boss.\nThis is not how I wish to invest my time in a game.","July 5, 2015","false","39.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","1"

Although the extra loot was nice, within the first few hours of playing I had to redo quests leaving me stranded because the ship I had received as a reward was at the next location but yet I did not have credit for the quest even though I did it twice leaving me stranded only to admire my reward from afar.

The story is about the balance between light and darkness--and the game lectures and reminds the player about this balance a few hundred times throughout, as New Age-plagued JRPGs often do.\n\nIts gameplay is where it fails on virtually every level: Most of the jobs are useless, half the abilities in the game are bugged and simply don't work, and players will lose hours upon hours of progress due to a complete absence of in-dungeon save points.  You can only save on the world map, and some dungeons are 5+ hours long.\n\nEven players who only desire a peek at the advent of Final Fantasy's Job System will be disappointed, as the game's combat shoehorns players into a select few jobs, rendering the remainder not only unusable, but boring and uninspired as well.  For example, over half of the game's jobs are mere upgrades to existing jobs, offering nothing of substance on a gameplay level.\n\nThe music and graphics are sometimes surprisingly good.\n\nI recommend this game to hardcore completionists and to Final Fantasy XIV fans who want to see the origins of the "Crystal Tower" raid.  To anyone else: don't waste your time.  Final Fantasy III is just not good enough to justify the time investment.","September 22, 2015","false","38.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","1"

Square must have patched it up, so here's my initial thoughts:  it's still a lackluster port.  If you have never played FFIII and love JRPGs, then you will really enjoy it, and the PC version has the most potenial.  The menu lay-out is spot on the mobile version (which I played on my Androids, GS2 and GS4) and the controls NEED to be changed to make sense.  Otherwise, I'm keeping my eye out for the numerous reported launch glitches.\n\nOverall, I do not recommend this game.  Final Fantasy 3 is possibly the hardest in the franchise and compared to later games, it's a bit weird.  The characters (who didn't exist in the original NES version) are all card-board cut outs, and they don't even have basic architypes applied to them, so they're uninteresting, and the game's overall plot--while unique--is predictable and cliched (cliched due to setting the bar, not jumping on existing cliches).  Combat is basic, and character leveling and skill management is difficult to understand and never feels like it's making an impact, so grinding levels and items is always a chore in FFIII, plus you're in constant fear that a character may faint and you'll have to rush to a town with a revive fountain because Phoenix Downs are scarce.\n\nIf you are a fan of JRPGs or Old School RPGs, then I can't recommend playing this game overall, and this should be the best version of this classic, but I strongly feel most gamers will get upset or frustrated with this title.  I loved the Nintendo DS version, but I've played every game in the series (at least the main series) and understand that this one is black-sheep-ish compared to the styles and gameplay of the later games.\n\nThis game totally isn't worth $16 by the way.  The genre and indsutry changing classic, Final Fantasy VII is only $12, but that even seems too high for 3, considering it brings nothing new to the table.  It's just the iPhone/Android version, which was a single-screen DS version.  There's no update to the aesthetics and no content that improves the game, and 2006 DS graphics do not look good on a PC monitor made in the last ten years.\n\ntldr, JRPG fans will like it, but it is a more advanced JRPG, so general gamers won't get into it.","May 27, 2014","false","3.9"," 22 of 55 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","22","55","0","5"

However after I spent at least 30 hours powerleveling my jobs for awhile I found that once I advanced to the next continent I received a nice little bug that made it impossible for me to change jobs. Now I have absolutely no way to finish this game as all of my characters are stuck into being Onion Knights for the remainder of the game. I'm not sure about anyone else but not being able to change jobs in a game that is all about changing jobs seems like a complete failure of this port. My recommendation for anyone considering buying this game is for you to steer clear. If you have it and were able to avoid getting this bug then I am supremely happy for you since it is such a great game. But for all the rest of you who encountered this error. I feel your pain.

The graphics are terrible, the gameplay and storyline are completely lacking any heart or substance, and the 3D element is horrible! The game itself is extremely bad, as you continually die and do not have the opportunity to revive yourself before a boss. You do not have the option to buy Pheonix downs, and whenever you do find them you end up using them immediately. You also never have the option for healing party members by using tents or ethers, and any Elixer you find along the way are also used up almost immediately.\n\nI will never figure out why Square-Enix didn't simply remake this game in the same style as the first two Final Fantasy games for the NES (which were awesome) because this one is horrible beyond words. I would never recommend this game to anyone ... and sincerely hope this will not be the new style for Final Fantasy games.","July 4, 2014","false","15.1"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

The story progression stays 100% the same with added vibrancy to the beginning to give the characters more depth than the original. The difficulty has been tweaked to attain somewhat of an easier feel. The original was very grindy, but they've removed a little bit of that in the first few levels of XP. They added in a few extra quests at end game to ascertain a level of difficulty of the original with a new boss that takes a lot of grinding to be able to stand a chance against, which is what every FF fan deserves at the end of a long haul of the game. They kept the buy in bulk discount which is great, especially at the beginning when gil is somewhat scarce unless you grind a bit for that. I'd recommend this game to any RPG fan who hasn't played the original or the DS remake for those that love a good solid story with improvements to an already awesome classic.","February 8, 2015","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not very familiarized with JRPGs, FFIII is great for anyone who loves JRPGs or wants to try one out. The story is easy to follow and well developed throughout the whole game. What I find a little tedious is perhaps to level up all character to lv 99 in every single job; but I guess that's the whole point. Proggressively difficult monsters and bosses that require that you carefully level up your party and it's relatively difficult to 100% this game.

While it is a great game overall, it does have its flaws. The game requires a lot of grinding, so if you aren't a fan of that, you won't like it in this. The plot is generic compared to modern games, but since it was originally made for an 8 bit system in 1990, it's excusable. Unlike every game since IV (and the remakes of I and II), each level of magic has it's own MP level, and each one gains new MP individually. This means that when you get spells of a new magic level, you can only use them once or twice before healing, but you can get more MP with levels. However, the game has its good features. It was the first game to feature the Job system, which returned in later games like V and XIV: ARR. With this, you can change your characters classes freely, at any time. It was also the first game to feature summons, and has many of the classics, like Bahamut, Ifrit and Odin. It has good graphics and a good soundtrack. Overall, this is a great game, and I would recommend it.","July 14, 2014","true","47.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The battle system, while a little clunky, was very innovative at the time and still holds up today as a fun and strategic way of fighting against the monsters of darkness. The job system makes a brilliant first appearance for the first time in the series in this game and it really is such a great way for the player to place his "stamp" upon the game, with a large and fun variety of interesting classes and jobs to choose from at will. Again, I highly recommend this game.

Now keep in mind that this is the real Final Fantasy III (not the Super Nintendo Final Fantasy III which was actually Final Fantasy VI, but renamed FFIII since it was the third FF game to hit the US). The graphic update looks good (keep in mind that this version of FFIII was originally a Nintendo DS game). The gameplay is typical turn-based Final Fantasy gameplay. It's hard to compare to the original FFIII since it never came to the US, so I've never played it. This FF game puts an emphasis on jobs. Which determine your skill sets and which weapons/armor you can equip, but don't worry you can change your job at anytime. You also level up your jobs just like you level up your character. So the higher the job level the better you'll be at that job, and you don't lose any job levels by switching back and forth. The story is nothing special, but being from 1990 it's pretty good. Bottom line is if you like the old Final Fantasy titles (you'll need to do some grinding), and you don't mind the graphics then you'll enjoy the game.","July 28, 2014","true","53.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good old fashioned turn based strategy, Loved it from start to finish. Wrapped it up in about 30hrs, Not a very deep story but certainly didn't feel like it hindered the fun.\nThe 23 different jobs you get to pick from certainly can make battles a little more interesting, Can be talored to make many different playing styles. I'll admit I really didn't make much use of it, but you can be more strategic using different jobs for each dungeon to make life easier. Spent entire game as a variation of attacker, black mage, healer, attacker. So if you want to stick to your roots and blow through the game dont worry about the job system.\n\nConcerns about grinding, really not alot of grinding I mean if your playing a game like this then your probably no stranger to grinding out for exp. Probably hour total throughout game grinding and most of it took place before final boss. Literally just playing through the story to the next location will give you enough exp to take on the next objective.","June 21, 2014","true","54.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chances are that if you enjoy any RPG's at all, you'll most likely find something you like in this.\n\nThis is a port of the iOS version of Final Fantasy III, so it has an upscaled 720p version of the graphics. With that being said, things still look quite primitive and blocky, and the battle arenas more often than not look like you're stood inside a disc floating in space with a jpg wrapped around it. If that kind of thing is absolutely unbearable to you, than maybe avoid this title.\n\nIf you dont care too much about graphics, and you're all about the gameplay, FFIII works on a classic turn-based system, and has a classic Job system that Final Fantasy is renowned for. Character classes and archetypes are classic, recognisable and feel unique enough to make a difference in how you fight. If you've played Bravely Default, Final Fantasy 5, Final Fantasy 10-2 or even some of the Dragon Quest games, you'll feel right at home here with this classic rendition of the Job system.\n\nFF3 provides you with quite a challenge at times, especially with the bosses, and even some monsters (Lookin' at you chimera mage) Can surprise you with an attack that can wipe out your party if you're rushing too much. I'm not saying be prepared to grind for years, but if you try to charge through, you're probably going to get frustrated when you reach the next crystal boss.\n\nSome of the achievements are a serious pain, such as the 100% Beastiary and 100% Treasure achievement, due to some areas where certain monsters are missable completely, and the same is true for chests with no possibility to return to those areas. The last achievement that can be annoying is the "Jack of All Trades" achievement which requires you to reach Job Level 99 for every job, with every character. This is literally a matter of grinding, and even using optimal methods, it will take you several hours of mindless boredom and repetition to accomplish.\n\nOverall, aside from some of the grinding, and the graphics leaving something to be desired, I'm proud to have this title in my library, and you should be too! Fingers crossed that Square finds it within themselves to bring more and more FF titles, and other RPG's to Steam.","June 29, 2014","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I might be doing something wrong though)\n\nDespite my above petty complaints, the gameplay is simple, elegant like all early final fantasys and relaxing.

Unlike most of the other Final Fantasies, this one utilizes a standard turn format, where the player and the enemy select commands and perform them in a single-file order until one side drops dead, as opposed to the active battle systems used in later games. The combat itself is well done, although the game makes no attempt to explain anything about itself to the player, making a bit of a sharp learning curve. The Magic system is a bit unorthodox, but after the player understands it, it becomes simple to function. Magic is equipped to each character individually, and is organized into 8 levels, each level having it's own MP. Each casting of a spell consumes one MP of that level. This makes magic rather ineffectual, because there is no way to recover MP aside from sleeping at an inn, healing at a spring, or using the rare Elixer item. It works well for what it is, but the player is discouraged from using magic, because it only has so many usages, making stronger magic less useful because it can only be cast once or twice. The game's defining feature, however, is its Job system. At predefined points in the game, the player will unlock Jobs that they can freely change their characters in and out of at any time outside of combat. Jobs level up just as characters do, and are the primary determinant of stats, which are wholly dependant on Job and Job Level, with the exception of HP, which is constant through all Jobs, although its growth is determined by the current Job. The Jobs work well, and playing with each one is entertaining, seeing all the ways Jobs can work together. However, they are very poorly balanced, with some Jobs, such as the Scholar or Evoker, being situationally useful at best, or utterly useless at worst. Thus, the player will tend to gravitate towards the same jobs every playthrough, ultimately hindering replay value. The game's replay value is prevalent, however, as thankfully, most jobs have at least some sort of niche to fill, preventing most jobs from falling into complete obscurity. The music, while there are some good tracks, is generally unnoteworthy, and the visuals aren't very appealing, as this game is a port of the DS version. The game also has a very ridiculous difficulty curve, with the game suddenly jumping from enemies dealing around 50 damage, to enemies dealing 150 damage, with absolutely no warning or gradual increase. To someone who knows the game well enough, the game is not very difficult, but to someone who does not know better, the game's difficulty will spike, particularly halfway through the game, where enemies will virtually instantly wipe you out if they get a Back Attack, and one particularly notable boss halfway into the game who will almost certainly crush your party. The game has severe balancing issues, but if you can get past that, it's a very well-made game that should occupy you for some time. What it does, it does well, and what it fails at are not too big of a detraction. I give this game my recommendation, so long as steep difficulty curves and turn-based combat are not a big detraction to you. This game will do nothing to change your stance if you don't appreciate the genre, but for those who do, it's an excellent foray.","August 10, 2014","true","91.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd drop all the $ signs to see the other ones on here so I could replay them endlessly just like I used too.\n\nNote: I always hear, why do you like Final Fantasy so much? there are too many to follow...\n\nEach final fantasy is a different story with different characters and different in game mechanics which make it all worth while following each and every game. I grew up with these games, and 15 years later the games still are just as fun and amazing as ever.","February 7, 2015","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story progression stays 100% the same with added vibrancy to the beginning to give the characters more depth than the original. The difficulty has been tweaked to attain somewhat of an easier feel. The original was very grindy, but they've removed a little bit of that in the first few levels of XP. They added in a few extra quests at end game to ascertain a level of difficulty of the original with a new boss that takes a lot of grinding to be able to stand a chance against, which is what every FF fan deserves at the end of a long haul of the game. They kept the buy in bulk discount which is great, especially at the beginning when gil is somewhat scarce unless you grind a bit for that.

Not very familiarized with JRPGs, FFIII is great for anyone who loves JRPGs or wants to try one out. The story is easy to follow and well developed throughout the whole game. What I find a little tedious is perhaps to level up all character to lv 99 in every single job; but I guess that's the whole point. Proggressively difficult monsters and bosses that require that you carefully level up your party and it's relatively difficult to 100% this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauridsen/recommended/239120/","flauridsen","BitZer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flauridsen/","794 products in account","First off - I'm a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, so I might be a little biased because of that.\n\nSo what makes this game good? In my opinion it's the job system and a fantastic world is the main strengths of this game. The job system allows the party characters to switch between classes (like warrior, monk, black mage, etc.) giving them access to a variety of skills and equipment unique to each class and each job can be leveled up alongside the characters' "normal" level.\n\nThe world is vast and has a good variety of towns, caves and temples. Without spoiling too much it's also wonderful that the world is a lot bigger than you might initially think.\n\nAs for the gameplay it's a fairly traditional JRPG - especially if you've been playing the older FF games before. It's a turn-based battle system that allows the faster characters or enemies to strike first when commands are selected. You do have all the time you want to select commands, though, meaning there is time to be strategic.\n\nWhile not overly difficult, you'll have to grind once in a while if you want to be strong enough to progress. I'm not going to put that down as a positive or negative thing as that is very much up to the individual. It's especially important in late game, though, and crucial if you're planning to take on some of the games optional bosses.\n\nIf you're looking to go for a Perfect Game (obtain all achievements) you should be prepared to grind relentlessly as some of the achievements here are incredibly time-consuming.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken this is a port of the iOS version (which is more or less identical to the DS version), which means updated graphics. It's not beautiful, but it has a certain charm to it - and it's definitely an upgrade from the original graphics.\n\nThe soundtrack also deserves a mention - it's good. As in really good. It contains revamped versions of Nobuo Uematsu's original compositions for the NES version of the game - I haven't heard the originals myself, so I can't compare, but the new versions are definitely solid.\n\nMy main gripe with this game is the characters, though. There's so memorable NPCs but the party characters are pretty boring and with only a little background story to each. Even though more is revealed later in the game it's still not particularly satisfying.\nThe story isn't anything out of the ordinary either, although it isn't downright bad. If you've played older Final Fantasy-games before it's pretty much a classic "save the world using crystals"-story.\n\nBut besides a boring cast of party characters and a somewhat bland story, the game is still worthwhile if you're into more old-school JRPGs and don't mind the updated graphics. The gameplay, job system and the world are magnificent and should entertain most RPG-fans enough to make this a worthwhile purchase. Don't expect it to be as story-rich and complex as later entries in the Final Fantasy series, though.","February 18, 2015","true","41.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has flaws like: You can't buy Phoenix Downs so until you can get to a revive well you have to rely on the ones you have found or not die, and reise magic is a level 5 spell. Magic is not based on Mana but you have a set amount of casts, they upgrade with your job levels but I perfer the mana method. The story and people you talk to don't always tell you where to go next and the map isn't labeled, and like all the other early Final Fantasy games you have to spend a bit of time grinding or get destroyed but I find that makes them more interesting. What I liked the most is the graphics I think they are well done, The fact that you get your 4 characters VERY early so you don't have 1 or 2 characters that are much higher then the others, the NPC's are interesting, this game introduced Moogle Mail which I find to be a great part of other games (Love those moogles) the jobs, I have only gotten the first set so far yet, but they are great, the characters look good in them and they are quite powerful.

I've played for two nights after work and I'm really enjoying this game. The story is of course a bit simple and delivered as if to children (the original target audience) but that isn't to say it isn't elegant.\n\nCouple of technical quibbles though; As some have already said though make sure before starting play the first time, go into settings in the launcher to find out (and probably change) your key bindings.\n\nThe job system makes for a wonderfully diverse range of characters you can play, although I kinda wished some of the advancements you make in one class would bleed into another, so by the end of the game you have four unique individuals shaped by the selections they've made throughout the game but that's probably just the roleplayer in me.\n\nAlso it would be nice If the jobs were available a *little* earlier on.\n\nThe map is next to useless, which is disappointing as well, seeing as the game will say "go to the dwarven continent" to continue the story, but the map doesn't have any names on it, and I've found no way to move a cursor there. (I might be doing something wrong though)\n\nDespite my above petty complaints, the gameplay is simple, elegant like all early final fantasys and relaxing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mutto/recommended/239120/","Mutto","/\/\utt0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mutto/","340 products in account","Before getting down to brass tacks, one needs to be reminded that this is an old game.  A 23+ year old game, actually.  So with that in mind, there can be times when FF3 feels archaic, grindy, and vague.  This is an NES game with a new coat of paint.  So, do not expect hand holding or a cake walk.\n\nWith that out of the way...\n\nThis is actually a port of a port, which usually instills fear into my heart, and while others have reported bugs, glitches, and downright unplayable circumstances, I have been lucky.  Nothing technical has disturbed my playthrough.  However, that doesn't mean the game is free from these issues.  It's kind of a, "buy at your own risk" sort of deal...\n\nAs for the game itself.  The new paint, while cartoonish, resonates very well with me.  While in battle, I get this odd deja vu feeling, because the art design and animations resemble FF9's quite a bit.  The world is just gorgeous compared to the NES version.  The music is the original, but redone with modern technology...you know...so it matches the non 8 bit paint job.\n\nThe writing, however, is atrocious.  I haven't played the original with the english fansubs, so I cannot compare the two, but this is easily B-team writing, if not C-team.  But, that's ok, because this game doesn't have a particularly good story anyway.  The story is...well...an NES story (it is basic and generic.  We don't see one of those classic Final Fantasy stories till the release of the SNES and FF4.)  If you want a good story, YOU WON"T FIND IT HERE!\n\nBut what you will find here is a fun and addictive leveling system.  Oh yes, the jobs system.\n\nSee, unlike some of the later games in the series where there are more party members than we know what to do with, this game has only our 4 innocent teens.  So, instead of leveling/grinding multiple people who may represent different classes, you focus on the same four heroes but have the option of switching their class/job.  There are 23 different jobs and every character can level each of those jobs (independantly of the other characters) to level 99.  This allows for diverse parties and the ability to adapt one's party for specific situations.\n\nIt's not as awesome as the ICONIC FF5 job system, but, this came out before that...on a weaker system...with a lower production budget...and a smaller dev team...\nBut, being simpler doesn't mean it's any less fun.\n\nAs for the battles themselves.  The ATB system hasn't been invented yet.  It's oldschool turn based.  The player inputs commands for all 4 characters at the same time, and they are executed in an order detrmined by the stats of both the characters and the enemies.  Then, repeat.  This can be a good or bad thing.  It can be frustrating if your mage strattles that line of sometimes healing before the enemy attacks and sometimes after it attacks...despite being the exact same enemy.  The system can be controlled to a degree if one knows the speed of their characters...and equips gear to make the characters faster or slower.\n\nSo, if one wants a TL;DR version...\n\n-It's an OLD game (1990) with a new coat of paint\n\nPros:\n-Seems remarkably stable despite being a port of a port.\n-Job system is addictive and fun.\n-Plenty of side quests/optional dungeons for treasure hunting.\n-CHALLENGING!  Unlike many new games released today where one can get through without dying, there were many sections which took me a few tries to get through.  Strategy through trial and error creates a sense of accomplishment.\n\nCons:\n-Horrible writing for a non existant story (indicative of late 80's/early 90's technology and gaming scene.)\n-Kind of expensive for being a port...\n\nIf you are looking for a nostalgic, old-school JRPG game, here you go.  It's gritty.  It certainly won't appeal to many, "youngins," but if looked through the lens of the time it was released, it is a solid, and recommended experience.\n\n8.2/10","June 23, 2014","true","49.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which isn't a problem, per se, but something one should be aware of going in. Because of the class system and lack of clear distinctions in much of the equipment there is a *lot* of equipment management. Death is a pain, as Phoenix Downs are rare and while I assume there's a Life spell at some point, it certainly doesn't make an early appearance. A Quicksave option has been added, so at least you can leave the game in a hurry without losing progress, but you're still primarily dependent on world map saves (because there *aren't* any save points in the dungeons >.<).","June 23, 2014","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(II is worse, and there's that one later entry ... we both know which one). The combat system makes sense, the Jobs mostly make sense, and there's a forward-moving plot.\n\nThing is, though ... it's not very interesting. It's really mostly just a selection of classic Final Fantasy tropes shuffled together and re-dealt. There's the Job system, the familiar list of spells, dungeons, the airship, elemental crystals, etc., etc., etc. It's true that some of these things actually originated here, but it kind of doesn't help? When I go back to FF1 I can see it's retro and primitive but it still has a "freshness" to it that FF3 lacks.\n\nAll I know is, if I'm in the mood to replay a retro Final Fantasy that evokes all the old tropes like this, I'm more likely to go to FF5 for its more intricate plot and less bland characters.\n\nThat said, I mean, there's nothing really WRONG here. There's nothing wrong with a bread-and-butter sandwich or a glass of plain water ... I was just kind of really hoping for a grilled cheese and Coke, y'know? So while I'm recommending the game, I'm probably not going to be playing it through more than once, ever.","May 5, 2015","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a Final Fantasy, it's not the best in the series, but it's definitely better than anything after Final Fantasy IX (except Final Fantasy XII). I'm not sure why everyone keeps complaining about bugs, but I've never seen a single one through either of my playthroughs. The only real complaint I have with the game is the fact that to level up your jobs, you have to perform an action (fight, guard or an ability) to gain job points (which is a hidden stat) In Final Fantasy V or even Final Fantasy Tactics, you received job points after each battle or kill that went towards leveling your job.\n\nAlso, your HP gain is based on what job class you have equipped when you get a character level up. So if you keep one character as a magic user the whole game, they will end up with low HP by the end, which in turn causes A LOT of extra grinding as a job you really don't want to use. Even still, the HP gain system in this Final Fantasy is strange. At level 60 on my first playthrough, I had about 3500 HP with each character, giver or take. Which made some boss battles aggravating since bosses tend to hit VERY hard with physical attacks but not so much with magic. In conclusion, it's definitely worth the money if you're a Final Fantasy fan, a fan of games with a class based system (Might & Magic, Wizardry) or if your a fan of retro RPGs.\n\n7/10","May 29, 2015","true","90.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While i personally don't mind playing a bunch of create your own characters in a party, it was kinda of nice that each of the characters have a personality and backstory.\n\n- The cinematics look amazing! Though they are not very common, their addition is very nice indeed.\n\n- Like any other Final Fantasy game, there is a TON of extra quests/loot that is just waiting to be beaten/explored, at this point i am still grinding my way to the last few achievements (including beating the secret boss)\n\n-The Job System! It's so cool that you could try all sorts of different strategies to fight enemies and defeat bosses. I just like that they have look a little different depending on which character is using the job\n\n\nCon's\n- Grind heavy! Thankfully having finished it before i was aware of this, i remember having to spend about 3-4 hours levellin my characters and jobs just to survive and beat some bosses so if you want to experience just the story without the extras, be prepared\n\n\nSo if you like JRP'S or Turn based RPG's, it should be right up your alley! I personally don't think it is worth full price, but definitely pick it up on sale and you'll get 50+ hours worth of goodness =)","January 28, 2015","true","33.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also my Enterprise ship just disappeared after I docked it and stepped out.","July 4, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

PC version of the Final Fantasy III is certainly fun, and updated visuals and interface brings a lot to the game. As with all the old FF games, there is not much story to speak of, the game is all about dungeon crawling and although you have some dialog here or there, most of them are simple and do not distract from action. I would actually sometimes appreciate more dialog in game, because it is easy to get lost in game sometimes due to lack of pointers about where to go next. You also have only four characters for whole game and all of them are active whole game if present (and alive), so you do not need to worry about managing and leveling up too many of them at the same time, which is common in some later games in the series.\n\nCombat is turn based, but you are not restricted by time during turns, which makes it more strategic than more recent games. From modern FF games it is most similar to FF 10, although with less options when comes to spells, items or other actions. Final Fantasy III also uses job system. It means you can change character classes between fights, and there is more than 20 of them. Downside of it is that there is separate level system for character and jobs and no experience points and levels earned in one job transfers to another. Therefore you need to train every job separately and some dungeons require you to use specific jobs, which unfortunately makes some of them essential and other practically useless. And yes, the game does have random battles so depending on your preferences you will probably either love this style or hate it.\n\nBugs in PC port of the game is something which is spelled pretty often in other reviews here. As for my own experience, I knew about the biggest of them from the start and did not encounter any other mentioned here, my playthrough was pretty smooth. So I would recommend to save often to several files be sure (you have 3 maximum), never to return to your first town and use the restoration fountains after you break the rock which seals you in the first area, and you should be fine. Of course, the graphic is old for today's standard and locked in 15 fps in battles, true. But you are not exactly playing game from 2016 here and the the game looks nice as the chosen design fits its style.\n\nIn the whole, Final Fantasy III is certainly worth playing for all FF fans. LIke me, you may easily find that you will enjoy it more than some more recent installments in the series. Only given the price and age of the game, it may be better to wait for some steam sale.\n\n+ Great example of old time jrpg\n+ Updated visuals and interface\n+ Turn-based combat system\n+ Level design, monsters and bosses\n-  Unbalanced job system\n-  Does not tell you where to go next sometimes\n-  PC version have at least one bug which can break game, although it can be avoided\n-  Battles locked to 15 fps (depends on player if it matters)","January 31","true","49.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Newcomers I would warn off and advise playing one of the other titles in the series before considering this one.\n\nIts a fine game, on the face of it simple and inviting, there are a few features though that mean I would not recommend for new players.\n\nThe job system is good fun, I had encountered it before playing Final Fantasy Tactics on the PSP so was familiar with it, but as I'm playing through I'm learning more about the intricacies of it. There is very little guidance in how the different jobs work, quite a lot of guesswork is involved without visiting guides on the Community or FFWiki.\n\nThere is also a fair amount of grinding involved, some of the bosses and dungeons are a real step up (currently levelling up for one of them!)\n\nFianlly, in my opinion the story is not the best. By no means is it a bad story, in fact I'm enjoying the quest of the Warriors of Light. I just can't help but feel they could haave had a bit more personality about them, you don' really get to see them interact with each other very much so you don't get much insight into their personalities.\n\nThat all said, if you like the series I'd grab this (advise waiting for 33/50% sale) as a lot of stuff from this game was original when it came out in the 90s and has been well restored for this DS version.\n","April 2","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First and foremost, this is a tough game to dedicate your time to beat. Currently I have held 52 hrs on record to play this game from start to finish. While the linear gameplay isn't necessarily that long, however it does take preparation to level up for the final challenge which is why it took me extra time plus completing much of the Steam achievement list.\nAs for the game itself, this version of Final Fantasy III is a remake of the original Nintendo DS handheld first released in the US in 2006. The original game came out in 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in Japan only. The 3d remake retains much of the\ndifficulty and control schemes of the original version typical of any RPG genre type game. The story is pretty clichéd and bland compared to the later Final Fantasy titles, but it still doesn't fail to entertain as it is filled with many surprises, plot twists, and some humorous moments. Furthermore as a trivia fact, III was the first game that introduced many of the series highlights, including the job class system, summons including Ramuh, Ifrit, Shiva, and Odin to name a few, the hit point system that popped up when striking an enemy, riding chocobos throughout the world map, the first appearance of the moogles and the boss battle theme made its debut in this game as well.\nThe gameplay elements involve character job classes ranging from a knight to magic user, summoner, thief or job class with special abilities. Many more job classes are picked up along the way as the game progresses. Completing the game depends on the player constantly adjusting and upgrading on these job classes (it takes time & effort on this). Experience points that are used to level up on your characters and job classes are gained by defeating monsters randomly encountered on the World Map field or dungeon level, (encounters can get repetitive and annoying this way) as they are not seen.\nThis version does not include special features like a music track, or art gallery by Final Fantasy series artist Yoshitaka Amano, but does include a bestiary (viewable list of monsters defeated) which counts towards completing a Steam achievement. However, the bestiary is not viewed from the game's main menu, but rather much later in the game after achieving  a certain vehicle.\nOverall, this has been one of the best classical Final Fantasy titles to play, but players be prepared for its classical difficulty and extended time to completing it.","May 10","true","52.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
