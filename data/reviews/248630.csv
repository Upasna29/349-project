I bought this game on a whim because I had nothing else much to play after I watched the trailer. it seemed very similar to Dark Souls and I was especially intrigued in the spells + sword fighting gameplay.\n\nFirst thought was, "damn, why is this game so bright?" but the game is beautiful. Some things aren't texturized that well and the game is full of glitches, bugs and inconsistencies but that is what an early access is about. Things will be fixed and as of yesterday, a patch has already been released acknowledging many inconsistencies and imbalances.\n\nUsing the mouse to aim the direction of sword swings isn't unheard of, but I think the game does it well, and with the addition of bows, throwing axes, mines and magical spells, it adds alot of depth to the game. Discovering what types of spells go with which swords or abilities is fun and experimental and there are many different combinations to tinker with.\n\nAll in all, I think this game has so much potential right now. If FlyLeaps studios could make the sword play a little more responsive, (sometimes, hits do not register), add a duel-mode similar to that of chivalry, and some more content (including more spells, swords, maps etc.) this game will be big hit that will most likely appeal to a competitive community.","November 25, 2013","true","19.2"," 314 of 351 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","314","351","0","4"

It boasts 360 directional attacks and parrying with swords. While this may be a dreamland for swordplay, one must not forget the dark fantasy background it has by including magic. It's a game that's still currently rough around the edges, however still manages to be enjoyable.\n\nThis game may not be for everyone due to the amount of work it still needs. As this game is in Early Access, the developers do want you to report problems and make suggestions on their Kingdoms Rise Community Hub. So if you can make constructive feedback with some research, why not pitch in to help out?","November 25, 2013","true","33.2"," 105 of 131 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","105","131","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Murukai/recommended/248630/","Murukai","Murukai#1485  <-- Overwatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Murukai/","160 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst off I would like to say that I've been playing this game since the beginning and have literally not stopped playing. If what you're looking for is a multiplayer melee experience similar to that of war of the roses or mount & blade, but set in a fantasy world where you control magic at your fingertips, then look no further. This game really delivers, for an alpha.\n\nThe updates in this game take awhile since there are only two devs working on the game and they do aim for monthly updates, doesn't always happen but they do let us know what is going on. As I have said the game is still in alpha and will have some bugs here and there. Playing with a low ping is highly recommended. Anything over 130 (in game not in the server menu) is not very playable.\n\nRight off the bat you are able to customize your knight in some impressive fantastical armor and clothing, but there are also choices for some more 'realistic' gear. Devs are adding new things all the time and are always showing off their progress on the Kingdoms Rise facebook page.\n\nAs of right now there isn't a tutorial in-game, but one can be seen in the guides section made by the devs. You don't need to look at the tutorial, but believe me when I say, at the very least look at the parry and parry lock section of the manual. It will save you a lot of grief in game and once you master those skills, gameplay becomes even more addicting. You can get away with spamming away attack with other new players, but once you meet someone who knows how to parry, you will most likely lose. Luckily, those experienced few in the community are always willing to help out new players and usually it isn't too hard to ask these guys for some help.\n\nThere are many different swords in the game, each with their special effects and stats. They aren't perfectly balanced, but your use in magic and skill with the sword is enough to offset any of the swords' abilities currently available. Magic in this game isn't over powered and is meant to be used to complement your swordsmanship as well as mold the playstyle you want. You can only equip 2 spells, however, you are able to have doubles of any spell as well as have a large selection to choose from. There are many types of spells from attack, to defense, to healing and mobility. Mix and match to create the playstyle you want.\n\nYou will have a hard time at first controlling the sword with your mouse due to the nature of the screen moving with you as you strike, but like I said, look up the tutorials and get some practise performing the moves. They do require some timing and precision, so if an easy mode game is what you're looking for, then you are in the wrong place. However, if you're looking for a competetive game where the skill cap is high and it is very much possible for a skilled player to take on an entire team, without the use of cheap tricks/exploits, this game is for you.\n\n**AUGUST UPDATE**\nAI has been added to the game and makes for quite the training partners as well as a challenging surviving mode that will have you crying for mama within the first 5 waves. Really fun if you just want to mess around by yourself, or can't currently find a game. Just remember not to use the disonnect button while you're in the survival server as it will crash the game","July 5, 2014","true","591.0"," 76 of 90 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","76","90","0","0"

I understand that you are a very small team of two and such, and the slow progress can be understandable. But you need to understand yourself that you have to keep at least some announcements, or some kind of dev blog about this game, rather than succumb us into dead silence for almost a year now. That's not how 'business' works around EA titles, and you can clearly see you've earned a pretty harsh reputation from your community. Just my two cents out there. Don't leave us in the dark, because there are other EA titles that have done this. I have no idea if this game will even progress at all, since now you speak of a 'port'.

Its a lot of fun with just a two-four people, and its a lot of fun with a large group. (That's a big bonus) The controls take a little while to get used to: BUT take forever to master completely. Learning when to block and when to attack. Not only that: BUT HOW TO BLOCK and where to attack can be tricky. MY BIGGEST complaint: is how SLOW you run. IT makes you feel heavily armored. However... it really slows the pace of the game down. Increasing the speed a little bit will make this game bad ♥♥♥. Getting that first double, then triple kill makes this game addictive because while your character can't move super fast. That doesn't mean: the action is slow when you enter the melee fringe.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/koleslaw/recommended/248630/","koleslaw","Kole","http://steamcommunity.com/id/koleslaw/","201 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNote: This review recaps my old review/experiences and then goes into more recent attempts at playing.\n\nOne year ago, I was longing to experience Dark Souls, but couldn't due to hardware limitations. I began a quest of looking for a suitable hold-me-over and found Kingdoms Rise. Kingdoms Rise reminded of the combat experience I longed for- up close and personal melee combat with some ranged and magic attacks mixed in.\n\nAfter purchasing the game, I excitedly hopped in and was met with bugs and lack of features that killed the user experience (short recap: menus that didn't work, broken key bindings/controller support, no tutorials). As a new user, I was quickly turned off. As I tried playing, I became flustered with the lack of guidance and no tutorials to help me out.\n\nI did eventually find the video tutorials that the developer posted, but found it hard to implement these lessons against players with 20+ hours compared to my newbie self. As I tried to persist, I was put off by the bad GUI and lack of a tutorial.\n\nPlayers on community sites and Steam kept repeating that after about 10 hours of playing the kill cam, you would start to get better and that the bugs were not an issue. Ignoring the bugs issue, I was very put off by this. Call me weak or lazy, but I would rather not waste time (like my money) on a kill-cam simulator. In similar games, I was able to learn and start improving long before the 10 hour mark. Sadly, this was not the case with Kingdoms Rise.\n\nAs I now review other reviews on Steam, I can see that I wasn't the only one that burned out shortly after starting the game. Between bugs and difficulty learning the new system, players gave up.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nNearly one year later, and a recently built new computer, the Black Friday/early Winter sale reminded me of this game. So, I redownloaded it and gave it another try.\n\nIt is nice to finally see big bugs ironed out (menus function properly, controllers work, keybindings stick) and some areas of the game (practice range, menus, in game interface) improved.\n\nSadly, the developers took too long with these changes and lost nearly the entire playerbase.\n\nOn the server browser, I was presented with ~15 servers to choose from. Of all these servers and game modes, only one server had one person. Thinking it may be a bot/AFKer to draw people in, I decided to let the game find a match for me, hoping to find that one server that people were still playing on. I was given an empty server to fight NPCs on (alone) - which got old, fast.\n\nWondering if it was just my luck with the match system, I hopped on a popular site with karma points to see what discussions were going on. What I saw was not pleasant. The latest post was 6 months ago, and the next post after that was 10 months ago. Many of the comments on Steam and this site call this game "A quick cash grab by the developer".\n\nIt's sad to see a potentially great concept die out. Personally, I believe it is to blame for being released (even as an early access) too early and not enough speed from the developer.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAssumedly eager to make some money - which is very understandable - I feel like the developer rushed the publishing of this game. From my perspective, this effectively killed the game when the developer couldn't keep up. While it should be a topic of its own, I feel this is greatly to blame on Valve's allowance of Early Access games.\n\nBetween the dead player base and the improvements, I'm torn between recommending this game or giving it a thums down. But, because of the dead player base (the key aspect that makes this game playable), I'm going to keep my thumbs down.\n\nAs the game (hopefully) gets more exposure during the sales, I'll keep giving it more chances to see if the community sparks a bit and see just how much the game has ironed out. As I stated in my previous review, I'd love to give this game a thumbs up. It's a great concept. But right now, I simply can't.","December 26, 2013","false","2.2"," 41 of 62 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","41","62","0","1"

Introducing a perfect blend between magic usage and melee combat, it could arguably be considered the magical equivelant of the Chivalry series. The weapon conbat is fluent and precise, with parrying and blocking working efficiently and allowing for some truly awesome duels.\n\nKingdoms Rise, though an awesome game has several flaws which hinder its sucess in the playability area. The foremost of which being a lack of players. Some games become simply outstanding when played on a full server, alas, Kingdoms Rise seldom presents the possibility for this. The game in its pre-release accomplished more by ways of player versus player melee combat than many other games have accomplished in their whole lifetime.\n\nWhether you play Kingdoms Rise for its awesome character customization, to blow your friends to pieces with fireballs, to teleport behind enemies and impale them on a blade of flames, Kingdoms Rise is for you.\nThe only recommendation I offer to those playing it is to go in with an open mind. The game has its bugs, as one would expect from an early release game. Though any braincell-possessing human being can see the potential in this title.

Game's website hasn't been touched since Dec '14, Twitter since Apr '15, and so forth.\n\nJust another indy money grab if you ask me, not sure how these projects get put on to the store page but if it's a dead game then suspend sales at the very least to protect people with background information. The only way to currently play is to hopefully schedule match times with people through 3rd party means.\n\nHope this saves someone else's $15.","December 22, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

The swordplay worked well, the blink teleports made getting around quick and exciting, and the game looked really cool.  I would have recommended it in a heartbeat.\n\nHowever, I can't do that in good conscience anymore.  Unfortunately, the game has bugs that haven't been fixed after months, the community is tiny at this point, and, while this might just be me, I feel like the game has gotten less responsive when it comes to attacking and parrying.\n\nA great game with potential, but it was a let down in the end.","December 31, 2014","false","6.4"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"

This is the game to get. Still in early access stage it has left me wanting more and more. Blocking works wonderfully and the locking system is very rewarding when performed correctly.\n\nI have no big remarks to the fact that the game is early access and just developed by two dudes. Sure, it’s a bit unpolished in some areas, but nothing really game breaking. With more things coming in the future and smoothened out product, it will be one of the best melee action games out there.\n\nAll in all, if you like action with big swords then this is a must get.\n\nEdit 2014-08-12:\nA couple of updates later and I'm still loving it.

Combat is somewhat like Chivalry, only everyone's on equal ground and there are 8 swing/parry directions, as long as a clever parry locking system to raise the skill cap extremely high. There's also a ton of character and loadout customization, like magic! You can have 2 spells ranging anywhere from nukes, teleport, crowd control, magic immunity, healing, etc. and use any combination you like, as well a special slot that is used for a bow, mines, traps, throwing axes, what have you.\n\nThere's a ton of game modes, ranging from huge FFA fights, organized duels, last-man-standing (Counter-Strike style), as well as a survival and practice mode.\n\nThe learning curve is sharp, but it's getting better. They're adding a lot of features into the game to make it easier to understand what's going on, but even then a good swordsman can take you out pretty quickly. I had to pull a player aside, pull out training swords and get smacked for a while as he taught me before I understood what was going on. The game is extremely satisfying, and has a bright future.\n\nEven in it's early state, the devs have the genius and success of Kingdoms Collide behind them, and Kingdoms Rise is looking fantastic.\n\nIf you read this review, and you're thinking about getting this game, send me a message on Steam. If you plan on getting this game, add me as a friend/send me a message and let's duel! I'm still learning, and I can help teach you as well!

I only wish it was finished but as is other than the no one to play with part, this game is really good. The magic makes everything chatoics and adds another dimension, some magic games do not even have magic as fun as this. Sending people to their doom off cliffs or comboing to do really fun stuff, appear behind them in an instant and swing.\n\nSo overall this game is not done, no one to play with, amazing combat and magic; overall play with a friend so you can actually play the game and you will have fun but a bit pricy for a vs game, so weigh the the option on how much you are willing to spend on a game that most likely wont develop further but is actually  really fun reguardless of being unfinished.","April 21","true","11.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

No leveling or unlocking, everything is immediately available, and lots of fun. I even picked up a 2nd copy for the occasional friend to play.\n\nWith in-depth & intuitive mechanics for the genre, blocking isn't frustrating or over powered like in "War of the Vikings". Instead the combat system makes a lot of sense, and not just because I read the manual – though it did help explain combos, counter-attacks & how to parry.\n\nCharacter customization is also very impressive – whether you want to be a heavily plated knight, a nimble ninja, or something in between, you pick every piece of armor you wear (or choose not to wear). Combined with your choice of weapons & spells, players of all archetypes step onto the battlefield with a variety of builds – often resembling characters from different videogames (such as Link & Ninja Gaiden).\n\nWhile "War of the Vikings" offers higher production quality, and a realistic experience in the genre - "Kingdoms Rise" offers more fun with its deep & balanced combat mechanics, character customization, and vivid colourful graphics.\n\nI’m really looking forward to what this title offers in full release!

However, the devs are still working hard to update it, fixing the bugs and adding new features. The only reason I don't play it much is because nobody else plays it, and that is a vicious cycle. If you can gather several friends to play together, it is heaps of fun, this also breaks the cycle and more people will join in.\n\nThe combat is very unique, I am yet to see another game with 360 degree sword swinging/blocking.\nThe maps are detailed and beautiful like a dream. Very fun to play on.\nProbably one of the best things about this game is: everything is pretty much balanced! You don't see everyone use a particular spell because it is just plain OP or everyone using bows, like a lot of other games. There is a vast mix and everyone has different weapon/spell preferences.\n\nThe customization is great! If you want to be a naked knight, go ahead.

This also gets old within the first match or two as there is no minimap or even a real way to hear people coming up behind you.\n\nGraphically, the game feels a bit dated already, and due to the washed out color palette it can be difficult to even see other characters within parts of the battlefield.\n\nWhile the game is still in early access status, there are still noticeable elements such as keybinding bugs and extremely awkward sword swinging controls which can hamper combat even further.\n\nIn short, the concept of the game is a very good one, but so far implementation leaves quite a bit to be desired. If you enjoy games such as Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden, you may be disappointed as the pace of combat is almost slower than in oblivion or skyrim.","December 26, 2013","false","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Sure it's early access, and you notice it on some bugs that appear now and then. But most of the time it's just awesome! Some people complain about that the fighting is just about mashing the left mouse button, but that is far from the truth. Sure mashing is how you start out(probably), but when you learn how to block that's when the real fun starts. Locked in a swordfight where the smallest of mistakes can cost you your life. The spells add another layer to the fighting such as ice bolt which freezes the target for a short duration which leaves them defenceless against your sword swing, unless they dodge or neglect it with magic immunity or planeshift. In conclusion, a great game with a deep fighting system. Not to mention the awesome character costumization.","November 25, 2013","true","46.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Make sure you take this into account when analyzing the game yourself. Another thing that might initially be a turn-off is the lack of an active player-base meaning those trying to play the game solo won't get to do much playing, which is a shame because the gameplay is quite enjoyable despite all its buggy unfinished-ness.\n\nI have yet to play the game extensively, and I bought a four-pack for me and some friends so we've had someone to play with. What we have experienced is a genuinely fun melee-combat game, which is something we have been searching for for quite some time. The combat is visceral; every hit and parry feels great and the spells are a great way to add some flair to what would otherwise be just a sword-fighting game. There's plenty of variety of tactics that you can utilize to take down your opponents in creative ways by mixing sword-type with spell choice, and if you get tired of one build, just try another. Get a few people together and you'll have a lot of (admittedly unpolished) fun.\n\nIf I were to compare this game to any others that I have played I would have to place it somewhere between Mount and Blade and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. It has swordplay reminiscent of M&B and the magic/force powers of Jedi Academy, but the swordplay is more active than M&B and without all the confusing randomness (that I felt) in the lightsaber battles of JA.\n\nI hope you find this useful and would absolutely reccommend purchasing the game. Buying the game increases the player base and gives support to a game that has a lot of potential. Even though it is rough and incomplete, with support and patience I think this game could turn into something truly unique.\n\nAnyway, that's my impression. Take it as you will and with discretion; thank you for your time.","June 30, 2014","true","31.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've been eye-balling this game for the past few days and decided to get it and I'm not disappointed because this game delivers! The fun factor alone is good enough to buy this game, but then it also has beautiful landscapes, easy to play (for the most part; parrying is something I'm still working on), and nice character customization (even though it's not even done, it's still good for what it is). Of course there's bugs, glitches, very few collision issues, etc. with the game since it's still in development, but thankfully it does NOT take away from the fun at all really. All-in-all, this game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of potential due to what they have and the engine they're using to develop it (UDK is awesome from personal experience). I'm anxious to see what else they do with this game!\n\nI read a few reviews that mentioned it reminded them of Dark Souls, and as a fan of that game also, I can see where they're coming from. By all means though, from watching vids and playing it, they didn't rip anything from the game or the ideas; it's no clone. It carries a certain aesthetic that "it's a dark place that you want to be in because it's beautiful" and the sword-play mechanics are pretty good.\n\nThese are a few things I hope to see over time as the game develops:\n-Full graphics optimization (on a semi-decent rig, I still have to play in super low res).\n-Balancing out spells. Some spells make others irrelevant due to how OP they are atm.\n-More weapons, sidearms, and spells to flesh out more variety and strategies.\n-Make some clothing aspects react to the team color so it's easier to differentiate who's on who's team (I've killed countless allies by accident because they didn't look to be a teammate lol [sorry bros]).\n\nI know these would take even more time, but it would be cool too:\n-A developed story.\n-Single Player Adventure Mode... or something along those lines, maybe even with Co-Op.\n\n_My Rig Specs_\nCPU: AMD Phenom 2 x4 945; 3 GHz rated @ 6.75 GHz\nRAM: 8 gb\nVideo Card: GeForce GT 610; 1gb VRAM\nOS: Win 7 Home Premium; 64-bit\nDirectX: 11\nInternet: Fiberoptic Connection","November 30, 2013","true","3.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game is clearly Early Access so you have to understand the game will eventually be something worth your time and money but it needs a bit more polish. This review is written based on playing with a rather strong computer so just bear that in mind, your experience may vary.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe good in this game is that the groundwork is clearly there for a great highly tactical chaotic sword and magic game. The art work is of a high quality and the animations are certainly well done and seamless. The gameplay is fluid for the most part and the game is functional. The combat can be quite fun as you swing, dodge, roll and use magic with relative ease to defeat your enemies. The magic spells are varied and can mix up your gameplay quite a bit. Do you want to be a stealthy guy who can assassinate someone? Do you want to be a guy who can take a lot of hits and get into the heat of battle? You have many options when deciding on the type of warrior you wish to be. The various swords in the game also have unique stats that help make your warrior be more true to your desires. Swords have stats such as increased damaged, increased back attack damage, etc and it all works quite well. Especially with the new patch that balances magic and swords out more. It is easy to be swept up into the frantic combat and I never found myself bored of it.\n\nThe character creator has a decent selection of varying armor pieces for your character to wear and make him (and soon to be her) look unique to a certain extent. In the battlefield you may lose some of your identity but you can stand out depending on how creative you get. Also the team plans on adding more game modes into the game to spice up the rather lacking selection at the moment.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThis is an Early Access game so these problems I address could very well and probably will be gone within a month or two so take this with a grain of salt. Don’t dismiss the game because of what I say here, it is a game in progress and will evolve. The game has few modes to keep you interested right now. It’s your standard generic fps fair of Deathmatch and King of the Hill. The replay value isn’t much at the moment unless you really enjoy those.\n\nSpawn camping has been somewhat of an issue in my time with the game in so far as team modes are concerned. In free for alls I was never once spawn killed. However in team matches if one side was overpowering another it would get to the point the other team would camp the spawn and keep you locked inside of it. Without a moving spawn point this can be an issue and while you can fight your way out eventually, the spawn system shouldn’t work like that. It has been proven in countless games that fixed spawn points typically lead to spawn killing.\n\nSomething about the combat doesn’t feel very meaty. It feels like I’m not really fighting so much as I am swinging a sword vaguely at the direction of pixels which pulled me out of the experience a bit. Also magic really needs some better animations, it is very easy to be blindsided by it with no warning. As I said in the last part the gameplay is still good but it needs more fine tuning to achieve all that it can.\n\nThe Conclusion\n\nThe game itself again is Early Access and the gripes I mentioned I know will be stamped out a couple months time. The game does have a lot of positives going for it. The combat is smooth and the mechanics are definitely there for an excellent experience. The game is fun as it currently stands but the replay value is little at the moment. When more modes get added in and other gameplay mechanics I feel the game will have a far more powerful draw on peoples wallets. For now however the game needs more fine tuning and you can find better games with more replay value for your money. Keep an eye on patch notes and wait for some big updates before jumping in.","November 28, 2013","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sackon/recommended/248630/","Sackon","Sackon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sackon/","663 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA very fun game with a very interesting concept.  You take the role of a swordsman with two different spells and a second, alternate weapon of your choice.  The swordplay is interesting.  Based on how you move your mouse when you click MB1, you decide your direction of attack, which, based on experience, seems to change damage and swing speed based on which way you go.  You can also hold down MB1 longer for a stronger attack, although this takes up some time for it to charge.  You can also parry attacks, although this requires a lot of luck because of the nature of the attacks.  It's essentially who pulls the trigger first, because they will always attack first.  This also creates a sword of imbalanced gameplay because, when you are struck, you're essentially interrupted from swinging your sword.  So one person can easily chainstun you and kill you unless they miss a swing.\nEvery player has the option to select 2 of ~10 spells, such as freeze, heal, fireball, teleport, and more.  Some of these spells are buggy as hell, while others are overpowered as hell.  For instance, freeze is probably the most overpowered spell, as well as the most buggy.  The spell stuns whoever it hits for a few seconds and damages them, leaving them wide open to a fully charged attack.  Combine this with the flame sword (increased damage) and you can pretty much kill anyone you come across with ease.  Other times though, the spell won't do anything.  Their animation will be frozen, but they can still move and attack, which is really annoying to deal with.  Then heal, which heals you over time to 100+ health, meaning you can activate it, take damage, and just heal it all up in a few seconds.  These two spells are pretty much the most used, along with teleport.  Then other spells, such as fireball, invisibility, and aoe blast, go unused.  Aoe blast, probably the worst spell next to invisibility, sometimes never deals any damage, has the longest cooldown of them all, and has a long charge time and animation that can get you killed easily.\nNow as for gamemodes.  There appear to be 3 gamemodes at the moment.  Team Death Match, Free for All, and a king of the hill style mode.  Here are the problems with them.\nTeam death match: There is nothing to regulate team numbers, so you can have horribly stacked teams.\nFree for All: Probably the only fair mode.  Everyone for themselves.\nKing of the Hill:There are usually a few points.  Each point starts counting down the timer for each team.  First to 00:00 wins.  There is nothing to regulate team numbers, so it can be very imbalanced.  There is also the fact that, in some maps, one team can potentially spawn ON a capture point.  There is no wait time to capture a point, instead, it is instant so long as the owning team isn't on it.  Probably the worst, least fun gamemode of them all.\n\nA very fun game, with great potential, but at the moment that is all it has: Potential.  Do not buy this until there is a greater sale or more work has been done on it.","November 24, 2013","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But the directional swing/parry system that's implemented, as well as the spells, work well and are satisfying. I also think the pace of the game, the speed at which your character moves and the time-to-kill, fit well.\n\nThe most importat issue that a potential player should be aware of is the current lack of other players.

Then look much further as this is not that game. As soon as I entered the game I could tell something was just....off. A shoddy menu screen with a rather dreadful layout. I continued on to the character creation screen (same menu btw). Creating your character should be in a nice well lit area with a contrasting background for easier customization right? Wrong! Kingdom's Rise rejects these ideas and instead introduces a very intruding and ever present orange light to blot out any detail on your character. So the color scales they give you that dont work anyway, wouldnt show any color on your character to begin with!  Due to it being "Early Access" I decided to give it a bit of leniency and continue on to the gameplay. Boy was I in for a treat...and not a good treat. The artwork resembles what looks like a child splattered watercolor paint onto a game engine and the combat was no better. Terrible hit detection, sluggish movement, and (for lack of a better word) absolutely dreadful animations.

(You can get good at it and all but in the end, it's spinning in circles).\n\nRoll is clumsy and worthless since if you're close to an enemy and you roll, for instance backwards, he can simply WALK up to your post-roll position and land a strike just like that.\n\nSome spells are OP, some UP, some situational and some just worthless or broken.\n\nI don't even know why this game has bows in it. You can get few kills with a bow initially, don't get me wrong, but then people realize that the counter to this magnificent weapon is movement and that's it. It becomes a mild annoyance.\n\nImo anything but 1v1 (maybe 2v2 too but I only played it twice or something) is not playable (it just doesn't feel interesting, like at all, you just go in and hope to land a last hit), but then again, you'll rarely get to do anything but 1v1 'cos of the already mentioned dead servers.\n\nPlaying with a controller is quite alright till someone who's semi-decent on a keyboard gets on the server and destroys you.\n\nGot it for free, tried it since I was hoping for some DS-like combat, was fun for few hours but that's pretty much it.

I have not tried quick joining, I have selected the servers I have wanted to join.\n\nCharacter Customization\n\nSo far in this game the Character Customization is pretty nice as far as armor and colors can go. You can change the armor on your left and right shoulders and arms independently, to mix and match some pretty menacing looking outfits. There isn’t much to choose from as of yet about 7-10 choices for each part you can customize, those parts being Head, Left shoulder, Right shoulder, Left arm, Right arm, Chest piece, Scarf (Shinobi style is my favorite), Groin, Belt, Legs, and Boots. You can even have different voices. So far as of playing I have yet to see the same two people be exactly the same (unless they were trying for it). The parts that you cannot change about your person yet are if I remember correctly Gender and Hairstyle.\n\nWeapons\n\nThe combat in this game reminds me of Chivalry more than War of the roses, in the fact that you do not have to block in left right up down format, you just have to hold the right mouse button at the time the opponents swing would hit you and you will parry them completely. There are 5 swords to choose from so far, Stealth Sword (grants x5 backstab/flank damage) My personal favorite!!, Fire Sword (added ongoing fire damage/ may pierce block) Tank Sword( grants extra blocking time/reduces incoming damage a hair) Bowman’s Sword (extra ranged damage) and Mobility Sword (Gives you sprint speed without having to but away your sword/faster dodge rolls) Second personal favorite. Your choices for secondary weapons are as follows, An Explosive Throwing Axe (one time use 75-100 damage depending on how close the target is to it after it lands charges and explodes) Personal Favorite, A sturdy Bow (depending on the range and where you hit your target 25-100 damage multiple arrows 10 or more), a Mine ( 75-100 damage EXTREME KNOCKBACK, I have been sent flying off of capture points and into the void because of these nasty buggers), and a Trap ( a Gigantic bear trap that does either 25-50 damage and locks you in place for a few seconds, if the hunter is vigilant you are dead as soon as you trigger it)\n\nSpells\nThe spells are as follows, Fireball (it’s a damage over time spell), Freeze ( Its pretty much a Trap you can use over again), Flame Drop (Execute your Target and everyone around him with this, But be warned cool down time is pretty major and you will hurt/kill friendlies), Teleport ( It’s a Teleport Spell)Choice 1 from me, Heal ( It heals you fully over time) Choice 2 from me, Phase Shift( turns you into a glowing ball that is immune to damage as long as you can hold it, really good for dodging heavy hitting swings from the fire and tank swords), Stealth ( turns you completely invisible, Be careful though your team members will not be able to tell if you are a friendly while invisible). Magic Invulnerability (Immune to all magic damage) For spells you get two choices, Teleport is a must if you want to have any kind of advantage in movement against a mobility sword!! Heal is just awesome, pop it in the middle of a fight and if you can block your opponents attacks you will be at full health in a matter of seconds.\n\nCombat\n\nHere are a few tips, if you plan on being ranged support with the bow, use the Bowman’s sword with a mine at your feet so you don’t get stealth killed. Spell choices for ranged in my opinion the best two spells are Teleport (to get to higher ground and have a height advantage against everyone on the field) and Freeze (just in case someone starts charging at you with a partner)\nFor you stealthy people, who just love to dash in and out with maximum damage, use the Stealth sword with teleport (required) and freeze/stealth/heal.\nAnyone who wants to try taking on multiple melee combatants at once I suggest the Tank (hp damage reduction) or Fire sword (Pure raw damage). HEAL IS A MUST, and take fire drop just to run into a group cast it and get a good 4 or 5 kills.\n\n\nLearning Curve\n\nIn the beginning, you will die. It will happen. Just learn from your mistakes and have fun.\n\n\nAdditional notes\n\nThe only three glitches I keep encountering are as follows, the in game scoreboard is glitchy at times with different resolution sizes, my name shows up as the only one typing in chat, and the other is that sometimes when I make a kill it says Player alive killed Dead Player.\n\nMuch respect to the two man crew that has brought this game to life. A few things I would like to see in the future if at all possible, an Assassinate button for when you are chasing down a target that is Sprinting (sword is on their back) away from you and you have either the Stealth sword OR the Mobility sword, or just an Assassinate button in general. A capture the flag type game mode would be awesome for this game, as would dueling servers. I would like the Spell Freeze to lock people in place so they cannot turn to face me if I hit them in the back with the freeze spell. I would like the Bow and throwing axe to have better crosshairs on the screen rather than having the translucent circle that is the size of my water bottle. The last thing I have an issue with is the teleport spell I would like it to negate fall damage if timed properly, as in someone is running under a tower entrance I want to be able to jump from said tower and a few seconds before hit teleport and land safely on the ground and give chase to them, instead of just going splat on the ground. Those are my wishes :D\n\nGREAT JOB SO FAR KEEP IT UP GUYS :D\n\nFrom the Humble,\nLoki The Damned","November 26, 2013","true","9.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

As it stands, the game is great in gameplay, but the story is lacking some substance, and glitches are frequent as to be expected with a beta.

The difference here is every character has access to 2 spells (of your choosing) plus a piece of equipment.\n\nGameplay is clearly early stage but definitely playable, in fact, it's pretty damned fun in the current iteration.\nThis is not a fast paced game however, if you're looking for a hack and slash game you may want to look elsewhere: Kingdoms Rise is more about planned, deliberate striking at the right moment and not about overwhelming someone with pokes. Every fight is usually ended with 1-3 well placed strikes depending which weapon you take into the fight.\n\nThe sound design so far is pretty nice, even for early stage. Every character is very chatter, shouting war cries and the expected grunting of swinging their swords, giving the game a bit of a brutal feel to it.\n\nOverall, if you're into more tactical melee combat, I say give this one a shot! There's a lot to come with this one it looks, and is a great game to unwind with after a day at work :)\n\nps: It has colorblind mode, a major plus in my book.","December 13, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can change the armor on your left and right shoulders and arms independently, to mix and match some pretty menacing looking outfits. There isn’t much to choose from as of yet about 7-10 choices for each part you can customize, those parts being Head, Left shoulder, Right shoulder, Left arm, Right arm, Chest piece, Scarf (Shinobi style is my favorite), Groin, Belt, Legs, and Boots. You can even have different voices. So far as of playing I have yet to see the same two people be exactly the same (unless they were trying for it). The parts that you cannot change about your person yet are if I remember correctly Gender and Hairstyle.\n\nWeapons\n\nThe combat in this game reminds me of Chivalry more than War of the roses, in the fact that you do not have to block in left right up down format, you just have to hold the right mouse button at the time the opponents swing would hit you and you will parry them completely. There are 5 swords to choose from so far, Stealth Sword (grants x5 backstab/flank damage) My personal favorite!!, Fire Sword (added ongoing fire damage/ may pierce block) Tank Sword( grants extra blocking time/reduces incoming damage a hair) Bowman’s Sword (extra ranged damage) and Mobility Sword (Gives you sprint speed without having to but away your sword/faster dodge rolls) Second personal favorite. Your choices for secondary weapons are as follows, An Explosive Throwing Axe (one time use 75-100 damage depending on how close the target is to it after it lands charges and explodes) Personal Favorite, A sturdy Bow (depending on the range and where you hit your target 25-100 damage multiple arrows 10 or more), a Mine ( 75-100 damage EXTREME KNOCKBACK, I have been sent flying off of capture points and into the void because of these nasty buggers), and a Trap ( a Gigantic bear trap that does either 25-50 damage and locks you in place for a few seconds, if the hunter is vigilant you are dead as soon as you trigger it)\n\nSpells\nThe spells are as follows, Fireball (it’s a damage over time spell), Freeze ( Its pretty much a Trap you can use over again), Flame Drop (Execute your Target and everyone around him with this, But be warned cool down time is pretty major and you will hurt/kill friendlies), Teleport ( It’s a Teleport Spell)Choice 1 from me, Heal ( It heals you fully over time) Choice 2 from me, Phase Shift( turns you into a glowing ball that is immune to damage as long as you can hold it, really good for dodging heavy hitting swings from the fire and tank swords), Stealth ( turns you completely invisible, Be careful though your team members will not be able to tell if you are a friendly while invisible). Magic Invulnerability (Immune to all magic damage) For spells you get two choices, Teleport is a must if you want to have any kind of advantage in movement against a mobility sword!! Heal is just awesome, pop it in the middle of a fight and if you can block your opponents attacks you will be at full health in a matter of seconds.\n\nCombat\n\nHere are a few tips, if you plan on being ranged support with the bow, use the Bowman’s sword with a mine at your feet so you don’t get stealth killed. Spell choices for ranged in my opinion the best two spells are Teleport (to get to higher ground and have a height advantage against everyone on the field) and Freeze (just in case someone starts charging at you with a partner)\nFor you stealthy people, who just love to dash in and out with maximum damage, use the Stealth sword with teleport (required) and freeze/stealth/heal.\nAnyone who wants to try taking on multiple melee combatants at once I suggest the Tank (hp damage reduction) or Fire sword (Pure raw damage). HEAL IS A MUST, and take fire drop just to run into a group cast it and get a good 4 or 5 kills.\n\n\nLearning Curve\n\nIn the beginning, you will die. It will happen. Just learn from your mistakes and have fun.\n\n\nAdditional notes\n\nThe only three glitches I keep encountering are as follows, the in game scoreboard is glitchy at times with different resolution sizes, my name shows up as the only one typing in chat, and the other is that sometimes when I make a kill it says Player alive killed Dead Player.\n\nMuch respect to the two man crew that has brought this game to life. A few things I would like to see in the future if at all possible, an Assassinate button for when you are chasing down a target that is Sprinting (sword is on their back) away from you and you have either the Stealth sword OR the Mobility sword, or just an Assassinate button in general. A capture the flag type game mode would be awesome for this game, as would dueling servers. I would like the Spell Freeze to lock people in place so they cannot turn to face me if I hit them in the back with the freeze spell. I would like the Bow and throwing axe to have better crosshairs on the screen rather than having the translucent circle that is the size of my water bottle. The last thing I have an issue with is the teleport spell I would like it to negate fall damage if timed properly, as in someone is running under a tower entrance I want to be able to jump from said tower and a few seconds before hit teleport and land safely on the ground and give chase to them, instead of just going splat on the ground. Those are my wishes :D\n\nGREAT JOB SO FAR KEEP IT UP GUYS :D\n\nFrom the Humble,\nLoki The Damned","November 26, 2013","true","9.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

As it stands, the game is great in gameplay, but the story is lacking some substance, and glitches are frequent as to be expected with a beta. My overall opinion is that buying into the early access is a intelligent move, as seeing the features presenting, I feel that the finished product will be immensely impressive if the Dev team follows their current path.","December 9, 2013","true","2.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The difference here is every character has access to 2 spells (of your choosing) plus a piece of equipment.\n\nGameplay is clearly early stage but definitely playable, in fact, it's pretty damned fun in the current iteration.\nThis is not a fast paced game however, if you're looking for a hack and slash game you may want to look elsewhere: Kingdoms Rise is more about planned, deliberate striking at the right moment and not about overwhelming someone with pokes. Every fight is usually ended with 1-3 well placed strikes depending which weapon you take into the fight.\n\nThe sound design so far is pretty nice, even for early stage. Every character is very chatter, shouting war cries and the expected grunting of swinging their swords, giving the game a bit of a brutal feel to it.\n\nOverall, if you're into more tactical melee combat, I say give this one a shot! There's a lot to come with this one it looks, and is a great game to unwind with after a day at work :)\n\nps: It has colorblind mode, a major plus in my book.","December 13, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Giving them your money will help this team improve. This game is the best and worst game I have ever played. It plays sort of like Dark Souls series, with combat, they could drastically improve the combat system for more fluid movements and better mobility. The idea of this game is what every hardcore RPG player will want in a game, an online, combat oriented, PVP masterpiece. But that's just the idea. The game has many flaws that will only be fixed by overcoming financial barriers.\n\nFor those Dark Souls series lovers, remember Dark Souls started as Demon Soul's (which nobody I know personally played before falling in love with Dark Souls other than myself). I strongly suggest this crowd to support this game, and to see where a series like this could go.\n\nPros:\n-Awesome Character Loadout Screens\n-The Idea of a PVP combat Oriented Hardcore RPG\n-The Gameplay is fun even if it's not as good as it could be.\n-PVP System\n-It's not even finished yet\n\nCons:\n-It's Not Finished\n-Slow Updates\n-Very Slow, Un-Fluid (for lack of a better term) Movements.\n- Graphics could be smoother in most instances.","December 15, 2014","true","0.6"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

Where should I start? The game says beta but they need to do themselves a favor and call this early alpha. It's embarrassing to call this beta. I've played pre-alphas that have had better UI, menus, options than this.\n\nThe Steam footage makes it look better than the graphics produce in real gameplay. Not that the game is ugly.. the graphics are ok. But when looking closely around the maps I see horrible low-poly grass popping out of the ground in all kinds of odd places. The whole interface lacks function and any sort of decent graphic design. There is no explanation to the weapons and spells. Nobody really knows what does what. The tutorials are only on the dev website. The sound controls do not work. The key bindings always have to be reconfigured. Only movement and special are mapped to controller so if you want to map the game with Xpadder you're screwed. Either make the gamepad fully functional or leave it off completely until it is so we can remap the keys.\n\nThe list goes on. I knew I was reaching when I got this game, but ultimately I was burned. And truth be told, there is a decent game buried inside this dysfunction somewhere. The combat is actually kind of fun. But there is a long way to go until this turd blossoms. I doubt it ever will. If there is quality control on Steam how did they let this game release with a UI like that. Give this one at least another year.

Like probably many others, I bought the game out of impulse because I liked what I saw on the trailer. I understand that it's early access and, while I do keep that in mind, I gotta say I expected more. Now, I'm not saying I don't like the game, because I do, but I think there should have been a few more fixes before the early access.\n\nSome issues I find with the game are things like the hitbox being wonky... at times, your weapon will go through an enemy and not lay a single scratch while you yourself are mowed down in 2 hits. another thing that bothered me, while on the subject of weapons, is the major inbalance there is. Overall, the tank sword will kill anyone in 2 hits.\n\nMoving on to the spells, they do really allow for different 'classes'. There's the spellsword, throwing fireballs while slicing with the flame sword while the spell is on cooldown, yet keeping a fire blast tucked away as a last resort. There's the healing spell, which can be used to heal not only yourself, but friends as well. As for those who like to be sneaky,there's invicibility and teleport, which makes for a very stealthy class. the ice spell didn't really stand out because I never noticed anything, even when i hit someone directly with it.\n\nAs for secondary weapons, we have the mine, which explodes on contact. there's the bear trap, which keeps the enemy locked in place while dealing DOT (Damage Over Time). For projectiles, you have the bow, which is a bit hard to use but when mastered, is quite the killer. And then you have the throwing axe.\n\nFor character customization, there seems to be a few glitches where nothing changes color, and then there's also the fog in the customization screen that makes it a bit hard to customize. the selection isn't very broad but seeing as you can combine and customize various pieces of set (each glove and shoulderpad can be changed, for example), it does over a small sense of variety.\n\nthe gameplay, though a bit laggy and with its errors as is every online game, was quite enjoyable. Free for all matches offer quite the rush, since anything goes. See a group of enemies fighting? throw in a fireball! The blast is sure to get you a kill stolen or, like in my case, kill all the fighters and give you a nice boost in score. Team matches are exciting as well, especially when you all coordinate without even saying a word, as often happens in games as if the teammates were somehow connected.\n\nOverall, I give the game an 8/10. Needs a lot of work but it's damn good for early access.","December 4, 2013","true","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Though I haven't done too much with this game recently, it has a great concept, and huge customizability options for a MMO. When playing, it is easy to tell that it is still under development, as the game is a bit buggy, and some things aren't balanced. This game could possibly rival Chivalry or other games of the same concept. I would reccomend this game to anyone who is looking for casual play every once in a while, but isn't looking for massive servers with 20-30 players. At most I think I've had 15 other people in a server, so the community is still small, but don't let that persuade you not to support Kingdom's Rise. If you don't want to get it now (with all the bugs and small community), then consider getting later on sale or after it passes through the Early Acess system. Great job to Flyleap Studios for making a phenominal game with huge potential.

It has a Dark Souls feel to it when it comes to the combat: slower paced movement, powerful satisfying strikes. The magic involved is also well done. Easy hotkeys to use, and despite the somewhat limited spell/sword choices, you're able to come up with the build that is perfect for you. You can play stealthy, aggresively, as a tank, or a ranger, your choice! The armor is wicked customizeable and has no movement penalities, you can make your character look like anything you want.

I was actually quite surprised in that the swordplay is coming from a completely different approach. My first couple matches were more akin to an old-school Unreal Tournament match than actual dueling or sword-play. It almost seems to me that perhaps if the characters' speed was somewhat less, and jumping wasn't so exaggerated (you also even see a lot of--again--old-school "bunny hopping"), then the players would have to be more methodical and deliberate in how they wield the swords. Also, especially after my first match, it struck me that while learning the wielding mechanics must surely give you an advantage, it seems that in most circumstances simply just button-mashing and swinging the sword in random directions does the job just fine. Point in fact, that's mostly what I witnessed, generally speaking. Of course, one could argue that the above is simply a matter of taste (and also consider my previous leanings toward JK2) and that many people enjoy the fast-paced combat. Thus, now that my main grievances have been mentioned, I feel that it must be said that for a dev-team of only two people the game as it stands is quite an impressive achievement. The graphics are actually quite pretty (although the bloom/HDR effect might be too glaring in some places), and while the maps are small, they're designed well enough to serve as makeshift funnels for the players in such a way that you--again like in UT--can't go but a few seconds without needing to charge in or defend yourself. Here again though, I do feel the need to point out that I found the 360 degree sword system description quite misleading, since that doesn't actually seem to be the case in practice. That would almost imply mouse-controlled sword movement. I personally found it, with all the button-mashing and jumping around, quite difficult to actually defend myself with my own weapon. It's more effective (and non-lethal for your character) to simply roll away and swing random blows at your opponent. So for future players and purchasers, I do believe that should be clarified more on the product page. But I digress, I should mention that there is partially complete character customization that defintely shows a lot of potential to be very attractive especially if the devs follow through with their planned content updates. I honestly believe that this game can turn into a true gem if some combat and gameplay balancing issues are addressed to actually make it worthwhile on how to learn how to use the sword (which seemed to me to be a major selling point/factor?) skillfully and if the devs follow through within a relatively timely manner on content. Even if it's just small, consistent patches. And for those who might be wondering, yes I did watch the training videos. Some of them several times. But I do have to also say that there seems to be a precedent for some Indie and/or Early Access games to die out, especially in MP, when the aforementioned updates do not occur or are very delayed. I really don't want to see this game kick the bucket before its prime, and it has loads of potential. And also, despite all my groaning, there are enough tense or exciting/fun moments to make the game worth picking up and playing occasionally for some gamers. So I'd say it's worth a buy for some, bearing what I've written in mind of course. To the devs: it's all just constructive criticism, keep up the good work. You've got a very solid foundation for an excellent indie title. It's few and far between that you get to see an indie title with such high graphical fidelity or unique gameplay. Maybe introduce a gameplay mode that enhances and encourages dueling and duelists? Hey, it worked for JK2! :D\n\n*Edit:\n\nAs I'm looking at some of the other positive reviews, I noticed that quite a few people mentioned the game Chivalry in comparison to this game. Incidentally, I had actually written that into my first part of my review above, but took it out because I thought it was long enough already. Well now I'm going to make it longer, so if anyone is reading this, bear with me. And if not, well it never hurts to brush up my writing skills I guess lol. But I also own Chivalry also, essentially hoping for some meaningful, in-depth combat again. While some people might look at how many hours I've played of this game or that game, I don't really need to sink countless hours of my life into something to be able to speak with experience. I think most people that are reading these reviews are gamers and have been gamers and know what I'm talking about. Essentially I came away pretty disappointed. Sure, there is a comparatively sophisticated (speaking of Chivalry [hang in there, I'm going somewhere with this]) directionally-based combat system, and the classes do add some measure of tactical depth, but basically button-mashing can all too easily triumph over the attempted practiced, methodical approach. In effect, what I'm pointing out for KR is that although the sword system is touted as a major selling point of this game, and even showcased in the trailer, the gameplay mechanics nor the realities of the game as it is does not encourage, let alone reward, the player for learning how to wield the sword effectively. I didn't really get from the trailer or the product page that it was seeking to achieve the same flavor and, well, chaos that occurs in Chivalry. Last thing I wanted to mention is that from a practical/realistic/historical point of view, that kind of...flailing could only be useful in a very specific, and limited manner. When soldiers marched against each other, effective militaries of the day would obviously be in some kind of formation (rank and file, phalanx, testudo, etc.) and would therefore be pressed together on both sides. Once the opposing forces eventually charged each other's lines the men in the front would only have that claustrophobia increased. Again, historically speaking, the effect of that being the men in the very front couldn't move, use their weapon, or manuever. The men in the ranks behind them (mostly) couldn't hit the enemy at all. Thus, the prevailing tactic of the day was for the front ranks to plant their shields and intentionally be pushed by their companions behind them. Naturally that doesn't make for a fun game. But once the combatants began to have some "elbow room" so to speak, perhaps that flailing could possibly have been effective for that very narrow stretch of time. But once the combatants had spread out further, for various reasons, it's obvious and only logical that the men would bring whatever methods, training, and skill to bear if only because it was essentially a matter of survival. Chivalry (just like my comparison above) is very much alike to KR and UT in that despite the relative "thinness" or rather absence of any organization/structure/formation, method, practice, and skill do not guarantee a correspondingly effective kill ratio. In fact, I would go as far as to say that as the game is, speaking in a broad/general analyses, that it is more effective to utilize rolling, bunny hopping, and trying to circle around your opponent while simply striking with your weapon. As in, ignoring the blocking, parrying, and intentional sword swings entirely. Of course, for the sake of completeness I should mention that in Chivalry, the characters don't move quite as quickly which makes logical sense. However, what doesn't make sense is thse big, broad-shouldered, armor-laden, giant-sword-wielding--soldiers? Mercenaries? Erm...princes? Can bunny hop to a height as would occur only if fighting on, perhaps, the moon, roll in full armor, like a gymnast, and swing huge weapons like candy canes. Therefore, after all this long-winded analysis, I find that, unlike my first part of this review, I cannot recommend buying this game as it stands, if at all.","November 29, 2013","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It has a Dark Souls feel to it when it comes to the combat: slower paced movement, powerful satisfying strikes. The magic involved is also well done. Easy hotkeys to use, and despite the somewhat limited spell/sword choices, you're able to come up with the build that is perfect for you. You can play stealthy, aggresively, as a tank, or a ranger, your choice! The armor is wicked customizeable and has no movement penalities, you can make your character look like anything you want.

I like it so far, but the fact that the team I just played with loved team killing so much since it was a thing, really detracted from the game. But saying that the game is bad from only that is too much. The game has a lot of interesting abilites and amazing looking weapons and armor. The customization is going to be plentiful from what I can tell. Gameplay is solid enough where you wont want to throw everything in your room that is within arms reach. The moves look strong, every blow you give looks powerful but the animations look a bit robotic and too smooth for the human body, especially when running. But those are little quips when looking at the big picture.\n\nThe world looks beautiful; the lighting and the scenery. This game looks great for something that is early access and you can tell that they put a lot of time and effort into making it look that way too, without skimping out on the actual gameplay mechanics. So far I only managed to play in the forest, snow castle and uh... mini acropolis? or a hill with a light shining from the middle looking map. Look I forgot to look at the map names ok? (￣▽￣) They look great is what I am saying. This game is definitely worth the money it is asking for in my opinion, and the game can only get better later down the road.\n\nI noticed some things and if they could work on things like:\n\nHaving our cooldowns on abilities reset after respawning.\nBeing able to run and swing or at least lunge instead of sheathing your weapon and then taking the time to pull it out again.\nHave something that demotes team killing.\nThis may be just me, but I feel that the controls aren't as responsive as my hands can move.\nPressing escape while in game kind of jerks around and spazzes for me. It looked like it was switching from the main title menu to the In-game menu.\n\n\nThe customization menu also had a few quirks:\n\nHaving no zooming capabilities (that I know of, all I tried was the mouse wheel) to see my characters face.\nThe slider for the Hues and Tones also turn the camera.\nThe lighting is too bright for me to get a clear picture of the helmet. Not sure if that is just me.\nI didnt really see my character's hair color change. Neither did I see the eyes change for that matter.\nYou have to wait a bit when selecting the voices unless you want your eardrums to be barraged by a chorus of yells. (It was pretty cool imaging an entire army charging when you do that though, just turn the volume down a bit)\n\nI'm really excited for the finished piece of this game and then all of the other finishing touches and polish that they are going to put on it eventually... Hopefully. If the game looks this good and is only in the Early stages and is only developed by two guys.\n\nJust saying, I'm impressed.","December 4, 2013","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Your resolution resets every time you try to change an option. The swordplay is clunky and they give you no indication of what anything is. Aiming is difficult as you have no crosshairs.

When clicking one button, it would take me to another. I was confused when I clicked the cog which I assumed would be options took me to the server browser. Clicking it again later then brought me to the options menu. The tutorials aren't even in the game. Instead of an interactive tutorial to get you used to the engine, it simply tells you to follow a link to their website so now I'm watching instead of playing when I was excited to get my hands on a blade and start wrecking face even on a practice dummy, but no. I'm told to quit out of the game and not interact with it.\n\nThere are several easily accessible areas that the players were clearly not meant to be, some of which do so decievingly. To test and see how well the jumping worked, I tried jumping along some rocks and shapes juttiung out from the waterfall. Very blockily and slowly but surely, I made it to the top to where there was nothing and I fell out of the map. That's understandable, perhaps I found something the devs had overlooked. There is another area in the same level with fallen stone pillars. Simply running up them brings you to the wall of the arena where there is nothing. The level just stops and that's it. You fall out and you're dead.\n\nThe movement is anything but smooth, the graphics are decent but often clip and clash with each other, and all around the game is just a mess. I understand it's an early access game but it's so early it shouldn't have even been put out yet. As of posting this, it's in Beta 2.0. Does beta not mean they're just about complete, they just need people to test it out to iron out creases? I would call this an early alpha as it has a long way to go and as I'm leaving this game to sit on my digital shelf, it's got all day to get there. I'm guessing that a majority of people agree with me as well seeing as I was unable to even test combat as all of the servers were empty, much less one with a decent ping. By the time this game is far enough along to actually be a half decent release, I'll have already moved on to something else. The devs should have waited much longer before even attempting to sell the game. If it was further along in development before I got my hands on it, people may have enjoyed it for a while, enjoyed it and continued playing.","June 10, 2014","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The UI was decent but was broken in multiple places after the May 2014 patch and started to frustrate me. Blade Symphony does what Kingdom Rise is trying to do but is a lot more fluid and has a lot more depth. The game also does not receive as many updates as an early access game should.(The last updates were around 5 months apart) I'll probably come back to it once the game is a bit more polished and see if anythings changed. Of course this game is still in early access, but i do wish to give some of my perspective on the current state of the game.","May 29, 2014","false","0.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Heavily buggy, user interface doesn't register options half of the time, online play is nearly unplayable if you are not local, and the combat system has so many flaws. Insta kills, unblockable attacks, parrying not working even when you are doing it correctly, and being killed while invulnerable (using phase shift) even on a decent ping. If it was worked on more and given some love, it could be a really fun PVP game. But as of its current state, the swaying of the screen to try and line up every parry and attack in quick succession, is just going to give you a headache.

Who wouldn't be? The trailer and screenshots showcased a fast-paced multiplayer fantasy action game. So when I saw the game appear on sale as early access, I bought it straight away and got ready for some sword-fighting action. All I have gotten so far it disappointment and frustration. The controls are awkward and unresponsive, the classes all seem to be exactly the same, several of the specials are usless (for example, there is no way to aim the throwing axes/knives), and the game itself is laggy to the point of being unplayable. I'm aware that this game is still in early access, but it would be nice if I could actually have fun with it. It is supposed to be a game, after all.\n\nI wanted to like Kingdoms Rise, I really did, but it is simply an unenjoyable experience. If you really are keen to try out this game, I would recommend waiting until it's out of early access or just avoid buying it altogether.

The screenshots and videos of the levels are 3/4ths of that entire map or level. No joke.\n\n-Due to the EXTREMELY small sized maps, often leads to 1 team dominating the other, and spawn camping the other team the rest of the game, resulting in a very frustrating, and un enjoyable experience.\n\n-Nothing in the way of letting you know the differnce between weapons, etc.\n\n- Very bad UI, that is both confusing, and misleading.\n\n- Absolutely nothing letting you know whats going on, such as if enemies are taking a control point, etc, or if the other team is controlling it or not, again, with the stupid small maps, it's not the biggest issue, but again, causes alot of confusion in games.\n\n-Very confusing main menu.\n\n-Cosmetically the UI layout, in-game layout, and main menu is very un appealing and or confusing. Of course, again, a small thing, but it's just one very small of many things to pull it all together to turn someone off.\n\nLike I said, the game has ALOT of potential, because of what they are trying to bring to the table, but it has quite a very long time to ever get to that point for what the stage is at. Consider yourself buying a Pre Alpha version of a game. Where the levels are made, the base simple mechanics are there, but nothing else is remotely close to being finished.\n\n\n","December 7, 2013","false","0.3"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

But that's my experience.\n\nTheres not much to this game, the combat system is essiantially the same as Mount & Blade, and that game is really old but is one of the greatest hack&slash games out there. Sure the combat adds in spells... but some are just way too OP so you see most players using them and abusing the OP stuff most of the time.\n\nThe game is in Early Access, and hasn't been updated in ages. Developers are still apparantly working on this game and it isn't dead, but I cant come to actually liking the game in it's current state, the $15 is an absolute waste of money and you could get better games.\n\nI do regret my purchase at this time, I hope the developers end up changing my mind by actually updating more frequently rather then taking months.\n\nNo I do not recommend this game to the slightest. I stand by my oppinion and I will until the game is out of Early Access, to which I will play the game again and see if it's any better.\n\n*Edit* I decided to play the March 2014 Update\n\nIs it any better? No it is not. It's still a really crappy game with a low playerbase.

This is an amazingly fun game that can really be summed up as third person Chivalry with magic. But it's much more than any of those things.\n\nNormal melee uses a charge/release system. When you release, you swing in the exact 360 degree direction that you moved the camera while charging. You also block in the same manner, holding a direction, up to a couple seconds at a time. There is no magic block button in this game. You have a dodge roll, but there are no invincibility frames. You have a backstep, useful for counterattacking, as well as a disarming strike that render's the opponent's weapon unusable for a couple seconds by hitting your roll button during an attack charge.\n\nThere's an assortment of weapon choices in the game from the tank sword, which reduces incoming damage by 30%, to the Sneak Sword that basically functions like a TF2 spy knife to the Mobility Sword that increases your movement speed and enables you to double jump. There's a sword and shield option if blocking in a given direction proves too much for you and the Warhammer has a large amount of knockback useful for sending players flying off ledges.\n\nYou're allowed to carry a bonus item into battle as well, and these vary in form and function. You could enter battle with a longbow strapped to your back, a bear trap to place on the ground, or an amulet you can consume for a health boost. Maybe you want to use throwing knives instead of the bow, or an axe that explodes like a grenade and can stick into a player if you hit them with it.\n\nYou can take two spells into combat (or the same spell twice), though if you're good at using the menu you can swap these out on the fly, assuming you're willing to wait their full cooldown duration before use. Spells include a long-range teleport, turning invisible, force pull and push, multiple slows, a buff that grants temporary immunity to non-melee hits, some nukes like fireballs and lightning bolts, the ability to turn intangible for a couple seconds, a healing spell, and more.\n\nSpells (and their cooldowns) are where all the game's strategy comes from. Do you want to rely on your sword to kill opponents? Take spells like teleport and pull to get up-close and personal. Afraid to get in close? Try using Fireball, Lightning Bolt or Ice Shot to deal with enemies at a 'safe' distance. Having touble against that kind of player and want to juke out their cooldowns? Go for Phase Shift, Teleport or Magic Immune to dodge their damage while you approach. Are you losing in the melee? Consider using Force Push and Invisibility to sneak up on any player standing too close to a pit for a kill and a good laugh. The most recent spell, Ice Spike, summons a large crystal which pops up players on top of it and once summoned, can be used as cover or to platform on top of.\n\nThe only real problem with this game is that no one plays it. Nine times out of ten, the servers are all going to be empty. There is a survival mode and a practice map with bots that can show off the game and give you the opportunity to test your loadout, but it's not the true Kingdoms Rise experience. I would buy this only if you have a friend to play with or if you want to be one of those guys and add random people like me onto your steam list hoping for some matchmaking.\n\nI write this fresh out of an hour and a half streaming session in which I played Kingdoms Rise for none of the world to see, because people watch the game as much as they play it. If you want to see the game in action, the different maps and spells available, and you don't mind a bit of vulgarity because the friend I'm playing with and I are disgusting when put in the same room, I suggest you at least take a peek. If you'd rather watch footage that's safe for work, just turn the sound off. It's probably for the best anyways, though the gradually increasing music volume as the timer reaches zero is a nice touch by the dev. Click Here (NSFW)\n\ntl;dr: Buy this game, then buy it again. Then buy a four-pack. Buy one for all your steam friends. If you can get one of them to play with you, regardless of who they are, you're gonna have a good time. If you buy enough copies, maybe the dev will be able to afford a marketing budget finally and we might get opponents on a more regular basis.","March 10, 2015","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And for being early in development the character customization is rather good, even if it could be better.\nHowever there are some bad things, the animations when it comes to attacks and such are rather boring, and don't have the same amount of 'feeling' in it compared to games like Chivarly (granted, Chivalry did have a bigger dev team and more funds). The lack of music in the game certainly doesn't help, not even a light ambience in the main menu, making the game feel rather dull honestly. Hitboxes feel off, and during online play people with only a 20 ping difference seem to have a large advantage of those with higher ping, making the hitbox issue even worse.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 6/10, the idea is great, it just needs to be refined a bit more.","September 24, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And Kingdoms Rise more than delivers on this front. It has a well-executed, smooth and deep melee combat system where every single factor comes into play when fighting your foe, from basic things like movement and mouse control - sidestepping attacks, aiming your own swing well and knowing your sword's reach, dodging and rolling - to the advanced features of the combat system, including directional parrying, counterattacking ("locking"), and juking parries with feints.\n\nThe system truly allows for a master swordsman to outshine his opponents (up until the moment an adversary sneaks up on him unawares and cleaves him from behind, at least!), and the satisfaction of improving and seeing the results of your own improvement in-game is a huge part of what makes the game fun. And oh yes, don't forget the kills. Bloody, brutal and extremely satisfying. The game has an awesome, fluid set of animations even at such an early stage of development.\n\nThen there are the ranged weapons and spells. I have a few minor gripes about them (I personally hate how stealth is spammable, even mid combat, and I also feel that plane shift is too strong) but overall, it's remarkable how well balanced abilities and secondary weapons are for a game so early in development. For the most part they bring even more depth (and fun!) to the game, without overriding the main flavour of the game, which is pure melee combat. I feel that teleport and heal  bring the most to the table in this regard, especially heal as it prevents "graveyard zerging" of a player who's already been engaged in heavy melee combat, but emerged victorious (albeit not unscathed).\n\nOut of the box, this pre-alpha appears to be really buggy - lots of unimplemented things, settings not getting saved, missing menu items, and so on. Don't be put off - everything that *needs* to be working for you to jump straight into a game, is working. I'm actually happy that the menu looks like crap, the menu sounds are annoying and loud and everything looks like crap - because the real soul of the game is there. And gosh darnit, it's not even pre-alpha yet!","November 25, 2013","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The directional-based sword fighting feels both weighty and satisfying, and though it lacks a little in fluidity you soon forget this as your blade cuts through your enemies.\n\nCombat consists of directional-based attacks and parries depending on the movement of your mouse, but also allows for advanced combat tactics such as rolling, jump-attacks, locking, feinting (cancelling) and counter-strikes. It also has a decent array of spells that can change the course of battle; including invisibility, fireballs, bear-traps, teleportation and mines, with more to come in the future.\n\nGraphically, the game is quite impressive. It looks fabulous and the maps are not only varied, but each equally fun to play; there's no one map that gives me the reaction "ugh, I hate this one." It also has a large amount of content for character customization, including specific armour or clothing pieces for specific areas of the body allowing you to carve out your own, unique champion. Often, I've recognized players not by the name above their heads, but by what they look like.\n\nBear in mind it is still in development, so you will have to forgive the occasional graphical bug (such as swords not appearing in the hands of a swinger) that while annoying, didn't particularly subtract from the overall enjoyment I had. Though I only played for a few hours, I had a blast of a time and would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in fantasy sword combat.\n\nThis game has great potential that it has already begun to realize and I cannot wait to see how they expand upon it in the coming months. I'd love to see some sort of progression system, new weapons with varied statistics and the ability to create clans/guilds with fellow players and battle it out in epic guild wars.

The menus are shotty at best, and the gameplay can be a bit tough to jump into (since there are no actual tutorials). That being said, the scenery is beautiful, and the skills+swordplay coordination is interesting to learn. I believe that the game has a lot of potential once it has had time to be developed. One thing I think would be nice is slightly faster attack speed.

The combat isn't terrible but it's not great, nothing really separates it from other games to be honest. The concept is good, if they polish it a bit more then it'd be great.

Definitely incomplete, definitely awesome nevertheless! It illustrates legitimate medieval combat while implementing a unique and, if I do say so myself, a double-backflippin awesome magic system. My personal weapon of choice is the stealth sword (one of the five swords) and two fireballs. Though weapon choices are limited, the character customization is INSANELY COOL! My only gripe is the cloaks. Though I still wear them, they act really strangely. The sidearms are all pretty cool. I go with the explosive throwing axe, myself. I also like how there is no crosshairs, making the whole thing much more realistic and hardcore.

But there is some room for improvement a game like this can mostlikly change the pvp arena games , I smell call of duty doing this sometime , but lets hope kingdom rise makes good use of what they have. But my only problem is the hosting and the some weapons that feel sluggish , but all in all its a good game so far and i do mean so far..","December 6, 2013","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The devs recently decided thast it was a good idea to put in throwing knives, which drastically effected the way you approach combat and overall just made the game not that much fun anymore. I know its an alpha, but its not a pretty good sign if the devs think its okay to put such an out-of-place, unbalanced weapon in the game.\n\nRegardless, its surprisingly fun for a game in its alpha.

I would HIGHLY recommend looking at the tutorial (which were not avalible in game at this time) but can be found on the website. Parrying and dodging took some getting used to and I found if my ping was abit high I was dying. Mayeb there should be a practice bot you can learn the basics off? I learn because I bought my mates the 4 pack and we just jumped on a server and learnt with each other, but I doubt everyone can do that. Also not sure what the different swords do? but get this game even if to just mess around with for a few hours, well worth the money. Great work to all involved in the game","December 5, 2013","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played a good amount but I left because there was noone playing it. The game had teams of four (Probably more but I don't know because there was noone playing it). If it was F2P with buyables, like TF2, this game would take off and prosper, people would scramble to get on servers to play it. It is by far one of the most fun games I have played, but because you run into the same 5 people all the time, it becomes unfun, especially if one of the people have 100+ hours on it and play it all the time. I honestly wish that this game was alive still because I would be playing/would have played it more. Just because the servers are dead doesnt mean that it always will be. there might be more than 3 people on at once, then hop on in and enjoy a fun small game.\n\nIf this review is read by someone in the masses of steam/a developer, I really think that there should be a secondary game mode where its sort of like a MOBA, where you are the commander of your own little troop of weak NPC's that arent too weak and can take a hit. No towers, just protect the king, 1v1 2v2, 3v3, make it competitive. Also a 1v1 option, like an arena where people can enter and rank up would be cool too. And tornaments to support more people coming onto this game. Pull a CS:GO and create skins for new weapons that are rare, common and somewhat rare. It would attract the people who want to play the game for money. Drop the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and as more people buy into the game, release the more expensive ones in a tornament format. 1v1 tornament, 2v2 tornament, and 3v3 tornament. Would make this game ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING. But inorder for this to happen, it would have to be paid for and the skins should not be able to be sold until the game gets more publicity.\n\nI really want to see this game succeed,\nGood luck.","July 13, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then a few questionable updates came, namely an XP unlock system. I'm fine with it in early access, to test feedback on it and see if the rate needs any tweaking, but the game has, for all intents and purposes, a dead playerbase, so you really can't progress to unlock better spells and swords.\n\nI bought into it early, before the XP progression, and I really really liked what it had to offer. The combat was decent enough for the state the game was in, if a bit confusing and frustrating at times, but that was part of the fun, learning how to do combos and then do them faster and faster. And then, everyone I was having fun with in the game started to disappear, now there's only about 5 people if you're lucky.","November 4, 2015","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let the pretty screen shots and epic videos fool you, no one plays Kingdoms Rise anymore, and the game never came close to living up to it's promise.
