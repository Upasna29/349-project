See explanation at the end of the message]\n\nThat game is not a sequence of 30-ish maps to clear. You have to manage a unique village, recruit workers, produce food, build, and so on. I love that kind of games (like Virtual Villagers and The Promised Land). A lot!\n\nBut this one is kind of disappointing... Other similar games let you choose what you're gonna do, and let you feel like you're managing something.\nHere, it's just a list of orders with lots of waiting. You're asked to research agriculture, plant potatoes, harvest potatoes, makes fries, plant tomatoes, harvest tomatoes, make ketchup, give fries and ketchup to save the natives from starvation... You don't get to choose. You just follow orders. And you wait a lot between two.\nSo... No, thanks!\n\nThe game could be good if, like the others, it let you some kind of freedom.\nAs you can see, I only played around 40 minutes, but I got bored fast.\nIt's too bad, because there's not enough games like that.\n\nFull edit: I'm being a little harsh because I love that kind of games. As it is, it's way better than the games with levels to clear. Because you get to build a whole village stone by stone. It may be a negative evaluation, but it's not because the game goes in the wrong direction, but because it's only halfway in the right direction. With a little tweaking, the game could be good. Here are the things that would make my thumb go up: a bigger screen, smaller controls (this is not a mobile game), and total freedom. I mean, just add an option to switch off the step-by-step and I'm back!\nKeep a few as a tutorial and then it's all about figuring out what to do with the farm.\nReally, to be honest, I don't need something else.","May 28","false","0.6"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","3"
