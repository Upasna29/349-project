With that said I think its worth supporting this title for the level of quality it contains at the moment.  Bioshock is one of my all time favourite game worlds and this game is heavily inspired by it with its art deco setting, adverts via the radio and poster and also its overall dark/dystopian vibe.  This game also to my good fortune blends some of the "hitchikers guide to the galaxy" humour with a 70/80s view of the robotic future.  The colors blast you with a fusion of neon and seemingly much larger areas than rapture had and the environmental sounds and noises also conjure up 70/80s sci-fi action movies.  The game though centers around a noir detective setting of which you appear to be a robot dective.  I stumbled across some of the story and very amusing incidents as i tried to just take in the game world.  It's a great base and with some more love this game will hopefully turn out to be a gem even if it's gameplay doesn't get to advanced by the end.   If you like any of the above i would recommend the game even at full price (it may go up in theory when released in a year?).  Even if not I suggest adding it to your follow list to see what develops over this year--here's to hoping the "Ministry" delivers on this ambitious endeavour.","January 5","true","1.6"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","0"

I did feel like it should just come to life though. As if this large metropolis should be bursting with life and energy. Especially in the lounge area where the bar is. Seems as if something is missing in that aspect. This game is very emersive, the overall feel and  flow combined music really sets you into a state of relaxation mixed with a bit of fear. Just because you do not know what can happen next.\n\n~The Fat Man","January 15","true","0.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
