That’s why when I started to play Tales of the Orient I expected to be bored after 30 minutes – 1 hour of gameplay. Instead of that I found myself playing it for hours straight, without needing a break.\n\nWhat makes it so enjoyable then?\n\nMaybe it’s the fact that the goals are so well set that they make you want to play “just one more level before I quit” – during each level you collect gold that you can use afterwards to buy buildings in order to restore a town damaged by the Civil war; it usually takes 4-5 levels to get enough money to build something, which is an easily achievable goal.\n\nOr maybe it’s the flexibility that this game offers by providing 3 game styles: Swap Mode – the classic Match 3 where you swap tiles to match 3 or more identical tiles, Pop Mode – in which you click on a group of adiacent matching tiles and Chain Mode – in which you have to drag a chain over a group of identical tiles. In addition to that you can choose to play in Relaxed mode or in Challenge mode (limited number of moves).\n\nAnother thing that I liked about this game is the feature of rotating the board in either direction. This is useful in order to avoid empty tiles since they refill by turning the board; it also allows you to control the direction in which the tiles will fall after a successful match. In addition to that, there are of course power ups that you can use and that recharge over time and a shuffle option.\n\nThe nice graphics and relaxing ambient music make this game even more enjoyable. The tiles are colorful, which makes them easily distinguishable. In case you need to match a tile multiple times, the tile background indicates how many moves are left until it’s fully unlocked.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","March 2, 2015","true","21.2"," 58 of 63 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","58","63","0","3"

If there were other options, this game would get the "If there's nothing better" or "meh" rating, because it's just ... generic. It has a few strong points, and just as many weak ones, making it really hard to foresee if a random user would like it or not.\nStart with the positives:\n- The best one: you can choose your game: match 3, the classic swapper one. Pop, where you just have to click on groups of 3+ blocks to make them disappear, and for third, Chain - you need to draw a line between 3+ blocks to make them disappear.\n- Power-ups: single block,  random 5 blocks, whole row, whole row + rank in a shape of a cross.\n- If you can make at least 5 blocks disappear, you'll get a bomb with blows up the tile it's on + 2 in the four main directions.\n- You can rotate the table\n-Ability to randomize the table - timed, not charged.\n- Pretty, colourful design.\n- Lots of levels, if you enjoy the game. About 100 levels to build everything, and achievements for 200 played levels / 10 hours of gameplay.\nThen the negatives:\n- Totally unbalanced. In chain-only games, like 4 Elements, the longer the chain, the bigger the explosion. Here while the chain-mechanic has the potential of making much longer matches than the traditional swap, it's hard to pull of because you can touch one tile only once during drawing the chain, plus the game will reward the 6-7-8 block long chains with a simple bomb as well. Bomb will get placed where the chain ends, if it's long enough.  Pop mode makes this much, much-much easier - I think chain is the hardest mode because of the too many different colours present at the same time.\n-Feature level bugs and annoying kinds of real bugs. Where you create a bomb you can detonate it in the air before it would fall, you can do this with any block matches as well.  You can rotate the table while creating the bomb making it fall "sideways". While the bomb's flames are present, the game treats the blocks as intact, so basically you can blow up a bomb, then make the soon-to-be-exploded blocks disappear in a match. But at least you can calculate with these, but I'm pretty sure it's not designed into the game as tutorial hasn't mention it at all.\nOften (especially where creating bombs) blocks just spawn under the bomb, so it doesn't fall as deep as it should be, destroying tactics and plans.\n- Challenge mode in my opinion is totally broken and borderline impossible. Levels are randomized, and challenges are based on the number of moves, not time. The table doesn't auto-shuffles where there are no matches, you need to do it manually. In challenge mode if you don't want to spend 3-4 moves for the *chance* of making a golden tile disappearing, you can try reshuffling.   Once in like every 3 minutes, making the game incredibly streched out and slow.\nThe powerups require like 50 blocks (14 3-block matches) to charge, making it usable like once on a level, if you're lucky. Another reason to call the game surprisingly slow.\nAnd this is not a real negative, but it would be so much better if one could rotate the table with the arrow keys, like Clickr does, it would improve a lot on the fluidity of the gameplay.\nAfterall, my problem with the game that is so average (and not a trustworthy kind of average game hence the constant glitches and bugs) that I can not recommend it - though if you want to play it, get it, preferably on a sale. It's not bad, it's not unplayeable, just ... there are better games out there in the match 3 genre.\n( PS: an advice: Always escape to the menu and close the game - if you happen to alt-F4 while playing on a board to close the game,  your progress from that session gets deleted as I think there's still no autosave between the levels)","November 2, 2015","false","66.9"," 43 of 59 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","43","59","5","1"

The game also has a story line, that is enjoyable to do as well. The main game is basically 100 levels and each level has a different board to play on. Instead of endless just matching pieces though, you are given goals to achieve to pass each level which keeps the game interesting as you go along. So checking your goals before you start is the best way to get going. What also makes the game more tactical in thinking is you can also turn the board to the left or right in 90 degree increments. There are four game tools that can be used as soon as they are "filled" up by matching certain pieces as you move along. One tool breaks one whole row or column that the tool is used in, one breaks a whole row and column. Making sure you know what fills each tool up can make or break you getting your board done to move on to the next level.\n\nThe story line consists of building up a village, each building you complete gives you extra moves to use when you want to. The games graphics are very beautiful and makes the game very relaxing to play. The graphics alone were a big reason I purchased the game. Getting all the achievements is not hard at all, so making 100% achievements is very do-able. This casual game gets a 7/10 from me.","August 31, 2015","true","85.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","2"

There are 3 different ways to play:  Swap, Chain, or Pop.  Swap is the traditional match 3, as in Bejeweled, where you click on a tile, then click on a second tile to swap them and make a match.  Chain is like in Tidalis, where you use the mouse to create a path of the same type of tile and then clear them.  Pop is similar to Season Match, click on groups of 3 or more matching tiles to clear them.  Personally I prefer Swap.\n\nThere is also 2 different modes.  Challenge mode gives you a set number of moves to finish the level.  Casual gives you no limit.\n\nThe graphics are decent.  Nice backgrounds of Japanese scenery--both day and nighttime scenes.  Let's face it, you're probably not playing this game for the cutting edge graphics, so what do you expect?!\n\nThe background music get boring after awhile.  But again, are you really playing a puzzle game for great sound?  Sure it would be nice but it's not essential.\n\nThe story is bare bones, but they keep it interesting by having you purchase buildings for your village.  The buildings do not do anything, but it makes it seem like you are making progress rather than just playing for no reason.\n\nI highly recommend this for match 3 lovers.  You can play whatever style you prefer.","March 2, 2015","true","24.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","2"

Your goal is to rebuild your village, destroyed by invaders. For that, you have 100 levels of matching the same picture at least 3 times.\n\nBut do you know why this game is also different from every match-3 game? You can choose casual and timed mode.\n\nOr perhaps, this is more about choosing the mode you'll play the level: classic match-3 (swap mode), making chains (chain mode, like in the game 4 Elements) or taking all tiles of the same picture that are touching each other (pop mode).\n\nYou can rotate the board (very helpful to fill the void that can happen), shuffle the pieces or use one of the four bonus that are being filled with a specific picture. In other words, Tales of the Orient: The Rising Sun is letting you play the same level very differently each time!\n\nAdd to that a nice soundtrack (not diversified but still nice), correct graphics and you'll get a game that can take quite a time to finish - or to hunt achievements (10 hours in the game or the 200 levels).\n\nI've enjoyed it. That's true. But the big disappointement is that you have geishas and samurais and nothing is done with them apart speaking to you about the importance of some buildings. In other words, "Help the Geisha and the Samurai to save the day" should be understood as "Save the day while the Geisha and the Samurai are just sitting there and speaking".\n\nI'm still recommanding it though.","July 7, 2015","true","11.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The best feature of this game is it's fully compatible with a windows10 tablet. Very touch screen friendly. Works perfectly on desktop too.\nSo I recommend this game to everyone who likes objective based match-3 games, but beware! It's not an easy game. You can choose from 3 different play styles: swap, pop and chain. Most of the time I play in swap mode but none of them makes the game easier.\nThe graphics are beautiful, the music is epic too.\nI recommend it to everyone who is up for a good challenge!

I picture a design meeting where they asked everyone to call out the first thing that came to mind when hearing the word "Japan".\n\n"Sushi!"  yelled Bob from accounting.  "Samurai!" called out Jim, the janitor.  "Good, good, keep em coming." said Jane, as she jotted down the suggestions.  "Geisha!"  "Ninja stars!"  "Rice balls!"  Excitement filled the room as more and more wonderful ideas were called out.  Suddenly Albert the night watchman called out "Happy Ending!"  The room got quiet for a minute, then everyone started to cheer.  "We're totally putting that in there, or my name isn't Jane Doe!" said Jane Doe.\n\nSo yeah, it's about rather blandly generic, or possibly generically bland as you can get.  This game accurately depicts Japanese culture about as well as Taco Bell depicts Mexican cuisine.  Now, I must say that I'm a regular American, and I really don't care how they depict anybody, except maybe Americans.  Point is, the whole "Build an ancient Japanese village " and "Exciting adventure" thing isn't all that thrilling.\n\nSo how about the gameplay then?  Well, the next point in the description is "Rotate the board make the best matches."  At first rotating the board sounds pretty cool, until you realize that you can just keep rotating the board until you win, with the occasional match made by you to free up some space.  There are also your typical match-3 game powerups, charged by destroying gems.  Nothing revolutionary there, except maybe the bug that prevents you from clearing certain tiles.  Yes, I know they said they fixed it, and yes, it is still happening.\n\nIf you're a match-3 player, there are certainly other games out there better than this.  Heck, HuniePop is a far better match-3 game, albeit one attached to a whole other, less savory H game, which is not an inherently bad thing, but not for everyone.  Tales of the Orient is, despite the lovely description, rather bland.

All of the concepts are well thought out - artwork, putting in a story line to tie to progression, having four skills to help beat the levels, three modes of play, but I came away feeling it could have been so much more.\n\nYou get the full suite of skills by level 20.\nPop and Chain mode - you spend more time waiting for the shuffle button than actually playing and the part that's annoying is that you can't minimize the game and do something else - has to up or it suspends the timer.\nAs you progress you create buildings but they serve no purpose.\nAnd once you're done the 100 levels, the last achievement feels entirely like grinding for the sake of getting it.\nYou have to try really hard to fail a level - it's so hard to fail unless you click randomly that it probably could have been a rare achievement .\n\nFor contrast compare it\n1.

Plus, the art style isn't as annoyingly saccharine cutesy.\n\nThe game has a "challenge" mode where you are limited in moves like Candy Crush, but also a "relaxation" mode where you have infinite moves, just in case you're sick and don't want to think too hard, or you want to let your 4-year-old have a game without ever feeling frustrated.\n\nIn fact, the 4-year-old target audience seems like a good fit: You can rotate the board to change where the blocks fall, and you get infinite "shuffle"s to re-randomize the board.  You get overpowered special abilities that wipe out whole columns and rows of the board, and the recharging of those abilities carries over, meaning you can purposefully tank a level recharging your supermoves, then break them out at the start when you reset the level.  (Or just play relaxation mode where it's impossible to lose.)\n\nThere are three modes to choose from, with two of the three relying upon clicking already-existing matches, and the last being the "swap" mode that is familiar to most match-3 players.  The maps and number of moves are the same, and you give up automatic matches/chain matches when you play anything but swap, so there's zero reason to handicap yourself by using anything but swap.\n\nYou play as a... I don't know what you play as.  But apparently, someone burned down a village (although it's a pristine grassy field when you look at it,) and everyone says it's your responsibility to pay for rebuilding it.  Getting gold involves beating levels, so basically, you just play levels and then spend all your money on other people you are assured you are related to in some way.  There are only two characters, (the ones on the title menu,) and they only have two poses: normal, and blinking.  You'll get sick of seeing their stiff poses.\n\nThe village scenes are largely pointless.  You get a set amount of gold from each level you complete, and need to build 4 buildings to complete each set before you advance to the next set of buildings.  Since getting maximum gold is nearly always mandatory, it basically comes down to completing level 10 will let you complete set 1, and level 31 will let you complete set 2, etc.  Besides the first set, all the buildings give you are more "extra moves", which are basically what you pay money for in Candy Crush.  Since you get a set amount of money per level, it basically amounts to "click a button to build something every five levels, then go back to play more."\n\nThe story is paper-thin, it's about as relevant to Japanese history as a American Civil War chess set is relevant to the actual American Civil War, and the apparent priority you have in village building more than slightly absurd.  (You build a temple for geisha entertainers before you build a rice paddy, and sumo wrestler rings and zen gardens before you build a watch tower or garrison to prevent more raids.) The story involves a civil war, but fails to mention which civil war, which side you're on, or who was even fighting you.  You build a "Great Wall" to keep the invaders/rebels/whatever out that looks awfully Chinese for a Japanese story, etc.  It's clearly not meant for someone who cares at all about Japanese history.  (In fact, "Orient" is generally looked down upon by most Asians...)\n\nIn total, it's a match-3 game that isn't trying to rob you, and isn't all that frustrating.  Good for a break or giving to people who are definitely on the "casual" end of gaming.","August 9, 2015","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't think Geisha, Sumo and Samurai Temple being real. Having a Zen Garden too close to a Forge isn't very logical, either(As metalworking would make LOTS of sounds, and silence is important for Zen.). Childrens and buildings look too much chinese, and there are more things to complain, but I'll cut it for now.\n\nGameplay is bad, for a match-3.\n- 100 levels. too much of them. And unlike gazillions of match-3s that are on steam, there is no minigame at all.\n- Being able to rotate the board is an interesting take, but makes drops very unpredictable. I sometimes seen drops appearing from SIDES.\n- On level 44, You're tasked to remove 10 Metal tiles(you have to remove twice to be able to reclaim the golden tile beneath it). But you only see TWO at start. so where are the other 8? THEY ARE SIMPLY INVISIBLE, because those invisible metal tiles are on normal tile.\n- There is no freedom in order of buildings, because you get fixed amount of gold from clearing levels. Buildings after second tier(first tier give you powers) only give you "Extra Moves" for Challenge mode.\n- I wouldn't recommend playing in any modes other than Relaxed Swap mode, because :\n-- Challenge mode has very tight(or nearly impossible) moves limit, and "Extra moves" you get from buildings ARE GONE FOR GOOD when you spend them.\n-- Pop-3 and Chain-3 doesn't have "combo effect" unlike Swap mode.\n-- Also in Chain-3 mode, you can also chain wooden/stone blocks. Is it intended?\n-- Shuffle recharges in time than moves, so you can eventually beat challenge mode with 0 moves, if you have patience for it.\n-- And in Challenge mode, UI problem occurs when you finish a level with the last move.\n- Achievements for playing 10 HOURS and 500 levels. seriously?\n- While music is not bad, it doesn't sound too Oriental(or Japanese).\n\nI tried to be nice with reviewing this game, but the many bugs, especially the forementioned "invisible metal tile" problem is beyond my torelance. 4/10.\n\nEdit : they ninja-updated the requirement of "500 levels done" to 200. But it doesn't improve the game much.\n\n---------------------------\n\n日本ネタのマッチ3だから薦めようと思ったけど、その気がおきなかった問題作。\n江戸時代と書いてあるけど、全くそれっぽくない。Geisha Temple(芸者の寺？)やSumo Temple(スモウの寺？)なんて初めて聞くし、Forge(鍛冶場)のすぐ裏にZen Garden(庭園じゃなくて瞑想場?)があるのもおかしく思えたりする。他にも変なところはあるがここでは説明しきれない。\n\nゲームプレイの出来は酷い。\n- 100面もいるか？Steam上にあるほかのマッチ3ゲームと違い、ミニゲームすら存在しない。\n- ボードを回転させられるのは良いのだが、なぜかドロップが左右から出てきたり、落下が予測できなかったりと悪い方向に働いている。\n- 44面の目的のひとつに、「鉄タイル(2回マッチさせる必要がある)を10個消す」とある。しかし見えるのはたった2つ。残りの8つはなんと透明(消した時のエフェクトで判断するしかない)で、「金タイル(消すとクリア時にゴールドがもらえる、と言うか全部消さなきゃならない)」ではないタイルの上に置かれていることが原因だと思われる。\n- ゴールドの入手量が決まっているため、建物の建設における自由さが皆無。第1段階の建物はパワーを解禁するが、第2段階以降の建物は全て「Extra Moves(追加手数)」を与えるのみ。\n- 手数無制限のスワップモード(Relaxed Swap mode)以外やるべきじゃない。理由は次のとおり：\n-- チャレンジモードにおける手数制限が厳しすぎる。しかも、建物から得た「追加手数」は使えばそれっきりで、その面を失敗してもやり直しても取り戻すことができない。\n-- ポップモード(3つ以上隣接したドロップをクリック)とチェインモード(3つ以上隣接したドロップのひとつをクリックし、同種ドロップの上をなぞっていく)は「コンボ」が発生しない。そのためスワップ(ドロップをクリック、隣接するドロップと交換)以外の難易度が極端に高い。\n-- チェインモードでは箱(隣接するドロップを消すと壊れる)も直接消せてしまう。意図的とは思えないのだがどうだろう。\n-- シャッフルは時間経過で再使用できる。そのため、チャレンジモードも手数0でクリアできてしまう(時間の無駄だろうけど)。\n-- チャレンジモードで手数を使い切ると同時にクリアするとUIが同時に表示される問題がある。\n- 実績に「10時間プレイする」「500面クリアする」ってのがある。長すぎないかそれ。\n- 音楽は唯一の悪くないポイントだが、日本らしいとは思えない。\n\nテーマ的にはアリなんだけど出来がダメ過ぎる。もう少し高く評価したかったが、前述の「見えない鉄タイル」問題だけは許すことができない。 4/10","March 2, 2015","false","6.7"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","17","32","2","3"

The art is gorgeous, the music is great (and incredibly apropos for the theme of course) and the err... "story" (???) for what it is also matches the theme.  Also the variety of options in which way you make your matches will keep even the most addicted Match-3 fan at least a little busy.  Avoid if you don't like match-3s or casual games, but it's great for burning off a migraine or while watching documentaries.  Or anime.

When I first started playing, I almost uninstalled it after 5 minutes. The game was very difficult even just on stage 2 because the spaces are tight and blocked while tiles don't spawn on the side after I accidentally cleared the bottom. However I come to realise that you can actually rotate the puzzle and the tiles will start to fill up the empty spaces again. How silly of me. Apart from your convention swapping tiles, you can also choose from 2 additional play style (which is quite similar actually).\n\nEach game will earn you some gold and you need to spend them rebuilding your town. After certain milestone you will unlock certain powers that will recharge when you consume tiles. The story and town building is irrelevent in my opinion as you only click on purchase once you have the gold and the building simply appears on the landscape. It does not provide any other use apart from eye candy and the feeling of progression.\n\nThe game can be challenging as you can see from the screen shot. The convention slide beside the blocked tiles to break them and you need to do that several times. One thing that really annoys me is the speed of the game and the animation which is painfully slow.","October 18, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

About every minute, regardless what I'm doing, an animated arrow about 60% the size of one of the tiles will appear, and slowly wave back and forth to point out the move it would suggest -- and it stays there until I have made a move.  It is immensely distracting, and difficult to ignore -- and I'd rather play the game myself, rather than click on the things the computer tells me to click on.  :/\n\nI'm probably going to revisit it again later, just to give it another chance, but for right now I really can't see myself enjoying this game without some option to turn the hint system off.  Or at least make it wait for me to click a button before it spoils possible moves for me.","July 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaysbadmemory/recommended/339160/","kaysbadmemory","kayhmkay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kaysbadmemory/","467 products in account","This game is your average match 3 game. Average being the keyword.\n\nMy main problems with this game:\nAs a first impression: the custom pointer is broken. Launching the game for the first time, you don't see where your mouse is, so good luck setting things up etc. If I didn't use a pen tablet with area fixed to screen I would have given up.\nThe story does not add anything to the game. You're supposed to save a village after a raiding horde has destroyed it. Or something. All you get from the story happens in about 40 seconds before you get to play anything.\nIn relation to the previous, you play to get gold with which you're supposed to rebuild the village. However, getting all gold tiles in the level is one of the requirements. Else you fail. This means, there is no excitement or 'point' in getting the gold and trying to build the village. You either succeed and get to build stuff or you're stuck.\nThe building itself is slow, tedious and pointless. You click on the building, then wait out a (too) long animation and have your building. Next!\nThe little info or 'goal setting' you get from the characters you can accidentally click away. There is a 'continue/close' button in the dialogs but clicking anywhere will close things.\nThe match 3 mechanics are broken. Playing with the swap option (this game gets a big plus for letting the player choose between swap, pop and link style of gameplay for each level) the matches you create sometimes don't disappear fully or are replaced on the spot instead of filling the empty slots from the top like (I assume) planned. This means you can plan for awesome chain reactions, but it's a matter of luck getting them. Playing in challenge mode where your moves are limited will drive you nuts.\nAs someone already said, if you don't exit through the main menu, your session is lost. I had over 13 hours on record, the game crashed/Steam closed it, lost 10 hours. Oh well. Hadn't gotten the achievements for 5 or 10 hrs either so no big loss.\nI am a big match 3 fan. This game looked good on paper and jumped on the top of my long queue the day I got it. I was very happy with the first couple of levels, but after that, the negatives outweigh the positives. This is in no way the worst match 3 game I've ever played, but it's not good either.\n\nMy advice? If you've played all the other ones already or if you want easy (but slow!) achievements AND you get this for less than $1.00, GO FOR IT. If not, stay away.","March 10","false","27.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Would not want to not see Mulan's t*ts again.\n\n\nReal Review:\n\nSo, another match-3 game given with an easy 100%.  Play as a generic placeholder as you aid a geisha and a samurai (The samurai whom you'll only see twice in the game.  Once in the beginning, and once in the ending) in rebuilding a Japanese town after a civil war has ended.  That's as far as the story goes...not even a 1-minute long story.\n\n\n\nPROS:\n\nCasual\nEasy\nAchievements\n\nCONS:\n\nGame has bugs (Tiles will fall down and sometimes get stuck, leaving them to shake uncontrollably)\nGame has exploits (When you repeatedly click a combo in POP mode, it'll count multiple times to easily elliminate special tiles)\nKinda' boring\nToo expensive for what you're getting.\n\n\nPersonally?  I cannot recommend this game for the asking price ($7) as it feels like a game you could either play for free via Facebook.  If I had to price this game, I'd say that $1 or $0.50 would be fair.  The game has a few exploits and bugs, but overall, it's an easy casual game with 3 modes of gameplay to choose from.\n\n\n2/10  Just didn't hit its expected mark.","March 11","false","15.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

And you can rotate the board and there is a scramble on a timer if there is no more matches to be had.\n\nIt's mostly like other match 3 games except for the 3 different game modes.

In relaxed mode you have unlimited moves to complete levels, whereas in challenge mode you are given a maximum move limit. Players can switch back and forth between these modes at any time.\n\nAt the start of each of the 100 levels, you are given an additional layer of customizability: choosing your preferred clear mechanic - swap, chain, or pop.\n\n- Swap is the traditional Bejeweled-style gameplay, where you form rows or columns of 3-5 symbols by trading adjacent tiles. This is the only mode in which qualifying matches auto-clear from the board.\n\n- Chain is similar to 4 Elements, where you click and snake your mouse through connecting matching tiles to form longer zigzagging matches.\n\n- In pop style, you click on any grouping of 3 or more like tiles to clear it.\n\nIt is completely up to you how you want to play; you can stick with one style the whole time, or switch it up with each new puzzle. Certain levels are easier or harder depending on which option you choose, which means there are effectively 300 different levels in the game if you go back later and freeplay each level with each play style.\n\nAs you play, you gain currency that can be used to construct buildings, unlocking power-ups and extra moves. Moves gained this way go into a pool that you can draw from in 5-move increments in order to finish a level in challenge mode. This pool is finite, so any moves you use from it are permanently depleted. Additionally, there are only 16 purchasable upgrades, so use your moves wisely.\n\nOver the course of the game, you will unlock four different power-ups that will help you overcome the various challenges presented in each puzzle. These power-ups have meters that refill as you clear specified tiles from the board, and any progress you have made toward replenishing these meters carries over between puzzles. You are also given a shuffle button that is on a timer, bombs that appear any time you clear 5 or more tiles simultaneously, and arrows that rotate the board, allowing you to refill blank tiles spaces or change the direction of how tiles will fall. None of these bonuses count against your move limit.\n\n(I disagree with other reviews that imply you can keep rotating the board to solve levels. First of all, as previously mentioned, auto-clear only works in swap mode. Secondly, rotating the board can only clear tiles if you have open slots for new tiles to fall into, which isn't often. There are a handful of puzzles where rotation will help you form a few matches or save a few moves, but it will never complete the level for you, and usually the levels in question compensate by having lower total move limits.)\n\nI felt the escalation of challenges was well-paced, and keeps the puzzles from feeling repetitive. There are a range of obstacles to overcome, from immovable frozen tiles to hidden bricked-over tiles, and the tutorial does a good job of introducing each new hurdle.\n\nOnce you work your way through the story, you enter freeplay mode, where you can go back and replay any level from the game. I had a small glitch with my game where the play button for freeplay was not initially available, and I had to exit the game and relaunch it for the button to appear. I had no further problems accessing freeplay after that.\n\nI want to point out that the music for this game is absolutely fantastic. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a soundtrack so much.\n\nMy only real complaint with this game is the story. It is a bad amalgamation of mostly-Japanese tropes and stereotypes, and really has nothing to do with the Edo period. I am fine with a game being set in an historical setting, as long as the developers do their research and make it at least plausibly accurate. They could have easily kept their theme and given it an educational bent, with references to a specific conflict or real historical figures; but as it is, it feels generic and slightly offensive. Even the voice acting felt forced. There is a difference between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation, and even though the story didn't impact the gameplay in a significant way, it still made me shake my head.\n\nOverall, this match-3 game is highly customizable, well-paced, has a wealth of replay value, and contains an awesome soundtrack, making it one of the top in the genre. Its only real downside is that it used a cultural setting as a cheap gimmick, rather than as a learning tool or a respectful homage. I would give it an 8.5/10","May 18, 2015","true","26.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's either work hard and drive iPhone soccer moms poor, or be kind to the elderly women who vegetate on a PC.\n\nThis game, obviously, is of the second kind. I didn't enjoy the graphics, the UI is shoddy work with too much unskippable delays that do not belong there. However the game manages to stay easy and approachable despite adding more mechanics on top of Match 3 such as three match modes and rotation of game field.\n\nI enjoyed the fact that you can endlessly shuffle the board rather than waste moves that do not achieve anything, but it felt too good to be true tactic, open for abuse. You can get away from even the toughest of levels without wasting your last precious moves, simply by waiting for the game to let you shuffle the field. I feel that this is due to developer not wanting to implement a complex move prediction algorithm that is mandatory in mobile games to ensure players aren't stuck with no moves. Still, I appreciate this feature since some of the alternative match modes are impossible to win on some fields unless you abuse Shuffle for hours.\n\nI got this game for free, as part of a mass giveaway, but since you're probably looking at full price, I would still say it is enjoyable Match 3 game, especially if you'd rather play something on the lower spectrum of difficulty.

The different levels (as per Candy Crush) is what players of this style of game like, something to keep pushing their skills and limits.\n\nI liked the option to play with 3 different styles of match modes, however I found myself resorting to the 'candy crush styled' SWAP MODE.  When I first started playing, I played the first three levels in each different style, I started with SWAP, then went to CHAIN then POP.  I did this to find out what each style of gameplay was like, but it also unlocked an achievement.\n\nAs mentioned before, I fell back to SWAP as it lead to chain reactions happening with in the puzzle, where I was unable to get this effect to happen within the other game modes.\n\nI found it to be a Great game, I highly recommend it. :) :)\n\nNote to DEV: A thought I had on an adjustment to the game would be change the "complete 100 levels" and "complete 200 levels", and then add a 3rd.  You could call it "complete 300 levels" if you wish, but I would try to force a player to complete all the levels on each different 'SWAP STYLE'.
