Ten outa ten, best game of the year, or a fine work of art, words of praise that's hollow with no real meaning. You could say this kid wants to write about the solid gameplay, engaging story, beautiful world, amazing soundtrack, and a fine narration. But the kid knows better... The game left him feeling satisfied in the end, no one can say he had a bad time.

I would love to play another game with this guy as a lead voice. Music for the game is also very good and fitting for this kind of game, somewhat somber at times.The game play is pretty fast pace and excellent, though has it's short falls. One of them is that you are given too many weapons, Unless you plan on experimenting with the weapon load-out, You will usually stick with what works for you. Same with secret skills, which I hardly ever used while playing. Overall, an amazing game that opens up for you the more you play.","November 28, 2013","true","11.1"," 278 of 315 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","278","315","0","10"

Seldom has an independent developer hit the gaming scene with such an original and beautiful game as in this case.\n\nWhen I started Bastion for the first time, I immediately got the feeling I was in for a special treat. Few games begins as arrestingly as this one, with the whiskey- and smoke-weathered voice of the "narrator" immediately setting the scene. This narrative aspect proved crucial in the way Bastion drawed me into its world. It seemed like every step I made or every action I tried, could be met with some commentary. This feeling that the story develops "on the spot" is further enhanced by the fact that the world literally materialised under my feet as I ventured further out. This world is painted in bright and gorgeous colours with a teint all of their own: Bastion would be immediately recognizable just by looking at the colour-pallette.\n\nThe story by itself proved interesting enough to keep me playing, wanting to discover step-by-step how things would develop with the Bastion and the protagonists. Gameplay-wise, Bastion is not as innovative as in its storytelling or visuals, but it takes a well-tried formula into perfection. At its core, it is an action-rpg (light), preferably to be played with an xbox 360 controller (as are so many games the past years!). Controls are perfectly laid out and very intuitive: after a couple of hours I played it as if I had done so for several years. As the game progresses, more weapons and special abilities are unlocked, all with their distinctive characteristics. Weapons can be upgraded in five stages each, and liquids add some punch to the main-characters possibilities. Several other elements complement this core gameplay so that there is always enough variety to keep things interested. I even signed up immediately for the "new game plus" mode after completing the game a first time, looking forward to more unlocks of different sorts.\n\nAnother department where Bastion truly shines, is its soudtrack. Seldom has ingame-music helped me so much in getting "into" the game, as it captures the mood of every level to perfection. Combined with the unique grain of the narrator's voice, this develops into a great listening experience. The developers also did a wonderful jobs in the myriad of smaller sounds present in the game: every weapon for example has a unique "ring" to it, from the zippy sound of the Breaker's Bow to the rusty clack of the Musket. There really is no weak link in this game. Everything is extremely well thought-off, and even better implemented. It's a must-play for everyone who loves pc gaming.\n\nGameplay: 27/30\nGraphics: 18/20\nSound: 10/10 (maybe the best of all elements in this game)\nLongelivety: 8/10 (I played it for over 25 hours, exploring it to the full)\nTechnical: 10/10 (no issues whatsoever)\nSteam-integration: 8/10 (trading cards, leaderbords and achievements included, the latter good but not special)\nPersonal appreciation: 9/10\n\nOverall: 90/100\n\nI completely love Bastion and recommend it emphatically. Since I started writing reviews of the games I play on Steam almost a year ago, this is the first game that gets a score in the 90's - I don't want to ruin my scoring-system with giving too many high-scores. But this one deserves it to the full.","October 2, 2014","true","26.5"," 201 of 218 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","201","218","0","10"

Being one of the most beautiful and climatic games of 2011 this action RPG shines brightly even now, still as fresh and original as during its release.\n\nThe game itself is not so complicated. You take up role of a Kid, waking up, all alone, surrounded by beautiful yet crumbling world falling apart into thousand pieces. What You need to do is get to the Bastion – safe heaven set up to shelter those who’d survive any crisis threatening Your homeland – city of Caelondia.\n\nTo Your aid, in a quest to find, and rebuild Bastion, You’ll get a vast arsenal of even the weirdest weapons, each coming with different mechanics and “special skills” which further enhance Your possible combat strategies. Further modifications to Your play-style can be achieved through quite original system of upgradable structures built inside the Bastion, which allow Kid to chose worshiped “gods” in a shrine, or special drinks in a distillery each differently affecting game environment, providing new opportunities or threats.\n\nDespite game mechanics being pretty simple it’s not easy to get bored with ‘Bastion’ even after a few long hours, but what really makes this game stand out is its unique way of telling the story. Most of our actions are commented actively by omniscient narrator, who not only slowly reveals some details behind tragic events that left the whole world in ruins, but also perfectly portraits the Kid and his few friends, allowing us to immerse into the games plot on a level rarely seen in video games.\n\nThe last thing worth mentioning about ‘Bastion’ is it’s astonishing soundtrack. Composed by Darren Korb this game’s music fits its dreamy, hand-drawn canvas perfectly, strongly enhancing the impact of the narrative.\n\nOverall, I consider this game to be one of the most amazing feats of storytelling in video games, and definitely one of my favorites. And don’t get scared that the game relying so heavy on its story will get boring after just one completion. NG+ and Score Attack modes, matched which some arena-styled levels will allow You to spend long hours in “Bastion's” captivating world !\n\nPros:\n- One of the most beautiful soundtracks out there.\n- Light, yet interesting story with uniqe responsive narration.\n- Vast amount of weapons, special skills and other modifications.\n- High replayability with NG+ and Score Attack.\n\nCons:\n- To some, controls may feel a little unresponsive (I base on some friends opinions)","December 21, 2013","true","29.0"," 168 of 183 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","168","183","0","0"

It's all over social media and touted as the biggest event of the year.  You plan on going because all your friends and colleagues intend to, but days pass and you forget to RSVP. Your calendar stops functioning and you lose sight of all your big appointments. You press on regardless, making sure everything's ready prior to the big day as you frantically search for your invitation. Time goes by and you get distracted, forgetting about your plans and your schedule. You finally locate your invitation and head to the venue, only to find a fish and chip shop where a reception should be, and that the big event was held three years ago.\n\nThat's how late I am to this party.\n\nReleased in 2011, Bastion is a game that belies its indie origins, combining great gameplay with colourful art and an amazing soundtrack composed by Darren Korb, making for a complete package that puts some bug-ridden AAA games to shame. The haunting song that plays during the closing credits, Setting Sail, Coming Home, will likely remain in your head for days, along with the urge to keep playing.\n\nBastion is a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough. If, like me, the game has been languishing in your "to-play" list for a while, waste no more time. Play it now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/107100/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Rarely does artistic excellence and mechanical brilliance come together in as amazing an experience as Supergiant's Bastion. Its vision is remarkably strong and merciless in its attempts to astound your expectations, never content to settle for anything less than wholly inspired. It stands apart as a shiny example of independent ingenuity, a bar to which others should aspire to hit, but more than that it manages to feel as fresh and fully developed as anything coming out of much larger studios. It's the sort of experience that sticks with you after you finish it, hollowing out a place in your mind where the most excellent games of our time take up residence, sure to be talked about for years to come.\n\nA proper story's supposed to start at the beginning, but Bastion's not that simple. It spins its narrative in a nonlinear spiral, urged on by the smooth voice of the narrator, who describes your character's every action with a cool and calculated tone that gives the impression he knows more than he's letting on and has seen this all before. More than just a original storytelling device, it gives Bastion a personality all its own from the second the game begins. It keeps you engrossed despite an almost complete lack of character dialog, falling back largely to third person descriptions that on their own may seem meaningless, but when weaved in perfect context to the action on screen create something of a living story; one which feels as much a product of your own actions as the author's. The plot is never neglected however, as slowly but surely it all winds back together, taking control over the fascinating amounts of lore you are told throughout your journey and turning them into a full featured narrative that never falters or shows any sign of hesitation. Its deliberate planning can be traced back to the very first line uttered in the game, and when you finally see it all fleshed out, it's rather incredible that it works anywhere near as well as it does.\n\nBastion operates under a clear design to offer the player as much freedom as possible to choose their own playstyle. Almost entirely focused on hack'n'slash combat, it presents new weapons and means to dispose of your enemies on a near constant basis. Mixing and matching these weapons and abilities is what allows you to tailor the game to your own playstyle, from melee and ranged weapons, to a near endless variety of passive upgrades and power ups. Whatever you choose you're never locked into any one upgrade path, which lets you freely experiment to find what works best for you. The combat itself is extremely simple, but meticulously balanced and refined to feel satisfying and as challenging as you want to make it. It excels at creating a constant feeling of progression, even past the point of finishing the game as you can then playthrough it again in new game plus mode to catch any upgrades you missed, or take on even bigger challenges.\n\nThis almost doesn't matter though, in the face of Bastion's astonishing presentation. The flow of tiles building the path in front of you venture through the world, the gorgeous art design that overflows with vibrancy and creativity, and the unbelievable soundtrack that blends an astonishing amount of styles into a sound that's unlike anything I've ever heard. It's truly an artistic feat that puts the bland and predicable visual and sound designs of other games to shame, and should serve as a reminder to developers that conforming to a common mold is detrimental not only to your games identity, but the industry as a whole. I can scarcely recall playing a game with as much aesthetic originality and finesse as Bastion, and it's a triumph to its creators that they were able to create something that is as impressive to look and listen to as it is to play.\n\nEven before I played it, Bastion always stood as something of a posterchild to me for indie games. Its relentless ambition and startling success at achieving it are a showcase of how much can be accomplished by a small team with a clear set of ideas for the game they want to make. It's stunning and memorable in the way few games could ever hope for, and is as mechanically solid as it is breathtakingly presented. It succeeds in every aspect, and is one of the most well rounded games I have likely ever played.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 29, 2014","true","9.4"," 122 of 128 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","122","128","0","17"

It really didn't feel bland at all. The game's simple, but very fun to play. Its good to get into if you don't want to learn a complex system or devote a bunch of time into going through an RPG. Its not a long game, but that doesn't make it lesser. There's some replayability to it with different modes too.\n\nBastion's strongest point is the story. Oh my God its so good! A bit depressing, but so strong. It had a great impact on me and is easily a game that will never be forgotten.\nI won't speak much on it. You have to play through it for yourself.\nAlso, the story is narrated. Its pretty neat and really sets the mood of the game. I couldn't imagine playing the game without the narration!\n\nThe art is gooorgeous. It has a very artsy look and is quite colourful. Its pleasing to look at. I liked it a lot.\n\nThe music is also excellent. Has an OST worth playing outside of the game. The style of music was pretty unique. Some really great tracks and its something I still listen to here and there.\n\nThere's a few different ways to play the game when it comes to controls. It all runs very well. No issues.\n\nBastion is just a total masterpiece. If you haven't played it you need to. Its one of those must-play indie titles that people will still be talking about years from now.

I'm not really into these action, kiddy looking, RPGs. I kind of just picked it at random from where it had been collecting dust in my library, but it won my heart. The voice acting is amazing and clever. Arguably, there is a deep philosophical lesson to this game. I won't give it away though. The music? Wow. I have never wanted to buy a game soundtrack, but I do now! At some point in the game, you get a radio, with which you can put whatever song you like on from the soundtrack.\n\nThe game has different endings. You beat the game once, and have the option to play the game again with all of your weapons, upgrades, and level intact. This is helpful to get a different ending and/or for achievements.\n\nThere is also a attack score mode, where you restart from the beginning, without your upgrades and from level one. In this mode, you can accumulate points and compete on the leaderboards.\n\nThere are some really tough achievements, but once you get them you have this huge feeling of accomplishment. They really test your skills as a player.\n\nBuy this game. If you are on the fence, put it on your wishlist, and buy it when it goes on sale. I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed.","January 3, 2015","true","53.3"," 117 of 128 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","117","128","4","10"

Rest assured though, with it’s stylish isometric graphics and stunning presentation, Supergiant Games has created something that not only brings a certain amount of legitimacy to indie titles, but in my honest opinion pushes the established medium of video games forward as whole. I would argue that Bastion is one of the biggest arguments for games as an art form to date.\n\nBut how does one review or explain art? Everyone has their own interpretation. It is pretty easy to notice Bastion’s graphics, any screenshot is a testament to how gorgeous the game looks. But Bastion is not just a pretty picture; this is one game where you can not ignore the audio. There is a reactive narrator the explains everything as if he is watching you play. Fall off a cliff and he tells you to watch your step, get a new weapon and he is sure to have a little quip about it. Both the narrator and the game’s haunting music added greatly to the atmosphere and storytelling.\n\nNot content to rest on style alone, Bastion is also a solid action RPG. You assume the role of The Kid, who is never named. You awake to empty space, an existence that has been destroyed by an event known as the Calamity. As you take your first steps into this brave new world, life springs up under your feet and upon arriving to a safe haven dubbed the Bastion, you learn that it is your destiny to rebuild. Cores brought from the Wilds beyond the safety of the walls allow you to construct buildings: a forge for upgrading weapons, a shrine for paying patronage to the gods, or even a distillery for mixing your own drinks.\n\nWithout giving too much away, the Kid comes to find out what caused the Calamity; the story is not entirely complex but rather poetic and touching. There are multiple different endings and a score attack mode to keep you playing long after the credits roll. And since the new game plus allows you to keep levels and weapons, I found it worth it to play through a few times in order to see everything. In short, I would say Bastion is pretty much perfection.","October 18, 2013","true","28.4"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","62","68","0","0"

A lovely RPG that reminded me of the good old Terranigma. Only cons I could find out, which is also something I loved is the narration. Don't misunderstand; it's gorgeous, and the way it's describing your moves with a bit of irony is very enjoyable. The problem is for non-native english speaker, like me, who might have troubles to concentrate on the subtitles while playing. That's the only negative point I could find while playing. Otherwise, don't hesitate! This game is a gem.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nVisuellement sans fautes, poétique, philosophique et surprenant sur de nombreux points: les musiques, les chansons (à la fois douces amères et nostalgiques, et qui vous hanteront pour longtemps...), l'histoire,... Voilà un sympathique petit RPG qui m'a à plusieurs reprises rappelé le bon vieux Terranigma. Seul défaut que j'ai pu lui trouver, qui m'a pourtant charmée, est la narration. Ne vous méprenez pas; cette narration est géniale, et la façon dont chacunes de vos actions est décrite avec une touche d'ironie est très appréciable. Le problème est qu'étant en vost, les joueurs dont l'anglais n'est pas la langue maternelle, même malgré un bon niveau, auront certainement du mal à se concentrer sur les sous-titres tout en jouant. Voilà donc le seul défaut que j'ai pu relever en jouant. Cela mis de côté, n'hésitez pas un instant!

I will try to keep it short.\nAnyways,\nBastion is a wonderful game. In the first few minutes, it pulls you in like quicksand with its watercolored art and "what the hell happened here" curiosity and its hard to quit playing after that. I guarantee that you will only quit playing either a) Your eyes start hurting real bad, b) You need to get out of that chair and do something.(^Its mostly gonna be 'a'^).\n\nLets break it Down:\n\n++Fantastic Storytelling: Logan Cunningham does a fantastic job in narrating and guiding the player through the world of Bastion and at the same time, keep it alive. The Dyanmic commentry presented here is something i wish all games had. It just makes the game feel more Alive. It has lore, but only essential to the game.Yes he's also in Transistor. +++\n\n++The GAMEPLAY : OH YEAH, Fluid combat system and varied enemies keeps things interesting throughout the whole game. The melee and ranged weapons are well balanced and its upto to the player to figure out the what weapon loadout(2 melee or 2 ranged or melee-ranged) to take that bests suits one's playstyle. This i liked very much. Made me spend time experimenting with the different weapons, secret skills, passive boosts(spirits) and finding that right loadout for me. I also loved that we'd fall off the edges,keeps you more aware and cautious rather than just running around crazy. The level loading was also something eye-catching as it loads as you move or progress in-game,land just literally falling from the sky.++\n\n++The Amazing Art : The game was quite colorful with the watercolor backdrops and vistas, NPC designs were nice,and art was overall very appealing for 2.5D game.If you notice closely, you can see the different animation details for a lot of combat moves.++\n\n++The Sound: The sound sometimes really set the mood for whats happening in-game. Its amazing, maybe you wont feel its amazing just by listening to the tracks alone, but when in-game, they really bloom emotions. Yes, same sound team in Transistor..++\n\nOverall: 10/10. Coz its one of those few games that made be Start NG+ difficulty. If you have it in your library and have'nt played it yet, I recommend YOU GO PLAY IT.\n\nOne of the more powerful games emotionally for me. Its not "Just" another Indie Game.\nA brilliant marriage of story and mechanics.\nWaaay more Depth than Transistor.\n\nSpoiler Alert:\nThe whole sequence of carrying Zulf just tugged on my heartstrings.","May 8","true","15.0"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","38","40","3","0"

He writes a review for Bastion, one of many. Maybe someone that survived can read it. Someone sharper than a brusher's pike.... Or maybe someone as curious as a squirt.\n\n\nBastion is an amazing singleplayer experience that provides an exceptional story and impressive artistic design, with simple, but effective combat mechanics, amplified by it's interesting soundtrack. It was released in 2012.\n\nBastion is recieved high praise for it's story, which is told through a narrator. This form of storytelling was a new form of interactive media. In Bastion, a man narrates the actions of the protagonist, while also engaging the players in the lore of the world. This dialogue is vast, and there is a lot of narration throughout the game, which reveals the world to the players in an interesting and unique way. The interactivity can be seen when players simply play the game, which makes the game stand out. For example, if you flawlessly continue through a level, or if you defeat an enemy with a new weapon you found, or if you fell off a new level, you would get a unique piece of dialogue, adding to the theme of the game. There are hundreds of these conditional dialogue pieces, and even players that make mistakes can hear some unique dialogue as well, intensifying the bond between gameplay and narrative. Through this kind of narrative, players can learn about the world just by playing the game. Another example is the shrine. When you activate a god's shrine, it gives a short, but enticing, bit of dialogue that reveals a little bit more of the god to you. There's even a lot of text to go through, and lots of interesting descriptions to read about items that you find or use, and you are guaranteed to hear many different things by the time the game is complete. Another example of this narrative interactivity is even seen when picking weapons, as the narrator will make comments about the choice of weapons you have. Like if you pick a mortar and pike, or a mortar and carbine. Even the soundtrack is part of the story, as some music within the game actually is relevent to the game. On top of that, the soundtrack is quite good. The player also gets a little bit of choice through the story, as they can choose any weapon they have unlocked, activate any god to increase the difficulty, and there is an interesting moment where the player decides something. It's a post-apocalyptic world that feels like an adventure, yet there are moments where the player may learn about the sadder things in the world, as the game firmly grasps emotion, something that many games fail to do.\n\nBastion isn't a complex game. It has relatively simple controls, however, this doesn't mean the game is boring, by any stretch, as there are a good selection of different weapons, and players get the option to make the game more difficult. Players can also use 'drinks', which are passive effects that the player can choose to make them even stronger. Weapons are handed to the player as the game progresses, widening the level of choice players get as they move towards the end of the game, and players can also select upgrades for their weapons, and can choose which upgrades they want. For example, a player may opt for damage, or they may opt for more range. The combat itself is relatively enjoyable. Players can roll, use a shield to block and counterattack, use range or melee attacks, and pick from a variety of special abilities, and, as mentioned before, the game's difficulty can be increased for more fun, possibly making the game faster paced. The game is very easy to get into, which makes it a great choice for casual players, or people who don't have much time to begin with, as they won't have to deal with an unforgiving learning curve.\n\nBastion also has a very unique artistic style. It's a 2.5D game with great looking style throughout the entire game. There isn't a moment in the game that feels like it doesn't carry the theme of the rest of the game, and visually, it's easy to see that as players stroll through the menus, look at the loading screen, and explore the levels. Instead of the standard 3D world that you just walk around, Bastion's world is floating. Though there isn't really any platforming, it's a unique way to define current nature of the world, as it does become part of the game and the story. The top notch artwork complements the graphical style of the game, and at the same time, the game is not at all intensive to run. There aren't any super hardcore textures, and there aren't any hardcore lighting effects, as the game's graphic style makes it for it by being unique. This means that even 'non-gaming' PCs ( or Macs ) and Linux based systems can run this easily.\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I believe Bastion to be a very solid title. It's not a triple A title, it's actually an indie game, and yet it's still recognized internationally to be a great title, despite being as small as it is. It's the kind of game that you have to try, even if you don't think you'll like it, and for good reason. Bastion is a great experience, and though you won't be getting hundreds of hours out of this title, every hour will be worth it, and worth a little bit more.","May 5","true","19.7"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","34","36","7","6"

My goal was to see the main story through because it interested me, even if the twists and turns weren't all that surprising, it was compelling.\nMuch has been said of the soundtrack but I'm still going to talk about how gorgeous Ashley Barret's vocals are, and how perfect Darren Kolb's guitar work and compositions were.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SprySpy/recommended/107100/","SprySpy","SprySpire Obsidian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SprySpy/","1074 products in account","Intro:\nBastion is an isometric action-adventure game with an absolutely incredible visual style, fun and engaging combat, an engrossing narrative told by survivors of worlds that collided.  One of the core elements of Bastion is exploration and discovering the truth of the new world. You can uncover more through mementos, ash remains of old friends and folks long past, and the narration of a stranger.  The narration is remarkably well done and manages to convey so much without too much repetition.  They have tons of variations for even the small things like visiting a challenge area multiple times.\n\nGameplay:\nCombat is very customizable and can suit pretty much any combat style if you invest enough shards of the old world into your weapons.  Each weapon has different strengths and benefits, as well as varying timings to excel with; this makes the combat extremely reactive and very skill oriented.  The only complaint I have regarding combat is the order with which you unlock certain weapons.  I think it could have had the player decide at least a few times what weapon to make/unlock and help them find their preferred play style more quickly. I tried pretty much every weapon and upgraded them all at least once, but I definitely found a few that I preferred over others.\n\nI did have a little trouble distinguishing the actual level from the background at times due to perspective; some partially destroyed walls looked to be traversable and I would roll off into the oblivion as a result.\n\nStory:\nI won't go into much detail regarding the story as I think all players should experience it for themselves.  In my opinion, there are a few minor faults to the story, but they don't matter much and are just slightly inconsistent with the setting/world more than anything seriously problematic.  Thematically, Bastion's narrative has very clear and strong writing that the player can influence with how they approach the challenges set before them.  Some examples follow: If you choose to remove all the pests from an area, the narrator will remark on it; just keep running and ignore the enemies if you want, etc.\n\nAudio:\nWithout a doubt, Supergiant Games created one of the very best sound designs and soundtrack I've ever heard for any artistic medium.  It blends so many different styles and musical instruments that it just feels completely different and fresh when you discover a new track.  I spent quite a lot of time just enjoying the music when I unlocked the gramophone, which lets you listen to any of the game's soundtracks.\n\nValue & Time:\nI spent around 10 hours to do most of the content available in the first playthrough, while unlocking 11 of the 24 achievements.  My plans are to play through some of New Game Plus to see the new content that is only playable in that mode, but I don’t think I’ll play through the whole game again right now.\n\nOverall:\nBastion gets a Highly Recommended and is an extremely polished title that pretty much anyone will enjoy.  This is an incredible, memorable adventure that more people need to play through.","December 8, 2013","true","15.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","2"

I love how they made it look so gorgeous although the claim it's hand painted. The world is beautifully painted, the characters designs are cute and aptly made for the game, the animations are incredible. You owe your eyes to look at this game.\n\nBastion is a story driven game with great art and legendary Narrator. Yes I said it - legendary. I really like how the Narrator performs, he actually narrates most if not all Kid's (our protagonist whom we control) actions. His deep voice brings a new gaming element for real. The story itself is one kind of common topic - to restore the 'world' that's been destroyed by the Calamity. The combinations between the narrator, game's art, narrator and OSTs, though, make it feel different.\n\nThe OSTs themselves are ear-catching. Most platformer games I play I usually don't care about the OSTs, some even were so irritating I turned them off. In Bastion? I love every second the OST is played.\n\nGameplay is a mix between RPG and platformer. You can actually assign weapons/shields/power ups, have potions and the pure hack and slash aspect. You can't hack and slash your way, though, since it requires more than that. Evasion and blocking skills are also essentials, some enemies you can't just pew pew.\n\nThat said, playing with controller is recommended.\n\nFor people who love challenge, Bastion has plentiful for you. Starting from Hard difficulty, to New Game+, to Idols. Idols is a feature in game that actually tamper the situations of your choosing. If you want more exp but harder enemies, there's one feature for you.\n\nOverall, the game's a bit short. Only 10 hours or so for normal to hard difficulty. For completionist it will take more hours. I'd love to get Bastion 2 to compensate this, but Bastion simply is a game that should end just there. You'll understand when you finish the game.\n\nFor 80% off, this is a steal.

Not to you but your foes.\n\nWhat's good in Bastion :\nA beautifully hand-drawn world with a lot of oppurtunities.\nFluid, chaotic combat giving way to a plethora of action and fun.\nA great mix of soundtrack which is both tranquilizing and pacifying.\nAn excellent narrative by Logan Cunningham which acts as a superb gimmick to connect you to the very small bits    of the game.\nPukka stages of varied context often delivers the unexpected.\nA handful of weapons with a great deal of customization.\nWhat's not so good in Bastion :\nAn average 6.5 hours of experience which leaves you wanting more.\nDispensable leaderboards.\nA could've been better story.\nDefeating a challenging foe in a hack and slash game is merely a quotidian thing, you kill it and forget about it but in Bastion each such fight is given soul and life by the excellent narration. And by the time it's dead, you know more about it than your own friends. That is Bastion.\n\nBut then? All he got was more thankless work, from a man who ain't even asked his name. Sure, I may be the one who dreamt up the walls and the Bastion, but the Kid made 'em real, not me. I'd like to say I'll never forget him, or what he's doin'. What he's done. I surely would.\n\nGiving you a beautiful world to explore, Bastion disregards the possibility of delivering a longer and a more polished story. On the other hand, the narration is excellent, the music great, the hack'n'slash combat really fun. A ravishing world brought to life by exceptional handpainted designs. Bastion is authentic and phenomenal.\n\nMy Rating - "Gorgeous"\nTraditional Rating - 8 on 10.","October 3, 2014","true","6.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

Its your job to put the world together. To do this you have to explore and gather pieces named Cores. Along the way you will find new characters, weapons, scenarios and a lot more.\nThe world of Bastion is amazing. It looks like an alive oil painting with fluid movements in it.\n\nIf you are like me and care about the soundtrack of a game, prepare to be amazed. The sound track of this game is quality in person and very well paced. You have your "sad songs" and "happy songs" in the right time, at the right place.\n\nAnother amazing aspect is the narration. It follows your actions along your journey, if you for example fall down a hole you can be sure that the narrator will tell a little joke about it. The use of a gun, an item, the path you take, all have a narration. The voice acting is suberb and the tone of the voice beautiful. All of this makes your experience and imersion even better.\n\nBastion is one of those games that shouts: hey you don't need fancy graphics, complex storylines or explosive soundtracks to create an engaging and fun game.

This one had been on my radar for a while, and I was lucky enough to grab it at a discount. I have to say, though, that after playing it, it's worth every penny at full price.\n\nThere's truly something for everyone here. It's got RPG elements, beautiful world design, post-apocalyptic storyline, hack and slash "everything dies" free-for-alls, weapon mechanics, challenging achievements, and an intriguing story with heavy moral choices along the way.\n\nThe full controller support couldn't function any perfectly, and the graphics are astounding. The soundtrack is also excellent and seems to enhance the experience even more. Characters are multi-dimensional, and combat is dynamic. There's definite replayability here, as well as many challanging yet fun achievements.\n\nThe Stranger is beyond a doubt my favorite character, and it seems that a lot of thought went into character development and world-building. It's a fantastical combination of old West and ethereal  fantasy realm.\n\nThis looks like a game that was designed by gamers who just happen to know how to create video games. It's got so many wonderful elements strung together that it's very likely that the developers sat down to design and code a game that they themselves would enjoy playing. I have to say, they hit the ball way out of the park with Bastion.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I'll just add that a cerebral gamer will find other hidden gems in the storyline. I found myself speculating about time paradoxes, time travel, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the identity of The Stranger. I'm so fascinated with this game that I'm beginning my second playthrough now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/recommended/107100/","HSquirrel","HalfSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HSquirrel/","66 products in account","Bastion is a very unique game. The story line is extremely captivating, and it's easily one of the aspects I love most in this game.  The biggest thing that kept me playing this game was wanting to find out what happened next (I'm a huge story fan - A game with a good story is a game that I finished with love). The gameplay in this game is also something I haven't experienced before. The combat is very interesting, and there are a lot of small details in this game that I took for granted when I started playing this game (the automatic targeting system helps a lot more than I thought :p).\n\nThe Bastion area in the game is also new to me. Various buildings, all with unique purposes that all work together to make the gameplay more fun and interesting, and are all beneficial in their own special way. My favourite one easily being the Distillery, because I like being able to customize the bonuses I get for each level at any time, and always being able to unlock more and become even more powerful.\n\nI really enjoyed being able to upgrade my weapons, and then choose from a pair of upgrades that you can go with. Differently from most games, you don't have to pick your way through an entire skill tree to get to cool abilities, and you also have the option of easily changing what you picked at any time. Though the normal skill tree is fun, and can easily change how you play a game, I always found it difficult to decide which tree to go with and worried about picking the one that I wouldn't like. What if I don't like freezing enemies, and I would rather burn them? What I like about this game is that you can easily switch between the weapon upgrade that you want to use. It may not affect gameplay as much, but I still found this to be more enjoyable.\n\nSomething I think this game lacks is replayability. When I first completed the game, I figured I would start again and continue trying to improve my character. I did it for a little while, and restarted the story, but it just didn't have the same effect. It wasn't quite the same after the first playthrough. It didn't have anything new, even in the new gametypes you unlock that allow you to continue with all your old gear. Another issue is that at that point, the game is pretty easy. You have all the best weapons, all with really good bonuses, and the difficulty is barely increased. It's possible that it gets more difficult farther in, because I didn't get far before I stopped the replay of the game.\n\n*WARNING* WEAPON SPOILERS IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH\nAnother aspect I don't like about this game is that certain weapons are far better than others. I always found the fang repeater and the duel wielded guns (that I don't remember the name of) to be completely useless, having never used them outside of the practice zone for those weapons. For long range weapons, I used the bow until I got the Galleon cannon thing (that I also don't remember the proper name of) and then I used the calamity cannon once I got that. I never really had the need for anything else.\n\nI also never used the skill associated with Q. It could be just me, but I was never particularly aware of it's existence and the only time I really used it was the occasional fight where that's what you were supposed to do. There's no particular emphasis to remind you to use it other than the constant finding of new abilities (which also never gives you the chance to use the old ones if you're like me), and there is no need to use it as I got through the game without too much trouble not using the Q skill.\n\nI think the usage of Shrine Idols rather than an actual automatic difficulty increase is interesting, but I also never wanted to do it. I prefer a simple switch from Normal to Hard, rather than having to activate shrine idols and worry about which ones seem harder than others. This is probably just a personal thing, but the Shrine is always a building I avoided.\n\nOverall, I don't think the game is worth $15. I wouldn't want to pay more than $7 for a game that I'm going to play less than 10 hours of, but when this game goes on sale (it seems to have some pretty big sales when it goes on sale too), I hope it gets into your Steam Library because you won't regret playing through this epic adventure.","July 4, 2014","true","8.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/recommended/107100/","JiveSoulBro","Jive Soul Bro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JiveSoulBro/","85 products in account","I hope that many years from now Bastion is remembered as the quintessential retro game of the downloadable era. Too many game developers have settled to plagiarizing outdated game mechanics, putting the end product through a pixelated filter and justify a frustrating experience by calling it "Nintendo hard" to gain that somehow glorified honor of being called "retro". Well I'm old enough to have lived throughout that period and wise enough not to glorify it through rose-tinted glasses. I also remember the sense of discovery that came from trying out new weapons and destroying everything, so I'm glad to say Supergiant Games has well understood that concept while making Bastion!\n\nThe setting behind the story could best be described as "Frontier Fantasy" with your analogs to pioneers, marshals, mines full of mystic crystal cores and dispossessed natives undercutting your mission to rebuild the Bastion, aka humanity's last refuge. You'll read a lot about this game's very own narrator whose grizzled voice is there to give your actions a certain gravitas. It works, but having him be the sole source of exposition makes it near impossible to connect with anything else! You barely interact with anyone and if you do talk to other characters, the narrator tells you what they say! A whole universe experienced through the pinhole of one old man's words, that's what Bastion is!\n\nThe world itself could best be described as an isometric sky platform badly in need of handrails. Forget pixels, this is all hand-drawn art with individual sprites and the result is a full and vibrant environment with a diverse menagerie of monsters, each with their own characteristics, some even with their own backstory! In an age of heavily processed animations, still having hand drawn graphics is the most retro thing there is!\n\nThe actual fun in the gameplay comes from trying to find the right combination of two weapons with which to face the dangers ahead. You build quite the arsenal throughout your journey and each weapon has its own skill tree in which thankfully, you can change your decisions if you're unhappy or just feeling experimental. This is important because you'll soon come across a variety of binary needs, most of which aren't readily evident. I mean, you can understand quick & short-ranged vs slow & long-ranged but soon comes factors such as spread damage, weapon stun, poison vs direct damage, the issue of armor penetration and so forth. Needless to say, every weapon is unique and it's the combination thereof that makes the gameplay so engaging.\n\nMuch appreciated are the training camps for each and every weapon along with the dream sequences which just has the Kid fight wave after wave of enemies. They're supplemental, optional and a great way to acclimate yourself with the new toy you just discovered in that one stage. I also liked the timed shield reflect mechanic which might be overpowered since it also reverses melee attacks. You also have access to about thirty Secret Skills, super moves for all of your weapons; however since they are all activated by collectable Black Tonics these all turn into so many different ways to press an emergency "SAVE ME" button.\n\nThere's A LOT of exposition dump concentrated early on but I'd say that the game really picks up after finding your third or fourth Bastion shard and opening the Forge which allows you to start customizing weapons. There's a self-awareness in that the game realizes all that it wants to accomplish but still attempts to be as accessible as possible; heck, even the difficulty system works on an individual monster upgrade system, though one that is non-essential towards the story.

It's in the style of an isometric hack-and-slash, but really feels much different than many other games in the genre.  The whole atmosphere of the game remains light yet immersive simultaneously, making for a truly enjoyable experience.\n\nSomething about the combination of the art style, the gameplay, and the narration make this game more charming than a Disney prince.  The gameplay is simple yet engaging and the whole atmosphere of the game just keeps a steady flow of euphoria pumping into your consciousness.\n\nIt's not very long, but there is a NewGame+ mode and also an arcade style mode where you get a running score throughout your playthrough.  The basic main game is pretty easy to beat, which is the proper way to design games in my opinion.  If you are looking for more of a challenge you can turn on extra enemy abilities with the innovative and intricate difficulty system, or you can try to beat the challenge missions (dream worlds) as those can be very hard with all the enemy buffs turned on.\n\nAll-in-all this is a great gaming experience, and a modern classic.  Highly recommended.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 18, 2013","true","12.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Basically, I feel confident in saying you will either love this game to bits and find yourself writing essays about how brilliant and deep and awesome this game really is, or find it one of the most obscenely, dangerously overrated, yet pretty good-looking and fine-sounding, piece of pretentious indie [you know that word] you'll ever play.\n\nLuckily for you, Oh Revered Prospective Buyer, you don't need to rely on the confusing cacophony of opinions of other people to figure out which camp you'll find yourself in in. Like, don't like, and wait... why? For, you see, O Might One, this game is endowed with the Mystical Power of The Demo.\n\nDemos are strange beasts and too often misleading ones as well, willfully tricking the Player. But this will not be the case for Bastion: you will either think this game has the most boring minute-to-minute gameplay experience of the isometric action RPGs you ever had the terrible misfortune to play, or that it'll be to you about as good an invention as The Revered Sliced Bread, maybe even a slice better.\n\nIt doesn't matter which button I'm going to press when I am done writing, because obviously the majority thinks I'm the minority and thus this one single vote is simply a drop in the ocean and won't matter one single bit. That is fine and dandy as it gives me a chance to be completely honest without incurring in any unwarranted backlash, isn't that true Almighty Community?\n\nYou won't downvote this <cough>review, because while I almost dread every single hour I spent on it (, I'm still encouraging people to be open minded instead of trusting my judgment blindly, as it were The Word, and try the demo for themselves.

The art is beautiful and the storyline is just enough for an indie game to bring you back.  For the game itself, I give it a 9/10 - I fell in love with it and, although it's short, it is an experience not often found in games these days.\n\nGameplayAs far as gameplay, major events do not seem to require sound.  Almost everything happens on screen and has a screen shaking effect for important events, whether on or off screen.\n\nFor gameplay accessibility, I give it 10/10 - the game can be played to completion without or with limited sound.\n\nSubtitles/TextBastion is fully captioned, but can be confusing about who is talking at first.  There is a narrator that speaks during the gameplay.  It's not essential information for the game, but it does add to the story.\n\nFor subtitles, I give it 8/10.  It was hard to figure out who was talking at first until I saw the character/narrator much later.\n\nChatting/CommunicatingBastion is single player only.  No rating.\n\nOverall AccessibilityThe game's visual signals for events and full captions make it fully accessible for deaf/hoh gamers.  Hearing players frequently comment on the amazing soundtrack associated with the game that plays during gameplay and ties in with the story.  If you're hoh, you may still be able to enjoy some of the tracks.  Otherwise, no vital information is solely passed through sound.\n\nOverall, 9/10 for this amazing indie action/RPG game.","May 28, 2014","true","38.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stakmaster/recommended/107100/","Stakmaster","StakAttak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stakmaster/","513 products in account","No doubt Bastion has its share of flaws, but in the end the good far outweighs the bad and it's definitely deserving of a playthrough by just about everyone. The gameplay, the art direction, the music and sound are all excellent, but there are just a few nagging bits that dragged it down for me personally. It's best to start out with the art and the narration, as those are Bastion's immediate appeals.\n\nThe art, as you know if you've seen any video or screenshots, is amazing. The hand drawn backgrounds appear before you as you traverse the level including plenty of destructible objects that can be bashed in for fragments of the old world, the currency in the game. The overall motif of the game is a sort of exotic, alien western populated by no shortage of bizarre creatures native to Caelondia such as Anklegators, Squirts, Rattletails, Lunkheads and more, but each level introduces new environments that always keep the game feeling fresh and making the player feel like they are progressing through this world. At some points it was difficult to tell what was destructible and what wasn't, and I ended up falling off the map a few times because I wasn't able to tell where the physical ground stopped and the background art began, but it's hardly worth mentioning. You gain a sixth sense for that sort of thing as the game goes on and it happens less and less. Another big appeal for this game was the "interactive" narration, and while it is charming every time you see it happen, it's utilized far less than I was expecting. It's funny to hear him say "The Kid just rages for a bit" when you begin smashing objects left and right, or "It's easy to lose your way in the Wilds" when you retread old ground in a level, but I can count on one hand the number of times I noticed a direct relation to what was being narrated and what I was doing, which is a real shame. I went into the game thinking this was going to be a major part of the game, but it happens less and less as you go on. Perhaps it's because the developers didn't want the tongue-in-cheek narrator stepping on the toes of the increasingly dark and serious storyline of the game, but either way I wish there was more of the narrator-player interaction.\n\nThe gameplay is traditional hack and slash with counters, special attacks, customizable perks in the way of liquors you can equip, and plenty of upgradeable weapons to choose from (perhaps too many upgradeable weapons, I'll touch on that in a bit). The game has a varied collection of enemies for you to fight, each with their own strategies, strengths and weaknesses. Anklegators (Essentially a land narwhal that pursues the player underground until it's ready to strike) need to be lured out into the open before being attacked, but what happens when the game pits one of these at you in addition to a Lunkhead (Leaping armored frogs that must be attacked from behind) and a few Pincushions (immobile plants that shoot thorns at the player in a continuous stream) all at the same time? The player must use their loadout that they've customized, their evasive and defensive manuevers, and decide how they're going to complete the encounter, which almost always proves to be tricky and fun. Back at the Bastion, the level hub and also the main plot device of the game, players can use their Cores they've gained in the levels to populate the area with helpful structures, and Shards let the player upgrade those structures even further. The distillery let's players customize which liquors they want to equip which grant bonuses such as more health or a higher critical chance all the way to more loadout-specific benefits such as a higher counter-attack damage and doing more damage when falling on enemies. The Arsenal let's players customize which weapons and special attack they want to bring into battle, and the Forge let's them use upgrade materials they've found or purchased in the world to further enhance their effectiveness. One great thing about Bastion is that it doesn't limit what combination of weapons you can equip. Where most games would require you to have one melee and one ranged weapon, you can equip any combination in Bastion and it really makes you feel like you can take on the game however you want. The Lost and Found let's players use their fragments gained in the world to purchase upgrade materials, special attacks, and unique liquors that can't be found anywhere else, and the Memorial presents a number of goals that the player can attempt which will reward them with more fragments.\n\nThe Shrine is my by far my favorite structure in Bastion. It gives the players a number of optional difficulty modifiers (similar to skulls in Halo) which reward those brave enough to activate them with substantial experience boosts throughout the game. Activate more than one and the rewards can be quite steep, granting the player up to 75% more experience, but also making the game much more difficult and in some cases even bizarre and unpredictable. While I love the modifiers such as those that slow the player when getting hit or make enemies drop grenades when defeated which let you scale the difficulty of what some might call a rather easy game for veterans of the genre to something more challenging, some just seem tedious and poorly thought out. One modifier randomly deflects attacks, and another causes enemies to become immune to attacks for a time. These don't make the game harder or the fights even necessarily more interesting, they just become longer and more frustrating. All the modifiers are optional however, so I suppose this is more of a nitpick than a significant complaint. What IS a significant complaint, perhaps only for me personally, is the frequency of which you get new weapons. If I remember correctly, you get a new weapon almost EVERY SINGLE LEVEL, excluding optional weapon challenges you can choose to play on the map screen. Not only that, but most of these levels are designed around using that particular weapon, and only rarely do the developers give you an arsenal mid level to allow you to switch back to your previous weapon if you don't want to use the level-specific item. It begs the question, what is the point of upgrading your items, customizing your loadout with special attacks and liquors, and creating a battle plan if the game is going to force you to use a new weapon (which you haven't had time to upgrade) every level? I get what they were trying to do. They want you to mix up your strategies on the fly, adapt to everything they throw at you, but a new weapon every single level? I don't get a chance to appreciate any of these weapons if you stick a new one in my hands EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. Some players might like this aspect so this point is largely a personal complaint, but it certainly feels like the game is undermining itself by giving the player all these tools to customize their playstyle and then ripping a whole through them at the beginning of every new stage. I also have to mention that many of your special attacks are tied to your weapon, so if you pick up a new weapon that takes the place of the weapon tied to your special attack, woops, I guess you get no special attack that level.\n\nThankfully the music is amazing. It's a mix of instrumental western tunes, some arabian sounding themes, and even a few voiced songs by the characters' voiceactors. It's a good variety and a few even became stuck in my head. The story is somber and at times vague, but even though most won't remember Bastion for its story it does a good job of keeping the player's interest and making you eager to find out how it will all shake out.\n\nBastion has its flaws, but at the end of the day it's still a fun game. It's been in a million bundles and it goes on sale for only a few bucks, so there's really no excuse to not at least give it a shot, and if you're one of those who have it sitting in your library for a rainy day like I did, give it a try, it's worth it.","September 29, 2014","true","13.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

After all, the main game's length is 5-6 hours tops, so it definitely won't get you bored.\n\nThe graphics are great and really fit the game's world, which is full of colors and beautiful environments.\nThe way the ground shapes itself in front of you as you walk was a really nice addition too, totally innovative.\n\nThe gameplay is probably Bastion's strongest point, the variety is big in pretty much all of the game's elements: weapons, enemies, power upgrades, side quests and items.\n\nThe soundtrack is good and fits the world too, but it just didn't hook me enough.\n\nAside from the main campaign, there are also some extra missions, in which you can raise the difficulty and, in order to get some achievements, you have to play in the highest possible one. They are the classic floors/realms in which hordes of enemies attack you and you have to survive to the end, beating the odds...

However, I decided to give it a chance before judging it so harshly, and I'm glad I did.\n\nOkay, credit given where credit is due. The art style of bastion really did blow me away. The way that every level builds itself as you go through it as well as the general design and even the characters themselves really won me over. Not to mention the narrator truly making the game feel unique.\n\nWhere I expected it to fail, the gameplay, actually turned out not only to be fun and diverse, but extremely polished. Each of the 12 weapons behaves completely differently and you can mix up any two of your choice, combined with one of 30 secret skills, providing LOADS of ways to play.\n\nYou slowly upgrade the Bastion however you want after completing each level, unlocking more options. There are some challenges to do here and there but besides that, the game is fairly linear. An average playthrough to one of the 4 endings will last about 5 hours but more content is offered in the much appreciated New Game+ Mode w, allowing for a lot more replay value.\n\nI'm trying to think of something bad to say but I find it difficult. Technically there is only 5 hours of content, so for £11.50, that is a lot. Also, the game may not appeal to everyone, it took a lot of self-encouragement to actually force myself to play the game. It doesn't do a good job at drawing people in initially.\n\nBastion gets an 8 out of 10 from me on 60 Second Reviews.","January 20, 2014","true","8.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ben_superman/recommended/107100/","ben_superman","StAidan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ben_superman/","278 products in account","After buying Bastion during the 2011 winter sale and playing the few minutes necessary to get the achievement for the coal-crafting metagame, I filed it away in my mental “play later” category, but never got back to it until just recently. (After all, I wouldn’t have felt quite right adding Transistor to my backlog until Bastion was done.)\n\nHonestly, it took me a fair amount of time to warm up to Bastion. The voiced aspect of the narrative didn’t hook me right away as it did for many other players - in fact, I found it somewhat distracting and stylistically difficult to follow while beating away on the baddies. The combat, while serviceable, didn’t immediately motivate me to experiment with different weapons or special abilities. As a result, I pushed through the first half of the game primarily because I like to finish the games I start, and not because I was particularly impressed with it beyond the superficial stuff.\n\nIt wasn’t until all the cores were gathered up that I felt Bastion was finally starting to click with me. By that time I’d had a decent opportunity to upgrade a few different weapons, and the creature variety made me think a bit more about approaching each situation (although I certainly wouldn’t characterize any of the enemy encounters as difficult). In addition, I had put together enough of the backstory that the plot started to get interesting. Narration redeemed. After that point, I was much more motivated to play the game to completion.\n\nThe soundtrack and art were superb throughout, but I don’t think there’s a lot of disagreement on that, so no need to go into any great detail there. I can’t think of any area of the game that lacked in the visuals department, although I did find that forested area with the armored frogs to be incredibly annoying.\n\nRegarding optional stuff, I didn’t spend a lot of time with it. First, I’d like to go back and try some of the idol challenges. I enabled one of the idols once, but lost interest in them when I noticed that it deactivated itself when I was done with the level. I didn’t really want to revisit the shrine between each area to keep them turned on. Second, I’m thinking about going through New Game+ after a short break (a month or two).\n\nSo, short and sweet, I’d give Bastion a decent recommendation. It wasn’t among the most compelling experiences I’ve found in gaming, nor did it really live up to the level it was hyped at to me. Regardless, it’s a good game and short enough for anyone to give it a fair shake. And it was most certainly good enough to make me look forward to buying and playing Transistor at some point.\n","August 21, 2014","true","7.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quikblend/recommended/107100/","quikblend","quikblend","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quikblend/","545 products in account","Here is my review of Bastion:\n\nFirst waking up in Bastion you have no idea what is going on. What starts your adventure is that you do not remember anything about what happened to the world after the calamity hit.  Bastion follows the story of "The Kid" , who happens to survive all the events prior to the game. You first start of with just a trusty weapon and begin to slowly build your arsenal.\n\nGameplay / Sound- it almost works as a action RPG. The action includes shooting guns with cooldowns, dodging to avoid enemy attacks and special attacks. The RPG element works with upgrading guns and deciding what weapons to bring into combat during a certain mission. Some of the weapons become ridiculously strong, but with the increase in difficulty it shouldnt be too much of a problem. Unlocking the shrines and using them makes the game more fun and it also creates a bigger challenege in the game. Outside of those the game plays pretty much like an action game more than a RPG one. Playing on different level makes the game feel as though the worlds are all different yet are a part of a bigger story. Sadly you do not get to see even part of the world. The soundtrack to this game is one of the best I have heard in any video game. Once you hear it, you'll want to download it and keep on listening to it.\n\nStory- The story revolves around "The Kid" and his quest to collect shards to save the world after the Calamity. While the story is fleshed out over the course of the game, i cant help but feel that the world isnt as interesting as I thought it would be. What i mean by this is that there is a clear beginning, middle and end, yet not any more to it. I expected to find notes or more journal types of items to help flesh out the world. It exists already to some degree in the game, but i would have liked to know more. Other than that little nit pick, I found the story to be good, but not great.\n\nReplayability - While there is a proving grounds and some wave enemy combat, I see Bastion on Campagin as a one and done type of deal. There is content to keep you interested for the better part of about 15-20 hours though. If you getting everything and doing the extra missions you should finish within that timetable. The campaign for me took between 6-8 hours. Once you get the hang of the combat it runs though pretty quickly. As a game to pick up in the future again, I say it has limited replayability.\n\nControls - Controls are pretty straight forward and really easy to learn. I would recommend using a controller though because keybindings are on the backburner for this game.\n\nConclusion: If you are looking to buy Bastion, do it. It is a fantastic game and well worth purchase. The only negative takeaway is that the story background  isnt fully fleshed out and the replayability factor is pretty low.\n\nFinal Score: 9 out of 10\n\n","March 9, 2015","true","11.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

I have cleared it 4 times already, and I would do it again if I wasn't this god-damn lazy. It's going to sound like complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to most of you, but I do think, that this game is the one that got most close to perfection. And I ain't joking arround here. I usually talk about the BAD parts of a game first, in the reviews, but I just can't find anything bad about it.\n\nIt's not THAT long, but it's cheap, and has replayability, New Game+ and some extreme challenges. The enemies never feel cheap or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly programmed. The world is well-crafted. The soundtrack is as perfect as it's narrator, who is, at this point, the Morgan Freeman of video-f#cking-games. It also has a good amount of weapons, skills, combinations... What's bad about it!?\n\nThe only bad thing, is that the "plot-twist" can be a bit obvious. THAT'S IT. And that's the only thing that makes this game unworthy of getting a 10/10. But you know what? Who needs perfection, when you can get so near, it doesn't even matter.\n\nBastion starts with "Kid", a young buy who's drifting in a world of lego that's being undone day by day. Uppon leaving what used to be the walls of the city, he joins the narrator, Rucks, and some other people later on. The "Bastion" works as your hub, and you rebuild it, adding a place to hold and change your equipment, to hold your liquor (seriously, the Kid is like 12 years old, SHAME ON YOU, RUCKS), or even pray to the golds, to make the game unholy-f#cking-hard. There are also, like I said, a bunch of challenges, in either pictures that will unlock by doing special stuff like killing multiple enemies with an arrow, or in special arenas where you have to fight and fight to survive, from waves and waves of enemies, while the dream (or rather, the arena of the dream) falls apart, while you get to learn more lore about the game.\n\nThe soundtrack is just perfect. The songs with lyrics are just beautiful. The narrator makes a perfect job to narrate the game, not like in other games, where he just would spam selected audio files, but in here, he DOES narrate what you do.  You fall down a pit? He makes a comment about it? You forget about enemies, and start smashing down things on the map? He will also talk about it. He will even comment how nasty and over-powered your loadout is (try to carry the grenade-launcher with the Bazooka, the line cracks me up every god-damn time).\n\nThe gameplay is as solid, as the snake on my pants. I wasn't trying to reference Metal Gear, that crap just happens. You can equip two weapons, and a skill of either of them. You can also upgrade your weapons, and at times, you can choose what to upgrade. You want the rifle to load faster, or to pierce enemies? Your choice. But with the amout of weapons, you sure can go whoever you feel like, and enjoy the game.\n\nOh, and if you didn't know, after playing the game, and going New Game+, you can get the skill to summon Portal Turrets. Seriously. That just blows my mind how much they managed to make futuristic turrets that talk fit so well in the game. Those guys are a bunch of geniuses, and they deserve your money for making this piece of digital art. It also has multiple endings, and the key moments of the game can seriously reach deep into you. Well, not in me, I'm too much of a man, but it sure was close.\n\nI give this game a Super Saiyan Morgan Freeman / 10, now buy it before he fuses with Samuel L.

Getting it at full price is great but if waiting for a discount just know you will be missiong a story meaty game.\n\nWhat Is Bastion.\nIn its core? A simple 3D isometric game where you collect crystal to advance the story while hoarding alcohol and weapons. Sounds simple ja? Not really. A deep system has a narrator narrate everything to you based on your actions and performances even boss types i must say get their own dialog to differentiate from the common rabble plaguing the world.\n\nReview a go!\n\n1:Graphics\nA refreshing take on the indie game stuff, Bastion emplys colourful world that is reminds you of watercolour with everything has a distinct blob to it to help with the effect. Special attacks and enviromental damage are beautifully done. Not much else to say though.\n\nHere's a link to somewhat show what i mean. A gameplay video would be even better i suppose.\n[fish, steam deleted my link. oh well next time i suppose]\n\n2:Sound\nFrom the husky voice of the narrator to the frightheningly well done tempo music that ratchets up as you serve the beatdown on gunky slim Bastion apparently paid the sound guy quite a good of cash. Not getting in the way while providing their purpose there is nothing wrong with such an approach.\n\nThe famous narrator of this game tells the story as you go and play with repeating challenges, killing enemies and even repeating a failed challenge will produce a different response from him each time. The warm husky voice definitely helped pull you in into the game world where no one else speak save for the surprise the game saves for you.\n\nGo do yourself a favour and download the OST even if you do not wish to buy this game. Its art by itself.\n\n3:Gameplay.\nOh boy the meat!\n\nWhere shall i shall i start? Well Bastion utilize a 2 weapon system that is mapped to the left and right mouse button respectively and clicking it will trigger said weapon. Now what makes this fun is that you have a shield that can block anything provided you counter at the right time or otherwise receive reduced damage instead and you even have a slot for 1 special attack that at the beginning has 3 charges.\n\nSounds typical? Well here we go. Fights are often arena based with smaller enemies appearing before a bigger baddy appear for you to squash. In between the healing, the frantic sword fight and the 'OH DARN' moment when you realize you used all the special attack Bastion nailed the meaty delicious part of combat to the letter but it does help that the narrator keeps on narratin throughout the battle as you desperately struggles to block a giant sack of pus from squashing you as his gentle smoky voice guides you to death. Snarkiness is guaranteed.\n\nFor weapons themselves....... lets just say i wouldnt spoil things but theres everything for everyone. I myself prefer bow and machete. Yes even in Bastion i play as berserker.\n\n4:NEW GAME +\n5 years ago such a thing would be all too common, these days they have all but dissapeared into the gutter but what a pleasant surprise to see Bastion packing a new game + and boy do i like it. 2X Everything for everything that wants to kill you and 0.5 for yourself. enjoy cutesy Dark Souls. :3\n\nConclusion.\nGreat game, great story and great gameplay. Bastion narration held it strong all the way to the end where you shall get a satisfying ending as befit a gaming warrior such as yours truly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InkHearts/recommended/107100/","InkHearts","[Overwatch] Bastion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InkHearts/","279 products in account","This game is really well written, I'm usually not big on plots, in fact, most of the games I have don't even have a singleplayer story mode because of that reason. However, Bastion was different for me, since the moment I began playing the game, I felt really immersed. The narrator speaking as you play is probably my favorite part of the whole game, it really makes you feel like you're part of the game and I wish more games would do the same.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's rather good as well. There are quite a few number of weapons as well as skills throughout the game making it pretty simple to develop your own style of play. The game itself is rather easy in my opinion, it only gets a tad difficult if you invoke all of the idols (Items that add various effects to monsters that make the game more difficult, but giving you extra EXP to compensate). The only part that I had some real difficulty with was the Stranger's Dream with all idols invoked, and even that only took me two attempts. However, if you have difficulty with these sort of games, there's a No-Sweat mode which allows you to continue unlimited times no matter how many times you die. Though of course, some of the achievements can't be obtained via No-Sweat mode.\n\nI'm usually not big on music in games either, but the soundtrack is also another thing to love about this masterpiece. It costs $10 to buy the soundtrack here on Steam for download, which sounds a little pricey, but I personally thought it was well worth the price. The music in the game is just amazing, and I can't get enough of it, just like the rest of the game, it's extremely well done.\n\nIf you're big on achievements, like I am, the achievements in Bastion aren't too difficult, to 100% the game, all you really need is time. I estimate that it would take most people 16-18 or so hours to perfect this game, I took a little while longer since I spent a lot of time messing around in the game, it took me a little over 20 hours. Each playthrough takes roughly 6-8 hours, New Game+ should take a little less than that, though if you haven't done the dreams, those might add on a bit more time. Then you have to play Score Attack, but you only need a million points and that doesn't take the entire storyline if you do the dreams with idols invoked.\n\nThere's not much else to say about this game, it has beautiful art, music, gameplay, story, and it has decent replay value. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone and everyone. I think this game is more than worth it at normal price, but it goes on sale every now and then as well, so if you really want to, waiting for it to be on sale is a pretty good option too. (Currently 40% off as I'm writing this review.)","June 27, 2014","true","20.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I don't know what makes this game, so, awesome. After seeing the release of Transistor, I decided to review this wonderful game. I have no idea though. The narrator? Visuals? Soundtrack? Either way, I must say, I haven't played a masterpiece quite like this in such a long time. To me, it outclasses Braid, which, for some odd reason, is used to compare Bastion, but don't have much in common. Man, where to begin...\n\nI guess I'll start with the visuals. The art in this game is absolutely amazing. It was done extremely, extremely well. Everything was painted beautifully, and I can't help but love everything about it. It makes you feel like an adventurer. You're curious to explore and willing to take risks. You just can't help but stop, take in all of the scenery, and realize you spent an hour staring at the visuals. All of it is wonderful, and if you mix it with the soundtrack, oh man. Ohmanohmanohman!\n\nSoundtrack is next. It's kinda hard to admit, but after drooling over the Super Meat Boy and Faster Than Light soundtracks, these songs will make you drool out a waterfall. Before you know it, you'll have created the "Drool Ocean," which covers all of Earth. It's just that amazing. Just go on Bandcamp, iTunes, Youtube, whatever. I swear to GOD, you will start loving that soundtrack.\n\nNow for the best part of this game: The narration. One player, dunno if it was Steam, but I remember him saying this: "His voice is velvet silk on this wonderful game" or something along those lines. I'm a madman, I know. But this narrator makes me think of Morgan Freeman. I don't know why, but he does. To me, this guy might just be the Morgan Freeman of gaming, no joke. He's a god. He speaks with more emotion than most AAA characters, heroes, villains, etc etc COMBINED. If you never heard his voice. PLEASE. I'm BEGGING YOU. PLEASE look him up on Youtube.\n\nLast but not least, the gameplay and replayability. The gameplay is simple, hack and slash controls. It's simple, but a little bland, and I admit, this is probably the weakpoint of the game. The difficulty is very easy, and I have no difficulty fighting enemies, even with the shrines. The weakweakpoint of this game, yes, weakweakpoint, is the length. You can easily beat the game in a few hours. I'm about to finish my first playthrough already! It's that short. However, the game is pretty replayable, so that's a good thing. You have about 20 hours or so of fun for this game.\n\nGraphics- 10/10\nGameplay- 6/10\nStory- 7/10\nAudio- 10/10\nReplayability- 7/10\n\n**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**\n.:9.0/10:.\n+Wonderful narrator\n+Amazing visuals\n+GODLY soundtrack\n+Has some replayability\n+Lots of emotion\n+Interesting characters\n-Short\n-Dull gameplay","May 20, 2014","true","7.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xoxsubzeroxox/recommended/107100/","xoxsubzeroxox","Edgelord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xoxsubzeroxox/","760 products in account","I can say that this is one of the best games I have played in my entire life. It does so much right. The gameplay is a lot of fun, although simple. But the strongest points of the game lie in its artistic and emotional values.\n\nBastion just looks beautiful. The graphics are hand-painted, and the colours are really well done. It almost makes every screen of the game looks like a real painting, but a lot of things on screen can be destroyed or interacted with. Your character and the NPCs look a bit more 3D, with maybe a little bit of cell-shading on it too. It makes them stand out, but it still fits really well with the 2D painted background.\n\nThe music is also amazing. There are a couple of songs in the soundtrack that still make me a little emotional when I hear them, just because of how they were used in this game. One of the later moments in the game is one of the strongest moments I've ever experienced in a video game, and the song that was playing at that moment was an important part of that.\n\nThe story seems pretty simple when the game starts out. But as you progress, you will find out more about the world and its people before the Calamity, and what the Calamity is and what caused it. The Bastion is pretty much the only thing left that can save the world from the Calamity, and you need to travel to different areas in the world to recover cores, which power the Bastion. It's also narrated by a great voice actor, who occasionally foreshadows things that are about to happen, and interacts with you about saying something specific to what you're doing at that moment. The world in Bastion is built up with some simple themes and ideas, but at the same it feels so real and deep, if you pay enough attention to the story and understand everything about it.\n\nEven though it felt like the gameplay was one of the game's minor focuses, it was still solid and fun. There are plenty of weapons for you to use, and you always have a primary and secondary weapon with you, together with a secret ability. Each weapon has five upgrades, which you can apply if you have enough fragments (currency) and upgrade materials. Each character level-up brings along an extra slot in which you can equip a liquor that gives you a passive bonus. You can also invoke shrines to customize the game's challenge. Each God has their own shrine, and invoking it will make the game more challenging in a specific way. One would, for example, grant enemies health regeneration, while another one makes them drop a bomb when they die. Each invoked shrine increases the experience and fragments you earn by 5%.\n\nI've played through this game about four times now, and I still enjoyed every minute of it. After playing through it, you can move on to NG+, with all your equipment and character level from the previous playthrough, to unlock the alternate ending. After that you can try score attack mode, or play arenas through the form of dreams of the survivors you rescued and brought to the Bastion. The game is not that long, but it's such a wonderful experience.","January 9, 2014","true","17.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I had no idea what I was getting into, nor how amazing this game was going to be. In reality it turned out to be nothing short of a masterpiece. If you ever manage to have the opportunity to play this game, do so! You will be treated to a rare experience, not easily found in the gaming industry. Few games accomplish what Bastion has done.\n\nBastion is an action-RPG, the first of two games developed by Supergiant Games, their second and most recent being Transistor. While they are both amazing games, and both equally worthy of praise, this review is all about Bastion. If Bastion and Transistor are anything to go off of, then we can expect great things in the future from this developer!\n\nBastion puts you in the role of the Kid, as he fights to uncover the secrets of "the Calamity", an earthshattering catastrophe that leaves the world in pieces. Bastion redefines storytelling, with reactive narration and superb voiceover work - simply playing the game and listening to the narrator is a joy in and of itself. The game also features a critically-acclaimed soundtrack, which is available for purchase along with the game.\n\nThe controls are extremely easy to use and get used to. Bastion features the typical but tried-and-true method of using the WASD keys for movement commonly found in many game, along with point and click input for combat. The direction you move the cursor is the direction the Kid will attack when you click. Left clicking uses your main weapon, which is more often than not a melee weapon, such as a hammer or machete; while right clicking is generally a ranged weapon, such as a bow or gun. Holding down either mouse button for a brief period unleashes a charge attack, dealing more damage than usual. Spacebar causes the Kid to roll in the direction of your cursor, allowing you to dodge most attacks. Some enemies have the ability to knock you into the air, at which point you have the opportunity to perform an air recovery by hitting the Spacebar.\n\nThere are many varied, handpainted environments, each crawling with savage creatures hell-bent on putting an end to your arduous journey. At your disposal is an array of different weapons and abilities, which are all upgradeable as the player progresses through the game. Also available is an assortment of Spirits, which grant various passive bonuses, such as an increase in Max HP, or increased critical hit chance. The game also has a New Game Plus mode, where you can replay the story carrying over all the items from your previous playthrough.\n\nFrom an enthralling story told through superb narrative, to lush, detailed environments and deadly enemies, Bastion has everything you could want from an indie RPG. It's definitely worth adding to any game collection. It's the kind of game that will turn anyone into a gamer.\n\nA Must Play\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","June 9, 2014","true","24.4"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","16","27","0","0"

Usually I'm wary of such games, as it's difficult to live up to so many high expectations.

The story is quite good, but the variations in combat are really what shine with Bastion.  Multiple weapons and weapon pairings allow you to play this game as you choose, and also allow for different playthroughs each time you approach this game.  Add in one of the best video game soundtracks I've heard in a long time, and you have a complete package.

Certainly I was impressed by its drawing style and the touching voice by Logan Cunningham. But the game play, mostly smashing things all around, didn't interest me too much so I abandoned half way through the story line.\n\nA couple days ago when checking my library looking for something to play, I saw this game sitting in my library and I figured it wouldn't be a bad idea to continue from the save of last year's summer.\n\nAnd it was fun. Real fun. The game play is actually very interesting.\n\nYou can choose two weapons to equip from a total of 12 and a secret skill. Some secret skill are weapon-specific while the others are general. There are also upgrades to weapons once you get the required material and money, which is called fragment in the Bastion. Bethesda really should have taken a page from Supergiant for Skyrim's battle system.\n\nThis game is suitable for both casual and hardcore gamers. For casual gamers there is a No-Sweat mode that allows infinite continues in exchange for inability to earn some achievements. The main story line only takes about 3 hours to finish on the first run. While for hardcore gamers, there are New Game+ and Score Attack modes, both of which are required if you want to get 100% of the achievements.\n\nAs a side note, the achievements are really well-designed that you earn as few as 5 out of the 24 achievements if you finish the game in story mode.

Though that might sound like slim pickings compared to other action RPGs (specifically Diablo clones). The hammer does more damage if you aren't moving, the sword can be thrown and is speed based, etc. and there are upgrades that make so that all of the customization options can be felt.\n\nPersonality is the key to this game's design. In a way, this game plays how you want it to. There is a high degree of difficulty customization (eventually, by way of "idols" in game), a few very important story decisions and combat customization. Alcohol acts as equipment in the game, and they can drastically alter how you play, on top of this you have special skills you can use and switch  out freely (unfortunately some of these skills are similar). If all of this sounds like an old hat, I can't stress enough how much you can change your gameplay experience: you can have enemies explode on death while you use two melee weapons for some nice reflex based challenge, or you can make your shields counter hits heal and do critical damage as you turtle along.\n\nThe highlight of the game features is without a doubt the narrator. There are certain portions of the game where what you do or don't do is spoken by the narrator in that golden voice of his. I even caught myself smiling as the narrator called me out on having fallen off the ledge so many times. When you change up your weapons he will remark how that reminds him of something, or some of the items history. What is great about the narrator is that he adds more to the narrative and lore, bit by bit, and adds more personality to the game. The story is solid, it is not experimental, but is great and delivered extremely well.\n\nThis game is worth your time. It is not a grand epic like any of the Elder Scrolls or a loot fest like Diablo. What you have here is an earnest gem of a game that isn't trying to be anything more than a solid action RPG.\n\n(This review needs an update)","August 2, 2013","true","18.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm glad that the game is just as enchanting as its music. Bastion is one big errand mission as you travel through the skies to find the essential pieces needed to rebuild the Bastion--the hub world you escaped to when the world was nearly destroyed by a 'calamity.' I don't mean to tear down Bastion, as it's a fun game that I thoroughly enjoyed. The only unfortunate thing about such a straightforward task is that it can't go on too long before it gets old, which the developers must have realized as they kept the game at a perfect length.\n\nBastion offers several weapons that you can hold in any combination. You can also upgrade them with abilities that strengthen their unique attributes--meaning most people are going to have different setups by the time they reach the climax of the game. I had a lot of fun messing around with different combinations to see which weapons best fit my playstyle. To top it off, you can also use different 'tonics' to give yourself a boost via an assortment of perks. Once you're finished with your customization the gameplay is solid. Blocking, attacking and rolling all feel great and you feel like a pro after a few minutes messing with the controls.\n\nThe story is intriguing, but I'm going to leave it at that since I could easily give something of the plt away. If you're hoping for a deep, fulfilling story, you'll certainly find it here. I can say that the narration of 'the stranger' is one of my favorite parts of the game. I thought I would grow tired of his constant talking as I fought through and explored the world, but it's well done and never overbearing. Overall, you should definitely pick this one up if you want a fun adventure with a great story and stellar soundtrack.","January 5","true","6.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are many different weapons so the gameplay has got plenty of variety, and extra missions to learn more about the backstory of the characters.\n\nOne flaw is that you only have one save file, and it saves automatically to boot. While admittedly it makes sense story-wise (the story is all about moving forward rather than trying to correct past mistakes), it's extremely annoying gameplay-wise.\n\nAlso, it can be annoying that the story is so vague about the way the Calamity affected the world. We quickly learn how it affected two countries (and even then the long-term survival of one of the two is left up in the air), but unless the whole world was only made of those two countries (heck, could be, they never say) it's pretty weird that there is never even a hint about what the rest of the world is doing.

The art style just blew me away, and it was admittedly the reason I got this game in the first place. But of course, good looks aren't the only thing Bastion has going for it. The combat style is very enjoyable due to the variety of customisations available, especially as you progress further into the game and unlock more weapons and potions, which affect your character's base stats. For those looking for a challenge, the interesting gameplay mechanic of invoking idol statues of gods further increases the difficulty of combat, with extra XP and money rewards.\n\nBut the most interesting thing about this game for me was the fact that you're accompanied by a deep-voiced narrator, telling you the story as you play through Bastion. Whenever you progress through the story, whether it's finding a new ability, walking into a new area, or even falling off the edge, the narrator will have something to comment about it right as it happens, more often witty than not. The live narration very effectively immerses the you in the game, making you feel as if you are part of the story itself. I have never seen a game do this kind of narration before, so it was a new and often amusing experience for me.\n\nDespite how great this game is, there is one thing I'd like to point out, and that is the game's lack of definitive area borders, making it very easy to fall off ledges sometimes. For example, there would be something like a chunk of land that you think you can walk on, but when you walk over to it, it was actually in the background and so you end up falling off the ledge. This was a bit annoying particularly when I was low on health, but it's not a huge problem I would deduct any theoretical points for.\n\nWith a compelling story, great soundtrack and amazing art, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Bastion and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good adventure RPG.","January 16, 2014","true","27.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

With a beautiful art and animation direction surrounded by a glorious and trully brilliant score, sound, and narration, Bastion grips the senses from the very moment you wake in a ruined floating city. As the entire experience is brought together with a powerful and driven story with unforgettable characters, it undoubtedly stands as a groundbreaking isometric role-playing game and an impressive debut game from Supergiant Games.\n\nNot only does the main story impress, but every weapon training level provides an entirely different style of combat not only with the respective represented weapon but the very grounds upon where you must prove your tactical prowess is carefully crafted and detailed to offer an eye-catching and grip-tightening hold on the challenger. Similarly, the four trips to Who-Knows-Where pit you against wave after wave of enemies to test one beyond their normal gaming limits and bring one to a peak of their reaction-timing and accuracy mastery. Bastion includes 24 Steam Achievements that will each take the player to the edge of their gaming ability and focus. It will most certainly build a better gamer out of you. Bastion is absolute gaming perfection.\n\nWith every brutally powerful enemy and cryptically beautiful scene, The Kid must traverse a broken sky for the materials needed to bring life back to his dying city of Caelondia and undo the damage wrought by The Calamity. As The Kid travels, he'll discover more than he bargained for surviving in vicious wildernesses, salvaged from fractured villages, and sacrificed to melted mountains. He'll face beasts of the wild, the warriors of The Ura, and even be tested by gods above to save the very fabric of reality, all the while unravelling the secrets of not only the city's fate, but his own past as well as his future.","December 3, 2012","true","58.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As you explore, the world fills in around you. Over the course of the game, you pick up a variety of weapons, powers, abilities, and even penalties you can equip to give yourself better rewards, all while working your way through the areas and story.\n\nBastion's strengths are three main areas: first, how it tells the story. The actions of the player are narrated by a fantastic voice actor, providing a feeling of having the tale be told as you play it out, which is very unique among games. Secondly, it has an amazing soundtrack, which I don't know exactly how to describe - maybe Electronic Folk? Anyway, it absolutely has one of the best soundtracks of any game I've ever played. Finally, the story itself, which I obviously don't want to spoil in the review, so I'll leave you to that.\n\nThere's a fair amount of replayability and challenges to complete if the player is so inclined - I personally chose to play through once and enjoyed it as that. At any rate, the most important thing is this: buy this game, and when you do, buy the soundtrack.","September 26, 2014","true","19.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I guess technically it is an action-RPG, but not in the traditional sense (for example, it's very short and you only gain 10 levels maximum). But it's not even really the gameplay that is the main attraction anyways (at least not for me) - rather, it's the unique world you get to visit during those few hours. The world is visually beautiful and the soundtrack is amazing, but the main draw that keeps you engaged is the smooth-voiced narrator that tells the story of everything you do as you do it. It's hard to explain the concept properly since it is unprecedented in gaming, so all I can really say is check it out and see for yourself. The game itself is not very hard, so pretty much anyone should be able to finish it (there are also various options more experienced players can enable if they wish to make the game harder). I can't say enough good things about Bastion - it is practically a clinic in game design.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AncientPancakes/recommended/107100/","AncientPancakes","AncientPancakes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AncientPancakes/","61 products in account","Oh my gracious sauce, it is time to review Bastion.\n\nLet's first begin by talking about the gameplay. While it is not extraordinary, it is very solid and I enjoyed it like I enjoy a rich potato salad.  You can carry two weapons in your main loadout as well as one special move or skill. As you progress through the game you will find more weapons and your options will increase dramatically.  Experimenting with the different weapons to find the playstyle you like best is great fun. There is also an upgrade system for these weapons which allows you to experiment even further. All super sauce.\n\nYou play through many different levels as you defeat enemies and collect shards.  This is where the great visuals are shown off.  They are crazy delicious. Ridiculously good. They did great work on the art style of this game and it pays off.  The music is also fantastic.\n\nThe biggest flaw of Bastion is that the main game is shorter than most. However, the replay value is boosted by optional challenges and endurance tests.  The difficulty level is also quite tame, but they allow the player to make the game harder and recieve more EXP by playing on harder difficulties.  It is up to the player to add more pasta sauce to the game if the length and difficulty do not satisfy.\n\nWhat I believe to be the most defining part of Bastion is the narrator who narrates all that the main character does in the game as you control him.  It is a very unique and fresh idea that made me say "Holy iguana lungs, this idea is pretty sauce!". The voice actor for the narrator is also excellent and his voice is quite godlike and very fitting.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely a slam dunk worthy of a top 10 special on ESPN.  The music, the art style, the narration, the story, and the gameplay are all as professional as a broadway musical.\n\nI have awarded Bastion a rating of "5/5 top notch godlike".  Thank you for reading my review.","June 20, 2012","true","68.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

From the clouds rolling over the map, to the in-game items, everything is thoughtfully crafted and coherent. A single aesthetic for the entire game scales from little elements to full-fledged splash pages.\n\nThe music does well to pair with the artwork. There's no let down. As much mood is created visually, there is equally fine musical pieces that create the sensations of adventure and tension in all the right places.\n\nThere's a major "cool" factor with the audio in general. The gruff but smoothly delivered voice-over fits the writing styles comfortable brevity. I never felt tired of sitting through narration. It was quick, to the point, but stylized to keep the entertainment flowing. The tunes mix atmosphere and raw, bluesy-western sounding guitar.

While it is not extraordinary, it is very solid and I enjoyed it like I enjoy a rich potato salad.  You can carry two weapons in your main loadout as well as one special move or skill. As you progress through the game you will find more weapons and your options will increase dramatically.  Experimenting with the different weapons to find the playstyle you like best is great fun. There is also an upgrade system for these weapons which allows you to experiment even further. All super sauce.\n\nYou play through many different levels as you defeat enemies and collect shards.  This is where the great visuals are shown off.  They are crazy delicious. Ridiculously good. They did great work on the art style of this game and it pays off.  The music is also fantastic.\n\nThe biggest flaw of Bastion is that the main game is shorter than most. However, the replay value is boosted by optional challenges and endurance tests.  The difficulty level is also quite tame, but they allow the player to make the game harder and recieve more EXP by playing on harder difficulties.  It is up to the player to add more pasta sauce to the game if the length and difficulty do not satisfy.\n\nWhat I believe to be the most defining part of Bastion is the narrator who narrates all that the main character does in the game as you control him.  It is a very unique and fresh idea that made me say "Holy iguana lungs, this idea is pretty sauce!". The voice actor for the narrator is also excellent and his voice is quite godlike and very fitting.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely a slam dunk worthy of a top 10 special on ESPN.  The music, the art style, the narration, the story, and the gameplay are all as professional as a broadway musical.\n\nI have awarded Bastion a rating of "5/5 top notch godlike".  Thank you for reading my review.","June 20, 2012","true","68.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The Bastion was a place everyone agreed to meet if there was an emergency. Through great story telling, a great narrator and many twists and turns in this puzzle-piece-world you find yourself sitting back and enjoying a story being told with some good natured humor as well.\n\nMusic: The game has extraordinarily good music, a video game itself needs to have good music, or else it takes away from the experience, but bastion has very suitable music and a soundtrack that I personally wouldn’t mind downloading.\n\nPlay-Style: You can swing a hammer, shoot a bow, poke with a stick, go click-happy with double revolver pistols and many other choices of weapons and combinations. Pick your favorite weapons; upgrade them at the forge to make yourself into one lethal mean killing machine.\n\nAchievements: I tend to play video games like I’m in a race to complete them, so I have played through the game’s story about 4 times now gathering achievements. In addition to playing through that many times, it took me only 21 hours. (Such as 02/12/14)\nThe achievements themselves aren’t overwhelmingly challenging, which is good sometimes you just want a relaxing game, if you’re going for a 100% completed game, this one is very doable, look up the guides for the harder achievements, and prepare yourself for a some-what challenging experience\n\nPrice: I consider price by how much time I’ve put into a game, how enjoyable it was, and if it’s replayable. Full price for Bastion is 14.99 at this time. I would suggest waiting for a 50% or 75% sale before purchasing. But I would highly recommend this game to anyone who’s looking for something new to play.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update May 27, 2016:\nadded link to my new/updated Bastion YouTube Review.","February 12, 2014","true","22.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

After finally finishing the game, I have to admit I'm not quite sure what held me back on my first 2 attempts because Bastion is a truly great game. It succeeds in nearly every way.\n\nProbably the most noteworthy and distinct aspects are its narration and visuals, both of which players will notice almost immediately. The narration guides along not only the story, but the gameplay as well, which - when coupled with the source of the narration - provides a more intimate and closely-felt experience. Much of the game's worldbuilding and lore is also developed through the narrator, with his very human, down-to-earth, and often heartfelt voice acting. Characters and their backstories are also developed in this way, and the story being progressed in this manner turns out to be more intricate and poignant than it would seem at first. Worldbuilding also takes place quite literally as the world is built before your eyes as you move along an area. This decision to have the setting come to life as you go does wonders for the feel of the game; it's a design choice (and in a way, a mechanic) that is entirely unique and refreshing and elevates the aesthetics of the game to another level.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is Bastion's incredible soundtrack. Its varying tracks fit the moods of different moments and locations exceptionally well. The music of Bastion is instrumental (heh) in creating the right atmosphere as it complements the narration and aesthetics to make a truly powerful experience. One track in particular caught my attention the instant the female vocals rang out, and I almost stopped playing just to appreciate the chillingly beautiful song.\n\nThe actual gameplay of Bastion is probably actually its weakest point, and that's only because the rest of the game is on another level. The gameplay is actually quite good, with satisfying combat that holds more depth than it would initially seem. It's not amazing as Bastion's other aspects, and it doesn't really do anything new, but it works just fine for the game and still provides for a fun experience. There is also a fair amount of replayability, which is always a plus in my book.\n\nWith a gorgeous soundtrack and aesthetics, solid gameplay, and top-notch narration, Bastion easily deserves its spot in the hall of fame for indie games.\n\n8.5/10","May 29","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifiamalone/recommended/107100/","ifiamalone","dinosaur° | rehab..backsometime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ifiamalone/","48 products in account","Bastion is an RPG top down game created by an indie developer, Supergiant Games (creators of Transistor as you know). The game's setting is in Caelondia, a war torned atmosphere left by after the war between Uras and Caels (I tried to remember the plot but this is a close one as I can remember). You will play as The Kid, an amnesiac warrior who cannot remember the past and tried to unravel. This game's dialogue have a minimalistic feel because the protagonist doesn't talk and same thing as support characters as well. The narrative voice acting, oh man, the best voice acting I have ever heard in my whole entire life. The musical scores are top notch, especially when you are in the dream sequence and every region you explore. The graphics are eye candy and visually stunning, the art style is immersively well done, the animations are well executed. The combat system is solid and fluid, you can have 2 weapons to carry and you can change the weapons if you can find The Arsenal during missions or before starting the mission. You have abilities to choose from to eliminate enemies with ease. The Forge lets you upgrade your weapons but you need a particular parts to upgrade the weapon. The Distillery lets you drink any potions you like, it gives you the benefits for your stats but also there are side effects or negative effects in it. The enemy A.I. are smart and tough. Every enemy you encounter needs a proper strategy because they have different attack patterns and weaknesses, so it's best not to mash buttons to win. If you want a challenge(it's an optional), you can turn them on by building the Shrine and enable any idols you like to have. I recommend everyone to use a controller, the controls are tight and responsive, no problem. There are 2 endings you can choose from, so it's better not to spoil for everyone (for the sake of not to ruin their experience).\n\n+ Pros+ Narrative Voice Acting and Musical Scores\n+ Graphics and the art style of the game\n+ Variety of enemy A.I. behaves and attack patterns differently\n+ Tons of weapons you can use, suited for your playstyle\n+ Replayability (New Game Plus available after finishing the game)\n\n\n- Cons- Keyboard and Mouse are not recommended unless you don't own a controller or don't like using a controller\n- Not many varieties for main objective (finding a same life crystal to restore the Bastion)\n\nIn this game's honest review, I enjoyed playing this game, just relax playing this game while the narrative is soothing my ears. The graphics, the musical scores, jnarrative voice acting, solid combat system and challenges that made this game's biggest strength. But there is a lack of variety during missions like finding a life crystal, encountering NPCs, it's a tiresome experience for me. I recommend you to buy this game during Sale because it's $2.50 (just in case if someone doesn't like the game, correct me if the price point is wrong). It's a solid recommendation.","June 6","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","2"

I can still hear the bluesy guitar line and the hurt voice of a character you meet early in the game.\nA game you should buy 10/10 !","October 8, 2015","true","11.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/107100/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Typically when a game's length comes into question, it's because of triple-digit hours on one save file. However, Bastion is one of those rare flames that petered out too quickly. Whether this complements the strong gameplay and story or serves as a complaint of an unfinished product is up to the reader. I am certain of this, though: some developer somewhere is scribbling down ways to turn Bastion's novel approach to RPGs into a multi-million dollar project.\n\nFew games can claim that they revolutionized the industry, and when they do, it's the one simple, novel idea that makes the mark. For Bastion, that's the velvety narrator who comments on nearly every aspect of gameplay. Fall off the landscape? He's got something to say about it. Thwart a boss without getting nicked? Expect a new piece of dialogue. Choose any two weapons? Prepare to methodically run through every combination of equipment.\n\nBut he does more than simply comment. The narrator tells the story from the perspective of a weathered, rustic old man who's made mistakes and bears the burden of regret. At the same time, he speaks of The Kid as a champion–someone who can make things right. And that's where you come in: as The Kid, you have the opportunity to fix a sort of man-made apocalypse called the Calamity. Finding survivors along the way, The Kid has to restore power back to Bastion, the protagonists' headquarters.\n\nBy finding crystals through linearly explored areas, The Kid grants Bastion energy, and buildings for some reason. Players have the illusion of choice when deciding which structure to erect, each of which grants some sort of ability or perk. The Arsenal, for example, allows the player to choose which weapons he'd like to equip, as well as a super power. Alternatively, the Shrine invokes the gods, which can make the game more difficult with a slight boost to experience and money; it's worth mentioning that the ways in which a player may increase difficulty are creative and keep the game new. However, all aspects of the game maintain a pine-fresh scent.\n\nInitially, Bastion's quick-paced, action-based gameplay is good, simple fun. Truly, without activating an idol or two, the game is a bit on the easy side. Though, should you falter, you're granted one reprieve. An additional pratfall results in running the entire level over again. Normally, a lack of checkpoints in extensive stages is a critical game design flaw, but with adjustable difficulty, this is more than fair. For those looking for a challenge and adrenaline rush, the penalty of running some of the longer levels over again can be enticing; however, those who enjoy whimsical hack-n-slashery need just avoid the idols. Although the game gets harder over time even in its vanilla state, leveling up and weapon upgrades maintain one's interest.\n\nWhen leveling up and choosing a potion to make The Kid stronger, players have several choices to make. Do I want more mobility when holding up my shield, or do I want to have a slight increase to critical chance? Another shop allows players to purchase gods for the Shrine, potions for leveling up perks, and even special powers for the Arsenal. Other buildings include achievements and weapon upgrading with customization.\n\nAlthough Bastion egregiously offers pseudo-choices the way so many other games of its ilk do, the customization, challenges, and achievements are well thought out. Valve and Kongregate will tell you with firsthand experience that easy, medium, and hard difficulty achievements are necessary if goal-setting is going to motivate players even a bit; Bastion has this covered. I completed certain auxiliary objectives without even knowing about them, while others took conscious effort and practice.\n\nThankfully, customization makes challenges easier. In this way, some of the side missions can be thought of more as puzzles with an element of skill, but others will require finesse, alacrity, and accuracy to conquer. However, I didn't find any Excalibur equivalents, and even if I thought I did, my brother glanced over at my screen and asked me how the heck I was using that weapon combination and special power; the sentiments were reciprocated. And isn't this the goal of any designer who includes gameplay options?\n\nAs alluded to in the beginning of the review, Bastion is more than just gameplay and a novel plot: it's an experience. For those who've read my King's Bounty reviews, you're probably well-aware of my love of color. Modern gaming can be so monochrome and drab that when a game as vibrant as Bastion comes along, the appeal is two-fold; not only is color in itself enticing, but we're so starved for it that our love for it is accentuated. Additionally, not only has Bastion been graced by daubs of the palette, it's extremely busy. While clutter can certainly reach a threshold, Bastion never oversteps its bounds. The developers made sure to keep the minds and eyes of its consumers occupied while not getting in their way. Another marvel of the layout is just how intuitive foreground breakables are. Many other games leave questions as to what can be examined and destroyed, and what is meant to be left alone in the background. Some may complain that foreground pillars and structures can get in the way, but this reviewer perceives that as a necessary evil given how beautiful the game is.\n\nBut what would a game be without music to match the visuals? Although most of the music is forgettable, some of the tunes have lasting power. Keeping with the atmosphere of a western, the occasional acoustic guitar and harmonica make for some innovative RPG music. However, the aural highlights of Bastion lie in its vocal numbers. Simple instrumentation matched with truly melodious voices grants us serene, wistful songs. Couple this with intelligent lyrics, and Bastion leaves an imprint on anyone with a love of music or beating heart.\n\nTypically, voice acting hurts or helps in a humble way. To my knowledge, never has a game been recommended purely because of the voice acting, but Bastion might be the first. Sure, we play games to enjoy deep, fun gameplay and funny or immersive storytelling. However, what if the defining feature was its narrator, and how that story was told? Take away Bastion's voice, and that leaves a pretty good game with fun combat in a slightly unique take on a post-apocalyptic world. With the voice, Bastion isn't just a great game, it's a work of art. Never before had I anticipated a person's name in the credits of a game, just so I could seek them out online and see what they've done and what they will do. I would be absolutely astonished and floored if this is the last we hear of Logan Cunningham.\n\nFinally, the controls are what you would expect of a game of this caliber. Nigh-perfect in its intuitive rolling and hit detection, the only complaints I can make are in its auto-targeting mechanism. Due to Bastion's archaic take on defending, players may steer clear of the shield due to its unreliability. When defending, The Kid automatically faces the nearest target, which makes sense.\n\nWhen I close a good, long book, I always feel a little sad, as if I had just said good bye to an old friend. I want to know what happens to the characters that I grew to love, but I have to accept the end and move on. Bastion is a short game, which will run most people around five or six hours. Nevertheless, I feel that same kind of loss. Although I truly believe that Bastion could have doubled its length in terms of gameplay, I'm glad that the story didn't risk imploding on itself. Don't let anyone tell you this is a Diablo clone–that would cheapen Bastion; it needs to be heard to be believed.","December 30, 2013","true","102.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But I've owned it for over 2 years and have tried picking it up on several different occasions only to never completely get into it. I don't feel very attached to the characters and story. It's all extremely vague, which can make some games fun because you get curious and want to explore more and play more. But if it wasn't for the narrator talking into my ear there would be no story. His voice is everything... and I kind of don't like that.\n\nThe gameplay felt really tight. The weapons can be somewhat interesting when you combine them with different power ups. I probably should have set my game on a harder difficulty because I found no challenge to it, but that's my own fault. I used the keyboard. The artwork is swell. I never fell in love with the music, although it is ever-present and perfectly fitting. The enemies are cool but kind of repetitive. I think that's about it. There's really nothing that stands out wrong with the game in my opinion, except for the story resting so highly on one overdramatic voice, even though that's the part everyone raves about. And to me, if you have a problem with the story then you have a problem with the game because the story is one of the biggest reasons why I'd ever even play a single-player game.\n\nI believe that I now realize what my other main issue is. I said "there's really nothing wrong with the game", but there's also nothing that special about it either. You strip away the artwork and the [annoying] narrator and it's just some run-of-the-mill barebones top down "twin-stick shooter", as someone in my comments had said. Twin-stick shooter. That genre might still be fresh enough for many people but for someone like me gaming into their late 20's who has already played quite a bit of those it doesn't do enough for me.

Although the game is linear, it's easy to forget that as you slowly uncover the details of what caused the Calamity. In addition, there is a large amount of customizability with what weapons you use, and they allow for many different playstyles. In addition, instead of picking an arbitrary difficulty at the beginning (For example, if you pick between easy and hard, what makes hard more difficult than easy?), the game allows you to create your own challenge - while also rewarding you with more EXP if you choose to do so. The storytelling in the game is also phenomenal, and makes replaying the game so much more fun - because you can't catch every detail in your first play through. I've beaten the game many times and still notice something new each time.\n\nOverall, this is a great game and shows that Supergiant Games will definitely continue to be a great video game company.\n","May 21, 2014","true","73.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laptoprocker/recommended/107100/","laptoprocker","theHatMadder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laptoprocker/","891 products in account","It's an isometric action indie game (although I don't know how being published by Warner Bros is indie but nevermind that.) This is probably the first indie non-sandbox game I’ve played.\n\nIt follows through the adventures of a boy the „Kid” who’s entire race was wiped off of the face of the earth „Bastion” by a strange event called the „Calamity”. The „Kid” is trying to salvage through the remains of his civilization exploring the world trying to find clues, and certain items to restore „Bastion” to its former glory.\n\nI’ll follow the usual format of game reviews just to make it easier to read.\n\n-	Story/Quests\n\nThe story itself is quite mediocre I’d say, there are no mind-blowing twists or hilarious moments in it. The quest mechanic are basically the same „go and fetch this and that” repeating around 16 times which can be tedious after a while. However an unique feature of the game is that EVERYTHING is narrated, no not by Morgan Freeman but by a more „macho” sounding gentleman Logan Cunningham who is also great in what he does.\nThe narration gives an interesting vibe to the game, you feel like you’re part of the story and it feels like „living in the book”, making the fights/progression and story more immersive. The narrator also has some quirky comments when you change your loadout or accidentally fall off of a floating island which made me smile quite a few times.\n\n-	Graphics/Looks\n\nThe art of the game is beautiful. Every level has a different story, feel to it which makes you forgive the (otherwise tedious) quests. Everything is colorful, rich and vibrant. Thankfully the game doesn’t have any serious system requirements it runs easily on a laptop so you can enjoy it in its full glory. There’s not much more to say, go watch some trailers or gameplay videos :)\n\n-	Combat/Gameplay\n\nThe game is very combat-centric, you don’t have much time to immerse yourself into the game or admire the scenery without getting ♥♥♥♥♥ by the various enemies. It’s like Bioshock Infinite, beautiful and interesting but you must keep on grinding through hordes of various enemies. The enemy variety is alright when you start to get bored there’s always a new type of enemy appearing. The combat itself is surprisingly fun with a great variety in weapons and combat styles. There is no quick-save or even checkpoints, a game is only saved after you successfully finish a level.\n\nYou have one primary and a secondary weapon slot and a variety of weapons (ranging from katanas to muskets) which you can upgrade. You also have a special ability slot which you can use to throw grenades or place a decoy of yourself to confuse enemies. There’s supposed to be an alchemy system and stealth in the game but I didn’t really want to get into it, I stick to my guns thanks. The combat is incredibly fast-paced and hectic with tons of enemies coming at you, sometimes you even feel like you’re playing an isometric „Shoot ’em Up” dodging projectiles all the time. The game is HARD, the enemies hit hard even on easy difficulty you find yourself grasping for breath, looking for health potions and trying to survive. You have three chances to „respawn” after dying if you exceed it then you must start the level all over again. There are the usual boss batles and you should apply a different strategy for different foes.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBastion is a fun little game, but it has its flaws. I love reading classic literature in my free time so my expectations of a „story” are quite high when I play video games. The game is beautiful, the combat is fun but challenging, and the narration brings a refreshing change to the storytelling. I recommend it to people who like games with an unique world, and lore but who also like getting their hands dirty in frequent fights. I don’t recommend it to people who don’t like hard fast paced, crazy combat and to people who don’t like to start a level all over again. The game takes around 6-8 hours to beat, but I heard that there are two different endings so it gives some replay value (I didn't really care about the story so one playthrough was enough for me :) )\n\nStory 6/10\nGraphics 9/10\nCombat 8/10\nOverall 8/10\n\nOh I forgot to mention:\n\nTHE SOUNDTRACK IS F*****ING AMAZING!!!!\n\nI mean really, I was even thinking of putting it on my phone just to listen to it its so great.","May 1, 2014","true","7.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.\n\nThe story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why.

Please.”\n\nBastion is one of the “big names” of the Indie scene. Although its reach has gone farther than most games made by small companies thanks to a partnership between Supergiant Games and Warner Brothers, Bastion still has the charm that only a small-time game can. From the graphics to the gameplay, the music to the narration, you know you’ve found something special from the moment the game begins.\nThe game follows the story of a boy known only as “the Kid” following a catastrophic event called the Calamity. With the world falling to pieces, it’s up to the Kid to collect cores to rebuild the bastion and restore life. An old man known as Rucks narrates the story as it plays out. Along the way, the Kid must fight off monsters, enemies, and even nature itself to retrieve the cores and save the bastion, with a few surprises along the way.\nArtistically, Bastion is a gem. Jen Zee’s artwork gives the world an organic, colorful feeling that constantly evolves around the player’s actions. The soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, is as beautiful as it is fitting for the game’s story. With a very down-to-earth feel and haunting lyrics on a number of tracks, the soundtrack makes for good listening both in and out of the game. Better yet, it’s also available for purchase on the Steam marketplace.\nIn respects to gameplay, Bastion is a generally easy game. I had little difficulty making my way through on my first play-through, and never encountered a game over. That being said, the “Shrine” portion of the game allows players to raise the difficulty in exchange for more fragments (currency used for upgrades and purchases) and XP. With that in mind, the game can be made as easy or as difficult as the player would like, with the best benefits reserved for those who play the hardest.\nWhat Bastion is known for most of all is its narrator, Rucks, who narrates the game’s events as they play out. The old, weathered voice of the man gives a dimension to the game that few others can hold a flame to. His voice guides players through the plot at several key points, but is also free-flowing at other instances. Rucks might comment on the weapons the Kid uses, offer hints when needed, and even comment on little things such as falling off the stage. The story is framed as Zucks telling the story--to whom? That comes in time.\nBastion is a gem, and for good reasons. Its fascinating story is told through every medium--art, music, and plot--and culminates in one fantastic experience. If you have the opportunity to experience Bastion, do so.","December 6, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll start with the graphics only because the style in which this world is built is breathtaking. The art direction is watercolours, and do they ever add a fluidity to the movements of The Kid, the silent protagonist of whom you are controlling in this adventure. The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.\n\nThe story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why. Honestly it's the only sense of direction you are likely to receive, given as to how each level is "summoned" step by step.\n\nA final word would be on the soundtrack. It goes with the game perfectly. What else is there to say?\n\nGet yourself this game if you're a fan of Adventure games!","June 1, 2014","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Please.”\n\nBastion is one of the “big names” of the Indie scene. Although its reach has gone farther than most games made by small companies thanks to a partnership between Supergiant Games and Warner Brothers, Bastion still has the charm that only a small-time game can. From the graphics to the gameplay, the music to the narration, you know you’ve found something special from the moment the game begins.\nThe game follows the story of a boy known only as “the Kid” following a catastrophic event called the Calamity. With the world falling to pieces, it’s up to the Kid to collect cores to rebuild the bastion and restore life. An old man known as Rucks narrates the story as it plays out. Along the way, the Kid must fight off monsters, enemies, and even nature itself to retrieve the cores and save the bastion, with a few surprises along the way.\nArtistically, Bastion is a gem. Jen Zee’s artwork gives the world an organic, colorful feeling that constantly evolves around the player’s actions. The soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, is as beautiful as it is fitting for the game’s story. With a very down-to-earth feel and haunting lyrics on a number of tracks, the soundtrack makes for good listening both in and out of the game. Better yet, it’s also available for purchase on the Steam marketplace.\nIn respects to gameplay, Bastion is a generally easy game. I had little difficulty making my way through on my first play-through, and never encountered a game over. That being said, the “Shrine” portion of the game allows players to raise the difficulty in exchange for more fragments (currency used for upgrades and purchases) and XP. With that in mind, the game can be made as easy or as difficult as the player would like, with the best benefits reserved for those who play the hardest.\nWhat Bastion is known for most of all is its narrator, Rucks, who narrates the game’s events as they play out. The old, weathered voice of the man gives a dimension to the game that few others can hold a flame to. His voice guides players through the plot at several key points, but is also free-flowing at other instances. Rucks might comment on the weapons the Kid uses, offer hints when needed, and even comment on little things such as falling off the stage. The story is framed as Zucks telling the story--to whom? That comes in time.\nBastion is a gem, and for good reasons. Its fascinating story is told through every medium--art, music, and plot--and culminates in one fantastic experience. If you have the opportunity to experience Bastion, do so.","December 6, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/recommended/107100/","RaefGall","RaefGall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/","298 products in account","I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/04/bastion.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nConceptually, Bastion could be considered a fairly typical action RPG.  It features a silent protagonist, a small cast of enemies, a selection of weapons for which you develop new skills as you progress, and a combat system heavy on combos and dodge rolling.  What makes it unique is its presentation, and to say that Bastion is an artistic endeavor would be an understatement.  The art creates a world somewhere between catastrophe and storybook, the music has a multicultural feel that creates something familiar but foreign.  The only character to speak is the narrator, who is a constant presence in the game and provides information about the world, the characters, and your course of action, serving as both storyteller and tutorial.  The way this was accomplished creates an experience that envelops you in what would otherwise be a decent game.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nThe tutorials for Bastion are pretty straight forward, and the controls are fairly simple to pick up and play.  The narrator also does a good job providing little hints for moving forward, especially early in the game.  The timing for dodge rolling, blocking with your shield, and even just attacking can take some time to master and feel a bit clumsy, especially given the differences in the available weapons.  The weapon proving grounds provide a good method for mastering the techniques for various weapons.\n\nAs far as the challenge curve goes, Bastion does a great job of starting off easy and escalating slowly to a proper difficulty.  The proving grounds and dream sequences allow you to build up your level and money, often while earning new techniques.  If you aren’t feeling challenged, the shrine allows you to drastically increase the difficulty of specific aspects of the game to increase your rewards, allowing you to customize the difficulty of the game in a unique way.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nBastion has a very stylized appearance that gives it a persistent otherworldly feeling, like you are experiencing a dream or watching the illustrations of a story book.  The enemies and foreground objects are often strange and brightly colored, the world itself is made up of chunks of ground floating in mid-air that form as you progress, and the backgrounds consist of little more than gradient colors and clouds.  The culmination of this look is a sense of nihilistic beauty, which seems appropriate in drawing the audience in to the story of the survivors of a world shattering apocalypse.\n\nThe music in Bastion is a bit hard to describe, both because of its occasional strangeness and the obvious scope of its influences.  At its core there is often a folksy acoustic guitar, but many of the tracks feature distinctly eastern sounds as well.  The lyrics are simple and poignant, and the vocal tracks have a haunting beauty to them.  Ultimately, the music has the same effect as the visuals, to draw you in to a place that is both alien and beautiful, and reminding you of what has been lost to the world you explore.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nWhile not a specific moment, the best thing about this game to me was Rucks, the narrator.  Voice actor Logan Cunningham did a great job creating a character that sounded familiar and warm, further connecting you to what could otherwise be a somewhat alien world.  Rucks serves as a storyteller and historian for the viewer as the game progresses, serving as the medium for each major plot point in the game, and telling you about the history of places, events, and character as they become relevant to the story.  In addition, he provides commentary as you move through each level.  There is something shocking about the first time you hear Rucks provide commentary on what is happening in the course of a battle, something that seems like it could not be scripted, but obviously must be.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nOnce again, I would encourage all brands of gamer to check out this game.  Bastion uses great art, music, and storytelling to create an environment that you can be drawn into.  The action may not always be on par with some modern titles and parts of the game may not feel especially challenging, but the gameplay is always fun and the sliding difficulty scale will help keep you under pressure.  Bastion is available to purchase and download on the X-Box Live Arcade and on Steam.","November 28, 2013","true","45.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Original, interesting, and fun!"  (Dec 27, 2011)\n\nI still really enjoy this game. There's no sugarcoating it. This is one of my favorite games of all time and it probably had an influence in my life choices.\nLooking at the game closer, everything about it appeals to me. I love the character design, the music is above fantastic, and the scripting is amazing. The game mechanics are pretty smooth too, but that wasn't the thing that made this game one of my favorites of all time.\nThe characters became a part of my life while I was playing this game, and not to sound like a crazy person here, but I connected with them all on an emotional level. Every single protagonist made me wonder about my life choices. I'm including Zulf in the pool cause I believe that he is in fact a protagonist, but that's an argument for another day.\nThe Kid is the character that really makes this game. You befriend him as the player. The Kid isn't some faceless hero that you can imprint your own desires on to. The Kid, is The Kid, and everyone in the game recognizes that. The Kid has a personality, yet he's quiet the entire game. Again, I could rant about the similarities and differences that The Kid has to Link from LoZ, but that's an argument for another day. The kid, different from Link, existed before you started to control him. He had a mother and a life of his own. The Kid had feelings and dreams that the player can experience through dream snippets that make a separation possible between character and player. Rucks' narration also helps separate The Kid from the player, but when it comes down to it, this game is beautifully written and I can't stress it enough that this game is worth your money and time.\n\nHave a good one,\nCoffeeGoat","December 27, 2011","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bastion can relate.\n\nMaybe not in the mental state but taking place in a world that begins to crumble into pieces, Bastion manages to capture a beautiful unique scenery that has a quite amuzing arcade like gameplay.\n\nPositive\n\nThe story follows to be short but powerful, the game follows a young boy on the curiosity and discovery on what's happening to his world, and how can you stop it.\n\nCaptivating dialouge, you will enjoy this classical hit if you love the enrichment of emotions this story can and does indeed bring.\n\nIf you have enough money for the soundtrack i also highly reccomend you download that too. I'm not much on soundtracks, however Bastion does have an extremely rich and cultivating music producer. However the beauty if music is there is aways gonna be a song out there to enjoy....just not for everybody. Thus,\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA6BDC6AA59483A76\n\nI give you a quick link to hear some of the music so you can see for yourself if you would rather buy the game with or without it's soundtrack. Im kinda repeating mysef here but again, im not much of a fan for the soundtracks, thats why i recommend this one, because i just absolutely love it.\n(I'm listening to the ending credits song as i write this review!!!)\n\nCon\n\nThe game doesn't have much of a replaybility, I mean Bastion contains extra modes after the intial completion of the game isn't the type of game you can have 500 hours on....unless you enjoy the game that much but in hinde sight, it is a short game.\n\nAdditional Info\n\nThe game contains multiple endings. Basion contains about as many choices as the size of one grain of rice, but very powerful in game choices you, the player, have to make.\n\nIt is not a choice making game like Mass Effect, but I just needed to add that because I still to this day regret all the decisions this game forced me to make. It's a balance of depression and joy that the presence of the choices were involved.\n\nIn short, for any fan of an enticing, rich storyline with captivating scenery and ear endulging music, this game is a must have. Bastion is a definatly an 11/10 in my book and the music is a must have in your itunes library.","June 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where should I start? Well, this game is probably my new all-time favorite. It has secured a place in my heart and I look forward to playing other games from Supergiant Games in the near future.\nThis game has an absolutely beautiful story that engulfs the player in the environment in such a way that I have never before experienced. The set-up for the narration is incredible and makes you feel like you are sitting on the Bastion listening to Rucks tell the story of the Kid.\nThe music is amazing and captures the environment of the game in a way that I've only seen two other games do before in my life (MGS4, and Borderlands). I will admit, I am a bit biased on the music because I love indie music in general and I love a very acoustic sound, so this was already appealing, but then as the game progresses the music takes a diverse turn that is very rare in any mainstream media. Darren Korb's instrumentation is great and includes a wide variety of instruments, and the vocals are absolutely beautiful (Ashley Barrett, I'm looking at you!).\nThe art is breathtaking to say the least. The game almost looks like the player is playing in a stained glass mosaic piece and the animation is smooth and natural feeling. The modeling is also superb and does not at all feel clunky.\nLastly, the gameplay is just 100% phenomenal. As mentioned above, the game plays very smoothly and everything feels very natural. The difficulty is at a very good level, giving the player the option to "invoke the gods" which provides a more difficult challenge, and gives the player more "fragments" and experience to build their character. Bastion's wide variety of customization options makes the game perfectly tailored to the player and ensures that people of all ages and skill levels can enjoy it.\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely. And not just to people who like Action Role-Playing games, but to everyone who wants to play a game that is, in the most modest of terms, perfect. Bastion is everything a player could ever want in a game, and is a must-have for anybody who has the ability to play it.\n\n"Now The Kid sees somethin' stranger still; his mind races.

I really just wanted to get my hands on trine, and the game soon fell into dark corners of my game library. A few days ago, for some mysterious reason, i installed it and played it, expected yet another indie game. Don't get me wrong, I love indie games, however with their independent label, we kind of lower our expectations and judge them on their own scale, seeing that a "small team made it against all odds in their own garage".\n\nI would have never guessed Bastion was an indie game made by a group of 7 people on my own. The game art and world work flawlessly, the innovitave and dynamic narration system makes the whole tale all the more engrossing, and the soundtrack is exquisite.

Ain't so simple with this one\n\nGet Bastion. Really. A discount means it's a steal for you\n\nI'm just fooling\n\nBastion is an adventure beat-em-up game with unique artstyle, superb storytelling, hypnotizing music, and a meta-ish thingy in the plotline.\nBastion graphical representation used a lot of handpainted scenery, resulting in a beautiful and easy-in-the-eye kind of graphics, you won't find many game that uses this kind (well, aside from other game from Supergiant, Transistor). It'll be a different 'graphics' experience for you with Bastion\n\nThe story in this game are told with a narrator as the player progresses through the Bastion world. The character player control is silent (and looks like the main character communicate with other using handwriting, as hinted by all the dialogue choices when interacting with others), and all element about Bastion are told by the narrator. The narrator did a really excellent job at delivering the world of Bastion to the player. His voice feels friendly, like someone you've known for so long, yet only meet again after a long separation. You won't feel tired listening to the narrator thoughout the game, and it is also a good thing because the way of the storytelling is unique, leaving you with a feeling of wanting to be told more.\n\nMusic at the bastion is a little different with other games that usually use orchestra of violin, drum, piano or everything else. It sound like 1 or 2 instrument that playing along with a storyteller, and perfectly captures the predicament of the story being told. This fits a lot with the storytelling style of Bastion.\n\nNot much of gameplay selling point can be told here. Some people might feels the combat is repetitive, and old as there's no differentiation to other game with same type of combat. That might be true, but I find Bastion combat is at good value. The many Arsenal you'll find coupled with passive boost from Distillery and difficulty tweaker from the Shrine will kinda force you to seek new way to combat the enemy and it's good enough for me.\n\nThe meta things of Bastion plot is *SPOILER AHEAD  you're supposed to choose a peculiar ending in order for your first playthrough to match with the new game +, the Restoration Protocol. Because the narrator will have some kind of deja vu telling throughout the whole new game + narration, it fits the ending. Also it can be interpreted that as the player, you are the Kid's will that never forget even after time reset itself, the Kid at first want to restore the world before the Calamity happen, but as the player see that restoring the world doesn't prevent the Calamity, on the second playthrough, you know that the correct choice is Evacuation Protocol, thus setting sail for a new home is kinda the right /good ending of Bastion. Bastion is game where a second playthrough is needed to close a loophole that might be caused by 1 ending. And it's spectacular for a game this small to have this kind of meta story.\nThe whole narration or the story is actually Ruck telling the story to Zia about how they all come together, while waiting for the Kid to return from the Tazal Terminal at the last level, so you are playing a memory of Ruck, and the only real time moment Ruck's narrating is when we save/leave Zulf and afterward.\nAlso, dramatic moment when you decide to rescue Zulf. The music is plain tearjerker, the tension of the situation feels heroic and out of respect, you'll struck in awe playing that part.\n\nIt's finished...\nNo matter what you decide to buy Bastion or not, you done good...\nThe Bastion's gonna take us to a better gametime\nSo long kid, Maybe I'll see you in the next one\n*cue Setting Sail, Coming Home music (youtube it!)","April 17, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Everything is narrated, and the narration serves both to guide the player through various parts of the game, it's also informed and appropriately altered by the player's actions.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid in most aspects, and works very well in its isometric framework.  The graphics are excellent, and it's endlessly fascinating to watch the stages gradually take form as you move around, and just as fascinating to run around destroying as much of it as you can.  The real star of the background is the music, however, which is just chock full of beautiful and catchy sounds.  Shelling out $9.99 for the soundtrack is a bargain as far as I'm concerned.\n\nThe Bad\nThe mechanics of the game have surprisingly little variation given how many different weapons, abilities, and the like that are available.  Many of the enemies can be taken out in a lot different ways, meaning there's very little reason to bother switching away from whatever weapon you've picked as your favorite since odds are it'll still do the trick.  I do like the combat, but I also think it could have benefited a great deal from just a little more depth.\n\nOverall\nA very fun game with a damn fine soundtrack and a good, thought-provoking story presented in a unique way.  I would definitely recommend giving it a try, and I personally look forward to seeing and playing SuperGiant Games' future endeavors.","September 27, 2013","true","9.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bastion could be titled a gaming masterpeice, much like Dust: An Elysian Tail. It's gameplay core and mechanics are solid, and is good enough to keep you nice and entertained for a couple hours in one session, and the gold narration and storytelling is only there to refine and back it up. These two combined can result to some pretty damn nice immersion, which is a thing some games fail at doing, and some succeed at. Bastion succeeded and went over the charts.\n\nThe only things I don't like about the game are very small nitpicks, like not being able to replay levels the player enjoyed, but that also gives the game a good sense of progression, to counter that nitpick.\n\nIf you're a fan of both good, addictive beat-em-up gameplay and storytelling bundled into a nice package, then Bastion is for you.

Great story, good gameplay, terrific music and the best narrator ever.\n\nThe storyline is quite cool, with a little element of choose your own adventure at the end. I just wish they expanded on the world of Bastion a little more, maybe with a sequel, it's a very fascinating world.\n\nThe way the game progresses through the story is sort of simple compared to the extensive background of the Bastion. Most of the game is "Collect the core to build the Bastion. Oh no, Bastion broken, collect shards to rebuild. Not again, more shards please." The storyline is very linear and I feel that some other plot device could be used instead of cores and shards. The story was too formulaic because of this.\n\nThe soundtrack, the art, and the narrator are fantastic. Every level felt awe inspiring, each environment looked incredible and well designed. I really loved that Rucks was used to narrate everything, it was a neat twist to story-centric games, and with Logan Cunningham's voice I didn't mind at all.\n\nThe weapon system is very awesome and most of the weapons are mechanically very different, but there are some obviously underpowered and overpowered weapons (UP=Fang Repeater, OP=Galleon Mortar). Generally the weapons are mostly balanced sidegrades.\n\nThe passive upgrades via Spirits is quite unique. There is also a faulty power balance among spirits too: eg. Leechade should always be equipped regardless of build. There aren't enough spirits to make different builds viable except for a tanky build and a high risk high reward build, which are both outclassed by the all around build. In all fairness the game isn't deep enough to warrant more builds than those.\n\nI really enjoyed the difficulty of the game. It's a very easy game until the idols are all turned on, now the squirt mobs instakill you when they die with the dropped explosives on death, the spinning gasfellas permaslow to a quick death, and the Ura move at godlike speeds; the fundamentals of the enemies change quite a bit. Regen god + Damage block god + Invulnerability god challenges on vs a really tanky and high damage enemy such as Pyth is really stupid though, it almost forces you to use the Galleon Mortar or other high burst damage.\n\nDon't take my review the wrong way though, the criticisms I've made with this game are very minor, the game as a whole is amazing and worth every penny.","July 31, 2013","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To be honest, all I can say is that this game is amazing, but that's a pure understatement.\n\nFor a quick summary of Bastion, the plot follows the main character, known as "The Kid" as he wakes up after the calamity has taken place. The calamity is an event which reduced most people and the world to ash and rubble. He takes off towards the Bastion where he will go off to get cores to power up the Bastion so that he can fix the calamity.\n\nThe gameplay of the game is extremely engaging and keeps the players on their toes, even when playing the game on the easiest setting. You will find yourself constantly rolling and trying to avoid enemy attacks, and searching levels for health potions over and over again. The enemies do become harder, but thankfully not the point that I would call this  a Dark Souls game. [ THANK THE LORD!!! ]\n\nThe main point I love about Bastion is the story. It keeps the players interested and compels you to play more and more so you can find out what happens next or find out what happened before the game had begun. I will not say too much however, but the story truly is beautiful.\n\nAnd I cannot leave out the next best thing, the music. I just don't know what to say about it. It is extremely fitting, and has a nice tune and beat to it, and always seems right for the situation you find yourself to be in, whether a fierce battle, or simply roaming around the Bastion and talking to people.\n\nOverall, I would like to say that this game is great, but it's not. It's a bloody masterpiece and one that I must say, will outlive many. This is a MUST for gamers everywhere.\n\nThis game... Is just...

Combining profound concepts with great music, artistic graphics, and a sort of post-apocalyptic scene of its own, Bastion is less of a game and more of a story that you play to hear.

Bastion can relate.\n\nMaybe not in the mental state but taking place in a world that begins to crumble into pieces, Bastion manages to capture a beautiful unique scenery that has a quite amuzing arcade like gameplay.\n\nPositive\n\nThe story follows to be short but powerful, the game follows a young boy on the curiosity and discovery on what's happening to his world, and how can you stop it.\n\nCaptivating dialouge, you will enjoy this classical hit if you love the enrichment of emotions this story can and does indeed bring.\n\nIf you have enough money for the soundtrack i also highly reccomend you download that too. I'm not much on soundtracks, however Bastion does have an extremely rich and cultivating music producer. However the beauty if music is there is aways gonna be a song out there to enjoy....just not for everybody. Thus,\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA6BDC6AA59483A76\n\nI give you a quick link to hear some of the music so you can see for yourself if you would rather buy the game with or without it's soundtrack. Im kinda repeating mysef here but again, im not much of a fan for the soundtracks, thats why i recommend this one, because i just absolutely love it.\n(I'm listening to the ending credits song as i write this review!!!)\n\nCon\n\nThe game doesn't have much of a replaybility, I mean Bastion contains extra modes after the intial completion of the game isn't the type of game you can have 500 hours on....unless you enjoy the game that much but in hinde sight, it is a short game.\n\nAdditional Info\n\nThe game contains multiple endings. Basion contains about as many choices as the size of one grain of rice, but very powerful in game choices you, the player, have to make.\n\nIt is not a choice making game like Mass Effect, but I just needed to add that because I still to this day regret all the decisions this game forced me to make. It's a balance of depression and joy that the presence of the choices were involved.\n\nIn short, for any fan of an enticing, rich storyline with captivating scenery and ear endulging music, this game is a must have. Bastion is a definatly an 11/10 in my book and the music is a must have in your itunes library.","June 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where should I start? Well, this game is probably my new all-time favorite. It has secured a place in my heart and I look forward to playing other games from Supergiant Games in the near future.\nThis game has an absolutely beautiful story that engulfs the player in the environment in such a way that I have never before experienced. The set-up for the narration is incredible and makes you feel like you are sitting on the Bastion listening to Rucks tell the story of the Kid.\nThe music is amazing and captures the environment of the game in a way that I've only seen two other games do before in my life (MGS4, and Borderlands). I will admit, I am a bit biased on the music because I love indie music in general and I love a very acoustic sound, so this was already appealing, but then as the game progresses the music takes a diverse turn that is very rare in any mainstream media. Darren Korb's instrumentation is great and includes a wide variety of instruments, and the vocals are absolutely beautiful (Ashley Barrett, I'm looking at you!).\nThe art is breathtaking to say the least. The game almost looks like the player is playing in a stained glass mosaic piece and the animation is smooth and natural feeling. The modeling is also superb and does not at all feel clunky.\nLastly, the gameplay is just 100% phenomenal. As mentioned above, the game plays very smoothly and everything feels very natural. The difficulty is at a very good level, giving the player the option to "invoke the gods" which provides a more difficult challenge, and gives the player more "fragments" and experience to build their character. Bastion's wide variety of customization options makes the game perfectly tailored to the player and ensures that people of all ages and skill levels can enjoy it.\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely. And not just to people who like Action Role-Playing games, but to everyone who wants to play a game that is, in the most modest of terms, perfect. Bastion is everything a player could ever want in a game, and is a must-have for anybody who has the ability to play it.\n\n"Now The Kid sees somethin' stranger still; his mind races.

It really didn't feel bland at all. The game's simple, but very fun to play. Its good to get into if you don't want to learn a complex system or devote a bunch of time into going through an RPG. Its not a long game, but that doesn't make it lesser. There's some replayability to it with different modes too.\n\nBastion's strongest point is the story. Oh my God its so good! A bit depressing, but so strong. It had a great impact on me and is easily a game that will never be forgotten.\nI won't speak much on it. You have to play through it for yourself.\nAlso, the story is narrated. Its pretty neat and really sets the mood of the game. I couldn't imagine playing the game without the narration!\n\nThe art is gooorgeous. It has a very artsy look and is quite colourful. Its pleasing to look at. I liked it a lot.\n\nThe music is also excellent. Has an OST worth playing outside of the game. The style of music was pretty unique. Some really great tracks and its something I still listen to here and there.\n\nThere's a few different ways to play the game when it comes to controls. It all runs very well. No issues.\n\nBastion is just a total masterpiece. If you haven't played it you need to. Its one of those must-play indie titles that people will still be talking about years from now.

The last stage was a rollercoaster of feelings and morality in the best possible way. But I'm getting ahead of myself...\n\nThe gameplay? Simple enough. You take two weapons and use them to destroy things. Each weapon usually has a couple different things they can do, but you can use any combination of two, plus a "secret attack," which is a special move that is either related to one of your weapons or a special attack in itself. You also have access to a shield that can block or reflect attacks, and your character isn't half bad at dodge rolling either.\n\nAs for the story? Well, I'm sure everyone's heard of the fantastic narrator. You, as the Kid, are tasked with travelling about a world torn asunder by the Calamity and finding Cores to put into a monument in the middle of the Bastion. And for what? Hell, I'm not gonna tell you. Figure it out yourself, but be warned that the story is pretty damn feels inducing. Lots of tear jerkers, sad and glad alike.\n\nJust remember to keep moving forwards.

You're in a post-apocalyptic world, and all you have is the voice of a Stranger guiding your steps, to build a Bastion where all can be safe, all can be rebuilt, though your enemies won't see it that way. If you take advantage of all the game has to offer, you'll find that your skills have been challenged to the utmost and you are the better for it; and tears may come to your eyes when you make your final choice.","January 14","true","73.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I absolutely LOVE this game. It is one of my favorite indie games that I've ever played (though I do still have a lot left to get around to!).\n\nThe story of Bastion is definitely an interesting one, and the way you learn more of the details is relatively simple but intriguing. For instance, learning through the Dream levels turns out to be more fun than you would expect. The perspective of the characters shifts as the game goes on and it definitely has you wonder what is going on.\n\nI liked the frame of everything with the narration, but I don't want to spoil any of the story so I won't say any more. The graphics of the game are great; it is straight up beautiful to look at. Very nice sound all around, and I love the music it has. The actual vocal songs they created were amazing as well and fit the style of their scenes almost perfectly.\n\nGameplay-wise, Bastion still continues pulling things off. There are enough unique enemies and bosses in the game to keep things interesting, and the weapons available also allow for you to test out different builds. The development of the Bastion is nice, even if you end up building everything in one playthrough (meaning you can't necessarily make a "bad" choice of what to build). But it helps tie everything into the world as a whole. Each level has a unique feeling to it and definitely keeps me focused. The training grounds for the weapons give you some nice challenges to overcome, and all of them are certainly doable. The potions you can equip further your build for Kid.\n\nAll in all, Bastion is just an amazing game. It keeps you focused and interested, with next to nothing wrong with the game at all. I never got bored with it, and I never will. I have played it multiple times since it was released, and I am always excited to play it every time I return.","February 14","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll start with the graphics only because the style in which this world is built is breathtaking. The art direction is watercolours, and do they ever add a fluidity to the movements of The Kid, the silent protagonist of whom you are controlling in this adventure. The colours themselves either have an undeniable shine to them that gently turn into black and white as your health decreases. So does your vision, which I found to be a great mechanic to have.\n\nThe story is unique in where a narrator occassionally comments on your actions, while giving the player a sense of direction of where they are going and why. Honestly it's the only sense of direction you are likely to receive, given as to how each level is "summoned" step by step.\n\nA final word would be on the soundtrack.

Please.”\n\nBastion is one of the “big names” of the Indie scene. Although its reach has gone farther than most games made by small companies thanks to a partnership between Supergiant Games and Warner Brothers, Bastion still has the charm that only a small-time game can. From the graphics to the gameplay, the music to the narration, you know you’ve found something special from the moment the game begins.\nThe game follows the story of a boy known only as “the Kid” following a catastrophic event called the Calamity. With the world falling to pieces, it’s up to the Kid to collect cores to rebuild the bastion and restore life. An old man known as Rucks narrates the story as it plays out. Along the way, the Kid must fight off monsters, enemies, and even nature itself to retrieve the cores and save the bastion, with a few surprises along the way.\nArtistically, Bastion is a gem. Jen Zee’s artwork gives the world an organic, colorful feeling that constantly evolves around the player’s actions. The soundtrack, composed by Darren Korb, is as beautiful as it is fitting for the game’s story. With a very down-to-earth feel and haunting lyrics on a number of tracks, the soundtrack makes for good listening both in and out of the game. Better yet, it’s also available for purchase on the Steam marketplace.\nIn respects to gameplay, Bastion is a generally easy game. I had little difficulty making my way through on my first play-through, and never encountered a game over. That being said, the “Shrine” portion of the game allows players to raise the difficulty in exchange for more fragments (currency used for upgrades and purchases) and XP. With that in mind, the game can be made as easy or as difficult as the player would like, with the best benefits reserved for those who play the hardest.\nWhat Bastion is known for most of all is its narrator, Rucks, who narrates the game’s events as they play out. The old, weathered voice of the man gives a dimension to the game that few others can hold a flame to. His voice guides players through the plot at several key points, but is also free-flowing at other instances. Rucks might comment on the weapons the Kid uses, offer hints when needed, and even comment on little things such as falling off the stage. The story is framed as Zucks telling the story--to whom? That comes in time.\nBastion is a gem, and for good reasons. Its fascinating story is told through every medium--art, music, and plot--and culminates in one fantastic experience. If you have the opportunity to experience Bastion, do so.","December 6, 2013","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you have working hands: play this game."\n\nWhile 19 year-old Luke agrees, I feel as though there's more to say, since looking back at Bastion: it still feels like one of my most significant gaming experiences of ever.\n\nThat viewpoint is perhaps somewhat nostalgic; this was one of the first real PC games I played back when I was still primarily a console gamer. So I will look back on it with that same sense of importance as Assassin's Creed 2 or Uncharted 2, the first two PlayStation 3 games I played.\nNevertheless, there are elements of this game that make it recommendable to anyone, despite its personal significance to myself and the close friends who played and discussed it with me back then.\n\nFirstly, the narration is exquisite - and yes, past-luke, it does compare to Morgan Freeman. The narration really draws you into the world quite quickly, and although I don't have a vivid memory of the world that the game was set in, I do have a vivid memory of the (protagonist) kid's adventure through that world. The narration is your first contact with that world, right into the game's ending moments - which I won't spoil, but I will say that they are very well crafted from a storytelling perspective.\n\nSecondly, I said the game had challenging gameplay. I'm not sure why I said that really. I did die a few times, but that was just because I wasn't used to playing with a keyboard and mouse more than anything. As James (M!dD3) points out in his comment, the gameplay is straightforward and simple, with a wide array of weapons to choose from and experiment with. And for those who want more out of a game's challenge - there are indeed way to buff your enemies in the name of bragging rights.\n\nFor me though, the gameplay wasn't a prominent factor. More important was the music, the soundtrack is amazing and undefinable by common genres. I've heard it described as "acoustic frontier trip-hop", so....yeah. Lovely. I still listen to that soundtrack today, and everyone I've encouraged to listen to it has loved the sounds: from friends my age, to adults, to grandparents.\nHowever, a game's soundtrack isn't rated by the quality of the sounds alone; in-game that is an irrelevant quality. But the music fits the game perfectly. I can still recall the chilling hammer-on-stone clangs of "mine, windbag, mine' as I entered an eerie stage and began to learn more of the truth of the strange world. And don't even get me started on "build that wall" and "mother, I'm here" - or better yet, their lovechild: "setting sail, coming home", to this day one of my favourite songs.\n\nThe artstyle is equally captivating while in game, there's a certain childish element to the designs that mix with the seriousness of the plot - summing up the kid's overburdened mindset perfectly. There's a reason that kid looks so melancholy on the game's cover art.\nAnd I suppose that brings me to the final element that I mentioned, the game's "deep plot". Yes, well, that's one way to put it. Let me just say the decisions I made in that game hold true to the way I intend to continue to view my failures and embrace the future for the rest of my life. That is by no means an overstatement, or some pretentious interpretation of the game's plot. This game is simple and important, that's all there is to it.

Great story, good gameplay, terrific music and the best narrator ever.\n\nThe storyline is quite cool, with a little element of choose your own adventure at the end. I just wish they expanded on the world of Bastion a little more, maybe with a sequel, it's a very fascinating world.\n\nThe way the game progresses through the story is sort of simple compared to the extensive background of the Bastion. Most of the game is "Collect the core to build the Bastion. Oh no, Bastion broken, collect shards to rebuild. Not again, more shards please." The storyline is very linear and I feel that some other plot device could be used instead of cores and shards. The story was too formulaic because of this.\n\nThe soundtrack, the art, and the narrator are fantastic. Every level felt awe inspiring, each environment looked incredible and well designed. I really loved that Rucks was used to narrate everything, it was a neat twist to story-centric games, and with Logan Cunningham's voice I didn't mind at all.\n\nThe weapon system is very awesome and most of the weapons are mechanically very different, but there are some obviously underpowered and overpowered weapons (UP=Fang Repeater, OP=Galleon Mortar). Generally the weapons are mostly balanced sidegrades.\n\nThe passive upgrades via Spirits is quite unique. There is also a faulty power balance among spirits too: eg. Leechade should always be equipped regardless of build. There aren't enough spirits to make different builds viable except for a tanky build and a high risk high reward build, which are both outclassed by the all around build. In all fairness the game isn't deep enough to warrant more builds than those.\n\nI really enjoyed the difficulty of the game. It's a very easy game until the idols are all turned on, now the squirt mobs instakill you when they die with the dropped explosives on death, the spinning gasfellas permaslow to a quick death, and the Ura move at godlike speeds; the fundamentals of the enemies change quite a bit. Regen god + Damage block god + Invulnerability god challenges on vs a really tanky and high damage enemy such as Pyth is really stupid though, it almost forces you to use the Galleon Mortar or other high burst damage.\n\nDon't take my review the wrong way though, the criticisms I've made with this game are very minor, the game as a whole is amazing and worth every penny.","July 31, 2013","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Recently I was looking for something different to play so I thought I'd fire Bastion up again and give it a play through. I love this game.\n\nBastion is about a boy who "wakes up" in the middle of what the game calls the Calamity. Your story is narrated as you (this boy) progress through levels that build themselves around you. This should not be confused with procedurally generated levels, rather there's a hint of where a path should be and as you move, tiles form up around you. This is a pretty cool effect even if it's totally linnear.\n\nAs you progress the story deepens, you find new weapons, upgrades, secrets etc. to battle your way through the game's enemies with a goal of restoring the Bastion, the game's home point.\n\nI never found the combat to be particularly challenging, with enemies brodacatsting attacks well before they happen and picking up fairly predictable patterns to counter. Your weapons and skills are more than strong enough to handle everything the game throws at you. You will have the opportunity to make things harder on yourself as you complete more peices of the Bastion if you wish. Weapons can be upgraded at the Bastion's forge, adding extra damage, or critical chance etc. You'll also be able to switch out skills and buy power up type items to help you along. And at the end you'll get to unlock a new game plus mode which adds a little replayability.\n\nLevel design is pretty cool, as I mentioned above the world forms around you as you move along. Sometimes leading to dead ends, sometimes leading to secret areas containing upgrade materials, or new story items, even companion type characters. It's worth exploring every corner you can in these well built, beautifully rendered, but often very small areas.\n\nThe story itself is at first just a narration of what you do as the game's hero character, but soon enough you'll start to feel it coalescing into something bigger. As you play, the game's narrator continues to tell the stories of the boy and various survivors of the calamity. This takes place in the game itself along with aquiring items to learn about and that help tell the history of the Bastion and it's home world and the people who inhabit it. Once things begin to move the story progresses quickly and in my opinion is told pretty masterfully.\n\nNow, Ive heard of people complaining about the narration of the game. Saying that he's too involved, or too in your face. That he never shuts up and they just want to play the game. I'm sorry to say that you can't shut the narrator off for those of you who may find him annoying. But on the other hand, he's the one telling the story, and Bastion is a story driven game so you need the narrator. I personally loved listening to him, the voice is pleasant, smooth and to me at least was nothing close to invasive. The narrator is integral to the game's story being told so you'll just have to deal with it and even if you don't like listeing to him I'm sure as things go on you'll at least be interested in what he has to say. The story itself is emotial, fairly deep and told really really well.\n\nAs is usual these days the game is short, around 6 hours I think total with potential of a couple more if you complete the optional mini games. But the fact is the story is fully told in this time, so you get a feeling of completion even though you it's a short play through, and with new game plus you can double the play value and still have fun.\n\nBastion, also has an epic sound track. "Zia's song", and the end theme "Coming Home" are two that stick out in my head. I believe the game even comes with a copy of the sound track if I remember corrctly.\n\nIn conclusion, Bastion, is a beautiful, short, story driven game with an excellent story and great original music. It's inexpensive and worth a play through. Give it shot I'm sure you'll dig it.\n\n\n\n","July 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don Draper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWerepyreKing/","392 products in account","Quite an amazing indie title.\n[Scroll down for Intro, Pros, Cons, Pseudocons, and Conclusion]\nIntro:\nIts controls are simple and utilitarian, anyone could pick it up and have a good time. Sometimes it's bad if a game is too easy; but I've never once felt that Bastion was too easy.\nBastion is a piece of art which drops you (literally, often) into the middle of "The Calamity", which destroyed this town of yours, which you are completely unfamiliar with. The storyline is explained through narration. The narration, which reminds me a bit of Ron Perlman (Fallout narrator and actor), is extremely well done and the narrator himself is given his own characterization. Your own character never talks, but the narrator speaks through you, always in the past tense. When you do certain things, the narrator reacts. I chose a bone-repeater and a War Machete, and the narrator commented that weapons don't have to be complicated to be effective [along those lines, at least].\nThe upgrade system for weapons is based on levels which are increased by finding one material and spending some in-game currency; and with each level you can choose one of two traits and it is always available to change it back. The distillery allows you to keep two drinks, but since only beneficial drinks were able to be served in town (I like it when the devs describe game mechanics, even if it isn't perfect. It adds character to the town) you can choose perks from the drinks, including an increased crit rate at full health, more health, a larger radius to collect money, instant crits at very low health, and many more which I have forgotten or not unlocked.\nThe story keeps me intrigued, with this mysterious town, and my gradual learning of what happened. I am excited to play more.\n\nPros:\nNice artwork, simple fighting and controls, non-punishing mechanics, nice story, cool narrator. A nice variety of combat choices. It isn't ever edgy, inappropriate, or brutally violent for no reason. Kid friendly, but was designed for adults. Many challenges and upgrades to work for.\n\nCons: It's an easy game, which would bore me if it wasn't a good game.\n\nPseudocons [NOTE: These are cons which I included to warn those that may not like this particular developer's choice. I love Fallout 3, for instance, but some may hate that you can't earn every perk and get 100% in every skill] : A very basic level-up system, which has no real permanent choices. There is no real choice in the storyline, ie, it is linear. Most of the game is just mashing click to attack, right click to range-attack, shift to block/parry, and f to heal: potentially repetitive combat.\n\nConclusion: If you are new to Video Games, or if you are a veteran, you'd like it. Great gift for kids or your S.O.\n","January 9, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/recommended/107100/","RaefGall","RaefGall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaefGall/","298 products in account","I recently reviewed this game for my game review blog, Five Penny Review. If you enjoy this review, please visit my page:\nhttp://fivepennyreview.blogspot.com/2013/04/bastion.html\n\nWhat sets this game apart?\nConceptually, Bastion could be considered a fairly typical action RPG.  It features a silent protagonist, a small cast of enemies, a selection of weapons for which you develop new skills as you progress, and a combat system heavy on combos and dodge rolling.  What makes it unique is its presentation, and to say that Bastion is an artistic endeavor would be an understatement.  The art creates a world somewhere between catastrophe and storybook, the music has a multicultural feel that creates something familiar but foreign.  The only character to speak is the narrator, who is a constant presence in the game and provides information about the world, the characters, and your course of action, serving as both storyteller and tutorial.  The way this was accomplished creates an experience that envelops you in what would otherwise be a decent game.\n\nWhat is the difficulty factor?\nThe tutorials for Bastion are pretty straight forward, and the controls are fairly simple to pick up and play.  The narrator also does a good job providing little hints for moving forward, especially early in the game.  The timing for dodge rolling, blocking with your shield, and even just attacking can take some time to master and feel a bit clumsy, especially given the differences in the available weapons.  The weapon proving grounds provide a good method for mastering the techniques for various weapons.\n\nAs far as the challenge curve goes, Bastion does a great job of starting off easy and escalating slowly to a proper difficulty.  The proving grounds and dream sequences allow you to build up your level and money, often while earning new techniques.  If you aren’t feeling challenged, the shrine allows you to drastically increase the difficulty of specific aspects of the game to increase your rewards, allowing you to customize the difficulty of the game in a unique way.\n\nDoes it use media effectively?\nBastion has a very stylized appearance that gives it a persistent otherworldly feeling, like you are experiencing a dream or watching the illustrations of a story book.  The enemies and foreground objects are often strange and brightly colored, the world itself is made up of chunks of ground floating in mid-air that form as you progress, and the backgrounds consist of little more than gradient colors and clouds.  The culmination of this look is a sense of nihilistic beauty, which seems appropriate in drawing the audience in to the story of the survivors of a world shattering apocalypse.\n\nThe music in Bastion is a bit hard to describe, both because of its occasional strangeness and the obvious scope of its influences.  At its core there is often a folksy acoustic guitar, but many of the tracks feature distinctly eastern sounds as well.  The lyrics are simple and poignant, and the vocal tracks have a haunting beauty to them.  Ultimately, the music has the same effect as the visuals, to draw you in to a place that is both alien and beautiful, and reminding you of what has been lost to the world you explore.\n\nBest moment in the game?\nWhile not a specific moment, the best thing about this game to me was Rucks, the narrator.  Voice actor Logan Cunningham did a great job creating a character that sounded familiar and warm, further connecting you to what could otherwise be a somewhat alien world.  Rucks serves as a storyteller and historian for the viewer as the game progresses, serving as the medium for each major plot point in the game, and telling you about the history of places, events, and character as they become relevant to the story.  In addition, he provides commentary as you move through each level.  There is something shocking about the first time you hear Rucks provide commentary on what is happening in the course of a battle, something that seems like it could not be scripted, but obviously must be.\n\nWho needs to play this game?\nOnce again, I would encourage all brands of gamer to check out this game.  Bastion uses great art, music, and storytelling to create an environment that you can be drawn into.  The action may not always be on par with some modern titles and parts of the game may not feel especially challenging, but the gameplay is always fun and the sliding difficulty scale will help keep you under pressure.  Bastion is available to purchase and download on the X-Box Live Arcade and on Steam.","November 28, 2013","true","45.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game starts you off with little direction but the narrator's voice as you get used to the controls, combat system, level flow, and most importantly the signature level design.  Every environment is Bastion "builds" itself from the ground up around you creating a very unique take on the "fog of war" style exploration you commonly see in strategy games.  Story-wise all of this is the result of some far-flung calamity that literally destroyed a good chunk of the world.  This puts the story's focus half on keeping up the progress of the Bastion's buildings and exploration of what's left around you.\n\nThe graphics are wonderfully rendered and everything looks like a mix of semi-realistic 3D and hand-drawn sprites similar to a sort of top-down version of Braid.  Despite the bleak undertones, the colors are vibrant even in the darker levels and every place feels both desolate yet full of life as you see what's become of the world around you.  All of these are explored via your home base- the titular Bastion which acts both as a hub for missions, power ups, weapons, and side-quests, but also serves to both tell and fill in the holes of the story you missed through the narration that goes on throughout the levels.\n\nThere are only four named characters in the game counting the protagonist, but all of them are surprisingly well-developed for how little any of them actually speak.  All of them have special reactions to pretty much everything you bring back with you on each trip and each has a backstory to explore through special bonus levels.  While interaction with them is minimalistic at best, you really grow to know who they are and care about their well being just as much as in games where you spend most of the story talking to them, which is quite the accomplishment on part of the frankly stellar narration.\n\nFor how much of the game you're going to spend in combat, it sometimes feels like it takes a back seat to everything going on around you.  However, you'll never get distracted from it and each of the game's unique weapons has its own bonuses and downsides making no combination (you can take two with you, plus one special move of your choice) a bad call.  It really calls to create your own fighting style and do what suits you best.  Due to how you can upgrade any weapons in a variety of ways, there's really no wrong way to go into battle and it's always fun.  What makes things more interesting is that depending on what weapons you pick, how you choose to go about a level, and even how well you're doing or whether you decide to simply derp about, the narrator has a response to pretty much EVERYTHING you do, which adds a bit of flavor and life to the game that feels a lot more like you're actually being watched and having your story told.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is just as varied as everything else in it and always manages to hit the perfect mood, particularly with the wonderfully done vocal songs.  Many levels or situations have their own music and no two songs really feel the same or reused whenever they appear.\n\nOverall Bastion is a wonderful experience that takes roughly seven to ten hours to complete in one playthrough.  It's not a long game, but at the same time it's not any longer or shorter than it needs to be.  But you'll be thankful for that because it means you can easily play it again.  If you ever see it appear in sales or the Humble Bundle as it's often wont to, I highly suggest picking it up if it even sounds remotely interesting to you.","September 10, 2014","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Just about recently, gamers are regularly met with a surfeit of these indie games that have a history of HYPE. Too bad most of them turn out to be vaporware or pretentious garbage. But there is that minute gleam of light that promises quality. Supergiant Games, thankfully, ends up being one of the few that actually develop decent games. Bastion, the game in question, is not one that should be adjudged "decent", but rather, astounding. Far from flawless, as this game is locked at 30 frames (Just, why?), but an overall stellar game that is worth every penny, or whatever crap currency you wield.\n\nMeet the Kid. One of the handful of survivors that has endured the Calamity. This catastrophic event brought the whole world to ruin. He sets off to the Bastion, where he is greeted by Rucks, the Stranger, with words claiming that the recent disaster can be undone. By constructing the Bastion back to health with monument cores and shards there are odds of restoring Caelondia and its neighbor lands to a time before hell unleashed, hence the title of this game. Throughout the Kid's travels to seek out the materials needed, players will learn more about the world and its people and you get to learn the backstories of the few survivors you come across as the game progresses. It might seem engrossing, but the story is where Bastion falls shortest. The journey with the Kid was complete in every angle it is viewed in, but it was also rushed from start to end, and had inadequate time to develop. Build-up starts to occur profusely around the last third of the game, only to conclude in some half-baked ending that proved to be unfufilling. Despite the mediocre narrative, Bastion is a feast for the eyes and ears due to it's gorgeous presentation.\n\nIt is not an overstatement when it is said that this game has the potential to be sold solely on it's presentation. Hell, some have avowed that they bought the soundtrack before the damn game. It's just that damn delicious. Bastion's visuals is where that abstract tag comes into play, because it is most certainly what most reckon to be unconventional. The playing stage constructs itself as you tread along the path and the camera is complimented by a shiny filter, and other things I won't bother typing as it's better experienced than read. The soundtrack, done by composer Darren Korb, is brimful with impressive songs that seemlessly attach to the rest of the presentation. I'm not one that gushes over video game OSTs, but this one is pretty damn good, and I'm convinced everyone that isn't a ♥♥♥♥♥ agrees.\n\nIf only it wasn't locked at thirty frames...that idea bothers me way to f****** much.\n\nEven with such wondrous superficial values, a game is crap if it isn't fun, and it is relieving to know that Bastion succeeds in this fundamental aspect too. Not much can be said about it however, it's just the average action-adventure game with a few tweaks that enable it to distinguish itself from the rest. The Kid can be equipped with 2 weapons at once and he has a "secret" move, and by, of course, playing the game (no way), the Kid is met with unlocks in his arsenal and attributes that gradually form him to an impetus of destruction by the end of the game. Sounds a little, unamusing, but this is without the mention of the copious ways one can up their game. The game played vanilla is laughably easy, but there are shrine idols that can unexpectedly rise its difficulty, which is recommended. There are also Vigils to complete for moneys, and wave-based side missions to earn more moneys and achievements, and a New Game Plus option that actually bears fruit! All of this will keep many entertained for a appreciable amount of time, around 20 hours or so maximum.\n\nThere's more to be said, but I'm done. Bastion is a worthwhile game that I'm sure many have already invested their time in, and I hope people continue to pick this up. Supergiant Games is a talented developer, and they only demonstrate so with this installation. Where it fails in storytelling makes up in well-done game-structure and incredible graphics and sound. I'm looking foward to playing more entries from this group.\n\nStill haven't played Transistor at the time of this review, so I need to get to that quick.","February 15, 2015","true","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don Draper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWerepyreKing/","392 products in account","Quite an amazing indie title.\n[Scroll down for Intro, Pros, Cons, Pseudocons, and Conclusion]\nIntro:\nIts controls are simple and utilitarian, anyone could pick it up and have a good time. Sometimes it's bad if a game is too easy; but I've never once felt that Bastion was too easy.\nBastion is a piece of art which drops you (literally, often) into the middle of "The Calamity", which destroyed this town of yours, which you are completely unfamiliar with. The storyline is explained through narration. The narration, which reminds me a bit of Ron Perlman (Fallout narrator and actor), is extremely well done and the narrator himself is given his own characterization. Your own character never talks, but the narrator speaks through you, always in the past tense. When you do certain things, the narrator reacts. I chose a bone-repeater and a War Machete, and the narrator commented that weapons don't have to be complicated to be effective [along those lines, at least].\nThe upgrade system for weapons is based on levels which are increased by finding one material and spending some in-game currency; and with each level you can choose one of two traits and it is always available to change it back. The distillery allows you to keep two drinks, but since only beneficial drinks were able to be served in town (I like it when the devs describe game mechanics, even if it isn't perfect. It adds character to the town) you can choose perks from the drinks, including an increased crit rate at full health, more health, a larger radius to collect money, instant crits at very low health, and many more which I have forgotten or not unlocked.\nThe story keeps me intrigued, with this mysterious town, and my gradual learning of what happened. I am excited to play more.\n\nPros:\nNice artwork, simple fighting and controls, non-punishing mechanics, nice story, cool narrator. A nice variety of combat choices. It isn't ever edgy, inappropriate, or brutally violent for no reason. Kid friendly, but was designed for adults. Many challenges and upgrades to work for.\n\nCons: It's an easy game, which would bore me if it wasn't a good game.\n\nPseudocons [NOTE: These are cons which I included to warn those that may not like this particular developer's choice. I love Fallout 3, for instance, but some may hate that you can't earn every perk and get 100% in every skill] : A very basic level-up system, which has no real permanent choices. There is no real choice in the storyline, ie, it is linear. Most of the game is just mashing click to attack, right click to range-attack, shift to block/parry, and f to heal: potentially repetitive combat.\n\nConclusion: If you are new to Video Games, or if you are a veteran, you'd like it. Great gift for kids or your S.O.\n","January 9, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great story, good gameplay, terrific music and the best narrator ever.\n\nThe storyline is quite cool, with a little element of choose your own adventure at the end. I just wish they expanded on the world of Bastion a little more, maybe with a sequel, it's a very fascinating world.\n\nThe way the game progresses through the story is sort of simple compared to the extensive background of the Bastion. Most of the game is "Collect the core to build the Bastion. Oh no, Bastion broken, collect shards to rebuild. Not again, more shards please." The storyline is very linear and I feel that some other plot device could be used instead of cores and shards. The story was too formulaic because of this.\n\nThe soundtrack, the art, and the narrator are fantastic. Every level felt awe inspiring, each environment looked incredible and well designed. I really loved that Rucks was used to narrate everything, it was a neat twist to story-centric games, and with Logan Cunningham's voice I didn't mind at all.\n\nThe weapon system is very awesome and most of the weapons are mechanically very different, but there are some obviously underpowered and overpowered weapons (UP=Fang Repeater, OP=Galleon Mortar). Generally the weapons are mostly balanced sidegrades.\n\nThe passive upgrades via Spirits is quite unique. There is also a faulty power balance among spirits too: eg. Leechade should always be equipped regardless of build. There aren't enough spirits to make different builds viable except for a tanky build and a high risk high reward build, which are both outclassed by the all around build. In all fairness the game isn't deep enough to warrant more builds than those.\n\nI really enjoyed the difficulty of the game. It's a very easy game until the idols are all turned on, now the squirt mobs instakill you when they die with the dropped explosives on death, the spinning gasfellas permaslow to a quick death, and the Ura move at godlike speeds; the fundamentals of the enemies change quite a bit. Regen god + Damage block god + Invulnerability god challenges on vs a really tanky and high damage enemy such as Pyth is really stupid though, it almost forces you to use the Galleon Mortar or other high burst damage.\n\nDon't take my review the wrong way though, the criticisms I've made with this game are very minor, the game as a whole is amazing and worth every penny.","July 31, 2013","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ain't so simple with this one\n\nGet Bastion. Really. A discount means it's a steal for you\n\nI'm just fooling\n\nBastion is an adventure beat-em-up game with unique artstyle, superb storytelling, hypnotizing music, and a meta-ish thingy in the plotline.\nBastion graphical representation used a lot of handpainted scenery, resulting in a beautiful and easy-in-the-eye kind of graphics, you won't find many game that uses this kind (well, aside from other game from Supergiant, Transistor). It'll be a different 'graphics' experience for you with Bastion\n\nThe story in this game are told with a narrator as the player progresses through the Bastion world. The character player control is silent (and looks like the main character communicate with other using handwriting, as hinted by all the dialogue choices when interacting with others), and all element about Bastion are told by the narrator. The narrator did a really excellent job at delivering the world of Bastion to the player. His voice feels friendly, like someone you've known for so long, yet only meet again after a long separation. You won't feel tired listening to the narrator thoughout the game, and it is also a good thing because the way of the storytelling is unique, leaving you with a feeling of wanting to be told more.\n\nMusic at the bastion is a little different with other games that usually use orchestra of violin, drum, piano or everything else. It sound like 1 or 2 instrument that playing along with a storyteller, and perfectly captures the predicament of the story being told. This fits a lot with the storytelling style of Bastion.\n\nNot much of gameplay selling point can be told here. Some people might feels the combat is repetitive, and old as there's no differentiation to other game with same type of combat. That might be true, but I find Bastion combat is at good value. The many Arsenal you'll find coupled with passive boost from Distillery and difficulty tweaker from the Shrine will kinda force you to seek new way to combat the enemy and it's good enough for me.\n\nThe meta things of Bastion plot is *SPOILER AHEAD  you're supposed to choose a peculiar ending in order for your first playthrough to match with the new game +, the Restoration Protocol. Because the narrator will have some kind of deja vu telling throughout the whole new game + narration, it fits the ending. Also it can be interpreted that as the player, you are the Kid's will that never forget even after time reset itself, the Kid at first want to restore the world before the Calamity happen, but as the player see that restoring the world doesn't prevent the Calamity, on the second playthrough, you know that the correct choice is Evacuation Protocol, thus setting sail for a new home is kinda the right /good ending of Bastion. Bastion is game where a second playthrough is needed to close a loophole that might be caused by 1 ending. And it's spectacular for a game this small to have this kind of meta story.\nThe whole narration or the story is actually Ruck telling the story to Zia about how they all come together, while waiting for the Kid to return from the Tazal Terminal at the last level, so you are playing a memory of Ruck, and the only real time moment Ruck's narrating is when we save/leave Zulf and afterward.\nAlso, dramatic moment when you decide to rescue Zulf. The music is plain tearjerker, the tension of the situation feels heroic and out of respect, you'll struck in awe playing that part.\n\nIt's finished...\nNo matter what you decide to buy Bastion or not, you done good...\nThe Bastion's gonna take us to a better gametime\nSo long kid, Maybe I'll see you in the next one\n*cue Setting Sail, Coming Home music (youtube it!)","April 17, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was pretty skeptical of all the hype and glowing praise this game has received, but never one to judge unfairly, I picked this up on sale for about $5.\n\nBastion is good. It is very good. I don't think it's the greatest indie game to have been made, but I can certainly see why people like it so much.\n\nAt its heart, Bastion is an isometric hack'n'slash with small elements of dungeon grinding. You have a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, and a special attack. That's it. You can guard and evade roll, but you essentially only have three attacks the whole game. To make this simple formual work you are granted nearly ten different weapons to choose from, all upgradable, and all of which have their own unique special attacks. Further expanding on the simple gameplay is the ability to equip various drinks to give yourself buffs (i.e. extra damage, extra health, etc.)\n\nThe game is balanced pretty well. I'm a vet myself, so I didn't have too much of an issue playing through this. There were a few hairy moments here and there, but ultimately Bastion isn't too hard. Unless you want it to be. In which case you can invoke the power of the gods, thus augmenting the enemy builds. While you can make them faster, more agressive, and sturdier, you also get an EXP and money boost for your trouble. Very well balanced.\n\nSo the controls are tight, the gameplay is good, so how about the story? I won't give anything away, but it worked. Nothing too crazy, but it held my attention and inspired me to push on. The story itself might be simple, but the biggest draw of the game is the narrator. This was one of the biggest things I heard about this game: the narrator. All I'll say is: play it and find out on your own. It's pretty cool.\n\nWhile only clocking in at about 6 hours, Bastion manages to give an engrossing and surprisingly deep gameplay experience. Between listening to the narrator and watching the hand drawn world literally fall into place with your every step, Bastion manages to combine tight action gameplay with a unique art driven narrative.\n\nGo buy it.","December 3, 2015","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great story, good gameplay, terrific music and the best narrator ever.\n\nThe storyline is quite cool, with a little element of choose your own adventure at the end. I just wish they expanded on the world of Bastion a little more, maybe with a sequel, it's a very fascinating world.\n\nThe way the game progresses through the story is sort of simple compared to the extensive background of the Bastion. Most of the game is "Collect the core to build the Bastion. Oh no, Bastion broken, collect shards to rebuild. Not again, more shards please." The storyline is very linear and I feel that some other plot device could be used instead of cores and shards. The story was too formulaic because of this.\n\nThe soundtrack, the art, and the narrator are fantastic. Every level felt awe inspiring, each environment looked incredible and well designed. I really loved that Rucks was used to narrate everything, it was a neat twist to story-centric games, and with Logan Cunningham's voice I didn't mind at all.\n\nThe weapon system is very awesome and most of the weapons are mechanically very different, but there are some obviously underpowered and overpowered weapons (UP=Fang Repeater, OP=Galleon Mortar). Generally the weapons are mostly balanced sidegrades.\n\nThe passive upgrades via Spirits is quite unique. There is also a faulty power balance among spirits too: eg. Leechade should always be equipped regardless of build. There aren't enough spirits to make different builds viable except for a tanky build and a high risk high reward build, which are both outclassed by the all around build. In all fairness the game isn't deep enough to warrant more builds than those.\n\nI really enjoyed the difficulty of the game. It's a very easy game until the idols are all turned on, now the squirt mobs instakill you when they die with the dropped explosives on death, the spinning gasfellas permaslow to a quick death, and the Ura move at godlike speeds; the fundamentals of the enemies change quite a bit. Regen god + Damage block god + Invulnerability god challenges on vs a really tanky and high damage enemy such as Pyth is really stupid though, it almost forces you to use the Galleon Mortar or other high burst damage.\n\nDon't take my review the wrong way though, the criticisms I've made with this game are very minor, the game as a whole is amazing and worth every penny.","July 31, 2013","true","36.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Recently I was looking for something different to play so I thought I'd fire Bastion up again and give it a play through. I love this game.\n\nBastion is about a boy who "wakes up" in the middle of what the game calls the Calamity. Your story is narrated as you (this boy) progress through levels that build themselves around you. This should not be confused with procedurally generated levels, rather there's a hint of where a path should be and as you move, tiles form up around you. This is a pretty cool effect even if it's totally linnear.\n\nAs you progress the story deepens, you find new weapons, upgrades, secrets etc. to battle your way through the game's enemies with a goal of restoring the Bastion, the game's home point.\n\nI never found the combat to be particularly challenging, with enemies brodacatsting attacks well before they happen and picking up fairly predictable patterns to counter. Your weapons and skills are more than strong enough to handle everything the game throws at you. You will have the opportunity to make things harder on yourself as you complete more peices of the Bastion if you wish. Weapons can be upgraded at the Bastion's forge, adding extra damage, or critical chance etc. You'll also be able to switch out skills and buy power up type items to help you along. And at the end you'll get to unlock a new game plus mode which adds a little replayability.\n\nLevel design is pretty cool, as I mentioned above the world forms around you as you move along. Sometimes leading to dead ends, sometimes leading to secret areas containing upgrade materials, or new story items, even companion type characters. It's worth exploring every corner you can in these well built, beautifully rendered, but often very small areas.\n\nThe story itself is at first just a narration of what you do as the game's hero character, but soon enough you'll start to feel it coalescing into something bigger. As you play, the game's narrator continues to tell the stories of the boy and various survivors of the calamity. This takes place in the game itself along with aquiring items to learn about and that help tell the history of the Bastion and it's home world and the people who inhabit it. Once things begin to move the story progresses quickly and in my opinion is told pretty masterfully.\n\nNow, Ive heard of people complaining about the narration of the game. Saying that he's too involved, or too in your face. That he never shuts up and they just want to play the game. I'm sorry to say that you can't shut the narrator off for those of you who may find him annoying. But on the other hand, he's the one telling the story, and Bastion is a story driven game so you need the narrator. I personally loved listening to him, the voice is pleasant, smooth and to me at least was nothing close to invasive. The narrator is integral to the game's story being told so you'll just have to deal with it and even if you don't like listeing to him I'm sure as things go on you'll at least be interested in what he has to say. The story itself is emotial, fairly deep and told really really well.\n\nAs is usual these days the game is short, around 6 hours I think total with potential of a couple more if you complete the optional mini games. But the fact is the story is fully told in this time, so you get a feeling of completion even though you it's a short play through, and with new game plus you can double the play value and still have fun.\n\nBastion, also has an epic sound track. "Zia's song", and the end theme "Coming Home" are two that stick out in my head. I believe the game even comes with a copy of the sound track if I remember corrctly.\n\nIn conclusion, Bastion, is a beautiful, short, story driven game with an excellent story and great original music. It's inexpensive and worth a play through. Give it shot I'm sure you'll dig it.\n\n\n\n","July 24, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I absolutely LOVE this game. It is one of my favorite indie games that I've ever played (though I do still have a lot left to get around to!).\n\nThe story of Bastion is definitely an interesting one, and the way you learn more of the details is relatively simple but intriguing. For instance, learning through the Dream levels turns out to be more fun than you would expect. The perspective of the characters shifts as the game goes on and it definitely has you wonder what is going on.\n\nI liked the frame of everything with the narration, but I don't want to spoil any of the story so I won't say any more. The graphics of the game are great; it is straight up beautiful to look at. Very nice sound all around, and I love the music it has. The actual vocal songs they created were amazing as well and fit the style of their scenes almost perfectly.\n\nGameplay-wise, Bastion still continues pulling things off. There are enough unique enemies and bosses in the game to keep things interesting, and the weapons available also allow for you to test out different builds. The development of the Bastion is nice, even if you end up building everything in one playthrough (meaning you can't necessarily make a "bad" choice of what to build). But it helps tie everything into the world as a whole. Each level has a unique feeling to it and definitely keeps me focused. The training grounds for the weapons give you some nice challenges to overcome, and all of them are certainly doable. The potions you can equip further your build for Kid.\n\nAll in all, Bastion is just an amazing game. It keeps you focused and interested, with next to nothing wrong with the game at all. I never got bored with it, and I never will. I have played it multiple times since it was released, and I am always excited to play it every time I return.","February 14","true","13.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

WHY DIDN'T I PLAY IT UNTIL NOW??? IT'S SO MUCH FUN!!!\n\nWow. I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a long time. The story is great, the visuals are beautiful and colorful. The whole atmosphere is really lovely. The music is so good and it is fluid in that you can flow from one mood to another easily when the narration changes, you enter a specific area on the map, etc.\n\nBut what really keeps me coming back is the combat. I don't usually love hack'n'slash, but these weapons & abilities are SO much fun to use. I love all of them, too bad you can only use two at a time. The option of using spirits and idols to make the combat easier/harder depending on different variables you can choose to control is just brilliant. And the eventual upgrades you get, are awesome.\n\nThe (increasingly difficult) maps & monsters are all introduced at a good, flowing pace, and in the end are all super fun to fight. I'm probably going to keep playing and toy with the difficulty and different weapon combinations for a while, even after I've beat New Game Plus.\n\nI was very motivated by the narrator and other rewarding, and interesting parts of the game to keep on playing and complete the story. Too often I don't finish games, but the Bastion called my name every hour of the day since I began playing.\n\nEven after you've completed the story there's still more stuff that you can do. Or, rather you can do other fun things while taking your time with the story. It's cool. The currency, and the rate at which it is acquired, is really in sync with natural progression. Everything about this game is just, "in sync". It flows. It makes sense. Nothing worried me about it. It is most excellently designed.\n\nWhoever came up with the idea to introduce New Game Plus after you've beat it the first time, knew how important that feature would be for people like me who couldn't get enough and wanted to keep playing.\n\nSo, you should get this game. It's really perfect, especially if you like rpg's, this is a special one. There's really no way you wouldn't enjoy it, unless you have real poor coordination and fall off the map all the time (but this is just another fun thing about it).\n\nAlso. Most of the world is destructible so that's fun (it's so pretty though, why would you want to do that? Maybe to make more room for fighting monsters, or getting past obstacles...) So much fun.

That's the central point of the game, to get the Bastion back in working order, gathering shards and minerals to fix the Bastion.\n\nAlong the journey, the old man, Rucks, narrates every move you make which might sound annoying but was actually intuitive because of all the context he is able to give. Later on in the game, you figure out that he's narrating to one of the Ura, a girl named Zia who comes to the Bastion after meeting the kid.\n\nI can't say much about the gameplay, as it's rather repetitive, shooting down enemies, blocking, and hacking, no depth to it. But the options you get in weaponry and special abilities and the leveling up make up for it. The game's design is isometric but also 2D, kind of cel shaded. And the floating islands which are part of the world was an interesting way to represent how society has turned out.\n\nVery good game though, with heavy depth in narrative.\n\n9.1/10","September 16, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay and combat is fairly straightforward, but the combinations of two weapons and a single skill can allow for many styles of play, and the lack of straight upgrades adds to this dynamic as well. Additionally, the system of leveling up was unique and further added to the styles of play, and the difficulty of the game scales well, with additional options to offer a greater challenge. Regardless of the engaging gameplay, Bastion excelled in its storytelling. Told through amazing narration, you experience the story of the world of the Bastion. The environment is defined by the artstyle and the soundtrack (which is definitely worth a listen). What stood out most to me concerning the story, however, was its ability to invoke an emotional response from me. As someone who usually plays games for just their gameplay, the whole story (and particularly the conclusion) I was surprised at how much I actually cared about the kid and the characters he meets.\n\nOverall, Bastion is definitely worth a purchase. Decent gameplay in an amazing environment with an engaging story made for a great game.","January 5, 2014","true","11.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

To die—to sleep,\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;\nTo sleep, perchance to dream—aye, there's the rub:\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause—there's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nTh'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\nThe pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\nThat patient merit of th'unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\nAnd lose the name of action.\n-Shakespeare\n\nBastion, a game that resonates so deeply with these timeless lines, puts you in the shoes of the voiceless Kid. The Dreamer, flung into this world torn apart by calamity. Your only companion an heirloom of a long lost love; it’s all you can hold on to as you seek a haven in this hellish -yet beautiful- landscape. All you can do is move forward, and hope.\n\n"Proper story's suppose to start at the beginning’. Ain't so simple with this one.”\nPerhaps the greatest strength of Bastion is its fantastic narration. The voice of the only survivor -and guide- in Caelondia, that follows your every step. The voice of Logan Cunningham is so deep, raw and powerful. It commands your attention as you explore, and battle the bygones of the Calamity.\n\nThat said, the narration is not the only factor that draws you in –it’s the beautifully designed landscapes, the unique art style, the vibrant and lush backdrops.  The expertly crafted soundtrack fills the air with melancholy, and the overwhelming feeling of loneliness. Though I felt “sad” reliving the loss and longing of the Kid, I felt joy and satisfaction also.\n\nAt its core, Bastion is a story-driven action role-playing game. The game does not heavily indulge in its role-playing elements, nor does it focus on being more action oriented. Everything is done just “right” for the type of game Bastion is. The main setback to this being a shorter lifespan. To counteract this, you have the option of attempting horde-type levels. These fully narrated “dreams” allow you to fight waves after waves of enemies, while still remaining relevant to the game. To up the difficulty, you have the option of Shrines, each with their own interesting backstory. Shrines spice up the difficulty by either strengthening the enemy or by weakening the Kid. And when you complete the story, and find yourself itching for more, you can try out the new game+, or Score Attack modes.\n\nWhile cataclysmic Caelondia, has no shortage of monsters that want you dead, the real beasts are the weapons found throughout your journey. Individually unique, and satisfying in equal measures. When you unlock a weapon, you are presented with challenge levels –Proving Grounds- that will test your mettle and skill, and if completed, reward you with certain valuables.\n\nCaelondia is a mysterious and intriguing world, but one that feels familiar as if it was set on our own, on a different timeline. There will be plenty of riveting moments as the story unfolds.\n\nA short game. But a gem, nonetheless.\n","November 14, 2015","true","41.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

The narrator's voice-overs and explanations for things are flawless and quirky, and make you want to hear more. The gameplay is great fun the combat, starting simple, becomes increasingly fast-paced and skill-based, especially when all idols are enabled for full difficulty. As you progress through the mysterious-yet-lore-heavy storyline, more weapons are unlocked, allowing you to play using different styles. You can eventually customize a "build" (a weapon loadout and some bonuses, called spirits). And the gameplay doesn't get old. Many games turn into grinding for levels, but Bastion encourages to play just to play.

The visuals are incredibly appealing vibrant, fitting colours, detailed artwork. The western-theme nicely by the western music, which is very fitting on the game as a whole. The narrator's voice-overs and explanations for things are flawless and quirky, and make you want to hear more. The gameplay is great fun the combat, starting simple, becomes increasingly fast-paced and skill-based, especially when all idols are enabled for full difficulty. As you progress through the mysterious-yet-lore-heavy storyline, more weapons are unlocked, allowing you to play using different styles. You can eventually customize a "build" (a weapon loadout and some bonuses, called spirits). And the gameplay doesn't get old. Many games turn into grinding for levels, but Bastion encourages to play just to play. I am playing through the main storyline for the third time now, having already beaten it once in its regular story and difficulty, and another time in New Game with all idols activated. Replay-ability is very high, and I still have not grown bored of it.","November 24, 2013","true","35.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/4wkn/recommended/107100/","4wkn","Lord Admiral Night Hawke|UK|","http://steamcommunity.com/id/4wkn/","289 products in account","To Bastion, or not to Bastion, that is the question:\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\nAnd by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;\nTo sleep, perchance to dream—aye, there's the rub:\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause—there's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nTh'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\nThe pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\nThat patient merit of th'unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pitch and moment\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\nAnd lose the name of action.\n-Shakespeare\n\nBastion, a game that resonates so deeply with these timeless lines, puts you in the shoes of the voiceless Kid. The Dreamer, flung into this world torn apart by calamity. Your only companion an heirloom of a long lost love; it’s all you can hold on to as you seek a haven in this hellish -yet beautiful- landscape. All you can do is move forward, and hope.\n\n"Proper story's suppose to start at the beginning’. Ain't so simple with this one.”\nPerhaps the greatest strength of Bastion is its fantastic narration. The voice of the only survivor -and guide- in Caelondia, that follows your every step. The voice of Logan Cunningham is so deep, raw and powerful. It commands your attention as you explore, and battle the bygones of the Calamity.\n\nThat said, the narration is not the only factor that draws you in –it’s the beautifully designed landscapes, the unique art style, the vibrant and lush backdrops.  The expertly crafted soundtrack fills the air with melancholy, and the overwhelming feeling of loneliness. Though I felt “sad” reliving the loss and longing of the Kid, I felt joy and satisfaction also.\n\nAt its core, Bastion is a story-driven action role-playing game. The game does not heavily indulge in its role-playing elements, nor does it focus on being more action oriented. Everything is done just “right” for the type of game Bastion is. The main setback to this being a shorter lifespan. To counteract this, you have the option of attempting horde-type levels. These fully narrated “dreams” allow you to fight waves after waves of enemies, while still remaining relevant to the game. To up the difficulty, you have the option of Shrines, each with their own interesting backstory. Shrines spice up the difficulty by either strengthening the enemy or by weakening the Kid. And when you complete the story, and find yourself itching for more, you can try out the new game+, or Score Attack modes.\n\nWhile cataclysmic Caelondia, has no shortage of monsters that want you dead, the real beasts are the weapons found throughout your journey. Individually unique, and satisfying in equal measures. When you unlock a weapon, you are presented with challenge levels –Proving Grounds- that will test your mettle and skill, and if completed, reward you with certain valuables.\n\nCaelondia is a mysterious and intriguing world, but one that feels familiar as if it was set on our own, on a different timeline. There will be plenty of riveting moments as the story unfolds.\n\nA short game. But a gem, nonetheless.\n","November 14, 2015","true","41.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

With that said I took this game pretty slowly and I still beat it in 8 hours, Just keep that in mind.\nLet me just start off by saying this game is a work of Art, A Masterpiece. This game honestly shocked me, Before I knew who supergiant was, I went into this game thinking it was just some average indie game with little story. I thought that  you would just be  going from zone to zone grabbing these crystal shards until you finish the crystal. But slowly you start to realize it is not just that, you start to notice it is more complicated than that and encounter new characters and Items. As you get further and further into the game,the story starts getting thicker and thicker. The narrator (Who is absolutely fantastic by the way) Is pretty much telling someone the story of what you are doing in that moment and this mechanic is what helps guide you through some parts that you may not have figured out.\nAs you progress you get these items which you use at the Bastion to upgrade the weapons which adds some variation is play styles.\nMy only complaint is that the OPTIONAL dream levels took so long and there was no checkpoints so if you died on the last wave you would have to restart and redo the last 20 minutes over again.\n9/10, excited to move on and play transistor finally!!","May 7","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Many games force you to sit through cut scenes or read massive amounts of text.  But the narration allows you to play without disturbances, and as it is sometimes subject to what you do in the game, it adds a level of humor.

After a hard time during the level due to the new weapon, you probably won't take it out for another spin.  This creates a bias for the starting weapons unless you really like to experiment.","December 17, 2014","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some upgrade path are not always straight damage/resistance increases or instead requires specific conditions which in my humble opinion makes the game more interesting.\n\nMy only regret would be that there is an optional built-in autoaim which is almost required for some challenges (at least it sure feels like it was balanced for players to use it and abuse it\n","December 24, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the demo alone I became acutely aware of just how amazing a game Bastion is.

However, I would be ashamed of myself for letting the opportunity to share how much I love this game slip by. I have logged far more hours into this game than the counter would suggest, and have loved every single one of them.\n\nThe story is polished and gripping. It unfolds in pieces, just like the world around you. Nothing is obvious at first glance, and every word spoken unveils new depths of emotion and connection to the characters and events without ever simply "giving it away."\n\nThe narrator, Logan Cunningham, is unreal. His voice feels like sunlight, and the almost interactive way the narration plays into the gameplay leaves you always wanting to find out what else there is to be heard.\n\nDarren Korb's OST is one of the best I have ever heard, as many who have played would agree. The fusion of American Western and Middle Eastern sounds, with heavy and dynamic rhythms, is gripping. Not a single note is out of place as you wander, battle, and witness the twisted world around you. The fast songs get you excited and the somber songs shatter your heart.\n\nThe gameplay is not particularly revolutionary, but it is well tuned and fun. The balance of difficulty and responsiveness allows beginners to enjoy themselves and pros to hone their reaction times and quick-thinking capabilities. The variety of weapons, skills, upgrades, spirits, and idols allows for a customizable experience that leaves you free to fight how you please. Balancing range and close-quarters? Tactical, strategic combat? Raw firepower? All are viable, playable options that leave you feeling pleased as punch.\n\nThe art...is a blessing to the eyes. Unique, painstakingly handpainted beauty with every step you take. A beautiful fusion of styles create an atmosphere unlike any other, that seemlessly blends all aspects of the game together into a world that captures the imagination.\n\nLastly, the characters and enemies are both enigmatic and relatable. Each character brings something powerful to the table, allowing players to connect on an emotional level - something very difficult for many AAA titles to accomplish. Enemies are well-designed and entertaining, leaving the player feeling ever-so-slightly guilty for their deaths...\n\nIn short, absolutely the best indie game I have ever played, and one of the greatest that I own. In no aspect does it fail to live up to the standards that every game should aspire to. I hope, for the sake of your own experience and for the sake of the wonderful people who put so much love into making this game, that you wait no longer to buy and experience this masterpiece.","May 27, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is mostly shown to the player through the gameplay and environment rather than told in dialogue or text. This makes the story seem more interesting than it perhaps actually is. My favourite feature of Bastion is that as you make your way through the world, the story and landscape are described by a man who has the voice of an old, western heavy smoker. This constant commentary, whilst mostly ineffectual, really adds a lot to the game and makes discovering each new area and enemy that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe combat is fairly basic and very similar to other isometric hack & slashers and the game can be finished in just a few hours but I think that if it were longer it might out-stay it's welcome. Bastion is a great game and often appears in the steam sales so it is definitely worth picking up.","March 1, 2013","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is what makes this one of my favorite arcade games. It is so immense and is unique is so many ways. This game extremely well done.\n\nThe artwork is fantastic and the gameplay is just astounding. The game mechanics are so great, they are fairly simple and easy to grasp hold of. The narrator for this game is extremely talented, his voice is so pleasant and fits the game perfectly.\n\nThe weapon system allows you make many weapon choices and combinations as well as certain and unique properties to go with those weapons. From a simple two handed hammer to what is basically a shoulder cannon that obliterates anything, the weapon system truly is amazing and fun to play around with. It also lets you choose between many traits as you progress in level. The game also provides mini challenges for each weapon which if you complete the assigned task you will rewarded with special items and secret moves for each weapon.\n\nThe characters in this game is also what dragged me into this amazing game. Each one of them, even the enemies, are unique in their own way and their diffifulcty can be increased through the use of Idols which give enemies new abilities or a boost in health, damage, or their mechanics during battle.\n\nAnother thing that I found neat about Bastion was that after you beat the game you can start the game from the beginning, but this time you will start out with the level your last playthrough, skills, weapons, and Idols. Overall this game is definitely a 10/10 for me.","June 12, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I saw this game on sale, and I heard good things about it, so I decided to spend my hard earned 2 dollars on it. The game is not hard to run, it never crashed, the framerate did not decrease and it still manages to look very nice. Gameplaywise, the game is quite simple. You walk with the w, a, s and d, dodge with space, block with shift, which also locks on targets and aim and attack with the mouse. You can carry two weapons at once. There is a set of melee weapons and ranged weapons, which you unlock through the game. You can equip two melee weapons or two ranged weapons, but I mostly stick with one melee and one ranged. You attack with your primary weapon with left mouse button and secondary weapon with the right mouse button, and you attack in the direction you point with the cursor, unless you are targeting an enemy. But the targeting system seriously bugged me. I thought that pointing at the enemies was a little dumb, so I tried to target the enemies, but the targeting system seems to target enemies randomly, maybe it targets the enemy closest to the cursor, but I am not really sure. Anyway, back to the weapons. My favorites are the machete, hammer, pike, pistols and shotgun, but I hate the rifle and mortar, but the worst thing about this is that in some levels, you get a new weapon, and the game feels that you just have to try it out and half of the level is just a weapon tutorial, which I thought was kinda dumb. But you get the option to switch your weapons about halfway through, which is neat. Throughout the game, a narrator tells the story, and he has an awesome voice, but most of the time I cannot hear him, due to all the noises in the game, but you can mute the sound and turn the voice volume up, which helps. And the story is awesome, listen to it. The game takes about 5 hours to beat, not counting the optional weapon challenges, where you can win materials to further upgrade your weapons. There are also survival modes if you're in that kind of stuff. Anyway, I think Bastion was a pretty fun game, and it's cheap, too. I would say it's worth the money, even though it's kinda short and the game isn't perfect. And the soundtrack is for sale, too.","November 6, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a witty narrator (think Stranger Than Fiction with Will Ferrell) that hilariously narrates everything you do. You get a few weapons along the way and a shield at the start then your favourite RPG tools appear.\n\nLet’s talk about the graphics. Amazing! If you have a higher resolution screen like me (2560 by 1440), checkout the Steam discussions to get a fix for it (look in properties, set launch options… and add -x 2560 -y 1440). It’s like you have been thrown into an artist’s water coloured mind and has painted his brush all over your brain. The music and sounds are fantastic. This is truly what gaming is about.\n\nBastion is a hack and slash RPG, you get and upgrade weapons along the way, and you have secondary weapons, special attacks, weapon upgrade tree, elixirs to improve stats, shrine to increase difficulty and mini games to master your skills. Even after that, you have a nice loot system that you’re always trying to find and there’s an excitement level because when you get something, it’s good and not just worthless junk!\n\nThe only area I can really fault with this game is its story, it’s not as interesting like most games (I want to know what caused the Calamity, but that’s about it), it doesn’t even matter though. You just want to play and have a good time.\n\nBest thing about Bastion is it always had something new to show the player, it’s not tedious, it doesn’t get stale. It’s refreshing to see a game excite so much while having so much strategy to a hack and slash genre which people tend to have a habit of mindlessly playing.\n\nThank you Bastion, for being awesome!

"Bastion", I think it was called. The kid went on about how it was a great game. He really seemed to be into it. He looks at me, and I nod in approval to let him continue talking while he types what's intresting about the '"active narrating" doo-hickey. He says how "cool" it is to hear  a person say what you're doing in a game and actively comments; and that it immerses the player into the world. I don't understand a word of it, but I continue nodding.\n\nHe then starts recounting about the times he played the game, about the "Calamity". He talks about waking up, floating in the sky in the middle of nowhere. Then something about a hammer. He starts listing all the types of weapons you get as you play, a machete. Rifle, Mortar, Shotgun, Pistol, Revolver, a Bow and Arrow. Even a flamethrower. He then lists all the monsters. Gasbags, Slimes, Crows, something about a Queen. All pretty interesting, but to a different man.\n\n+Kid talks about the "active narrating" again, saying how good it is\n+Then he says the controls are easy to learn,\n+"People with different playstyles will love it", he says\n+From what I've heard from the kid, the game's story is the best he's ever done\n\nWatchin' his smile fade to a frown, he starts to complain\n-"Too easy", says the kid. Well if you wanted it harder, all you gotta do is ♥♥♥♥ off a god, I say\n-He goes on to say that althought it's a great story, it's mighty predictable. Hmmph.\n-Kid becomes a lunatic, shouting something about Birds and Spikeweeds. Don't care much for that language he uses with it.\n\nHe pretends to be judge now, as he coughs and stacks a pile of cards, with the numbers 1 to 10 on 'em. Wait for it...\n\nHe holds up a 9, good golly. That's gotta make some'uns day.","September 25, 2013","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of the best games I have played in recent years.\n\nEven if you don't enjoy many platformer games, there is too much about this game that is just excellent. The combination solid combat, interesting puzzles and exploration, great asthetics and setting, beautiful soundtrack, and excellent narration driving the story forward make for an enjoyable experience that can last 3-6 hours per run through the story. Short term replayability is limited, but long term, this game is good enough and stand well enough independent of story spoilers you can play it many times over the rest of your gaming career.\n\nAt it's full price, I can reccomend this game to most serious gamers, and any fan of action platformer games. At a sale price, often below $3, I can reccomend at least trying this game to every single person who plays games; it's that good.\n\nGet this game.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhat Bastion is can be difficult to initially describe or grasp; and as such, escaped my interest for some time. When I finally did cave in and buy, I regret passing it over for so long.\n\nI would best describe it's genre as an Isometric Action Platformer, with some RPG elements. It's quite unique compared to many other games I've played, so its difficult to describe a genere; and screenshots do not do the game justice. However, I can say that this game reminds me much of a game I played many years ago, called "Lemmings Paintball." While, in my opinion, Bastion is defintely vastly superior to it in every way (Which may not be saying much, considering Lemmings Paintball's age), the way you explore and fight in the isometric world does bring back some memories of the time I put into Lemmings Paintball over 15 years ago. However, if had to make a genre comarison to this game, Lemmings Paintball combined with a touch of RPG and a story is my best description.\n\nStory is not driven by writing, by the main character, or by speach from other characters during the game. Instead, the story is described by a badass-sounding, omnicient narrator telling the story piece by piece, based on your actions and progression during the game. The narration is fantastic, perhaps only better if being done by Morgan Freeman himself... But seriously. The narrators tone, inflection, accent/voice, the word choice (Good job writers); everything about the narration, narrator, and narrations integration with the game is spot on, really making for an enaging and unique story telling experience I haven't found outside of games made by this developer (Transistor and Bastion being those such games, at the time I write this review).\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the base gameplay consists of you navigating and fighting your way through a twisted world, with isometric navigation. The iconic isometric split of height "level"  and tiles by an obvious grid or area seperation is not very noticable. The ratio of exploration, puzzles, and story to combat is pretty well paced. You rarely feel like that game has gone too long without action, while never feeling exceptionally overwhelmed by a situation where you never have a moment of rest from the combat.\n\nThe combat is nothing groundbreaking or first-of-its-kind innovative; what is does have is it's super solid execution, feeling of power without becoming too easy, choice of actions and weapon loadouts, and overall variety in combat sequeneces throughout the level. I didn't findmyself ever getting sick of the combat, and rarely felt frustrated by the combat sytstem itself (I'm always frustrated when I die or lose in any game, as with many others ;D). While it is solid, and the combat holds its own, I won't lie; you wouldn't buy the game for the combat alone.\n\nOverall, Bastion is well designed, and skillfully crafted in nearly every aspect and capacity. Its art style is unique and well executed, the sound and music is spot on, and the gameplay is great. It's use of narration is ingenious, with great execution from narrator who sounds like he's taken lessons for Morgan Freeman himself. I can reccomend this game to nearly everyone at even full price; if it's on sale, there is no reason to not own and at least try this game.","December 1, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some people have complained about the keyboard & mouse controls, but the controls were perfectly fine on a 360 controller.  Now, on to the review proper.\n\nBastion is a game where a mysterious calamity (simply called "The Calamity" by survivors) has wiped out most of the world's population and shot most of the land into the air.  You play as a boy (simply called "The Kid"), and must traverse various different locations to find Cores, magical crystals that will help to rebuild The Bastion.\n\nOne of the first things that people will notice about the game is the unique way that the narrative is framed.  Many of the different things that you do in the game are accompanied by a narration.  The voice actor perfectly fits the Steampunk/western style of the game, and is an absolute joy to listen to, even though he is the only voice actor in the game (aside from a few of the songs that contain lyrics and a small amount of dialogue with another character at the end).  The narration is meant to be one of the characters in the game retelling of past events, occasionally foreshadowing something or giving his personal thoughts.  The game allows you to find out about the lore of the game and the backstories of the characters as if you were actually the person listening to the story, allowing for you to decide what is true and what is made up.  Additionally, the beautiful handpainted graphics add to the atmosphere of the game in an incredible way.  You may end up feeling as if you don't want to kill any of the monsters, since they look so interesting, but avoiding them is generally not an option.  The game also explicitly mentions that many of the creatures used to be docile before The Calamity, leaving it up to the player why they suddenly want to kill The Kid (at one point, the narrator even says "At first they left the barge alone, then they saw who was riding it.").\n\nStylings can only account for a part of the experience of playing a game, though, so on to the gameplay.  The game has a sort of hack-and-slash style to it, and can feel very satisfying.  The weapons are all nicely varied, allowing for many different choices, and, in addition, each combination of two weapons elicits a unique line from the narrator.  The weapon upgrading system, featuring the ability to switch between 2 paths (usually representing effects versus damage), and its feature of allowing the player to mix and match upgrades at a will, adds even more depth.  Despite feeling satisfactory, the combat can feel a bit too easy once you get the hang of it, but learning each weapon as more are introduced throughout the game is great.  The "Proving Grounds," of which there is one for each weapon, however, are a very nice challenge for the most part, and completing all of them is very rewarding, even if you as the player don't like to use the weapon that it's relating to.  The spirits that can upgrade your stats are a nice touch too, being a very unique way of upgrading and, again, eliciting a unique line of dialogue from the narrator whenever one is equipped, usually talking about its Pre-Calamity use or reputation.\n\nOf course, since the soundtrack of this game is so famous, I would be remiss to review it without mentioning the music.  The soundtrack in this game is possibly the best I've ever heard.  The area tracks fit perfectly with whatever kind of atmosphere that area wants to convey.  The musical cues are spot-on, and the few previously mentioned tracks (entitled "Build That Wall"; "Mother I'm Here"; and "Setting Sail, Coming Home," respectively) are indescribably wonderful.  Even while typing out this review, I'm listening to the soundtrack in the background.  It's THAT good, and I'd say definitely worth a look, even if you don't plan on playing the game.\n\nOn release, this game recieved major critical acclaim.  I have to say that, even though I only ever played it 3 years later, the game is wholly deserving of any and all praise.  It has, very occasionally, been accused of pretentiousness, and, to this, I have to say that a game being "artsy" and it being "pretentious" are two very different things.  The handpainted backgrounds and incredible score add a level of atmosphere rarely seen in games.  The gameplay is very satisfying and rewarding, and there was a moment in the story, close to the end, that genuinely made me, a person who tries to keep my emotions to myself, burst into tears.  I won't spoil it by saying what it is, but what I can say about it is that it's one of the most emotional and well set up moments I've ever seen in anything.  I don't really know what I can add to the discussion about this game, as I'm sure that all I've said has been said elsewhere by other people, but, if you've read this far, all I can say is that this is a game worth getting.  Anyone who can appreciate games as an artform owes it to themselves to play this game.  It's fun, it's emotional, it's amazing.","August 14, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't think much of this game before playing, but after I did I was amazed. Bastion is basically a top- down action RPG where you (as a boy) have to go around looking for shards to save the world.\n\nThe music is great and suits the game perfectly. You also have a neat selection of weapons to choose from such as a sword,hammer, musket etc. with unique upgrades to suit your playstyle. There are about 12-13 levels in this game which are all feel different from each other. Voice acting is also good as well. There are different game modes available such as survival and score attack and new game plus which add to some replayability to the game. Finally,the story is remarkable and something you will remeber for a while.\n\nA problem I have with the game is the angles of some of the levels. I kept falling off because it was somewhat difficult to walk in a diagonal line in order to stay on some of the platforms. Another problem is that the direction your facing with the shield may not block all attacks as intended.\n\nShould you buy it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/violit/recommended/107100/","violit","Violit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/violit/","48 products in account","Admittedly, I missed the Bastion hype train when it came chugging past in 2011 and had only ever heard of a brief description of it being 'good' from people around me. How I missed that goodness knows but after playing Bastion I can only say that it completely lives up to the hype around it.\n\nIn an action RPG hack and slasher, you play as a character simply called The Kid. What unfolds is a story where there is no 'good' or 'bad' but instead a morally grey area for a majority of the characters which leads to some interesting perspectives. The story is told by the narrator who comments and narrates almost everything you do as The Kid. Perhaps people can see this as being a gimmick for the game but I personally found it delightfully charming and enjoyed listening to the commentary as I played. It helps to try the story forward and serves as encouragement if you should get stuck to keep going. The only gripe I have about the story is that I would've liked to have a bit more of it, plus one of the decisions that you're forced to choose at the end doesn't seem to have much of an effect on the end story.\n\nGraphically the game is stunning, even living up to the standards of 2014. Seeing the ground rise up around my character as I walked was stunning and helped to keep the pace of the game. Every area has been designed carefully so there's a lot to see and do in a story that is around 5 hours long. The foes you come up against have all had thought put into them and both move and look as I'd imagined.\n\nGameplay-wise the game is clever as it has an almost 'choose your own difficulty' with the shrine settings. By activating more idols  you gain bigger rewards but this in turn makes the game much more difficult. The use of the distillery also allows the player themselves to choose what bonuses they gain from levelling up making it so The Kid is completely customised to the player. The same goes with weapons; a range of melee and ranged weapons drop throughout the game which once again allows the player to play at their preferred style. This isn't something I'm used to seeing in games and it added to my enjoyment.\n\nAs for the soundtrack... it's honestly one of my favourite soundtracks and I'm someone who doesn't download soundtracks too much. It fits the mood of the game perfectly and  helps to immerse you straight into the world of Bastion. There's not much else I can say but I can guarantee that at the very least you should be able to fall in love with the soundtrack even if the game isn't for yourself.\n\nThe replay factor varies. I'm not the sort of person who'd play a game more than once yet I found myself playing Bastion for the second time through with the new gamemode I'd unlocked. As it allows you to carry over your stats and weapons from your previous save it makes the game a lot easier which some people may dislike but I enjoyed immensely. The game isn't so long that replaying it feels tedious either!\n\nUltimately I ended up being surprised that this game was made by an indie developer as it's so polished and such a beautiful, engaging game. There's not much I can fault other than one slight disgruntlement with the storyline to be honest. This comes highly recommended if there's anyone else who hasn't played it, even when it's not on sale. If it's on sale... well, there's no excuse to not buy Bastion.","December 4, 2014","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably one of the best downloadable games i've played. The game's artstyle is consistant and fantastic to look at all the way through. The game's story whilst fairly simple is very engaging and leads to some great moments, with some good characters and special mention to the brilliant narration that drives the story foward and sounds oh so good. The music also deserves a special mention, with some truely memorable tracks that have a consistant tone throughout, with vocals being used at the right moments to make reveals and gameplay segments more effective and truly memorable. Gameplay is very fun with a vast array of weapons to try out and find which best suits your play style. I couldn't recommend this game enough, so if you're in the need for a fun and gorgeous looking indie game, this is the one to choose.","December 27, 2011","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has great music and graphics. An interesting narrator that comments on your actions / decisions. And it also has a "Campaign+" Mode, Where you play the game over again with all of the stuff you got on your first playthrough.\n\nIts however a fairly short game that is not very challenging. However you can up the challenge by adding "Idols" Which makes the monsters harder to defeat, such as they attack faster, Take more damage on you, drop grenades once killed, Can't be shot with guns etc. This makes the game much harder.\n\nIt's a fun little title which you'll beat in a few hours. I've read that some people have played it for more than 60Hours. I myself haven't come back to it yet but now im thinking about playing it once more as it was so fantastic!

I have alot more experiance then the time it says I have put in.\n\n\nBastion is a game of story. The game is a almost 3D-isometric-ish hack and slash. There are alot of wepons, abilities, sidequests, options, and so much more. The controls are sweet too!\n\nYou wake up as a character called "The Kid"( as most characters are only referred to as The ????). After making your way throught the first level you learn a little about the story through The Narrarator. The world is expanded upon much more the there are a even a few tear jerking moments in there You can find several relics to give to people you will start pooling to the hub to learn more about the lore of The KId and the mythical world of his.\n\nThere are many wepons and abilities, as I have said. All wepons are found throughout the story along with some abilites. No wepons are missable. Stores in the hub(we'll get to that) can sell permant equipments(Spirits) and upgrades for your kicking wepons(assuming you have obtained the ingredients).\n\nThe game is traversed through the hub, the Bastion. The skyways(teleporters) can shoot you to missions or extra stages. Most of the time the game gives you several levels to choose from, although you have to complete them all, just in any order.  In the earlier mentioned extra stages you can play challenges based on one wepon. You can win money, a upgrade ingredient and a specilzed ability for that wepon.\n\nCompleting the story will allow you to upgrade the hub with stores. These range from the shrine for sidequests, to the Lost and Found to buy missed ingrediants and relics(even though you can backtrack), along with some uniqe spirits and abilites.\n\nThe story (and action) is complimented by  the awesome soundtrack, it can pump you up, get you down, ♥♥♥♥ you off, anything!\n\n\nIf you didn't get the message, buy this game!","March 2, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The combat system is real-time, and rather engaging, with upgrades to a variety of weapons that allow any gamer to really find her or his style. With controller-compatibility, the gameplay becomes even more fluid and enjoyable. I have nothing but praise for this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scrapod/recommended/107100/","Scrapod","Scrapod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Scrapod/","448 products in account","My first experience of the Kid waking up in Bastion instantly told me that this was going to be one of those games that you don’t forget, something truly special. So let me preface this by saying I will try and make my review as spoiler-free as possible.\n\nYou wake alone amidst serene chaos, on an island of beautifully painted pieces suspended over a seemingly infinite void. The only accompaniment is the deep, gravelly, and reassuring voice of the Narrator. Moving from your bed, the world begins to form at your feet. Tiles zip up to form a path before you, leading you onwards through a vibrant, colourful environment.\n\nAt it's core, Bastion is a competent action RPG. You can carry two weapons (each with a unique role, ability and all upgradeable), as well as a shield (which when used at the correct time allows you to deflect) and a special ability. While there is nothing particularly genre-redefining here, it fulfils its function and allows you to dodge and roll through the world slashing and shooting at lot’s of enemies as well as collecting “shards”, fragments of the old world.\n\nNot being a huge fan of ARPG’s myself, the real draw of the game for me was the delivery of the story, the atmosphere and the whole mystery surrounding the world. You want to know what happened here. The primary way for you to find out is through the Narrator.\n\nThe way Bastion utilises the Narrator works phenomenally well. He leads you through the levels, depositing slivers of story as well as beautifully crafted nuggets of feedback of your play style, all in a unique style of speech that you will associate with his long after the credits roll. Decide to smash everything in the room? Expect to hear something along the lines of “Kid just rages for a while”. Your character, the Kid, is a silent protagonist. But this is allows you to focus entirely on the Narrator, whose ability to drop subtle undertones of dismissal or hints at a haunted past is astonishing.\n\nDifficulty is handled in an ingenious way as well. Instead of just a straight Easy/Medium/Hard slider, you can choose to make the game more difficult in different ways through a building that I would rather not spoil. Not only does it allow the game to be more tailored to how much you want to be challenged, it does it through a totally natural system that doesn't take you out of the experience.\n\nIt isn’t without complaints though. The isometric camera angle can cause some frustration when coupled with the inherent limited maneuverability of the WASD keys. If this is getting too much for you, a 360 pad can be used instead. A small complaint, but worth mentioning.\n\nThe music for the game is also something else. Trust me when I say this, you should get a hold of the soundtrack. The melding of instruments from different cultures and technology creates a sound that fits the game’s theme like a glove. The way it is used in one particular song sent shivers through me.\n\nSo in summary, while the core of the gameplay is not hugely inspired (though sufficiently refreshed to be enjoyable) and the isometric view and keyboard limitations can be stifling, the game is one that should be celebrated as an achievement in the medium. The story and its implementation through the Narrator, the world in all its desolate beauty and the extraordinary soundtrack all come together. Each element melds to create an audio and visual treat which should not be missed.","November 26, 2013","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes, yes I do.\nWhy?\nWell, this is a game that gives you great art, a fantasic story and one of the most epic soundtracks ever. The gameplay is fun and even if the characters you meet are rather limited (4) and you dont learn a lot about them from the "main story quests" you still get quite atached to them and you have the chance to hear their backstory throughout the gameplay.\n\nThere are some stuff that might bug certain people, it's not the longest and most difficult game, I cleared the game after about 5 hours but doing the story mode plus and doing all the extra stuff can give you a few more hours of great fun and the game does give you tasks that you can try to achieve. The enemies can feel a bit repetative but this isn't something I really thought much about since I was focusing on the story being told in the background.\n\nSo in the end, it has it's downsides but to me and most people (as far as I know) the + is worth more than the -","July 28, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to clear levels and, one after one, the story advances in the "city" (Bastion), revealling more details of future and past.

It's very addictive and has fun bonus levels (pretty much a horde mode with 10 waves, that are pretty hard).

This is a game with 2D graphics and 3D movement, so you ought to get used to pressing two movement keys at once most of the time. The graphics are great, the artwork is detailed and the animations are satisfying. The combat is surprisingly fun and there's an upgrade system for your weapons that's full of possibilities. But the greatest thing about this game is the narrator. You get a badass background voice narrating everything you do. Every achievement, every mistake, and every ridiculous stunt you manage to pull off do not go unnoticed.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing and definitely worth its price.

Played through my first time with M/K and would not go back to them after using a 360 controller.\n\nVarying difficulty settings and optional weapon mastery challenges make it so this game has a lot of obstacles to overcome for us players. The difficulty ramps very steadily from the beginning to end and is completely possible to master the game with a little patience and practice with the weapons that suit your playstyle.\n\nDefinitely an achievement hunter friendly game.\n\nWorth playing, worth beating, worth 100%ing.","December 23, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After a hard time during the level due to the new weapon, you probably won't take it out for another spin.

(Note: This is somber, not bombastic like VJ. Just so you don't get the wrong idea.) There's some balance issues which make the customization a little less than it could be, but there's enough viable options that you won't mind. Solid Zelda-Style combat and lots of atmosphere. It would be too short as a full-priced game, but it's all quality, and at this price it's a bargain. If you have a weekend to kill and like listening to vaguely philosophical drawls in westerns, then you can't go wrong with Bastion.","November 13, 2011","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I love how you're constantly getting new weapons till the very end and how they each have a very different feel. And the system for constantly retuning their upgrades gave a lot of tactical decision making possibilities that changed how you use them. The flow of combat with timed shots, blocking, parries, and dodges is so well done... at least once you learn all those tricks from the training challenges. The passive upgrades and self imposed difficulty modifiers for bonus XP were really cool too (especially after they add more on the second play through).\n\nTo top it off there's the beautiful music, visuals, and narration. Everything came together in to such an awesome package. Can't wait for their next game!","May 25, 2013","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I only say this because it is such a short game (I only clocked in about 5.5 hours) and has very little replay value. The art style is amazing and the story is great as well. What I found to be the main attraction, however, is the narration. The narrator was so good that he even did an announcer pack for Dota 2 (which I bought immediately after completing this game). It's very easy for me to recommend this game to everyone.

One day I've caught myself humming one of the motives during the working day - and than's when I realized i was in love with it. So grammophone was just another piece of game for me, perfect in itself.\nThe other aspects of this hilarious game were also leaving only positive impressions - battle system, weapons upgrade system, spirits, special ablities, shrines with varying difficultie through the game, pets (omg, Squirt was sooo qute!) and so on. Of course the draphic design - the style is just complementing the whole picture, creating the masterpiece.\nSo, if you ask me, I would completely reccomend this game to everyone who loves game with strong breathtaking stories.","June 11, 2014","true","10.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is what makes this one of my favorite arcade games. It is so immense and is unique is so many ways. This game extremely well done.\n\nThe artwork is fantastic and the gameplay is just astounding. The game mechanics are so great, they are fairly simple and easy to grasp hold of. The narrator for this game is extremely talented, his voice is so pleasant and fits the game perfectly.\n\nThe weapon system allows you make many weapon choices and combinations as well as certain and unique properties to go with those weapons. From a simple two handed hammer to what is basically a shoulder cannon that obliterates anything, the weapon system truly is amazing and fun to play around with. It also lets you choose between many traits as you progress in level. The game also provides mini challenges for each weapon which if you complete the assigned task you will rewarded with special items and secret moves for each weapon.\n\nThe characters in this game is also what dragged me into this amazing game. Each one of them, even the enemies, are unique in their own way and their diffifulcty can be increased through the use of Idols which give enemies new abilities or a boost in health, damage, or their mechanics during battle.\n\nAnother thing that I found neat about Bastion was that after you beat the game you can start the game from the beginning, but this time you will start out with the level your last playthrough, skills, weapons, and Idols.

He tore his path through the world, reached out and ripped the beating heart of fun from the world.  And I'll be darned if it wasn't the most fun that little boy did ever see.","December 27, 2011","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything is so sophisticated that it threw me off and captured my attention immediately. The gameplay, I thought, was going to be kind of boring but it suprised me and was very enjoyable with numerous weapons that kept me interested in trying new combos of weapons and abilities. As well the game isn't as easy as I thought it was going to be and was a very nice balance of boss battles and diffucult enemies. If you want fun gameplay this game you should just get alone. But it just doesn't stop there the music is amazing. It completely captures the tone of the game and intense fights that you will get in too.

Thyme","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977434623/","612 products in account","Bastion is a game that after about 10 minutes of play is obviously a game designed for smartphones. You can tell by the way everything handles and the flow of combat. That being said, after about 30-40 minutes of play you likely either don't notice anymore or don't care. There are some games you get for the story and the art moreso than the gameplay; Bastion is certainly one of those games, but the gameplay doesn't really let you down either.\n\nThere is a fine selection of weapons, power-ups, and challenge arenas. If you just want to run through the story, enjoy the fine voice-acted narration, and then call it a day you can. Or you can bust your butt and try to unlock everything, but at no point did it feel to me like doing busy work; I always felt adequately rewarded for my time. It's the coffee table reading equivalent of a game in that you can play it in 20 minute intervals and always feel like you're getting somewhere, which for me is an invaluable game to have on hand at all times. Yes, I like the long quests, but sometimes I just wanna sip some coffee and game a bit before getting to work on something.\n\nNew Game+ grants you the ability to build on previous progress, but this is a story that when it ended I really wanted to know what would happen next. And that's almost a perfect ending. You get a host of weapons, liquor-based powerups, relics, cultures, history, gods, challenge modes, and then at the end really all you want more of is the storyline; not because the story provided was poor but because it was so good that you hate giving those characters up to the void of what we cannot know (unless they release a sequel).","September 29, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It wasn't necessarily boring because the game steadily throws new weapons and enemies at you which you have to work your head around. But by the end, I was mostly looking forward to not having to see another one of those green eyed thorn balls. I've never been a big fan of dungeon crawlers, so maybe it's a point in Bastion's favour that it was able to keep me interested for so long despite my mixed feelings towards the gameplay.\n\nThe artwork is definitely the highlight of the game. The landscapes are bring and colourful, and it's a plearsure to meaner your way throught them. The sound is great, with parts of the landscape giving a satisfying "cruch" when they're destroyed. And the voice acting... oh man. Rucks is the narrator/guide through your adventure. He is well written, and his rusty voice gives the game a lot of character. Buy the Bastion announcer pack in Dota 2 if you want more.\n\nOverall, it's a good game. I won't be playing it over, but it was overall an enjoyable game while it lasted.

The gameplay is dynamic, and very entertaining; art style is cartoonish, colorful, haflfway anime but not overdone. OST is one of the best I've heard and it's perfectly used through the game fitting each moment's pace completely. These things would already make the game outstand, yet it's major strenght is story and narrative. You can easily immerse into the story by hearing the narrator as you advance through the game, story unfolds with each step you take. It has only a few or no drawbacks, the only I can think of is it's relatively short duration (6-7 hrs) and that the ending didn't wrap everything up as I would like.\nFinal veredict: Brillant 9,3/10.

Definitely need to play Transistor afterwards though.\n\nI think it's important to point out, that I played Transistor first (legit 10/10), and having heard this was much better, I went into Bastion with extremely high expectations; sadly it could not reach those expectations.\n\nI found the conbat to be someone more hack n slash than the more planned out strategy found inTransistor. The level design, while more robust tan Transitors consistant color scheme, I kept falling off the edges of the map because it was not always clear what was floor and what wasn't...\n\nThat aside, Bastion is an amazing game with not only an amazing story, but characters that have a surprising level of depth, an amazing soundtrack, and art style that blew me away withi each new area.\n\n","December 12, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have alot more experiance then the time it says I have put in.\n\n\nBastion is a game of story. The game is a almost 3D-isometric-ish hack and slash. There are alot of wepons, abilities, sidequests, options, and so much more. The controls are sweet too!\n\nYou wake up as a character called "The Kid"( as most characters are only referred to as The ????). After making your way throught the first level you learn a little about the story through The Narrarator. The world is expanded upon much more the there are a even a few tear jerking moments in there You can find several relics to give to people you will start pooling to the hub to learn more about the lore of The KId and the mythical world of his.\n\nThere are many wepons and abilities, as I have said. All wepons are found throughout the story along with some abilites. No wepons are missable. Stores in the hub(we'll get to that) can sell permant equipments(Spirits) and upgrades for your kicking wepons(assuming you have obtained the ingredients).\n\nThe game is traversed through the hub, the Bastion. The skyways(teleporters) can shoot you to missions or extra stages. Most of the time the game gives you several levels to choose from, although you have to complete them all, just in any order.  In the earlier mentioned extra stages you can play challenges based on one wepon. You can win money, a upgrade ingredient and a specilzed ability for that wepon.\n\nCompleting the story will allow you to upgrade the hub with stores. These range from the shrine for sidequests, to the Lost and Found to buy missed ingrediants and relics(even though you can backtrack), along with some uniqe spirits and abilites.\n\nThe story (and action) is complimented by  the awesome soundtrack, it can pump you up, get you down, ♥♥♥♥ you off, anything!\n\n\nIf you didn't get the message, buy this game!","March 2, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This allows story to actively drive the game all the way through, rather than merely serving as punctuation. The smooth, standout narration deserves your careful ear, as its backstory adds so much depth to the overall experience. Bastion is one of the few games which enticed me to seek out other's analysis on its themes and philosophy afterwards.\n\nThe cartoonish, hand painted world blends together to defy the sterile, methodical aesthetic many isometric games suffer. It's cute how these gorgeous tiles and assets fancifully fall into place just a few steps ahead of you, all in theme with the recollective nature of the story. The only jarring result of Bastion's isometry is you can only move in 8 directions; not granularly. However, the important thing is weapon aiming is granular.\n\nI won't lie, there were times I found the combat frustrating, but it did improve as I levelled (and equipped) up, and by the end, I was even enjoyed it. I also appreciated the fact that you have a good old fashioned hunk o' metal shield. As in, one you have to actively face the enemy and raise to counter with. The combat is definitely more interesting for that decision.\n\nBesides, Bastion is worth it for the music alone.","January 8, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It also might be my #1 Indie game. Although there may not be anything completely original in this title, the way the game is presented feels different from the majority of games I've played. They keep a lot of tried and true mechanics (e.g. upgradable weapons and character, multiple levels categorized by zones, home base where you will upgrade and customize your character, and unlockable arena battles to test your skills) but they've added plenty of charm and character to this title that keep it fresh.\n\nThe narrator is one of the most memorable parts of the game and you will learn most of the world's lore and story progression via his soothing voice. The controls are very tight and almost perfect. The way you can alter your difficulty with the idols you unlock is also a nice feature that forces you to adjust your fighting technique if you want to face these self-imposed challenges. I finished the game several months ago for the 5th time, but keep reminiscing about the music, weapon loadout and the final, tough-as-nails dream challenge.\n\n9.5/10","May 13, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
