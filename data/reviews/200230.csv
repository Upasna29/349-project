When i say real offroad game i mean you have to use winch and watch the pressure so you dont break cable, you can turn 4x4 on/off and lock in hubs to get diff types of traction when/where you need it. It also has  prettty nice mud and effects for vehicle interacting with it and making tracks and ruts and it affecting the physics of the vehicle. Mud washes off if you drive thru a clear water river or creek and can get muddy again.  Overall fun game but different and captures real offroading pretty dang well and its obvious the ydid their research on this game. Its a shame the market for it is kinda niche cause they did a good job on it.","December 4, 2013","true","16.2"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","53","61","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027141250/recommended/200230/","76561198027141250","gamer1000k","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027141250/","985 products in account","Most offroad racing games have you racing around a relatively smooth dirt track that maybe has a few jumps. This game has some tracks like that, but where it really shines is when the smooth track ends at a huge pile of rocks and the only way forward is up and over.\n\nYou have quite a bit of control over the vehicle with the ability to use lockers, adjust air pressure, switch between high and low gear ranges and a winch. Knowing how and when to use these systems is essential to finishing most of the tracks, thankfully a tutorial is provided. The graphics and climbing physics are impressive and there is a nice selection of vehicles, although a little more customization would be appreciated.\n\nThis game has some fairly significant issues however. The driving model works quite well at low speeds (including simulating how easy it is to get stuck in deep mud) but breaks down at higher speeds on the smooth sections of the track where the vehicle has no sense of weight and slides and bounces around unrealistically. When you do get stuck without a nearby tree to use as a winch anchor, the lack of a reset button means you have to restart the race which can be extremely frustrating with the length of some of the events. The game does at least reset you if you roll the vehicle or fall off the track.\n\nIn all the events you're racing a ghost ai which often feels cheaty when it effortlessly floats over a mud pit that you're stuck in up to your axles or hovers over broken rocks that hang you up at every turn. When it's not cheating it's not particularly smart and is relatively easy to beat.\n\nUnlike most offroad games, there is no free roam mode. The tracks are very detailed with lots of interesting obstacles, but you're confined to a relatively narrow corridor that resets you back on the track if you stray outside the boundaries. Sometimes these boundaries aren't very clear so you'll miss a turn and end up off the track with a time penalty. At least you have the option to set up an empty multiplayer server and drive around the tracks by yourself to better learn them and to test out the vehicles. I haven't found anyone else who has this game to test out multiplayer with so I can't comment on how well that works.\n\nFor awhile this game appeared to have been abandoned with the devs being MIA but a recent update just a few days ago added additional language support so there is hope again that some of these issues will be fixed.\n\nDespite all these issues, I still had a lot of fun simply because there aren't many games that actually simulate low speed rock crawling and scrambling (besides possibly spintires which I'm waiting for a good sale on). I can hesitantly recommend this game as long as you can live with the issues and you can find it on sale, with the number of unresolved issues I wouldn't be able to recommend it at the full asking price.\n\nPros:\ngraphics\ntrack design\nrock crawling\n\nCons:\ncheaty ai\npoor vehicle handing at speed\nno way to get unstuck without restarting race\nno free roam\n\n7/10","October 29, 2014","true","12.7"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

Imagine being taught how to build a birdhouse in a tutorial then the first race asks you to build an entire apartment complex on your own. Even with 5 hours under my belt there were simply some courses I could not win.\n\nNow from a game design perspecive, ORD is almost an embarassment. The graphcis are... Okay at best. This would have looked good in the PS2 era of gaming. There are sometimes neat lighting effects and the draw distances are surprisingly detailed but everything else is left to be desired. Also the game cannot and will not remember your control configurations. So unless you want to use the up, down, left, right, arrow keys, you'll be remapping your control scheme every time you open it up.\n\nI'm willing to let all of that pass... but the one thing that really gets under my skin is the AI design. Basically if you don't win 2 out of the 3 courses in a circuit and place SECOND in the one you don't win... you will never come in first in a circuit. The same AI driver WINS... EVERY... SINGLE... TIME. There's no coming back from any finish less than 2nd place in any given race. That's just awful game design.\n\nEven if you absolutely LOVE anything offroading related, I cannot possibly recommend this game. It's just underdesigned on so many levels and in the few places that it does shine, it overly complicates things to the point where they are frustrating. Skip this game at all costs unless you are a fan of mental toture and self-harm.","August 21, 2014","false","5.1"," 36 of 67 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","36","67","2","0"

As of now I give it 8/10 and if I am able to connect a wheel for driving (nice you can already assign your own keyboard controls so dont have to use arrow keys) and variety of upgrades like better differntials, brakes, etc then I will increase rating.

I come from a long history of off roading games.  The greatest offroad game I have come across was the Cabelas 4x4 Offroad series.  That was for the older, windows 98-XP system.  I have played several others such as Spin Tires (incomplete), and none have come close to the Cabelas series.  Then I saw this on youtube.  When I saw it come onto greenlight I was anxiouse for it to be green lit, and I was super happy when it went on sale.  I regret nothing of my purchase.  Ill give you a nice thorough pros/cons list of what I look for in offroading\nMy list will definatly be disputable.\n\nPROS\nAMAZING physics.\nTruck mechanics (4x4, diffrentials, different tires etc) are the best I have ever seen.\nGround deformation is only put where it is needed, thus reducing any lag and making the game easier to run.  The deformation that is there, is beautiful\nGreat truck selection\nLevels are realistic to professional offroad raceing courses\nSpecial tracks (mud bogs, rock climbs) test your skills of the extremes\nNice tutorial.  Gives you a good experience of what you're in for.\nGhost truck and place indicator really add suspence, and give you a sense of competition to race against.  Some times the place indicator is innacurate, and when it says you're in 4th, you could win in 1st by a fraction of a second.\n\nCONS (most are very minor)\nMultiplayer and mods do not look promising to me at this point.\nNot much for soft body physics.  But really, it isnt needed and would just make the game more taxing.\nYou cant add accessories to the truck (light racks, bully bars, roll cages etc.)\nIts only raceing - theres no checkpoint driving or free rome, but I have not found this to be much of a let down.  The racing ROCKS.\nTrucks do not have limited fuel.\nNo "super bogger" trucks, or hard core mud bog/mud run tracks to use them on.\nEngine sounds arent the greatest in all trucks.\n\n\nIn short, do I recomend this game?  Hell yes.  Solid 9/10.  Good job to everybody who worked on it, and thank you for making this beast game.\n\nEDIT\nSince I wrote this review I have noticed that the public opinion has gone down.  If you ask me, people are picking on it to much and cant deal with a few problems from the big picture.  For $10, what did you expect?  Of course there are some problems.  One thing I saw was that there are to many obstacles.  Guess what?  Thats what pro offroading is about.  Obstacels, and lots of them.\n\nIf the game is on sale, it is definatly worth it.  If you are trying to dicide between this and saving for a better game, I would save for a better game.  But, I still love it and recomend it.","April 14, 2014","true","15.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

By this, I mean the game will register that the object are colliding when on screen they aren't. This will make taking a particular line difficult, its pretty infuriating when you should be able to make it up a ledge but the game won't let you. I can tell that this was done to ease the work needed in programming and less processing to do client-side, it would be nice to see it refined, however. This also ties into #5, vehicles ability to turn their wheels, more when I get there, though.\n\nRespawn system, the forced respawn is rather annoying, there have been countless times when I was forcibly respawned even though I wasn't in the situation it was telling me I was. I think forced respawn should be removed and a 'You appear to be stuck, would you like a penalty-free respawn?' should be in its place. There's just no excuses for the respawn, something like that should have been fixed long ago.\n\nVehicle handling is another spot that I can had corners cut to ease the work on the devs. When vehicle handling is lower, the vehicle isn't harder to handle, it simply won't respond to inputs as well. Yes, this is essentially the same thing, however its not. When handling is low, the vehicle simply refuses to do what you're telling it to do, IE. solid ground, full lock steering, and going 4 KPH the vehicle should turn very sharply, there is no reason for it not to, however it simply refuses to turn due to the handling mechanisms in the game.\n\nTorque, this is kinda in with the traction mechanisms of the game, low gear isn't as powerful as it should be. In most 4-wheel drive vehicles 4-low is almost unstoppable, however in the game the vehicles get bogged down far too easily. The vehicle get far too much 'traction' this is tied in with the object boundaries being lax.\n\n(Un)fortunately, this is the only game that I have found that fills this genre (Hardcore Offroad Racing), so I would have to say its the best one like it. I would recommend it because it isn't a horrible game, it just needs work to refine it.\n\n","December 26, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Love the graphics and choices of 4wd's. I really like the slow rock crawling maps. The suspention flexes around and the choice of bigger tires is great to. I would ask that you fix something in the settings, i change the left and right controls to A and D but every time i exit the game and reopen it, the settings arent saved. it never saves?? Its just annoying having to change the settings everytime i play it. I also wanna suggest that you ad a free roam, so that you can explore the maps at your will without a time constraint or points, just so you can have a bit of fun and get some screen shots and stuff.

It is very race oriented, but will allow you to drive in trial races which reward you based on climbing over things rather than going as fast as possible.\nThe camera views are decent. The view from inside the trucks seems extremely realistic.\nYou have a limited amount of tuning options - suspension and ride height and tire selection. These values do make a difference in-game.\nWhile driving, you can select your gear, clutch is an option, you can use a winch, tire pressure is adjustable on the fly and you can enable 4 wheel drive as well as separately lock center diff and axle diffs.\nOverall - 6/10 for a racing game, but 10/10 for an offroad simulation game.","September 20, 2014","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found this gem when I was looking for another game, I saw the screenshots and it sorta looked like a revamped, trials focused version 4x4 Evo with a 'lil bit of Spintires thrown into the mix. I added it to my wishlist and to my surprise it went on sale a week after that, so I bought it, played a bit and I wasn't dissapointed.\n\nIndeed, Off-Road Drive reminds me of 4x4 Evo 1/2 and Spintires, even better cause the latter, from what I've watched and read, looks like it doesn't offer much and gets old quickly. This game offers many different tracks, vehicles and customization options. You race against the clock and other opponents but you don't see 'em during the race tho, except for a ghost of the first and second cars when they're getting close on you, so it feels kinda like a rally game in that regard, you still feel the competitive pressure and rush; During each race, depending on the surface you're on, you'll have to change the drive mode, gears, differentials, tire pressure and you'll even have to use the winch to attach the vehicle to a tree -or something else- a few times in certain levels just to get out of the most difficult situations.\n\nA really fun game overall if you're into more 'cranial', simulation-y type of racing games, specially off-road ones, I truly recommend it.","September 21, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's awesome, almost as fun as off roading for real. But, it's not without it's flaws. The first one I noticed is that despite it's description there is no snow courses in the entire game. Another is that for game modes you have a choice of career or.. career. While you can go back and replay courses, you can't choose the exact track you want to play on, rather you have to play an entire series of tracks. Oh and I should note that if you lose in the series while replaying it will override your previously clearing it and possibly make trucks you've unlocked unavailible. But the biggest flaw is that the game does not have a free roaming mode, and is abosultely humorless if you try and do anything other than drive on the course in the exact way it wants you to.\n\nI wouldn't have bothered with writing a review if I hadn't noticed that 1c just released a French translation a short while ago, which must mean the developers still care about the game on some level, and perhaps they'll listen to me. Please add a mode where the game doesnt force you back on to the track. Possibly add inverted courses to change it up a bit. And maybe add some snow tracks if the first two things end up being easy fixes.

Don't let this game's potential go to waste! :)\n\nTL;DR Game is good if you get into real off roading, but don't expect to have as much freedom as you'd have in an older game like MotorM4x.","August 16, 2015","true","36.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than that great mud physics for getting stuck unless your driving one of the good offroading vehicles. Very challenging requires quickness and skill.

These guys got the right idea. Nobody to this day has still made a really good intense offroad game for pc that i know of. And im sure if there was it would sell many copies. Please make again but put some effort in this time. This off road drive is glitchy, has poor graphics and hard to see where your going because of the camers setup. But this game still has some kool features like diff lock, four by, winch, tire pressure adjustment ect.","December 11, 2015","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The times set by the computer are a little ridiculous. The vehilcles power are not even close to how they perform in real life. This game feels like they got pretty close to being perfect and called it quits. And why no sandbox mode or a least a practice option to where you can just slowly crawl your way through a track for fun. Even in the start up video there is a vehicle slowly crawling it\'s way through a course, but not once in this game will you be able to have that pace if you want to win. Would I recomend this game? Maybe if it was free, but it needs some more work, and it appears the only thing the developers are worried about it how many languages it has.","June 1","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
