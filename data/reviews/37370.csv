Good for a time killer and seems like it would run on a low-end pc. $6.99 seems a little pricey so I would wait for a sale.","February 7, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's just not enough to keep my attention. It just makes me want to play Bejeweled some more.","November 2, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
