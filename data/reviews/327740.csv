"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDSO/recommended/327740/","LDSO","LDSO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LDSO/","557 products in account","Before I continue, I want to disclose the fact that I'm one of the creators of the Killer App Mod for TRON 2.0. I've also owned the game since its initial release in 2003, and provided help and support to players during that entire time. So, my opinion on TRON 2.0 could be considered a bit biased.\n\nIf you look at the negative reviews for this game, you'll find in the majority of cases it's not because they didn't like the game. It's because they couldn't get it to work. Giving a negative review for that reason is fine, and Disney should definitely fix the issue.\n\nIt doesn't happen for everyone. But if it does, there's a community guide started by schmatzler that can help, with a simple fix. It also advises on how to play the game in widescreen, and even get the online multiplayer working again; both via the Killer App Mod.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=325088441\n\nFor me, TRON 2.0 is a more faithful sequel than TRON Legacy. It was once considered the official follow-up to the original TRON film, as stated by director Steven Lisberger himself. It celebrates the geekiness of the original, with many puns and references to it.\n\nThe environments in the game expertly balance the fine line between paying homage to the original film's neon glow aesthetics, while at the same time updating them and giving the game levels a more sophisticated look. The player's weapons are imaginative analogues to the standard FPS shotgun, machine gun, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, etc. But it's the iconic identity disc that is the most fun to use: being able to both attack, and defend (block) opponents' discs. Monolith Productions managed to translate the versatility and precise control seen from the disc in the film, to this game.\n\nContinuous FPS action is occasionally broken up with Light Cycle race sections, which again almost perfectly emulate what was seen in the original TRON. The AI can be a bit frustrating to play against, because of their insanely fast responses to the player. But, eventually you will learn how to deal with them, and they can be defeated relatively easily. If you find the races too frustrating, they can be skipped by saying "No" when the game asks if you want to retry. There is no score penalty for doing this, and you won't miss anything (cutscenes or rewards) if you skip races.\n\nThe ending of the game is a bit disappointing, and leaves you wanting more. But it's the journey there that is the most rewarding. TRON 2.0 is a lot like System Shock 2, in that regard. Another game with a fantastic campaign, but an unsatisfying ending.\n\nThe press and user reviews generally agree on a score of 8.4 (84/100), which I think is fair. If I had to give TRON 2.0 a numerical score, it would be a 9/10. It's not perfect or completely groundbreaking for its time, but it does what it does very well and is an overlooked gem of a title.","March 24, 2015","true","6.5"," 93 of 96 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","93","96","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/recommended/327740/","Sevandres","Sevandres","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevandres/","164 products in account","Tron 2.0\nTron 2.0 is a very old first person shooter developed by Monolith Productions and published by Disney. Though hailing from 2003, it does have the necessary components that allow it to hold your interest even with todays gaming giants.\n\nA little bit of background; Tron 2.0 is one of several games I frequented as a young child in the early - mid 2000s. It was also the first game to introduce me into a beautiful world with a good story line, thus sparking my love for video-game lore. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, through out all of its flaws and perks and even twelve years later I still cannot stay away. This review may be a tad biased, but I also believe that reviews should reflect upon ones experience, whether it be positive or negative.\n\nAs far as gameplay, it's not entirely up to par from modern games of today but it is not exactly lacking either. You have all of your basic functions; crouch, walk, lean over to the side, strafe and jump (There's no sprint.) Additionally all of your keys are rebindable which was a nice consideration. You do have a difficulty slider from Easy, Normal, Hard and Insane. Replayability shouldn't be much of an issue. Aesthetically the game does an incredible job of immersing you inside the digital world of a computer, from the sounds of your foot steps to the views of the many levels this game has to offer, and even as far as some of the termonology used in the games dialog.\n\nThe sound track is amazing and as I've said it before and I'll continue to say it, this game by far has the most unique and nicest looking game-worlds of anything I have played to this day. I'm not sure about you, but I am a fan of the innards of a computer. Neon lights, blocks, digital bridges, circuit boards and all. I cannot help but stop and look around for a solid five minutes when I enter a level. It's just very pleasing to the eye, even if it is a world designed in the early 2000s.\n\nYou play as a character who gets digitalized into a computer to fight off a virus. Your character can acquire build points to level up attributes such as health, energy, and processor (How long it takes your character to defrag or clean a corrupted subroutine). There are four types of weapons in the game, with three sub-types of those weapons to choose from. For a 2003 game published by Disney, I would not say the story is great, but it is not by any means bad either. It drew me in pretty easily early on, but I found it had some consistency problems towards the tail end of the campaign.\n\nAside from the age and story, and lack of previous success in it's earlier years, another and perhaps more fatal flaw is that it's relatively difficult to get this game to work for Windows 10. I'm not sure about previous versions of Windows and other operating systems though, so I will focus on what I had to do to get Tron 2.0 to run on my Windows 10 machine.\n\nBefore I get on with the how-to for Tron 2.0 on Windows 10, I will say that I recommend you to pick this game up. It's worth a run through the world to see the sights and hear the sounds, and a play through the story as well. It's relatively cheap, you can replay it easily at a higher difficulty, It's really a lot of good fun. Give it a go!\n\nThere are two+one items you will need to download and install to get the game to run (Links at the bottom of the review until if and when I am asked to remove them). The first item you will have to download is a seperate launcher. Simply place the new launcher into the folder that this game installs to, replacing the default launcher, is all you need to do for the first step. Secondly there's an unofficial patch that you'll have install as well but it's nothing too complicated. Just download and run the installer, and you're done. At this point, you will be able to run the game, and should do so before you continue reading this review / how-to.\n\nFinally, there is an optional mod that gives you extra features, including resolutions for 16:9 and 16:10 monitor ratios. The mod comes as an installer and is relatively straight forward to use. If you choose to download this optional mod, you must be warned that it might hang up at a certain part of the install due to you having any logitech or razer software / driver on your computer running. I found the easiest way to get the mod to install is to restart your computer and boot up into safemode. Run the mod installer once you're logged in and you should be able to finish the install with out any further issues.\n\nLauncher [tronfaq.blogspot.com]\nUnofficial Patch [tronfaq.blogspot.com]\nKiller App Mod [tronfaq.blogspot.com]","September 27, 2015","true","8.1"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","50","52","0","2"

It's a superb game, even over 10 years since its release. I completed it twice since 2003 and I'm sure I'll complete it again. Especially if you liked TRON (the movie), it's such an awesome experience. Visually it's top notch and you definitely get the retro feel when you're playing. The atmosphere is authentic and definitely matches the movie well.\n\nThe overall feel of being inside a digital world, or even a computer, is very well done. As with most games that contain a certain amount of RPG elements, you can gradually upgrade your character with "subroutines" that enhance your abilities. Unlike other RPGs though, you have to automatically re-spec  whenever you enter a new area (due to different memory requirements/allocations). This can mean that you might have more or less abilities to choose from. This is unusual, but adds another dimension in my opinion.\n\nThe levels and puzzles are great and as your arsenal gradually improves, so do the missions and adversaries in form of the "Kernel" and it's clean-up routines. Essentially you can be a computer virus in an FPS game. To use a fitting phrase from the time of TRON's creation: "That's just rad!"\n\nI do recommend you get the Unofficial 1.042 patch though (even if that is the version number Steam is showing, do still install it, it's different), and also the "KillerApp MOD". It adds additional options and provides current era screen resolutions among other things which you can choose during install. There are several websites you can get this, but a simple Google search will take you there. There are some very helpful guides here in the Hub that will assist you with issues. You can also play with your GPUs driver settings and add AA/AF etc. to  smoothen the game out further. Given the intended 70s/80s era graphics, the game almost looks current with those tweaks.\n\nAs far as FPS/RPG games go, this is certainly one that should be in everyone's hall of fame! For the current asking price, on offer or not, you cannot go wrong.","October 11, 2014","true","2.2"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","59","67","0","0"

The game just is so much better with them.\n\nThis game is just unique and amaizng. You play as Jet who gets sent into the Tron world and must find out not only why he is there but what is going on in the digital world. The music and sound effects are just fantastic. This game simply would not be what it is without the soundtrack. Most of the voices that you hear are very good especially the icp cernal. I am not really a fan of first person rpgs but this game is really easy to play. There are quick saves as well as autosaves at the begining of every level which help keep the game fair. The main weapon you will use is your disk which you can manipulate to bounce off of things and hit enemies in really interesting way. The story is actually really good which is surprising because the original Tron was not that great of a story. PLEASE GRAB ALL THE EMAILS YOU CAN FIND OR YOU WILL MISS OUT ON IMPORTANT DETAILS IN THE STORY. Some people say this game does not look all that good but in my opinion the graphics in here stand the test of time due to the unique bright digital look of the game.\n\nThe game probably took me about 15 hours to beat even though steam does not have the time recorded due to me using the killer app mod to play. I played on hard and I would recomend you do to because it is just the right amount of difficulty without going overboard.\n\nI am going to share one of my favorite parts. MINOR SPOILER WARNING: At one point Jet loses his disk and must stealthly take out guards to retrieve it. This section is really fun and rewarding once you get your disk back.","November 10, 2014","true","2.1"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

A critical darling from 2003 that, for whatever reason, failed to gain any sort of traction with gamers at release, it's one of the most unique FPS games you'll play, both visually and mechanically.\n\nIt's pretty difficult, and hails from a time before checkpoints every 30 seconds, so be prepared to familiarize yourself with quick save (F5) and quick load (F9) keys, at least in the early game before your character gets fully equipped with weapons (primitives) and perks (called sub-routines here).\n\nIf you decide to take the plunge on this one, I recommend taking the time to install the Killer App mod (there's a full guide in the community guide section) to enable widescreen support (and resolutions like 1920x1080) and force some AA through your graphics control panel.  In high resolution the smooth, sharp lines and glaring neon of the abstract TRON universe have never looked better.  Not bad for a game over a decade old!\n\nI genuinely can't recommend this game highly enough, and at a current cost equivalent to about two pints of beer here in the UK, it's an absolute bargain.  Also light cycles, nuff said.\n\nEND OF LINE","October 12, 2014","true","1.8"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","38","42","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeug/recommended/327740/","dxeug","Dxeug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dxeug/","560 products in account","Highly recommended; This is a truly classic FPS. I keep coming back and re-playing it every couple of years, because it had a mixture of really great game mechanics that few FPSen have come close to in subsequent years. As a bonus, the fact that it's set in Tron's computer-world means that, visually, the game has aged uncommonly well compared to its contemporaries. That world was so fundamentally fantastical to begin with-- lots of bright colors and stark angles-- and was so well presented, that even with modern eyes it still looks beautiful because the graphics were never trying to be "realistic" even when they were state-of-the-art.\n\nNotably, it has some of the most satisfyingly different combat of any FPS I've played-- the basic disc combat is really fun, and the various other weapons and modifications you get access to as the game goes on add just enough mix-and-match to the experience to keep it interesting. If there's one thing I can say against the combat, it's that many enemies use discs, so you're encouraged to keep it primed as your default weapon in case you need to block. It's therefore easy to fall into the trap of just defaulting to disc combat all the time, particularly since the other weapons require you to spend precious energy to fire them. I also like the progression system. Your "subroutines" (equipment) take up space and each "server" (game level) has a certain configuration of available space for you to use, so there's an interesting subgame of fitting your subroutines into your available resources. It doesn't often become onerous, but it does reward clever allocation and optimization.\n\nIt has the obligatory lightcycle matches, as all Tron games are contractually obligated to include. These are fun in themselves, but as a part of the game as a whole, they feel like one of the few weak points-- they're not very strongly integrated with the rest of the game and don't carry a lot of excitement for me. Still, they're not enough of a blemish to inhibit my deep love for the game. The writing isn't terrible, but the voice acting varies between "ok but pretty hammy" and "obviously read flat off a list with no context at all", which may be a bit of a put-off. As for the plot: I'm a huge Tron fan who was mildly disappointed but not completely put off by Tron Legacy, and I feel like Tron 2.0 has a much better claim to being a "sequel" than Legacy did.\n\nI've only tried multiplayer a few times, with limited success due to technical issues, so I can't speak too much to that side of it yet. The disc combat mechanics have a lot of potential for multiplayer though, so I look forward to giving the multiplayer a proper spin now that it's on Steam.\n\nLast word: Everyone who plays first-person shooters should play this game at least once, because the unique game mechanics are well worth exploring. If you're a Tron fan or other nerdy type who will enjoy the goofy plot and tongue-in-cheek nerd jokes, that's a nice bonus.\n\nLast-er word: I want one of those lasers please.","November 23, 2014","true","13.4"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","0"

The music and sounds just complete this feeling.\n\nThe story is wonderful and this game is the real sequel to the 80s movie (no wonder with both scripts were written by the same person).

But I'm going to just cast all that aside and give you my honest opinion.\n\nIf you lived around the 1990's, you know Duke Nukem, Eradicator, Heretic/HeXen and a plethora of other FPS Puzzlers. I would honestly say give this game a shot, there are hidden areas and finding the Build Points is another part of the challenge since there are -100- of them in the game.\n\nMoving over to the story aspect, you get new faces who are basically one-trick-ponies that appear, but you also get some memorable faces like some of the security programs (and yes I know everyone is going to make comparisons to SARK from the first movie) and another big bad who you should probably play the game to find out WHO they are. In fact: less that 2 minutes in and you find out who they are. Not a bad thing honestly, it helps you piece things together and the E-mails are another thing.\n\nRPG elements: You actually customize yourself, setup your programing and even give yourself more health, energy and so on. Though I think one thing that is kinda a downside to this is that your weapons (not all of them) use energy. So the same things you use to defend yourself you also gotta use them for treasure hunting. Okay, good and bad. Teaches a player to not go all willy nilly because they got 30 ammo boxes lying around.\n\nThere aren't a TON of weapons but there certainly are a lot. Plus, it's easy to tell if you got too many corrupted programs and what not.\n\nGet this, and play this for yourself.\n\nThis gets a 5/5 on my charts.\n\nThe Controls are VERY fluid and having 3 optimized graphical settings is a NICE touch just to give us speed over it being pretty.","December 7, 2014","true","19.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

Tron 2.0 is one of the best FPS games ever made.\n\nWritten in 2003, long before Tron: Legacy was thought of, this was the original spiritual successor story for the Tron universe. You follow and play at Jet Bradley, lowly developer at EnCom and son of Alan Bradley (Tron from the first movie). After the events of the original movie, Flynn has moved on to other projects and Alan has archived off the digitization process so similar events can't happen again. The Encom security officer, Thorne, contracted by a rival company FCon (Future Control Industries) to break into the system and steal the digitization algorithms are part of a takeover attempt of Encom by FCon. Jet gets caught in the crossfire and digitized into the system. What follows is a server to server hopping of over 20+ levels in an attempt to free your father and restore order to the systems.\n\nThe only real negative is that Tron 2.0 isn't great out of the box off of steam. There are two patches to apply and make sure to force V-Sync *on* in game (I also had to force it on my video card) to prevent stuttering around enemies.\n\nOnce the game is configured correctly with patches it's an FPS masterpiece. The game and story are very linear, but that's to be expected in an early 2000s FPS. The story and voice acting are quite enjoyable, as the music is top notch.\n\nIn game, the progression has RPG elements to it as you upgrade your firmware to get better abilities, better weapons, etc. But there's only a limited amount of space on your disc so there's some give and take of what you decide to run as your loadout. It's a very well done system.\n\nLook for about 12-15 hours on a playthrough.\n\nHonestly, I can't really say anything bad about Tron 2.0, except that there never was a Tron 3.0.","May 24, 2015","true","13.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Part of the reason I give the game a pass is because I'm a huge TRON fanboy. It's a shallow reason certainly, but what can I say? This game knows how to play upon my nostalgia.\n\nThe plot is unnecessarily convoluted. There's a hostile corporate takeover, data-wraiths, algorithms, corrupted programs, tons of callbacks to the movie, and a lot of other nonsense. All you really need to know is that you're zapped into the computer world. This is a classic-styled FPS, with multiple stages, some exploration, and various equipment upgrades to collect. In keeping with the original movie's theme, everything is a reference to computers & the internet. One of the villains is known as the Kernel, you use a sniper rifle called an LOL, and...ugh...you get the idea.\n\nAs with most other FPS titles, TRON 2.0 provides numerous weapons. However, they give you the best one right at the beginning. The disc works in just about any situation (even boss-fights), and it's entirely possible to beat the game using it. Get the sequencer upgrade and you can throw multiple discs at once, which is practically game-breaking. The rest of the weapons are usually situational, such as using LOL to protect a program from far away. Still, there is some value to trying everything out, because ammo is constantly available.\n\nAside from the usual "run around, collect keys, and kill stuff" levels, there are also light-cycles. The light-cycle is based off of one of the mini-games from the arcade version of TRON. The goal is to make your opponents crash into your jetwalls. The differences (aside from better graphics and camera controls) include power-ups and some changes in the mechanics, such as speeding up when you're close to a jetwall. The AI tends to be amazing in their inconsistency. Either they pull off a wicked stunt and blow you away, or they crash into a wall when you're a mile away. All told, it's a good addition to the game. It provides a nice break, and doesn't become overbearing.\n\nFor the most part the game is merely alright. The mechanics are solid enough and the levels are reasonably-paced. Unfortunately there are some aspects that don't really work. Take for example, the enemy variety. One constant that I've noticed is everyone attacks in groups. You'll fight some corrupted programs, and then some ICPs. You'll tangle with some ICPs, and then some data-wraiths. You'll attack some resource hogs, and then some ICPs. Each enemy has their own weapon, but they never mix things up. For example: you won't fight a corrupted alongside an ICP. There are story reasons for this I'm aware, but it makes for less intricate battles.\n\nContinuing on the issues with combat, I can't overlook that a large number of enemies, just aren't fun to fight. The corrupted throw around tons of splash-damage weapons that ruin your equipment, forcing you to run anti-virus programs to fix them. Data-wraiths are a nuisance due to their camo and rapid-fire weapons. There are also seekers that can hit you from anywhere, as long as you're visible to them. It's also unfortunate that if you can get the drop on a crowd, the battle is always yours. Prolonged fights are few and far between. This is also why I like using the disc so much. The disc-play is really well-done. You can block enemy discs, exploit openings, and quickly wipe out adversaries. The few boss-fights in the game are pretty weak, especially the kernel.\n\nDespite my issues with the game, I thought it was enjoyable enough. The music is really good, the visuals still hold up rather well, and a remarkable amount of love is shown for fans of the movie. However, you might not be willing to put up with a confusing story, somewhat dull combat, and potential quicksave abuse. The heavy fall damage and platforming can result in a number of cheap deaths. Treat this game as an experience and you'll derive a bit of enjoyment out of it. Just don't go in expecting too much.\n\nOh and definitely grab the Killer App mod.","March 9, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Personally, this game was my childhood. When I didn't even knew how to speak English properly, I was already putting my face in front of a fan so my voice would come out as funny as the programs did in-game.\n\nTRON 2.0 is an RPG'ish First Person Shooter with Occasional Grid Racing moments. You have 4 primitive weapons : A Disk, the "Frisbee" that can be used either as a weapon or a shield. A Rod, the "melee shock batom". Ball, the.. ugh, I never got what the hell was that, honestly. And a Mesh, the sub-machine energy gun. These primitive weapons can be turned into deadliest ones when upgraded, for instance, the Rod can transform into a sniper named "LOL", and the Primitive Disk can become a Sequencer...hence the name.\n\nWhen you find enough build points or complete enough objectives to level your character, Jethro (Jet) Bradley, you can choose to upgrade specs such as energy amount, hit points, weapon efficiency and others. There are also routines that you can find, upgrade and equip to enhance your character, making him faster, jump higher, having more energy to fire upgraded weapons, being able to see enemy stats, increasing overall damage, reducing incoming damage... there are a lot, trust me.\n\nThe game is linear, the campaign has a permission system so you can only advance levels after obtaining certain keys and completing objectives, but each level is so well designed and entertaining that finding permissions come as something natural, not tiresome. Combat is fun and responsive with any weapon ( maybe not the ball... joking ) and some levels are more combat-based while others are slower, platforms or puzzle-ish. there are some Light Cycle sessions that blends perfectly with the story sequence, and you can launch these races from the Menu as well, no campaign checkpoint required, you can even customize your vehicle, color and model ( only two models by the way ).\n\nThe characters are sure to be memorable, Jet and Alan do feel related, Mercury is forever in my heart, and Thorne... 10 Years later he still give me the creeps. You're not gonna meet too much programs (NPCs) here, but the one's you do, you'll remember.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, this game introduced the Glow graphic technology, so for today standards it might look a little bit too-glowish, but aside this and some low-rez textures ( again, for today standards ), this game still-looks-fantastic! Seriously, check my screenshots.\n\nMultiplayer is dead, obviously, BUT, there are servers up and you can easily search on steam forums for people to play with, it might sound silly, but blocking someone's disk and trowing another right at their face, NO BETTER FEELING. You must try it once!\n\nIn short, this game may have been shadowed by other launches like Halo at the time, but it shines, and it does so much that I must tell you that if you're into Tron or anything-computers... JUST BUY THIS. It even has trading cards now!\n\ntl;dr\n\nThe Good  Unique Visual Style\nSolid Gameplay\nCatchy Atmosphere\n1982's Movie References\nA True TRON Sequence & Experience\nLight Cycles!\nSuper Light Cycles!!!Not that good...

While I like Tron Legacy, I feel that the story in Tron 2.0 is far better.  I heard that the story in Tron 2.0 was originally going to be canon, but was then abandoned for Tron: Legacy.  In my opinion, this was a big mistake.\n\nIf you like Tron, do yourself a favor and get this game!  It's a fantastic FPS-style game in the Tron universe with interesting ways to develop your character.  You gain "build points" by fullfilling objectives and finding hidden items... this serves as experience points.  Once you get so many build points, you go up a version number... which is like gaining a level.  Once you go up a version number you can distribute points towards your stats.\n\nYou find downloadable subroutines throughout the game which are basically your skills.  You have limited space on your disk for installing your subroutines so you need to be selective of which ones to install.  You can install/uninstall subroutines as you wish, so you can adjust them based on the situation.  While fighting a virus, you can become infected if you are hit.  If your subroutines are infected, they can become "glitchy" until you use an antivirus to disenfect them.  Sometimes the glitches can cause some interesting and somewhat humerous effects.  But you need to disinect your infected subroutines as quickly as possible as the infection will spread to other subroutines.\n\nThere's light cycles (the old style that can only turn at 90 degree angles), disc battles, and lots of modern computer lingo incorporated into the virtual world that gives the Tron universe a life like it has never had before.  I believe this game is a must buy for anyone that is a fan of Tron.","October 13, 2014","true","4.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It could in many ways be seen as the middle child between AvP2 and F.E.A.R\n\nWhile it didn't sell well and was canonically retconned by Tron Legacy. It is still a very well made first person shooter. The environments are absolutely stellar and have aged very well for a game from 2003, it really makes you feel like you're inside of a computer. Different enemies can affect the player in different ways. Viral enemies for instance you have to watch out for since they can infect your subroutines and force you to disinfect your weapons and abilities manually. The game is very well animated and each of the protagonist's weapons and abilities are upgradeable. Outside of just the first person shooter elements the game also has lightcycle segments just like in the film.\n\nLastly, Tron 2.0 has very engaging multiplayer, which actually runs to this day thanks to a very handy mod called the "Killer App" mod.

Several of said games are nothing more than cynical copy-paste gameplay cash-crabs to exploit the current movies hype and as predicted, these games are usually f"*king terrible.\n\nNow, what happens when a resourceful and experienced developer gets their hands on an old franchise and attempt to revitalize it? "Why, such feat has never been accomplished!" I hear you cry.. But, what if I told you it had been already done? Almost 12-years ago in fact...\n\n\nPersonally I never owned the original release of TRON 2.0, but if I had the option I would have. This is a wonderful action experience faithful to its source-material, complete with hammy acting and generic plot.\n\nFor some reason I cannot help but to love the art-style of 2.0, maybe its that colourfull low-poly feel that everything has. Much like the old TRON film, (Which I have watched and find decent.) there is a great deal of flat-colors highlighted with crisp straight lines of contrasting neons and the way that is represented in the game is equally nice. The added transparency effects and other details including glow and lighting, faithfully augment the art-style.\n\n\nHowever, I must not be blinded by the bug-light of pretty art-style, oh nonono... I must also talk about the gameplay, for this is an action-title. Therefore, talking to a length about it, is only logical..\n\n\nWell, the action in TRON 2.0 is very similar to Monoliths Aliens vs Predator 2. (One of my personal favorites..) On the fact that most of the weapons feel the same, the disc, "rifle" and "shotgun" to be precise. Don't take this as a negative criticism, I in fact enjoyed the familiar feel that I got from the weapons and with that was quick to adapt to their pros and cons. The most notable difference between the two games is that TRON seems to encourage movement around the area, when AVP2 (most notable on the Marines side) is a very narrowed linear experience.\n\nthat freedom of movement is also seen in the levels, they are rather expansive for what they are and encourage exploration. However, in a very limited way. However, there seems to be only one way to approach the situations and with that narrow the players possibilities on engagement.\n\nIn a few instances, the narrow passages became very crowded from the attacking forces and I died a few times. However after moving around instead of sitting on my thumbs up my peripheral-port, I finally found a way around the encounter. However with some scripted events, these little annoyances mount up rather hastily.\n\n\nIn all, the action in 2.0 is very satisfying although a bit repetitive. Certain parts might appear impassable, but there are ways around it. But I'd still recommend to save the game at the start of every level, just in case something goes wrong or some valuable equipment is missing.\n\n\nIs there anything else to talk about? I can't really talk about the plot, since I'm doing my best to avoid story spoilers for those who want it in their games. (Like me) But, let's just say if you want a... hmmh... DECENT sequel to the old TRON flick, you can give this one a look. It might not be the best, but it's still better than the borefest of EVOLUTION...\n\nDEVOLUTION.. There, I managed to keep it in this far..\n\n\n\nRECAP:\n\nTRON 2.0 is an enjoyable little action title, even with its minor shortcomings. And manages to deliver a rather decent in-universe spin-off of TRON.\nFor those looking for a worthwhile action experience, that gives the movie-licensed games credit. Have a look at TRON 2.0.\n\n:::::PREPARE FOR DIGITIZATION:::::\n.....\n.....\n:::::LASER READY:::::\n.....\n:::::FIRING:::::","December 26, 2015","true","10.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Now, quite a few years later, and with a decent pc, I picked this up for $5 on sale. This game is what a Tron game should be!  As soon as you start playing, you are immedialtley sucked into the original thematic world of Tron.\n\nThe game is very representative of the feel, and overall vibe, of the first movie, and if you are a Tron fan...that is a wonderful thing.  The colors jump out out you in stark contrast to the background.  With all the details turned up, the light trails and glow effects look simply amazing, even by todays standards.\n\nSure, it may nor look like the newest fps with dynamic environments, physics, and 9 million shader effects, but thats the thing....it isn't supposed too.  What it does is succeed where so many film themed games fail, it actually captures the feel and look of the source material, adding new elements to the world, but not diminshing the overall effect of being in the world.\n\nThe visual style is what holds the game together, and walking around the environment is so satisfying due to the designs inspired by Syd Mead.  You can see his designs all around you.  Also, yes, you have the light cycles!  Not only do you get what I believe is the best looking and screen acurate model of the original bike, you get the new 2.0 version, which is pretty sweet.  The light cycles can be played as a stand alone game also, so you can't go wrong there.\n\nWhen you are playing you realize that it is a bit harder than maybe first thought.  You have Jet's identity disc, my favorite weapon, plus the rod, sphere primitives.  They each have pros and cons, and all recquire energy to use....except the disc!  Honestly, the feel of throwing that in the world of Tron, smacking a bad guy in the face and watching, and hearing, him derezz is worth the price of admission alone.  The visuals on the disc are spot on, with the disc leaving trails and then returning to you to thro once more.\n\nSpeaking of derezzing someone, the sound design is freaking awesome!  The music is so evocative of the Wendy Carlos synth score, I could listen to it outside of the game, and the sound effects are perfect.  From the sound of your footsteps, to the discs flying through the air, to the deresolution of baddies, it is a large part of the overall success of the game as a whole.  Also, having Bruce Boxleitner do the Alan Bradley character is a monster plus for me.\n\nAs with anyt gane, there are some downsides, but for me, they are very minor.  Due to the age of this game, there does not seem to be an option to get 16:9 widescreen.  But, that is a minor point, and does not detract form the fun. The only other thing that would be cool is third person view, but again, minor points. Overall, this game is a great fps game.\n\nSo, is it worth the buy, even if it is quite a few years old? Yes, especially if you are a Tron fan.  Seriously, if you haven't bought this, just get it, it is the closest I think fans will get to being inside the world of Tron.  I'm so glad that I picked this up, it is one of the most satisfying games I have played in a while....thanks Steam for having it onsale...nice one!\n\nBest. Tron game. Ever.  (next to the original coin op and Discs of Tron!)\nHope this review helps.\n\nRed","December 7, 2014","true","14.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Reynolds/recommended/327740/","Brian_Reynolds","Brian Reynolds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Reynolds/","620 products in account","Wow... what a grand day it is to have this archived on Steam!\n\nI'll tell you up front, -this is one of my favorite games of all time, and I played it to death in 2003.  Why should you care though?  What makes it worth playing nowadays?  Well, TRON 2.0 can be appreciated on two levels: first as a fully worthwhile sequel to the original 1982 movie TRON, and the second as a genuinely polished and entertaining FPS shooter.\n\nTRON 2.0 was released roughly coinciding with the 20th anniversary of TRON when Disney was testing the waters for how much enthusiasm existed for the property.  The greenlight for the 2010 movie TRON Legacy was still years away and so for awhile this game represented the only real sequel TRON was ever likely to see.  Fortunately game technology and know-how had advanced enough that this project could legitimately tell a movie-like story rather than consisting of just a series of arcade sequences strung out in sequence.  Considering the movie's age it's amazing this game was made at all, but even more impressive is just how dedicated the developers were to the concept.  TRON 2.0 is PACKED TO THE GILLS with love for the original movie, but never in a cloying, indulgent manner.  The developers' obvious respect and enthusiasm for the universe, dare I say it, glows in every story moment and visual idea.  The storytelling takes the computer fantasy setting and keeps the same balance of programmer nerd knowledge and general approachability while throwing in subtle nods to the fans ("You mind if I have some of your popcorn?") along with just a genuinely fun sense of humor like when you start getting spam messages upon crossing over to the internet city or when you get to see an imaginative take on what certain computer actions look like from the inside.  The art direction takes every original design concept and expands on it tenfold in scale so that the world feels vast and beautiful.  There is so much imagination in the computerized landscape, architecture, clouds, and settings that your eyes will constantly be finding something fun to latch onto and appreciate.  I personally laughed in delight at the sly choice of a late 1970's color palette for the ancient Encom Mainframe levels.  The music takes the Wendy Carlos source and embelishes it with completely relevant new material and the sound effects are extremely faithful to the movie with special surprises like the Atari 2600 tank explosion sounds.  If I could boil the whole experience down to just one word I'd use "FUN", just like that in all capital letters.  I emphasize "FUN" because if you've seen TRON Legacy or played TRON Evolution you know how those experiences changed the focus to "serious / thrilling".\n\nThe story presented here takes places about 21 years after the original movie completed.  There's barely a mention of the Master Control Program but lots of time spent developing the character of Alan Bradley and the relationship he has with his son, Jet, whom you play.  New characters are added throughout and these are the true highlights of the whole experience as I spent my entire time moving through the game to find out what happened to Ma3a, listen to Byte's sarcasm, watch with amusement the changes Mercury goes through, and to get a little more entertainment in seeing modern day Alan Bradley wearing the original TRON costume.  I was also very impressed by the breadth of the story being told and the cleverness with which the writers built your story expectations up and then played them out to differing conclusions such as when villains are revealed and then subverted, inverted, and shifted.  The game ultimately has multiple stories in play at once and each of them is given enough attention to feel satisfactory.  By the time the game ends you'll feel like you've never once been short changed... well, except for the VERY end where I felt the story ended on more of a primetime sitcom note than what the movie would have achieved.\n\nIn discussing the gameplay, I'd describe it as an exploration game wearing the clothes of an FPS shooter.  Unlike many modern FPS games you're not hurtled through a linear experience at break-neck speeds and there's rarely ever a timer putting pressure on you to get things done as fast as possible.  In fact most of the game encourages, if not flat out requires you to scour the levels in search of a multitude of "permission keys" to unlock progress barriers.  This has the dual effect of giving you the chance to see all the nooks and crannies of a level while also reducing the initial impressive sense of scale.  There will always be some sort of opposition to your progress, usually in terms of combat opportunities but there's also a lot of platforming jumping obstacles which were less fun to deal with.  A few times you'll also encounter "puzzles" which don't take any mental leaps to solve beyond trial and error but they do serve to add some occasional variety to your tasks.  Movement speed is a little slow for my taste especially while engaging the opposition rendering it impossible to be agile and dodge much, but the slowness does help the exploratory vibe.  Combat offers a truly unique experience since your primary weapon is the iconic TRON disc which functions as a sort of guided missle pistol, meaning that you won't be able to do much rapid-fire actions and you'll actually be left completely vulnerable if you screw up and miss your target.  There are lots of other weapons you can gain over time but in practice I've found them superfluous since they use up your energy reserves faster than the disc and are more specialized in application while the disc in contrast is pretty useful under all situations.  On the note of "iconic Tron elements" you'll also get to take the controls of the Light Cycles at several times which is a double-edged sword here.  While the light cycle gameplay is exactly what you would hope for the experience also hails from the old-school "arcade hard" mode of play and quite often as a newcomer you'll make a mistake or be shut out without fully understanding what happened or how to avoid it.  The difficulty isn't game-breaking hard and you should be able to progress beyond them without too much hair pulling, but these sequences are disproportionally harder than the rest of the game is and so the developers patched in an option to skip past these sequences if you're too frustrated.\n\nA terrific addition to the game is the minor RPG levelling process you can undergo.  In keeping with the computer-speak the game is saturated with your character can locate different "build points" that allow you to upgrade both your primary attributes (health, energy, proficiency) along with your weapons, armor, and assorted enhancement "subroutines".  These improvements are dolled out slowly but surely and give you both a satisfying sense of improved capabilities but also provide a great incentive for you to go treasure hunting to seek out all the different bits per level that will provide the boosts.  There is even a bit of strategic thinking going on with the upgrades you can do to your "subroutines" as you have limited opportunities to boost these attributes based on your preferred gameplay style.  By the end of the game I had the unusual gameplay feeling of actually *BEING* a heroic figure whose abilities were demonstrably stronger than the opposition.  Ordinarily in games there's a disappointing level of progression in your character growth, -your skills and weapon abilities will definitely expand but so too does the opposition so that despite your badass development you might end up feeling weaker than you did at the very start of the game when you had nothing.  Not with TRON 2.0.  At the end I felt like I was truly more than a match for the opposition and that I wasn't just trying to get back home but I had an obligation to help the world by stopping the villians.\n\nI have so much to say I'll have to continue into the comments section","October 17, 2014","true","18.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","5"

I played this game back when it originally came out and absolutely loved it.  I've been telling people for years how great a game Tron 2.0 was and how they were missing out.  This game is an absolute gem!\n\nTron 2.0 kinda came out under the proverbial radar when it was released.  When it launched, it was reported to be an official sequel to the original movie and it was said to be from a script from a movie that never got greenlit.  First and foremost I must point out that this is NOT Tron Legacy so don't expect to see anything from there.  After the release of Legacy the game was deemed non-canon and shuffled away.  It is a real shame that the second movie wasn't based off the game because it was monumentally better.  Ironically enough, both could take place and it wouldn't need a lot of ret-conning but I digress.\n\nTron 2.0 has you stepping into the shoes of Jethro "Jet" Bradley son of Alan&Lora Bradley.  Bruce Boxleitner reprises his role and actress Cindy Morgan (Lora) provides the voice of the artificial intelignce Ma3a who accompanies Jet through the game.  Additional voice talent is provided by Rebecca Romjin (Mystique of the X-Men trilogy) and David Scully (Sgt Johnson of Halo).\n\nThe levels are beautifully done up and absolutely breathtaking.  Many features/concepts are updated for the times.  For example the Kernel is in charge of the computer system Jet first encounters.  There are also numerous easter eggs and nods to things from the original movie as well as poking fun at computers (IE at one point Jet access the internet and the screen starts filling up with garbage text until he activates a spam filter) which gets a laugh.\n\nYour character levels up as you progress through the game and you acquire new programs.  These programs can be upgraded and slotted to your active wheel at any time so you can adjust what passive/active abillities you are using whenever necessary.  Weapons in the game stay themed and are uniquely designed despite being obligatory sniper rifle, grenade launcher, etc.  These weapons can also be modified to accomadate different ammo types as you progress.  The most unique weapon by far is the Identiy Disc.  This iconic weapon when thrown will arc around and return on its own or be manually recalled by you.  This mechanic makes for some very interesting shots as you can shoot the disc off in one direction and recall it through enemies/walls.  The disc also serves as an all purpose shield.\n\nWith a great story and breathtaking designs this is a game not to be missed.  The computer nods and jokes thrown in (IE coercing the assitance of a handheld's OS by turning on every feature to drain the battery) will make you laugh.","March 20, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I lost my disc, but the steam version accepts the killer app mod more readily, so it all works out.\n\nIf you've never played Tron 2.0, it's basically a direct sequel to the movie (both were written by the same guy, though Disney retconned 2.0 to be non-cannon so that Legacy would fit in.) The story is pretty good, and for someone with a little programming/networking in their background, the jargon is also entertaining.\n\nIf you've never seen Tron, go watch it first. It may not age well, but it is a classic, and 2.0 makes several callbacks to its predecessor that are good for a few laughs.\n\nIf you're wondering about gameplay, Tron 2.0 is an old game that plays like Quake III, except with disc (lazer frisbee) weapons. The lightcycle stages are equal parts frustrating trial and error, and lightning reactions.\n\nI love this game, but there's a lot of "where do I go now" and "****! So close!" for new players. All in all, the story is the best part of the experience. I recommend it, but you might want to play on easy/with cheats/quicksave a lot if you're easily frustrated.","January 20, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've read that a lot of Tron fans, hated the game.  I was born in that era and love the first Tron film (the second was ok, but a missed opportunity), and I love this game as well.  As far as game play goes, it reminds me a whole lot of No One Lives Forever and Dark Forces II: Jedi Knights, but in the world of Tron.  And in my opinion, they recreated that world exceptionally well.  I also enjoy the skills that are available, and the skill progression is good as well.  I've also read that the light cycle part of the game was impossibly hard.  Maybe they nerf'd it for the steam release, because I didn't find it hard at all.  Then again, I played the heck out of light cycles on the original Tron arcade game.  That was hard.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable game, especially if you enjoy games like I mention above.  Certainly worth the $10 it's being offered at.\n\n--  Update:  Ok, I've just finished this game, putting in over 30 hours and let me put this simply.  If you've ever as a kid (or even as an adult), watched the movie Tron, then went around holding a frisbee just hoping for a chance at a light disc battle, do yourself a favor.  Stop reading right now, go buy this game and play it.  You can become a disc wielding god of derezzolution!  I really can't put into words how much enjoyment I got runnning around the levels just looking for a fight to pick, which there was plenty of, but also some quieter areas to allow you to enjoy the beauty of the world that was created.\n\nI have read some comments about a lack of updated texture packs, or lack of anti-aliasing.  Graphics make a good looking game, but it does not define a great game, in my opinion.  The enviroment felt believable (in a 2003 graphics kind of way) and enjoyable.  I felt as though I had been pulled into the Tron universe.  The only time that illusion was broken for me, was during the light cycle levels, where the camera retracted to a 3rd person view.  However, I did discover the 1st person view, and that immerson returned, but it does make those levels significantly more difficult to complete.  I stayed in 1st person view for the light cycles for the remainder of the game, and it was FAR from the impossible it was described as.  Maybe we have gotten spoiled as gamers, or maybe they really did nerf the levels.  In any case, I enjoyed the light cycle portions enough, that I made special save files for the sections right before the light cycles, so I can play them again.\n\nI don't give 10//10 to anything.  For me, that would require perfection, which would be nearly impossible.  I do however, in all seriousness, give it a 9/10.  To put that into perspective, here are some other games I would give 9/10.  Crysis (the first one), Morrowind, Bioshock, Mass Effect (the first one), GTA: San Andreas, Saints Row: The Third, X-Com (the 1994 Original), Wing Commander (the original.. very dated controls and graphics, but very immersive for it's time) Star Wars Dark Forces II: Jedi Knights, Star Wars Jedi Knights: Jedi Academy, No One Lives Forever.  There are others, but hopefully this gives you an idea of what I like.  These games bring me back to them over and over again because they are just purely fun to play.  I will definitely play this one again, once I've convinced my family I'm still alive.","October 12, 2014","true","34.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Replayed recently, but haven’t finished yet.\n\nYes, it’s old. Doesn’t matter, you can still get it on Steam, and I have it installed. That’s the list I’m starting this series with, just for lack of better ideas.\n\nMy feelings about this game are kind of mixed. Before this one, if somebody had told me there was going to be a sequel to a movie I liked, but it was going to be a videogame, I’d have vomited blood. Movie/game tie-ins that respect neither medium are pretty common, and back then it was normal to believe it impossible to do better. To go as far as making an actual sequel would seem preposterous. By using a franchise where it seemed natural to try, they made a good game and paved the way for other people to try it with other properties. It’s fair to call it a classic on this basis. On top of that, it certainly had excellent graphics for the time, as evidenced by the fact that back then, I had to upgrade specifically to play it. That presentation has aged very well, aided by the style inherent to the series and an excellent fan-made upgrade, which is a necessity if you want to play today.*\n\nDespite that, I’m not sure how vociferously I’d recommend somebody who doesn’t have it to buy it now. If you’re a fan of the series, definitely do it. I love Tron: Legacy, but this is what the original’s creator intended the sequel to be, and it has more soul if you ask me. Even if you’re not attached to Tron that much, the setting is beautifully interesting and the story they tell in it is good, if you can stomach all the corn the dialogue and its somewhat flat delivery will force you to eat.\n\nThe trouble (which some might see as a bonus) is that its gameplay is representative of the period. Regardless of how pretty the graphics were, gameplay in FPS got stuck for a while after Half-Life. Everyone knew Find the Key maze shooters were dead, and were trying to jam in-engine story presentation in at the same time as they were struggling with what to do next in terms of game and level design. Between that and the characteristically dumb AI of the time, the result was an odd mash of jumpy arcade action, (which I’ve always had a smaller appetite for than most) frustratingly Xen-ish platforming, and not-criminally-bad stealth opportunities. Tron is just such a transitional work, so if you’re not nostalgic for Goldeneye, you won’t enjoy it the same way. I think it’s worth playing even by modern standards, mind, it’s just that how much you’d be willing to pay might be affected by that.\n\nBottom Line: $30 for me, $15 if you’re not a fan or supernerd.\n\n* If you get it, you’ll need the Killer App mod to get it working on modern systems.","October 16, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Great world building and visual design. More true to the original Tron than the movie and cartoon sequels, definitely.\n\nToo bad disc combat is for the super twitchy. I ended up quickload-dragging myself through this on easy and with cheats, because I found it impossible to block enemy shots with the disc block maneuver (right-clicking through a weird lag). The sound, visual animation, and actual effective timing of the block motion seemed to be completely independent of each other, making this essential combat maneuver impossible to pull off. Was the original Windows installable release like this?\n\nI'm recommending this game primarily as a wonderful color-burst of nostalgia. And godspeed to anyone who can pull off the disc block. Maybe you can actually play through the game as the developers intended.\n\nAnd also the awesome computer puns. Hearing the other light cycle pilots insult Jet's program-worthiness was priceless.

This is an utterly unforgiving game, but once yopu get the gist of how the game plays, this will provide hours of screaming, hair pulling and psychosis inducing thrashing.  Utterly worth it.\nAlso, this game IS DATED (surprise, surprise) but then if you look at this game and how it looks for its age, the truth of the matter becomes clear - this was a work of genius far supassing the likes of Call of Duty or Battlefield with a fraction of the programmers and auxilleries involved.\nThis is a game from an era when games were finished, tested and true to their source material and with some of the naration it utterly shows - Hey, they got the original Tron in to the game (Bruce Boxleitner) and it feels like he was enjoying the opportunity.\n\nStill not sure?  Well, then it's clear you don't have what it takes to finish this piece of FPS history.  Find some frilly pants and accept your failure as a gamer.  :D","November 2, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slayve/recommended/327740/","Slayve","The Milkman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slayve/","270 products in account","TRON 2.0 is one of those games where for the first few hours you're thinking, "Eff yeah, this game is great! Why don't more people talk about it?" Then you get to a frustrating light cycle section and your confidence in the game is shaken. But then you have a few more hours of well-designed levels, fun new weapons, and interesting story, and you're back on board. And then you hit one of the three or four really bad boss fights and you start to suspect maybe there's a reason you don't hear so many people talking about this game. But you keep at it because the art is super cool (and has aged quite well for a 12-year-old game), the music is great, and you loved TRON as a kid and feel you owe it to 12-year-old you to see this thing to the end. And you do, but not without making some compromises, like finding the cheat codes to top off your health from time to time (the boss fights are really tedious) and even skip a section here and there (I admit, I'm rubbish at the light cyle sections).\n\nIn the end, though, I'm really glad I stuck with it. I was surprised at the depth of the character ability progression, which was really ahead of its time. Every shooter does it now, but I can't think of anyone doing it back in 2003. But I think the best thing I can say about TRON 2.0 is that it evokes the movie so well that I had a big nostalgia grin on my face for most of the 17 hours it took me to finish it.

This classic is one I always enjoyed playing back before I registered for Steam.\n\nTron 2.0 takes you on a first-person improbably journey into the world inside your computer and has you fight against an army of corrupted scripts, stop digitized hackers trying to take over the system (and the world), escape the wrath of a rogue A.I. that is programmed to destroy any and all users, and become part of a storyline that encompasses the worlds inside and outside the computer.\n\nThe graphics, while slightly simplistic compared to what we see today, invoke the spectacle and wonder given to us by the Disney masterpiece this game is based off of, and while a FPS style, thanks to the clever Subroutines mechanic, the skills you learn throughout the story can become stronger as you upgrade them, and they become swapable as needed and as you enter new systems.\n\nIf I have one complaint with this game, it is with how they've implemented the Light Cycle sections throughout the game. Controlling the camera is clunky at best, especially since you're in third-person for the match and you need to be able to see the arena around you in order to be able to stand a chance. Also, the computer opponents have a distinct advantage over you in that they can make turns faster and sharper than you can, but it's still satisfying when one of your computer opponents traps themselves in a shrinking loop of their own doing.\n\nEven with the clunky light cycle stages, I highly recommend this game, whether you're a fan of the TRON films or not.","May 27, 2015","true","16.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
