Its an especially good game for kids or teens who want play shoothers but arent allowed or dont want to play M-rated games, but i can also recommend it to just about anybody. the difficulty is quite scalable making it challenging enough for pro`s yet can be simple enough for kids and you can also challenge yourself as a player by speedrunning, ignoring ammo-upgrades, etc.\n\nI have to commend this game for how it handles its license, it doesnt follow the original storyline, you dont get any awkward zoo scene or other unnecessarily cheesy scenes(maybe a few, but not nearly as many as the movie had). the game cuts right to the good part, fighting deadly robotic appliances and you get some neat guns and an electro whip to do it with. the people who made this game knows that film is different from video games and there`s a really healthy dose of fast, fluid gameplay. mouse control works as you`d expect it too from a TPS, gamepad integration is decent. i dont think the controls are the best they can be and you do notice that PC was not the target platform, but its completely playable.\n\ngraphically, it looks decent enough. textures are kind of small, environments are sterile and fairly basic. appliances lok decent though and special effects are pretty good. it also supports 4K resolution through downsampling or Nvidia`s Dynamic Super Resolution and the game is fairly easy to run 4K@60fps. there`s no graphics options for PC other than resolution so shame about that.\n\nthe price is a little high, but if you can get behind that and want to play a fun, fresh shooter-platformer hybrid with high focus on gameplay. G-force doesnt dissapoint, its fairly long too at about 10 hours or so","November 11, 2014","true","23.6"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","36","42","0","0"

Best movie game adaptation to a movie I've ever played. Even though the movie didn't do very well, this game completely blew it out of the park. This one however is completely the opposite. With unique and never before seen gameplay I would highly recomend this game for all gamers. I mean, in what other game can you play as a guinea pig and shoot kitchen appliences while driving in a hamster ball? I would give this game a 10000/10 for awesome as heck gameplay and story.","October 31, 2014","true","8.0"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","26","31","6","0"

I got Disney Mega Pack, and G-Force was definitely NOT one of the games I thought I'd enjoy. Aren't I glad I gave it a try!\n\nIn case you haven't read the description on top of the page:\n\n"G-Force draws you into the adventures of an elite team of trained guinea pigs on a mission to thwart a sinister plot to destroy the world. Take control of both G-Force commander Darwin and his sidekick, Mooch, as they apply their talents to defeat an evil army of altered household appliances."\n\nSounds silly, and it kinda is, but don't let this fool you--this game is good! Here are some pros and cons:\n\nüëç The game mechanics are pretty solid for an action/adventure game.\nüëç You get to collect and use a lot of weapons (flame and ice-throwers, robot-hypnotizer, among other common weapons) and tools (magnet, scanner, activator...) that constantly make the game experience feel fresh.\nüëç Sometimes you even get to control Mooch, a spy fly that will get to the hardest to get areas and open doors for our guinea pig friend.\nüëç Puzzles feel different enough, and they're really nice to solve. You can definitely see the effort put into this.\nüëç There's a good variety of enemies, each requiring a different strategy, so it was always nice fighting them.\nüëç Difficulty level is pretty decent for a game aiming children, and I have to say it's definitely not only for them.\nüëç There's a lot of collectible discs, which will unlock tons of upgrades for you to buy with the money you collect.\nüëç Characters are fun enough for what this game's supposed to be, and the story is a lot better than I had expected. Not that will blow your mind, but it's better than that of many adult games.\nüëç Music is also pretty nice and well-made, although a bit generic.\n\n¬± Everything is indeed a bit on the childish side, but it shouldn't ruin the overall experience.\n¬± I can't really judge that, but it could be slightly hard for younger children.\n\nüëéThe most basic enemies end up being a bit repetitive.\nüëé The game drags a bit too much, and it also ends up being more repetitive than it should.\nüëé Money is a bit unbalanced, since it's limited. I've spent almost no money with healing and ammo (only with upgrades), and I could barely buy everything. I wish I could've bought a bit more ammo, not having to worry about not being able to buy upgrades, or at least knowing that I could grind a bit if I needed more money.","December 16, 2015","true","18.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

For the most part it is well-designed, gives you a shop to buy weapons throughout the game, which gives you a bit of customization for your playthrough, and has really great level and enemy variety. The combat itself is a bit repetitive, but with the shop and the variations in the quests and enemies, they prevent the game from getting too dull. I think that it's not quite worth the price, but if this is ever on a sale I would really recommend for you to pick this up.","July 6, 2015","true","31.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

You play as a guinea pig ! Good stuff.\n\nFYI: The "challenging" mode is much like "normal" mode in other games.\nMost people should use this setting. Also, a piece of advice... Use mooch\nto scout out areas for enemies and other places if you care that much about\nexploring every inch of the game or are a completionist. It does help... A lot.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------- Good game, 9/10","March 10","true","13.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I also cant get feeling out of my head that there is some touch of Duke Nukem 3D in this game, possibliy because of creative weapons like freezer.","January 7","true","0.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"
