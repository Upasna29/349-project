Coming across the last black hole in the galaxy that is close enough to be a risk to Earth, it explodes drawing the Endera and crew towards invititable death. Somehow by luck the ship lands on an unknown object resembling a planet, this is the start of your story. This is not your run of the mill platformer.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3Kad9WqdnI\nOn board was an advanced AI named Auriel, the first to wake up finds herself contained within a PDA and able to have free thoughts, her regulation protocols among other things being destroyed in the crash. Second member of crew to wake up is the coffee boy who you take over as the main character. Your primary objective is salvage enough repair parts to fix the ship and hopefully escape the baron landscapes of the blackhole. Salvage is collected by completion of levels found throughout the larger game world, which also contains a bunch of 'sidequests' like finding lost black box recorders.\n\nLevels do start easier but get quite brutal and quickly, akin to Super Meat Boy. Please don't let that stop you though, most can be passed by collection of 1 salvage piece if you just want to progress the story and thankfully the game had extremely responsive controls. Both local and global timed scoreboards are included for speedrunners and the competitive sorts.\n\nDuring levels Auriel will give you her thoughts on the situation and while trying to steer you in the right direction, at least that's if you trust advanced AI (we all know how portal/RE went). Without dribbling on too much more that is where the game really shines. Story, characters and voicework really draw you while the humour stays both tongue in cheek and witty. Everything about this game screams AAA quality, yet it's indie and very affordable.\n\nHighly recommended if you enjoy platformers/puzzlers or just a heck of a good story along the lines of a Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Cheers folks.","February 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 72 of 97 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","72","97","9","8"

BLACKHOLE is both very rough in places and an excellent, charming, challenging and all around worthwhile platformer and experience. The movement in this game takes a while to master and is very satisfying to start pulling off. While some of the gimmicks are very physics reliant and overly difficult to manage, they are in the minority and the vast majority of levels are a blast to figure out. Luckily the game doesn´t require perfection, and the more aggrevating parts are easily skimmed through. The main mechanic of changing gravity is well used and the levels are often ingeniously designed with it.\n\nThe story and characters really create a complete experience that is more than just a pile of levels strung together, and by the halfway point I was very much invested in the whole effort and loving the humor. There is a good variety of enviroments and it took me 13 hours to finish without doing everything(but also not rushing through it). And there is seemingly a new update right around the corner adding a pile of content.\n\nI couldn´t recommend BLACKHOLE enough.","July 13, 2015","true","16.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

You are going to die many times and sometimes get very frustrated. To lighten up the mood though, you have the adorable crew of Endera and its AI to keep you company.

The developer knew what they wanted and ran with it.\n- The music is fantastic. Just like the art the developer knew what they wanted and executed it with perfection.\n- While a bit fuzzy in parts of the game, the controls are pretty tight.\n- The voice acting is really good for a indie title.\n\nNeutral\n- The game is hard. Really hard. Be prepared for a ton of restarts, retries, and frustration. This will either sell the game for you or make you pass on it.\n\nCons\n- The storytelling is really weak. Very little of what is going on is explained properly.\n- Finding hidden items is required to get backstory and a decent understanding of what is going on.\n- This game is bogged down with needless dialogue. The voice acting is great, however the majority of the speaking lines are not needed. (I'm looking at you Ariel....)\n- The humor tries too hard to be funny.\n\n\nSince Steam doesn't allow a neutral recommendation, I have to lean this recomendations to "Buy It". The artwork and music are fantastic to look at and to listen to. The story is very weak and drowned out by massive amounts of dialogue that don't move the plot forward at all. Don't expect compelling reasons for character actions or an explanation on what is going on.\n\nThe difficulty curve of the game ramps up to 11 very early on in the game and never lets up. The game isn't hard because of bad controls or bad gameplay decisions, the puzzles are legitimitly challenging and precision is the name of the game with the levels. Odds of ragequitting out of frustration are high for later levels.\n\nYour decision to buy this game rests solely on your tolerance for brutally hard games. If you don't mind tons of restarts and very tough puzzles then pick up this game. You will get your monies worth. However if your tolerance for that style of gameplay is low, I would highly suggest passing for another puzzle platformer.\n\nYou can see my full review here: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/blackhole\n\n","April 17, 2015","true","29.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/recommended/322680/","daytondoes","Dayton Does ¯\_( ͡°Ꮂ ͡°)_/¯","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daytondoes/","1247 products in account","Game developers are generally very nice people. They invite us gamers into a world they've made, exposing it to all the evils of the real world. Every once in a great while, I come across a game that brings me into a land that is much harder, more dangerous, and more puzzling than the land I came from. It's no tiny feat for a game to cause me more anguish than my real life. Does that mean the devs are evil? Quite the opposite. They are in fact insane, maniacal, Czech geniuses. They took a relatively simple mechanic, that being switching the plane of gravity, and turned it into one of the most hardcore puzzle platformers I've ever seen. The puzzles are complex, the platforming is relatively tight, and every level seems to stump me until I've given it some thought with a good night's sleep. I dream of BlackHole. FiolaSoft Studios has certainly picked a winner with BlackHole, Let's discuss what exactly makes it so good.\n\nThe first thing you will likely notice is the voice-acting. It's quite obvious they didn't use amateurs here and the results shine through, though some might consider the cutscenes rather long at about 5 minutes per, I found that the humor and quality of the voice-acting kept me engaged throughout the run. The art style is decent as well, and gives you a really good idea of what's what when you're wandering on an alien planet, which is pretty important. Finally, the music pulls the entire aesthetic together with a set of eerie tunes that truly gives you an otherworldly feel. As you hop on gravity pads to change which direction is down the flora and fauna, along with the music, will constantly remind you just how far away from home you are. Your only companion is the ship's AI named Auriel. Once the ship crashed she transferred herself to a PDA, so you can have a lady on your hip at all times! Though she does start out sort of mean, eventually her prankster personality started to really grow on me.\n\nAfter the cutscene, you will be able to go from the overworld map into an actual level. You will probably scoff at the first one you see. As you collect the two selfburn elements needed to repair the ship, you might think to yourself "This doesn't seem so hardcore." Within 3 more levels you will be eating your words. Only one selfburn is required to "pass" a level. If you collect all the selfburns, the level will be considered "complete". It will also display a high score for the fastest completion of the level. If collecting elements was all you had to do to complete the level, it would be relatively easy to find a way to stomp through each one. However, the game designers made the enthralling yet sadistic choice to force you to find your way back to the start without dying. Sometimes gravity will leave you stranded on an obstacle and you will be forced to commit suicide. It's all part of the learning experience.\n\nBlackhole is an amazing game, with tons of puzzles sure to wrack your brain, but there are some less-than-stellar points that should be noted. The controls feel a bit sticky, and make getting to some places a real challenge. There is also quite a lack of mobility considering the platforming elements to this game. There aren't many options for replayability (if you even make it through the first playthrough). Finally, the fun factor was knocked down a few points due to the sheer frustration I feel when getting stumped in this game. Completing any puzzle gives a great rush of endorphins though, simply because of how hard you struggled to achieve completion. I'm sure I will find myself coming back to this game multiple times in the future, not only to practice my puzzle skills on a master-level game, but also to keep my ego at it's properly deflated size. Thanks so much for sharing this game with us FiolaSoft! I hope to see more very soon.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 7/10\nFun Factor- 6/10\nDifficulty- 10/10\nReplayability- 3/10\nInnovation- 9/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nMusic- 8/10\nSound FX- 9/10\nStory/Lore- 6/10\nLevel Design- 6/10\n\nFinal Score: 70/100 for innovation, voice-acting, and difficulty.\nSummary: Innovative gravity-based puzzle platformer.

But if you decide to fight and adapt to the very high difficulty, you will be awarded with surprisingly catchy gameplay and nice storyline. And that's just a top of the iceberg called Blackhole, because there is everything you need. Not just the gameplay and story, but also fantastic soundtrack, clever mechanics, suitable sound and voice-over and lot of popculture and sci-fi references, jokes or easter eggs.\n\nOf course, there are some problems, you may encounter minor bugs, rare framerate drops or typing errors in subtitles, but you can easily ignore it, because it is not anything game-breaking. Just ordinary minor bugs that shouldn't cause you any real problem or bother you in case you want to buy the game.

Check out my review in video form!\n(Also subscribe if you'd like to see more!)\n\nPros:\n_Beautiful: Man, the game looks good. Colorful, and reminds me of something like Braid. Tha's a very good thing.\n_Controls well: Jumping and platforming feels terrific. Period.\n_Very, very, VERY interesting mechanics: The gravity changing system that is used for both traversal and puzzle solving is really really cool. Mind-bending and challenging.\n_Good music too.\n_Also, good voice acting.\n\nCons:\n_TERRIBLE WRITING! This might be the thing that make you not pick up the game. The writing is awful. It's bad. It's terrible. It's the worst kind of terrible, because it's terrible but it THINKS it's really clever. It's not funny or interesting. It's annoying, full of misplaced snark and sarcasm. This feels like it was written by someone who has never spoken English before and got their sense of humor from watching a single episode of Family Guy. On top of that....\n_Long cutscenes: Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game wants me to hate it. The cutscenes are really bad, and the first ten minutes of the game is litterally just ten minutes worth of cutscenes with a few seconds of gameplay in between. When it's not in the cutscene, it's constantly taking control away from me just so it can make a snarky statement about the environment. Just shut up! I just want it to shut up and let me play!\n\nThis game will be for you if:\n_You skip all of the cutscenes and dialogues.\n_You like puzzle platformer with a really interesting mechanic.\n_You like pretty game with good music and terrific (albeit wasted) voice talents.\n_You actually like the game's sense of humor. Hey, I won't judge.\n\nIs it worth $15? Yes, if you skip the entire storyline and just focus on the gameplay. Also, yes, if you like the storyline. Absolutely not if you're looking for good writing. Go play a Tim Schaffer game instead.\n\nI will give this game a very tentative recommendation just due to its gameplay alone. But man, I hate this game. I wish I didn't, but I do.\n\nUgh, I swear to Christ, Auriel, if you don't shut your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouth...\n\nShameless plugs time! Did you like my review? I do more than just that.

Such a letdown! The idea is very nice and novel, there is a good production value too. Then I begin to play: awkward controls and navigation. Weird jumps, very little control over your character's lateral movements in the air, and several patch-ups to make precise but passive navigation. I immediately think: oh okay this puzzle platformer leans towards puzzle! You can't steer your jump, it must be to prevent exploits and allow more puzzles.\n\nSo I thoroughly enjoyed the first 9 levels in this mindset. But then level 10 hits me and it needs Super Meat Boy-ish precision but in a minute long level and with controls that are so un-enjoyable for this kind of action. Frustrated after only a few tries (at level 257 in Cloudberry Kingdom, I usually AM patient), I took only one orb, then "passed" the level, the more dissatisfying win I ever experienced in a game.\n\nYou can't be a twitchy brutal platformer and a clunky puzzler with awkward controls at the same time, please just pick one side and bear with it.\n\nEDIT: After playing it for a while, I must say that despite the clunky controls, this game's one of my favorites ever. The level / puzzle design is impressive!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/digivampire/recommended/322680/","digivampire","digivampire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/digivampire/","669 products in account","After 15+ hours invested in this amazing platformer I have finally finished the first playthrough. Man, was it:\n\n- Tough! Many of the levels pushed me to my platforming limits, sometimes because of the controls being imprecise (although you get used to them) but more often than not because the game asks you to make a lot of difficult jumps.\n- Logically challanging/puzzles are well designed. Many of the levels especially later in the game are complete brain twisters. Each new mechanic adds a new dimension (sic) to the complexity. Usually you can squeeze by with a few orbs but collecting them all more often than not requires a much different attack plan on where to go and how to approach the level.\n- Frustrating! No save points in levels means you will be starting from scratch every time you die (and you will die a lot my counter ended up at 1200 deaths or so). The biggest frustration came from the wall of doom levels, but arm yourself with patience they are doable you just need to slowly progress through deaths to know whats around the corner, and keep track of the whole level in your mind until you master it.\n- Beautiful. Really digging the art style and the tiling engine here (and especially different worlds) provides a lot of good variety.\n- Funny! The story is nothing amazing but the way its communicated had me chuckle quite a few times. The lines can be super cheezy but given the setting they are intentionally so and it mostly works. Ariel can be super annoying at times though, you will learn to ignore it until the end :) I did wish for a mute button a few times, but it passed momentarily\n- Addictive! No matter how many times you die, or you get mad, you will be back. Usually once I got stuck, taking a break and tackling the level fresh allowed me to uncover the path forward. Levels being difficult are extremely rewarding when finished and you will be coming back for more.\n- Adaptable! There's "Easy mode" if you want it, although I really haven't tried it. If the difficulty is too much for you, as I understand, it provides a lot less repetition should you die with save points and gives you a lot more time in racing levels.\n- Joy to navigate! Next to no backtracking needed due to clever teleportation system in the menus (which are great overall)!\n- Cross platform! Nuf said.\n\nThe negatives I have are mostly centered on:\n\n- Repelants in the last world and water bouncing. They are super hard to predict if your jumps are going to make it or not, or in what direction you will be flung. I felt like this boosted the difficulty for no good reasons.\n- Difficulty curve spikes very fast in the first world after level 4-5. More gradual introduction would have appeased less experienced players.\n- Most mechanics are introduced properly but not all. One example if pushing blocks in the desert, or gaining speed off of ice scating/gravitational shifts to do large jumps. You do discover those on your own but only after a lot of experimenting.\n- The soundtrack is ok, I love the main theme, but it seems prevelant in every song in different flavors and as such gets a bit dull over time.\n\nMy initial experience was little shaky, but the more I played the game more I really enjoyed it. Give it a go, if you like difficult puzzle platformers I doubt you will want to miss this masterpiece.\n\n9/10","April 16","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A masochist that will speedrun the entire game without dying. Seriously, I'd pay to see that.\n\nSo, this game. A wonderful platformer made by a Czech studio, which of course makes my review absolutely non-biased! I genuinely love it though. The levels are well designed and extremely difficult, but I never got frustrated thanks to the great soundtrack which let me replay one level for 40 minutes without rage-quitting. Make sure to lower the volume of sounds and voice to make the music stand out a bit more.\n\nIt plays well on a keyboard, can't compare it to a controller though because I don't own any. The graphics are stunning, with a great variety of effects that make everything feel very alive. There's multi-language dubbing, which is actually very good, and I think it's also pretty rare for indie games. Nice and intriguing story too, although I've seen some people say they don't like it, so do your own research I guess.\n\nThe main story took me 16 hours, and I still have lots of levels to finish 100%, and a bunch of collectibles and secrets I might just ignore because I honestly can't imagine how I missed like 20 dog tags. Seriously, where are those things O.o.\n\nThere are a couple bugs and missing features at the time I'm writing this (like rebindable keys, although you pretty much use 4 keys to control the player so... no big deal for me). The team is actively working to fix things though. There's also no demo version for those who'd want to just try the game out before purchasing, which I critiqued many games for and this will not be an exception, despite the low price. Make a demo please!\n\nWould I recommend the game? Of course! Although if you're just a casual gamer who never played any hardcore games, you may want to proceed with caution.","March 6, 2015","true","18.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The sounds are great. Cutscenes / dialogues are great... I'm always looking forward to hearing more of it after each level. It's got quite a few really funny moments too. It's just a great game overall with an awesome very active friendly dev who listens and replies to every post in the Steam discussions area (or at least the ones directed to the devs) and does what he/she can to fix any issues you might have with the game.\n\nThe difficulty is quite balanced for most of the levels. There is 2 levels though where things get insanely difficult, one of which the dev fixed to be easier for the Easy Mode. So really, there's just 1 insanely difficult level, The last level in the game where you're rushed to reach a location in time and it has a few too many "cheap shot" instant kills, so you litterally have to die many times just to know where to expect things to happen just before it kills you, and instead of a wall of doom, you just have a sort of countdown timer, so if you don't get there in time, you lose... but it's kind of the last level, so it's somewhat forgivable. Once you finish the game and watch the end credits right to the end (you do not want to skip the credits), more levels appear and all of them are insanely difficult which is where I stopped playing... guess I'm just not that into hardcore mode. But I totally support it as it gives players the option to really challenge themselves and is for those still wanting more from the game... and die over and over and over again. Trust me, you'll likely die thousands of times throughout the game, but the checkpoints make it ok and it's not like dying has some dramatic cutscene or whatever where it takes forever to get back to playing the game again. You die, it teleports you back to the checkpoint and within 1 second, you're playing again.\n\nBut I do partially agree with the joke "Take a break from this game and go play an easier game like Dark Souls" as this game does have it's moments of extreme difficulty. But that kind of makes this game great because if it was too easy, then why would anyone bother to play it at all?\n\nThis game requires you to think a lot before doing anything and be very precise in what you do. I really enjoyed the game. I hope to see more games from this dev(s).","February 12","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also commend that did not use the early access version of the game, but they were so confident (and rightly so) that deliver a complete game. The first commercial game from the developers was Pac In a while it looked good, but more amateurish. This game is but professional work. It shows that for very little money can create brilliant game if developers are skilled and interested in the first place player and not money.

The puzzles seem to rely overly much on precise jump height manipulation, which is compounded by the awkward physics, so I had to switch from gamepad to keyboard just so I could tap the button quickly enough to get minimum jump height.  After level 10 or so the puzzles seem to edge towards nigh-impossible or use solutions based on mechanics that aren't explained.\n\nThe writing tries too hard to be funny.\n\nThere are Easy Mode and Less Plot options, but little explanation of what those actually mean, and the Easy Mode setting is irreversible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepapabrain/recommended/322680/","thepapabrain","PapaBrain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepapabrain/","135 products in account","At least two hours of playtime are AFK\n\nI was seduced by Blackhole due to its narrative similarity to the incredible platformer VVVVVV. You're a spaceman who needs to find the other members of his crew in a place where gravity works in strange ways. In Blackhole, DOWN changes depending on when you step on a glowy white platform. You need to use these platforms to solve individual puzzle-levels that are distributed over across an overworld.\n\nI finished the third overworld (the Library) before I realized I just didn't care anymore. None of the characters you are saving are sympathetic. Your constant AI companion is annoying. The mystery of "the Entity" and the Endera crew is dulled by the overbearing "HA-HA AREN'T WE FUNNY?" tone.\n\nOK. The graphics and art style are great. The different worlds bring a sense of awe when you first reach them, but there is no exploration or adventure, there are simple overworlds and the twleve puzzle-levels per overworld. And I wish I could enjoy the puzzle levels but I just cannot. Maybe I'm wrong, but the game expects you to beat each level in ONE specific way, without alternatives. Even still, for the most part I figured out the solutions to the puzzles relatively quickly. The true difficulty in this game comes from its physics and control scheme.\n\nThe jump physics are wonky and movement is imprecise Oh! You wanted to hang on that ledge you're jumping to? Well, since you held the joystick for 40 milliseconds too long, how about you climb up top into a laser, instead? And then that AI character chimes in, "How about thinking where you jump next time?" when you didn't even die from a miscalculated jump.\n\nThis becomes maddening considering this game is a precision platform-puzzler. I've read that the controls work minutely better on keyboard, but alas, I just don't care. And it's belittling to play Easy Mode (in a game where you're constantly belittled by every character) for a game whose problems come from its physics and controls. There are better platformers waiting in my library...\n\nIf you have more patience than me (do remember, I did beat VVVVVV, so I'm no noob), and this game is on deep sale, maybe try it out.","January 25","false","8.6"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

So the game starts you off with a TON of dialog for a platformer. You can skip it, but it seems a bit rude to do such cause its the story and the VA team is good....Then you finally get to the game, and the talking just doesn't stop!\n\nWhen I started I hoped I could just go without the PDA and heck maybe even get an achievement for it too! But, alas no, you have to pick up the girl that just continually tells you how to do simple things any playformer player would already know. She also leaves out just about anything that might be different about the one you are currently playing...\n\nLike the water, its not water, it is more like a jelly. You can't jump while in it, but if you jump from high enough you can go deeper in it to grab things. Or even deep enough so you can jump from the floor below.\n\nGravity in the game is poorly explained as a whole since it seems to only affect you, which doesn't make a ton of sense.\n\nThe continual trashing on the character you play as is a bit over done. The story doesn't have any depth unless you go for collectiables.\n\nOver all I would say wait until the game is completed.
