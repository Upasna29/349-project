Depending on the kind of sense of humor you harbor at your port you are either going to find the comedy on display here hilariously funny or ear-achingly awful. I fell into the later camp when it came to the first game in the series finding Deathspank a rather pale imitation of Guybrush Threepwood and just plain thoroughly annoying.\n\nThe first game in the series also did little to spice things up from the stock standard fair one would find in these kinds of hack and slash role playing games where you hunted down the evil and nefarious Lord Von Prong so that you could strip him of his corrupting thong - a thong imbued with all manners of fantastical powers- and while passably playable was not something I would have outright recommended unless you are a die hard fan of silly comedy or harbor an affinity for these kinds of Diablo clones. Having bought the series as part of a bundle deal during one of the Steam sales and now having played the second adventure, Thongs of Virtue, you are pretty much getting the same experience as the first adventure. That being said Thongs of Virtue is marginally better than the first game even though it is still pretty much a carbon copy as you set out on yet another series of quests to reclaim the remaining thongs of power.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471836666\nWhile the humor is still hit and miss for me this is the first game I have played that tasked me with killing Santa Claus - yes you read that right - SANTA CLAUSE - so surely that must score it some extra points right? Indeed it does. Thongs of Virtue also introduces a manner of environments not typically seen in fantasy action role playing games such a battlefields and war-zones with guns and bazookas (which you can equip) and napalm. There are also robots from the future that shoot lasers. While this might all sound ridiculous on paper this hodgepodge of genres intersecting with typical fantasy tropes actually ends up working in Thongs of Virtues favor. Deathspank, unfortunately, still remains an irritating and very talkative buffoon with silly quips for almost everything that at times I was incredibly thankful for mute buttons. Thongs of Virtue also scores points for ending with a rather delicious twist that I can safely say I never say coming.\n\nCombat remains practically unchanged where you attack enemies with any one of the four weapons you can have equipped at any given time. Certain weapons have the ability to unleash a powerful attack when your justice meter is full. Your justice meter is increased by dishing out homicidal justice to cowboys, aliens, leprechauns, pirates, ninjas, unicorns, dinosaurs, robots from the future, Santa Clause, elves and poor defenseless rabbits.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=471837536\nDeathspank: Thongs of Virtue is a goofy adventure that refuses to take anything seriously and if you take it on its own terms you are bound to find something in here to keep you amused. As a game it is structurally better put together than its predecessor and while I am still struggling to find much love for Deathspank himself, the adventure on display here is a competent one.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 29, 2015","true","3.0"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","43","46","2","8"

Exactly the same. Same gameplay, Same UI, Same items. Same enemies. More thongs. Many more thongs.\n\nAs much as a sequel can often be completely worthless because in an attempt to innovate and streamline it loses what made the original so great the opposite is also true. A sequel that does nothing new whatsoever will often feel hollow and foolish.\n\nDeathspank Thongs of virtue is one such sequel. It's a very simple action RPG that relies heavily on a quirky sense of humor that attempts to poke fun at the RPG genre in general. Unfortunately while the humor and silly art-style could carry the first game both have been worn quite thin by now and you are left with just the shallow action RPG that form the base of Deathspank's gameplay.\n\nNothing has changed other than the story and if you have already played the original Deathspank this won't be much different.\n\nYou should note, this game has a game breaking bug that corrupts your savegame if you exit the game at certain locations. The developers fixed the bug but never shared the update on STEAM. You have go find it yourself on the Steam forums and manually fix your savegame. Guess EA is rubbing off on them.\n\nNot really a game I'd recommend buying if you already played Deathspank. If you're new to the series you can safely pick either although playing both will be a stretch.","November 18, 2012","false","40.1"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

It also has a great deal of fetch quests and grinding, which can be kind of tedious if you play longer sessions, but all things considered, Thongs Of Virtue is on par with its predecessor!\n\nPersonal playtime total: 20 hours","October 19, 2014","true","20.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The added feature of ranged weapons would be nicer if the range wasn't ridiculous compared to blast radius and if you could actually see a longer distance in maps. I found myself dying more from my own grenades than anything else due to the extremely poor handling of such items. Still, it was a worthwhile playthrough with a nice conclusion to the Thong story.","November 30, 2013","true","20.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The exploring and adventure of the maps is extremely fun, and the dialogue is even better.  It is a goofy game, but it is not so goofy that it ruins the finer points of the game.  It is just the right amount of ridiculousness mixed with the right amount of seriousness (in the missions) to be a perfect game.  Also, this game has virtually no bugs (at least I have not noticed any), and the gameplay is extremely fun.  I bought this game 4 years ago, and never got around to playing it until this past Saturday.  When I started playing it Saturday, I immediately got hooked.  I am usually not interested in RPG/Adventure type games, but this game just blew me away.  In my opinion, if you like RPGs, you should buy this game immediately.","March 4, 2014","true","22.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Best thing i  found was to lure 1 enemy away form the rest kill it and repeat. If you have a friend with you who can play that makes it much easier ( the rainbow heal)\nonce you can muscle past the difficulty spike the game goes back to having the proper difficulty curve it should have and continues feeling fair again\n\nAnother problem i had was teleporting with the outhouses the 10second odd wait after you teleport before you can move gets annoying as it throws you out of the flow of playing.\n\nOverall 7/10","February 11","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The original Deathspank was fun, it had repetitive combat, alright controls with a controller and a good variety of quests. It was only 7 hours long though.\n\nThis game is about 10 to 15 hours long if you complete all the sidequests, so that's an improvement. Where it fails, is that I played it with a keyboard and a mouse and it was a pain to control my character! It felt clunky, I had to hold shift to attack enemies behind objects, I missclicked some dynamite crates, I unequiped items by mistake... Etc.\n\nThe humour was O.K. at best compared to the first one, I laughed alot less in Thongs of Virtue. A good bunch of quests and dialogues were copied from the old game and many of the old characters were re-used too. This game was easier than the first and requires alot more backtracking. I have to say that the bosses in this one are better than the first game though.\n\nOverall, it's not the best game i've ever played, it's worth playing... But, I personally didin't like the second one too much.

It took me about 19 hours to complete including all (side)quests. In the beginning, some of the quests are better to be postponed to gather necessary experience and equipment. If you are playing on the hardest setting, it is a good idea to concentrate a bit on roaming around and gathering everything necessary before storming off into a tough fight.\nIt seemed to me that there are many more side quests in this game than in the original, sometimes the quest log looks overwhelming.\nFor someone who enjoyed the original DS, this one is definitely to be recommended.","April 11, 2014","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
