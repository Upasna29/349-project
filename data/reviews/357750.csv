You play as Xavi, one of seven losers who is just bumbling about his days and completely unaware of the evil plot where a crazed man wants to sacrifice them all to appease the Mayan gods.\n\nGameplay takes place mainly in two locations: your home, and a remote island. Puzzles range from finding a hidden key to solving a gear/block puzzle using the Mayan counting system... the puzzles here are really well designed, as is the overall level design.\n\nGraphics are early 2000s standards: digitized versions of the main character and for the rest drawings. It all holds up pretty well, except in the cave section where it becomes easily unclear where you came from and need to go next.\n\nRecommended for anyone who likes cheesy fun.","April 20","true","3.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","1"

It's a return to the 90's games where you had video scenes with real actors. I personally do not like FMV games but in this case I had to make an exception.\n\nPlot\nIMHO it’s the strongest point in the game, characters with awkward personality and funny interpretation done by amateur actors (but with no fear to make fool of themselves). The funniest part of the game are its videos, funny gags, but among everything, the Dean. It's impossible not to laugh when Alex gets into scene and does crazy stuff, I love it. From the virgins group I take Bruno, this blonde-bearded guy can't be more disturbing and the fact that the Dean thinks he is irresistible for the girls makes the scenes even more nonsense.\n\nPuzzles\nA must have in all graphic adventure that won't leave you indifferent in this game. As always in the genre, you'll go from a logical set of actions and steps to get things working to a crazy puzzle. However, they are fair and after looking at the scenario and checking all the objects more than once you will get out of trouble.\n\nGraphics\nThe weakest point of the game. Nowadays we are used to see AAA graphics so I am expecting quality textures and more particle effects. However, since it’s thought to be like 90’s graphic adventures I would say it’s OK.\n\nSummary\nGood product to have, will give you lots of laugh. A must have for all the graphic adventure game lovers that do not want to see this genre disappear. For the younger audience it's a good first step to get into adventure gaming! Enjoy! :)","September 28, 2015","true","7.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","0"

When you interact with an object a little hud appears with different icons for each action that you can make, i.e. a hand for pick up or a gear for use.\n\nBut the awesome part is when you try to play with a touch screen. I tried in my laptop and everything was fully functionally. I think it's the way a modern point and click game should be played.\n\nI like the puzzle mechanics, there are many kinds. Sometimes you have to make typical combination of objects in order to get a new one. I have secretly fallen in love with Igor.","August 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","7","11","4","0"

I often seek out and play indie games for the very reason some people avoid them....because they are different! Most are not AAA studio games (this one included), which can be a very good thing.\n\nFunky characters, goofy acting, humorous dialog (if a little juvenile at times), and mostly straightforward (and not too difficult) puzzles made this game a joy to play. Unlike one reviewer, I personally thought the decision to use Unreal Engine 3 for the graphics was a good choice as it gave the game a "throwback to the 90's" kind of vibe, just as pixelated graphics in games from studios like WadjetEye Games take me back to the 80's. If anything, I think they add to the immersion, not detract from it. I realize this is a personal viewpoint, but to expect AAA graphics from an indie studio is a bit unrealistic to me. Don't get me wrong....I like well done big-budget games with awesome graphics too, but this one doesn't need that to be a successful production.\n\nThe "decision point" in the game leading to two distinct endings was an interesting development. I especially liked the way the developer gave us the option to play the alternate plot path immediately after finishing the game, which led to different puzzles and cutscenes.\n\nThe only real con I ran into was the game had a couple glitches, one of which was game-breaking, but after messaging the developer via the game forum the problem was quickly fixed and I was able to continue on. I've never received that fast of a response from a AAA studio!\n\nAnd although this isn't necessarily a con, I prefer being able to manually save my progress so I can revisit specific points during gameplay, but that option isn't available in this game. The auto-save and "continue on from where you left off" feature employed here is somewhat common, but I find it a bit restraining.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game, partly because I think the idea of sacrificing virgins always makes for a great plot premise....just maybe not these virgins!","October 12, 2015","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

IT MADE ME DO IT!!! :) Ok, now my warning to all the lovers of adventure games, if you want to have fun - do not buy this game, even for the peanuts it is selling on Steam, cause it is not worth even that and you will be disappointed. I personally have requested a refund, thanks god that I did buy it recently and have played for only 22 minutes, during which was bored and annoyed to hell. First of all - even though the game uses Unreal 3 DK, it looks like s**t, assembled from extremely primitive assets by raving 16 y.o. amateurs (at best!). Seems like the same those amateurs are also "acting" in FMV sequences, which are REALLY trying to be funny, but are not. At least not to adults. The quality of those sequences, as you've guessed already, also c**p. Aside from looking (and playing) really bad with screen tears (cause graphical options are basically nonexistant! }:>) and awkward navigation, all those who do not speak Spanish will be forced to read subtitles, and even if it is not bad per se, and also the info on only spoken language is obviously on the steam page for this game, it kinda makes the whole experience even more dismal than it already is. So, in short, AVOID, if you are not Spanish and have already lost virginity... ;)","October 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 13 of 56 people (23%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","23","13","56","4","0"
