The game developers have also neglected the game completely, giving up on updates and any further content. This also means they have taken down the servers, forcing you into the old fashioned way of creating a lobby and waiting 30 mins for someone to join.\n\nAside from all that, the gameplay can be very fun for the first couple hours, but soons dies out because of the ease of unlocking content, but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nSo four people play in one game, one is the dungeonmaster who has mana and cards that act has abilities and your resource, this recharges over time and when the heroes reach certain checkpoint, it will recharge instantly and give you a new hand.\n\nNow there are three different heroes, the Rogue, the Mage and the Warrior. The assassin uses high amounts of damage to kill stronger minions while the mage uses a mix between damage magic and helpful shields to prevent your allies from being knocked down. Last is the warrior, who is meant to take a beating from the dungeonmasters cruel and kinky toys of war.\n\nThe heroes must survive with only several shared lives to spare, forcing you to revive at all costs in order to complete the dungeon. If the heroes manage to make it into the boss room, they will have a bit of a problem keeping their sanity as the dungeonmaster controls the boss and will easily kill you on any difficulty higher than easy.\n\nDecent monster variety, with the dungeonmaster being able to possess them if they have the correct talents.\n\nNow, the cards the DM uses are unlocked with a currency you earn from playing bot or real games with players. You apply this to buy different minions, traps, bombs, turrets or bosses. These are much to easy to obtain, making the game pretty short and currency near worthless.\n\nIt's free, it's dead and it's a good game to play for an hour or two, by yourself or with friends. Give it a go, but don't expect anything in the long term.\n\nPersonal Rating: 2/5","May 4, 2014","false","8.3"," 99 of 131 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","99","131","0","6"

After checking its Steam store page, I was a bit confused as to what she actually paid for, since the game was listed as free to play. Turns out the game is free with a sliver of content and then you have to pay for the rest.\n\nThe game is very colourful and pretty, but also poorly optimized. My (admittedly aging, but still very able) notebook couldn't hold the fps consistently up. I could live with that, if the gameplay wasn't so bad.\n\nThe game feels really simple, but not in a good way. The maps in the mission I chose to play were all flat pieces of land with some enemies and several mob-spawning towers. Fighting felt sluggish, imprecise and pointless. I played the game with two bots and would sometimes let them kill the monsters in my stead, because to do it myself was just a painful experience.\n\nDuring the 33 minutes of gameplay I found two bugs. One was an invisible boss that spawned after I killed the actual boss. The invisible boss was constantly roaring and attacking the ground, probably mad about the game quality and his lack of visibility. The other was a graphical glitch, that showed huge white tile under another boss monster. Neither of these bugs were game-breaking, I managed to finish the three stage mission fine. Then again, they were annoying.\n\nThere are only three characters. They have one skill each (there might be more to unlock through coins, but I never got that far). They apparently can do skill combos together, but this just didn't happen for me and the bots. It wasn't badly needed though, as the combat was not enjoyable anyway.\n\nEven though the Evil Genius's sidekick encourages you to "Enjoy the looting", there is no actual loot apart from coins.\n\nYou are encouraged to use physics to throw objects and animals (!) around to hit your enemies, but most of the time this just doesn't work. Sheep are for some reason thrown in a big arc, over the heads of enemies you were aiming at. Even with careful positioning, I was not able to hit anyone with sheep. <- This sentence now looks ridiculous.\n\nThe developers stated that this game is supposed to be enjoyed as a coop game with three other players, but I don't see how I would persuade anyone to buy this. And now, according to other reviewers, the support of multiplayer has been dropped (I haven't tested it though), so their selling point is... gone.\n\nIn short, the game is really simple and doesn't stand up to the competition of Torchlight, Diablo and others.\n\nI understand this is the maker's first game, I've read about all the troubles they had while developing this (one dev even had to sell his car) and I wish them good luck in the future. Still, I can't recommend this game.","May 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 83 of 116 people (72%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","72","83","116","22","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiantemple/recommended/218130/","kiantemple","weihong.gong","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kiantemple/","26 products in account","Dungeonland is a great game where you are supposed to play solo with AI friends and with AI dungeronmaster, play with your friends on a map with a AI dungeonmaster or BE the dungeonmaster and send monsters at your friends. When you play by yourself you control a hero which is either warrior who is very tough, the assassin (I am not sure I am getting the names right) who can do bashing monsters with a sword but usually shoots them and the mage who can only shoot monsters. The perks are very good too, I like the vampire one (not sure is correct name either) it gives you health every time you hit a monster. At the end of every area there is a boss, the bosses have very different abilities.\nWhen you play as dungeonmaster you get to choose the monsters and stuff that you use but you have to buy new monsters and mines to place with money from adventures with your freinds or solo with AI. When you are the dungeonmaster and the game has started you can possess a monster by hovering over it and pressing f (with mouse and keyboard) and also there is a danger button which sends out loads of monsters and sometimes a mini boss who has a special power (passive not active). You can possess him too! You are the boss you choose but you can only come out once the heroes have made it to the final place and that is where you are going to be.\n\nI like it that the AI remember to use their abilities and that you can control the AI's class.\nI also like it that one of the weapons is not 100% useless as the dungeonmaster says.\nI don't like there not being always a mini boss when you do the danger button.","March 13, 2015","true","40.6"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","26","32","5","0"

The only reason why you would want to buy and subsequently play this game is if you had a bunch of friends who also want to do so. As it is, the game is dead. There's very few people who still play and since this game is absolutely horrible with AI (and even if it had decent AI, it wouldn't be fun for long) you'll have a bad time.\n\nThe gameplay involves you either dungeoncrawling through a fun, cartoony dungeon filled with monsters and traps while playing one of three classes (who also split up into 3 specializations). All of those have a very different role: The warrior is clearly the tank, the rogue is perfect for annihilating big foes and the mage is support and AoE damage.\n\nThe group dynamic between the 3 players is great and lots of fun, but it's way more fun to be the 4th one: The Dungeon Maestro. In this gamemode you get to direct the dungeon! You can use spells to actively harm the players, you can place monsters and even minibosses to create obstacles or make already premade monsterpacks even scarier and at the end you even get to control a huge Boss yourself!\n\nYou can take different kinds of "cards" (which are either monsterpacks or spells) with you, and the variety and combo-potential is pretty cool. Almost all of the 22 hours I have put into this game are from this mode, aside from farming for some hero items via an exploit (which has been fixed though). I'd still be playing it, if other people were to, too.\n\nAs it stands, the game isn't really playable anymore. If you do have 3 friends and a bunch of free time, get a 4 pack. Now. The game's tons of fun and very unique, and you'll laugh your asses off (while cursing the wretched Dungeon master, of course)!\n\nIf you do not though...Don't bother.

You can be the dungeon master and torture your friends! Except you have to use one of the 3 maps that you've probably already beat 4 times and have VERY little influence and anything you do is anounced to everyone.\nAs for the different characters. There's a wizard, assassin and warrior. Each character has 3 versions. The wizard sucks, especialy the ice version (version 2) version 3 is kinda utility/damage but if you compare it's damage to an assassin, it's pathetic. He has a sort of shield ability to help an ally out, which is pretty helpfull if one of your team mates is down, so the other can pick him up safely. The warrior is basically the same in each stage, but one of his versions has temp invulnerability and taunt so if you have that you can stall a huge mob to let an assassin leisurely ♥♥♥♥ everything. Assassin get's most DPS best missile speed, can insta kill pretty much every enemy if he gets behind them. If solo, second stage assassin OP, if you have a taunty warrior you can try assassin version 3 (charge ups and penetration shots).\n\nYou are forced to have 3 heroes and they share lives, so if you want to play alone, you're forced to have 2 bots who will die at the drop of a hat and waste your lives and when you run out of lives you lose. You can still be running around winning, but if a bot wastes enough lives you lose regardless.\n\nIf you're bored as hell you can go a few rounds, but it just doesn't have any real replay value after the first 10 minuts.","December 14, 2013","false","4.3"," 81 of 132 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","81","132","0","0"

Any game bought BEFORE it was made Free To Play is supposed to give the normal number of card drops for that game.  Since this game has 7 card drops that means users whom had purchased before it went F2P should get 4 card drops.\n2).  There was a problem where purchases from before F2P got 0 card drops that was eventually partially handled by giving 1 card drop instead of the 4 they should have gotten for purchasing before it was F2P.\n3).  People who did not immediately redeem that 1 card drop while waiting for an explanation or help from support had the 1 card drop removed.  Thus again have 0 card drops instead of the 4 they should have gotten for purchasing before it was F2P.\n4).  Recently the 1 card drop was re-added to the accounts of purchasers from before the game went F2P. That means there is still a problem where purchases from before F2P got 1 card drop again instead of the 4 they should have gotten for purchasing before it was F2P.\n\nThere still is a lack of communication from Critical Studio and Paradox Interactive as to how/when, and if these things will be fully resolved.  Further, it is quite clear at this point there is little intent to make things right to the people whom had purchased prior to the game going F2P.  The continued delay and failure to even get the correct number of card drops has further cost the initial purchaser of this product through the reduction over time of the cost of the cards.  Something Critical Studios admitted they were aware of and would try to compensate for and make right.  Instead, not only have Critical Studio and Paradox Interactive not made things right months later, they have haven't even gotten the right number of cards drops to us, still!\n\nOnly people who purchased a DLC after the game was F2P get drops based on the cost of the DLC purchased.\n\nThese things are really not being handled well.  It is clear Critical Studio and Paradox Interactive on top of not having a good handle on how to fix the situation are also unreliable at communication.\n\n\nAdding the following most recent news from the developers with BOLD tags around the quotes since those don't work in reviews:\nOriginally posted by BjornB:[/b]I will forego chrunchy and post my reply to him here myself. Not more than fair seeing there are a lot of invested people here and that chrunchy most likely would do it himself anyway.\n\nTo all of you. I'm truly sorry there isn't more we can do.\n\n\n[/b]\nI'm afraid there is little more we can do for you as things look like they do. I will summarize the entire thing in one list as a closing statement:\n\n- Yes, we did a miscalculation when we implemented the trading cards into the game and also made it free to play. The Steam platform is designed in a way that it then requires you to spend money in the game to be eligible for trading cards. The whole concept of trading cards was new to everyone, and Free to Play was a new thing to us. This is not an excuse, but it's an explanation. We try to learn from the mistakes we make and do better in the future.\n- We have asked Steam how cards could disappear from users that already earned them. We received an answer that stated that it shouldn't happen. Neither could they find any evidence or logs about it happening. This doesn't mean that it didn't, we just don't know more and can do little about it.\n- As this matter clearly is very important to you and we could not resolve the issue in a matter that would satisfy you, I offered you compensation in form of another game as a token of our good will. You declined.\n- As trading cards are bonus items and not part of the initial package you purchased, the lack of them is not valid reason for a refund of the actual game. As you probably know, refunds are not something you easily get from Steam when you owned a game for a long time and also have a significant play time.\n- Sales and refunds of games through Steam is dealt with by Steam.\n\nI am truly sorry we could not reach a solution that could make you happy. But since we exhausted all means to do so without success I'm afraid I must inform you that there is nothing more we can do and that I therefore must consider this matter over with.[/quote] [/quote][/i]\n\nThe cards didn't disappear.  The potential drops for those that had not redeemed them disappeared.  Then eventually re-appeared as many in this thread can attest.  Even checking the logs of this thread one could examine the accounts in question and see what number of drops they had available at those times.\n\nA company that can't do simple math should not be in business.  Even after all of this, without having redeemed any card drops I still sit at 2 out of the 4 drops your company should have provided.\n\nThe card drops weren't so new that it should have been hard to figure out 0 out of 4 was wrong.  The card drops weren't so new that 1 card drop was not 50% of the potential 7 card drops is some mystical thing that couldn't be figured out.\n\nYour company can't even have the decency to be honest.

Dungeon Maestro Mode is also fantastic as well, where you get to be the parks evil owner, the Dungeon Master, and actually challenge your friends (who play as the 3 heroes) with all sorts of spell cards based off a Mana system. Dungeon Tower mode is also fantastic, with each dungeon ending with a challenging boss fight. Also there is a shop where you can customize your character with armour, hats and all sorts of cool weapons. Infintie Dungeon offers endless fun which challenges you to see how long you can last without dieing!

The devs are lacking in the moolah department, so this is pretty much abandonware at this point.\n\nAs for the game itself, it's a weird one - there's a decent title struggling within a cocoon of poor execution that isn't allowing it to spread it's wings. The premise is solid, the humour is pretty good and with good netcoding, a thriving playerbase and a fair few tweaks around the game, this could've been much better than it is.\n\nSadly, Dungeonland is a prime example of a game that illustrates the pitfalls of lazy developer updates and shocking connectivity (in a game that advertises itself as a multiplayer experience, no less). If you've got a few buddies who're up for some local play, then it could be worth a spin.

Bots are dumb as a doornail, which shooldn't matter much in a multiplayer game, but condemns you to resort to PUGS if you dont have a full party.\n- Minor/Middle/couple of Major bugs. Lots of 'em, for which the Developer answers seems to be "well, don't do that, then".\n\nStill, the 5 to 10% of the time the game -does- work as intended (or what I pressume to be  intended, such as smooth gameplay), it's actually decently interesting. A revolutionary masterpiece it ain't, but it should keep people entertained if other options aren't available.\n\nConclusion: Recommend is dated Jan 30, 2013... Give it a couple months to either get their issues fixed or sink to the bottom, and then -consider- buying it. If it goes into a steam sale, all the better.\n\nEdit: A while later. (Dec 2013)\n\nSoooo. Tried this again a bit over two weeks ago, but lookin' at my card inventory made me remember to update this review. Kind of a bad idea. Trying it again, that is. If it was bugged before, now it's worse. With the developer studio dead, I really can't see it goin' anywhere, so let's avoid this one at all costs.","January 30, 2013","false","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have freinds who havent played at all or for 5 minutes of this game. Oh did you think the all access pack would get you the items read the Dlc it says this - Buy Dungeonland - All Access PassIncludes the full game with access to all stages (3). man for a Dlc like that make it 5.00 or 2.50 not 10.00 also if you bought the two Dlc's and not the collection pack hahaha ur gonna have to pay 17 bucks for all the Useless ingame armour wepons and bland skills. if this wants to atleast be a game add something worth the waste of about 35 bucks for all Dlc's Man i can by a way better game with 35 bucks guys dont you agree?

The flaw however is in the casual style of the game: the heroes basically cannot loose unless you play on a very hard difficulty, and the DM cannot loose when using a boss monster. So the most reasonable thing to do is to wait and do nothing till the heroes enter the boss room, then you kill them. Fun for everyone.\n\nOn top of that you get exactly one set of spells, monsters and so on, and for everything else you need to pay extra money.","April 26","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plus you have to by access pass to play all levels and use all the content, but I would rather pass on this game. Lacks all the charm, filled with the most stupidest fantasy based garbage no person would ever find appealing, classes are a joke in the game, the designs on characters and monsters is terrible, and this game made me hate upcoming fantasy based games.

At it's core, it's a Diablo clone. Sort of. Think of it more like an updated Gauntlet clone. It's four players co-op vs. a fifth player who is sort of a DM, but not really. He just controls all the baddies in a Gauntlet-style... well, gauntlet.\n\nThe character classes are droll and uninteresting, but once you figure that out the game gets a bit more enjoyable. It's basically your standard archer, fighter and wizard that have each have a smattering of special powers that are fairly unintriguing.\n\nThe fun of DungeonLand is the multiplayer mode. Four heroes vs an evil overlord. It's insane. I personally don't see the value in it.

It looked extremely promising due to the fact that I enjoy detailed games with a good amount of comedy, I was expecting that. But I was wrong, oh so so very wrong. Dungeonland is a Online/Co-Op Action Casual action brawler that just isn't that fun. The controls are pretty clunky, ♥♥♥♥s you over with the connection. I get into a match and I get lagged out the second the round starts even though I get 5 bars on my samsung laptop being right next to the router. The servers feel abandoned. Their is barely anyone there and the game is full of bugs, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, still gets too many frame drops which is sad since it's 3.5GB which means it should run smoothly, but it just doesn't. The classes are bland, the difficulty curve isn't fair because you really don't get a good view of it. And in general this game was just god awful. It kind of feels like puking out a tampon shoved up your ♥♥♥ after several hours not fun. Critical Studio, and Paradox Interactive. Next time you make a game, don't dun ♥♥♥♥ the whole thing up.

Your team only get a set amount of lives so if you have someone who sucks and they take away all your lives then there's nothing to do about it. If you have someone who rushes through the map and doesn't want to collect any of the coins, tough luck because you can't do anything about it. If you have someone who joins and then goes AFK you can't even start the match because there's no way of kicking this person. If you have someone who joins and just stays at spawn waiting for you to collect coins and do all the work, tough luck because you can't kick this person.\n\n-There are a lot of trolls who join your game and do absolutely nothing, which brings me to my next point...\n\n-There are hardly any players, and hardly no games to join.\n\n-There is basically only ONE map and that's it. There are two game modes, both with the same map, and if you want anything else you have to pay real money for it.\n\n-Exact same waves over and over again and just one map make for an amazingly boring game after the first hour playing it.\n\nTotal waste of time. Play only if you enjoy waiting 30 minutes in a lobby because you're on the last stage and someone joined your game but went AFK and now you can't kick them but you also don't want to leave because you almost completed the last boss stage in hard mode.","January 8, 2015","false","4.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/risingpun/recommended/218130/","risingpun","Osirus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/risingpun/","1452 products in account","There are various reasons I enjoy this especially for multiplayer. It's  a free non-FPS game anyone can jump into, and plenty silly. Most interesting to me is that it splits the difference on a pair of bifurcation points that oft divide gamers:\n*It's co-op and competitive, at the same time. (The DM mode pits 3 heroes against the dungeon master)\n*There is account/character progress and not, at the same time. (your wins get you cash to buy options, but never a raise in raw power)\n\nI know that I tend to prefer games with some sort of progress, but in most RPG-style games it means noobs and vets can't play together. And I usually prefer co-op games, but I know some folks prefer competitive games. I like that Dungeonland offers all of these at once. So sure, there are some annoying bugs, as you'd expect from a Paradox game. But there's a lot of fun to be had, and at free the price is certainly right to try it with a few friends. Don't grab it expecting a Diablo-clone to enjoy on your own; most single-player diablo-clones out there are better. This is a game to play with friends in DungeonMaster mode, with voice chat on, and plenty of taunting.","September 1, 2015","true","27.1"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","13","26","0","0"

In fact, we were considering posting gameplay on our channel as a joke, but instead, could not go 20 minutes in the game. Don't bother, it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked!!!!","October 11, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I was expecting a deep RPG element as was very disappointed at how shallow it was. As for the game of skill, dungeon master took a couple times to get good at the hardest setting (which is the "very easy" setting, referring to the heroes' point of view). The heroes side was challenging.\n\nWish I could have played multiplayer, but can't imagine it would have extended the life of the game too much. 5 games were open, 3 of them full, and the other 2 had connection problems.

There are a few pieces of equipment you can swap out, a few abilities and passives, and...That's it. Really, there's very little room for you to develop your character as you please. Now, I have to admit that the actual action gameplay is often quite fun, but everything feels a little floaty.\n\nNow, what about the main draw to the game- being the dungeonmaster? Well, it's quite disappointing, I think. In my experience with this game, it felt like I either played as an utter sadist, who would wreck anyone on the highest difficulties, or as an impossibly weak gimp on the easier difficulties. The dungeonmaster mode is pretty fun when playing with friends, but it kinda gets old fairly quickly.\n\nHonestly, I really don't know whether to reccommend this game or not. It's evidently very, very flawed, but it offers a fairly unique concept which is done fairly well, even if there are plenty of other games in which you can sadistically prey on friends.","June 20, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Wether you're the DM spamming the evil laugh button as your friends fail, or you're one of the plucky adventurers taking delight in 1 shotting the DM's miniboss he expected to do something usefull to you.\n\nWhile the game is a lot of fun with friends it definitely has it's flaws. The difficulty is more of a hard spike than a curve, and the most difficult boss is the one the DM starts with. The gameplay is also rather repetitive so playing alone is more of a slog than enjoyable.\n\nAll in all it's worth giving it a few runs with your friends for a fun couple of hours. Additionally if you happen to work for Nintendo you can witness what a Wii U title should look like, so there's that.","November 27, 2013","true","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is not bad. I hate auto attack, and was glad when this game did not have this feature. I give the game 4 out of 5.

I would probably still play this game if I wasn't forced to be with 2 bots, for some bone-headed reason, the game forces you to have 3 heroes in order to start the level and since no one plays online anymore, your stuck with 2 terrible AI teammates that always manage to get killed, thus ending your game because of shared lives...Playing online with 3 other humans (2 heroes, 1 DM) was fun but without the player base, this game is done.\n\nAll aboard, free admission to Dungeonland!...yea, no thanks...","February 28, 2015","false","9.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's an experience for casual players. I take that assumption because you can quickly run out of content if you play it hours without end.\n\nWhat I really love about this game is the possibility of being the bad guy and destroying the success of your friends playing against them, choosing what they have to face.","January 4, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I have to say, though, I don't approve of the way it's done here.  More than half the game is locked off until you cough up $10 that you could be spending on a better game.\n\nWhile at first the updates seemed to improve the game with better optimization and more, it seems to ruin the game now.  Whatever they did to the A.I. left them defenseless to die of not knowing how to actually attack, until you finally need a revive from the giant army meant for 3 people, and not 1 person and his two nonaggressors.  So, pretty much, don't expect to ever win on your own.\n\nWhy do I mention the A.I.?  Isn't there online play?  No, because the servers are almost always down, and even then, nobody plays this crap.  Special thanks to my bro for gifting me a copy of this game so that I could watch it turn from decent hack-and-slash to pathetic attempt at F2P hack-and-slash where you don't get to play the game until you pay $10, otherwise playing a mediocre demo of a mediocre game.","July 6, 2013","false","5.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuehnau/recommended/218130/","kuehnau","Kuehnau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuehnau/","284 products in account","I pre-ordered Dungeon Land, I gave into the hype that it was generating, only now after it was too late do I realize that most of that hype was from two things; being an indie game and being from a developer in Brazil.\n\nDungeon Land is mostly a poorly planned "Gauntlet" clone, placed in the theme of a Theme Park. Sounds like a good idea right? It should have been an amazing game and the developers messed up badly.\n\nTo begin with, although Dungeon Land is set in a Theme Park setting, you wouldn't realize it. The special events that happen are very few and far between, there's a complete lack of mini games and character customization is the equivalent of dressing dolls.\n\nTheme Parks are notorious for over priced food, hard games of "skill", rides, actors in suits and expensive vendors. Dungeon Land has almost none of that. Each stage usually has a single ride "event" that boils down to a mini boss before you eventually make your way to the end boss and most of these events are poorly thought out.\n\nYou collect gold in the game, but only to buy skill upgrades or new costumes. Costumes do nothing but change how your character looks. I thought part of the appeal of a dungeon crawl was finding all sorts of loot. I mean, wouldn't it have been awesome if they had random venords in stages selling different kinds of gear and stuff? Well, forget that. You don't get that.\n\nThe character AI is awful, if you can't find enough people to play with, the character AI is going to be the reason why you die. Me and my friends have literally watched in horror as the last surviving player, a NPC, runs into a wall and does nothing else while being murderd by hordes of enemies. It's awful.\n\nTo add further insult to injury, the game is now Free-to-Play, everyone who bought the game gets a kick in the butt and that's about it. But don't worry, there's more "content" for you to buy now if you want.\n\nIn all honesty I think this was the plan from the beginning, get as much cash flow from paying members as possible, then after all intrest is lost in their crappy, shoddy, ill thought out game, they make it free to play to bring in even more money. I'll never trust this developer again.","November 30, 2013","false","2.3"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

The dungeon itself is always randomly generated and allows for a unique experience every time you play. The twist is that the 4th player plays as the "Dungeon Maestro" whose goal is to stop the other three players from completing the dungeon by spawning mobs and towers while also playing as mobs, elite mobs, and the final boss. The game itself is incredibly challenging and clearly built with 4 player cooperative play in mind. There are other formats to play with fewer friends and an AI Dungeon Maestro, but the game really shines when you have four people playing.","July 13, 2013","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's free, so you lose nothing by trying it out. A lot seems to be micropayments, whether it's pay to win I cannot judge from this short a playtime. I found the interface very cluttered and the fonts too small in the menus; you might need some time to know what you are doing and what's available. Gameplay is, as already stated, simple, but captions and voice and style is fun.

I've always loved it, but have never had the friends willing to play it with me. At least not for very long.\n\nAllow me to explain why that's relevant, and why I don't recommend this game, even though I love it. The one worthwhile mode is the GM mode, where one player is the GM, controlling tricks, traps, and monsters to beat three other players struggling to the goal. For people who believe themselves cunning (regardless of if they are in reality) and enjoy pulling the strings to create a challenge and experience for other players, this is a real great game for you. I'm one of those types, and I sincerely enjoyed splitting my friends apart and trying to pick them off, sowing discord and trying (with varying results) to surprise them at every turn.\n\nHowever, for those who come to this game with the intent of playing as a hack and slash hero, which is advertised and is forced upon three of the four players every round, you will get bored of this fairly quickly. All the fun of the GM mode is for the GM to have, the players essentially running a gauntlet to the end. Some players get stressed or bored with how little they can actually do, and it in essence becomes a forced march to the end. The GM is given all sorts of ways to express his cunning and strategy, but the players? Kill what's in front of you and progress. Hardly exciting.\n\nThis loops me back to my first comment. I enjoyed playing GM, so I like this game. My friends did not as much, or got sick of playing adventurer when I was GM, and eventually lost interest. I feel like this is less a story about me and my friends than it is a story pointing out a major flaw with the design of this game.\n\nIn summary, while GM mode is fun, it seems to only be fun for the GM. You can take turns being GM with your friends, but in the end, it sacrifices the role of three other players for the experience of one, and that just doesn't last long.","November 26, 2013","false","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is so cool to be the Dungeon Master and throw bombs and set traps for your friends. I love the idea of asyncronous multiplayer, it adds a lot of depth and strategy to things. The game has a charming asthetic and very cool enemies/spells to go against.\n\nUnfortunately I've had nothing but problems with the game. It was unplayable at launch because it was so buggy. There are still tons of network issues that I've enountered while playing with my friends. There seems to be a very limited set of online multiplayer maps (I believe 1) so the multiplayer gets stale quickly. If playing with less than 4 people, the "Hero" side always loses because the AI characters are awful. There is so much potential here but the game was just executed poorly. I can see why it is now free to play.","November 27, 2013","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though the thing that ticks me off about the game is some of the unnecessary humor thrown in here and there, while Im a fan of high and sometimes crude or dark humor some in this game can go a bit to far. For examply being able to take a dump on a enemy while playing as one of the ending dungeon bosses. The rhino guy I believe. While this is hilarious in its own ways, its still a bit to far in my opinion. Dungeonland is a awesome game with lots of potential and deserves a 9/10 despite the over use of humor.

Never has a graphic simulator depicted events in such a thought-provoking, stimulating manner. The graphics leave a splash on any monitor this season – a true assemblage of both textual and representational elements. Centre stage, the viewer is first confronted with an image that he or she assumes is the Dungeonland itself. It is, however, the first clue to the deceptive and perhaps dangerous game that the designers have invited us to play. Upon closer inspection the subject does not so readily give over to the expectations of dungeon or dungeonland, rather looking like a cubis, avant-garde projection of an existential palace.","September 7, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Random mini-bosses keep things interesting, and it's a nice little panic session with friends all around.\n\nOn the other, we have yet to pass what I assume is the first stage. At this point it looks like we're going to just grind away until we have enough money for upgrades, then take on the level and actually win.

I've always loved it, but have never had the friends willing to play it with me. At least not for very long.\n\nAllow me to explain why that's relevant, and why I don't recommend this game, even though I love it. The one worthwhile mode is the GM mode, where one player is the GM, controlling tricks, traps, and monsters to beat three other players struggling to the goal. For people who believe themselves cunning (regardless of if they are in reality) and enjoy pulling the strings to create a challenge and experience for other players, this is a real great game for you. I'm one of those types, and I sincerely enjoyed splitting my friends apart and trying to pick them off, sowing discord and trying (with varying results) to surprise them at every turn.\n\nHowever, for those who come to this game with the intent of playing as a hack and slash hero, which is advertised and is forced upon three of the four players every round, you will get bored of this fairly quickly. All the fun of the GM mode is for the GM to have, the players essentially running a gauntlet to the end. Some players get stressed or bored with how little they can actually do, and it in essence becomes a forced march to the end. The GM is given all sorts of ways to express his cunning and strategy, but the players? Kill what's in front of you and progress. Hardly exciting.\n\nThis loops me back to my first comment. I enjoyed playing GM, so I like this game. My friends did not as much, or got sick of playing adventurer when I was GM, and eventually lost interest. I feel like this is less a story about me and my friends than it is a story pointing out a major flaw with the design of this game.\n\nIn summary, while GM mode is fun, it seems to only be fun for the GM. You can take turns being GM with your friends, but in the end, it sacrifices the role of three other players for the experience of one, and that just doesn't last long.","November 26, 2013","false","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The dungeon itself is always randomly generated and allows for a unique experience every time you play. The twist is that the 4th player plays as the "Dungeon Maestro" whose goal is to stop the other three players from completing the dungeon by spawning mobs and towers while also playing as mobs, elite mobs, and the final boss. The game itself is incredibly challenging and clearly built with 4 player cooperative play in mind.

Your goal is to survive the dungeons using one of three characters the rogue, mage, and warrior collecting gold along the way to unlock new weapons, perks, potions and much more! The gold is shared MEANING all the gold you collect goes to everysingle team mate aswell as the dungeonmaster if it is a human player.\n\nThe most unique feature from this game is being able to play as the dungeonmaster himself and placing monsters, traps, and structures how you want in your dungeon. You use gold collected from playing as heroes and or being the dungeon master to unlock cards which can be traps, structures, boss monsters, standard monsters ect and you draw these cards at various points in the game to use against the heroes, you can be as douchy as you please or you can have a nice fun yet challanging dungeon aslong as you have the mana to cast the cards which recharches over time and at various check points.\n\nAfter very losely covering what you can do in the game the conclusion is: this game is phenominal IF you have friends. It can be alright by yourself or with randoms online but by far have some friends to play it with itd make the experiences that much more entertaining. Being a new game there are bugs, hell i was outside the map once and couldnt get back in.. we lost.  Ping is also a factor also, as Rossinna mentioned in his review incase he reads this, terrible ping will create unplayable lag and AI dungeon masters will feast on that lag and make your life HELL.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCheatingWoodsman/recommended/218130/","TheCheatingWoodsman","Benedict Arnoldbatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCheatingWoodsman/","15 products in account","I started playing this game recently and I've really been enjoying it. It is difficult but pretty fun and fast paced at the same time. As for the look, the levels look as if it's a "Dungeons and Dragons" game board combined with a theme park. Everything has a cartoonish look to it, even the giant spiders. This combines with a lot of blood and gore as well, kinda like tf2 now that I think of it, (Another great game by the way).\n\nBasically a group of three players or "Heroes" come to a theme park run by the Dungeon Maestro, a some crazy guy who sends monsters and spells after them in the hopes of killing the heroes, wich he does quite often. As the heroes, It plays a bit like gauntlet if you've ever played that before. For the Heroes there are three classes you can choose. There is the mage, who provides support to the other players, the warrior, who soaks up damage, and the rogue, who can dish out a lot of damage, but can't take too many hits. Each of these classes has three different sub classes. The Mage has the fire mage, the ice mage, and the lightning mage, the warrior has the vangaurd, the lancer, and the defender. The Rogue has the assassin, the gunner and the archer. These different classes are made for fulfilling different roles on the battlee field. However, if you don't feel like being a hero, you can always be the "Dungeon Maestro". When you're the Dungeon Maestro your goal is to stop the heroes from advancing through the theme park. As I said before, you send you use monsters and spells to do this. the way you decide wich spells and monsters you will use goes like this. Before every run you begin by selecting cards. On these cards are the creatures, abilities, and spells you can use to thwart the heroes. Once the game begins, all you need to do is select the cards and use them on the heroes. However, if you use up all of your cards and are waiting for more, you can just posess one of your monsters and try to take the heroes out yourself.\n\nI would definately recomend you to try it. On a side note, at this game's launch it was plauged by bugs and glitches that would occur frequently. That, along with its difficult gameplay may have scared off a lot of potential players. Despite this, the game has been patched plenty since, thus removing a lot of the bugs and all together making it much more playable. Even so, I will admit it still has it's bugs, despite this though, I have found ways to work around most of them and it hasn't really hindered the experience for me. It fun and free to download so if your willing to take my word for it, give it a try.\n\nP.S. The game got pretty repetetive after a while, so you rnot exactly going to waste days on it. Still fun for awhile though.","June 26, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing with friends is the way to go, and with controller support and 3-player split-screen, it becomes an amazing experience with hours of entertainment - even though you need two controllers in order to pull this off.\n\nThe map variety, difficulty settings and the addition of challenges to them, gives this a lot of replayability. The DM mode, is where it shines the brightest, in my opinion, where a number of my friends have explicitly proclaimed their dislike of my tricks and gadgets.\n\nAll in all, a game I'd recommend for those who have the ability to play together, but not as a singleplayer experience.","December 2, 2013","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Visually, it's very pleasing to the eye.  The controls are responsive, and the game seems to work as intended.  That said, it just wasn't very much fun.  As it is a multi-player only game, you have to rely on other people to be there playing the game, and that just wasn't really the case.  The reason for this is that the game just isn't doing very much.  It's very basic, and the gameplay doesn't have much variance.  Perhaps I didn't give it enough of a chance, but it just wasn't for me, and I regret purchasing it.","July 8, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCheatingWoodsman/recommended/218130/","TheCheatingWoodsman","Benedict Arnoldbatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCheatingWoodsman/","15 products in account","I started playing this game recently and I've really been enjoying it. It is difficult but pretty fun and fast paced at the same time. As for the look, the levels look as if it's a "Dungeons and Dragons" game board combined with a theme park. Everything has a cartoonish look to it, even the giant spiders. This combines with a lot of blood and gore as well, kinda like tf2 now that I think of it, (Another great game by the way).\n\nBasically a group of three players or "Heroes" come to a theme park run by the Dungeon Maestro, a some crazy guy who sends monsters and spells after them in the hopes of killing the heroes, wich he does quite often. As the heroes, It plays a bit like gauntlet if you've ever played that before. For the Heroes there are three classes you can choose. There is the mage, who provides support to the other players, the warrior, who soaks up damage, and the rogue, who can dish out a lot of damage, but can't take too many hits. Each of these classes has three different sub classes. The Mage has the fire mage, the ice mage, and the lightning mage, the warrior has the vangaurd, the lancer, and the defender. The Rogue has the assassin, the gunner and the archer. These different classes are made for fulfilling different roles on the battlee field. However, if you don't feel like being a hero, you can always be the "Dungeon Maestro". When you're the Dungeon Maestro your goal is to stop the heroes from advancing through the theme park. As I said before, you send you use monsters and spells to do this. the way you decide wich spells and monsters you will use goes like this. Before every run you begin by selecting cards. On these cards are the creatures, abilities, and spells you can use to thwart the heroes. Once the game begins, all you need to do is select the cards and use them on the heroes. However, if you use up all of your cards and are waiting for more, you can just posess one of your monsters and try to take the heroes out yourself.\n\nI would definately recomend you to try it. On a side note, at this game's launch it was plauged by bugs and glitches that would occur frequently. That, along with its difficult gameplay may have scared off a lot of potential players. Despite this, the game has been patched plenty since, thus removing a lot of the bugs and all together making it much more playable. Even so, I will admit it still has it's bugs, despite this though, I have found ways to work around most of them and it hasn't really hindered the experience for me. It fun and free to download so if your willing to take my word for it, give it a try.\n\nP.S. The game got pretty repetetive after a while, so you rnot exactly going to waste days on it. Still fun for awhile though.","June 26, 2014","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Playing with friends is the way to go, and with controller support and 3-player split-screen, it becomes an amazing experience with hours of entertainment - even though you need two controllers in order to pull this off.\n\nThe map variety, difficulty settings and the addition of challenges to them, gives this a lot of replayability. The DM mode, is where it shines the brightest, in my opinion, where a number of my friends have explicitly proclaimed their dislike of my tricks and gadgets.\n\nAll in all, a game I'd recommend for those who have the ability to play together, but not as a singleplayer experience.","December 2, 2013","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to survive the dungeons using one of three characters the rogue, mage, and warrior collecting gold along the way to unlock new weapons, perks, potions and much more! The gold is shared MEANING all the gold you collect goes to everysingle team mate aswell as the dungeonmaster if it is a human player.\n\nThe most unique feature from this game is being able to play as the dungeonmaster himself and placing monsters, traps, and structures how you want in your dungeon. You use gold collected from playing as heroes and or being the dungeon master to unlock cards which can be traps, structures, boss monsters, standard monsters ect and you draw these cards at various points in the game to use against the heroes, you can be as douchy as you please or you can have a nice fun yet challanging dungeon aslong as you have the mana to cast the cards which recharches over time and at various check points.\n\nAfter very losely covering what you can do in the game the conclusion is: this game is phenominal IF you have friends. It can be alright by yourself or with randoms online but by far have some friends to play it with itd make the experiences that much more entertaining. Being a new game there are bugs, hell i was outside the map once and couldnt get back in.. we lost.  Ping is also a factor also, as Rossinna mentioned in his review incase he reads this, terrible ping will create unplayable lag and AI dungeon masters will feast on that lag and make your life HELL. Nonetheless, for $9 its a fantastic game to play on those days you just want some chaotic fun or some challanging hack and slash monster murdering rampages.\n","February 1, 2013","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the players takes the role of the Dungeon master and tries to make the living hell out of other players' progress trough the dungeon. The play gets repetative after a short time, however, as there is but a single map and options are very limited gameplay-wise.\nIt's great to play with your friends, though, if not for the terrible implementation of matchmaking - getting together with your firends online is very cumbersome and prolems with NAT are hard to overcome as the published workaround doesn't always work. The game has issues with optimisation as well which often results in lags, tearing, and freezing.\n\nDungeonland feels as an unfinished product overall. However, the recent info suggests things are going to change in the future (e.g. the twitter post of Paradox Interactive's CEO Fredrik Wester) and the devs started with fixing things after some time of dead air.\nI will revisit this review when the game improves and becomes the fun experience worth playing with your friends, as Dungeonland definitely has the potential to be so.","January 1, 2014","false","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
