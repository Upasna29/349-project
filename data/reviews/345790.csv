After getting a black screen (of my 39 Steam games, this is the only game I have issues with), I contacted the developer and left a message on the forum.  He responded that my computer didn't meet minimum qualifications and I should have checked before purchasing.\n\nMy computer: AMD A8 3.4 ghz x4, 11gb RAM, Win 7, AMD 7700 HD 1gb\n\nThis far exceeds the listed minimum and recommended specifications.\n\nI would be very careful purchasing this game.  You should avoid the headache.  Apparently, the game itself isn't very good as well.  Not that I can play it.\n\nSo I could leave this review, I had to let the black screen run for a total of five minutes.  Lol.","January 27, 2015","false","1.2"," 45 of 73 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","45","73","7","21"

I enjoyed this game. Some early growing pains for developer because some users don't have updated AMD drivers.\n\nGame looks good, Plays ok too.\n\nI really enjoy testing the bridge I create!  HINT: You need to press the RED button to test your Bridge!\nAlso, the default seems to have stress test colors OFF, so don't forget to press Green Button to turn them on.\n\nFull Disclosure: I received game key to test this game and it seems fine to me. The Developer is a good guy, give him a chance and he will work hard to fix problems.","January 29, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","3"
