The controls do not work at the start of game and the keybindings in the option menus were confusing. as for the game its the typical move forward kill things, gain gold, grow stronger repeat. This is fine,  but there isnt much besides that. There are lots of stats and gear to upgrade but it only ever really changes the numbers you deal to the enemies. also i ended up buying things on one upgrade page while on another,  doesnt seem like the code for the other menus is frozen while not being looked at.\n\nIf this goes on sale to something like $1 to $2 you can think of buying this. but otherwise for +$5 there are other more enertaining games then this.\n\n","September 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","38","47","2","1"

After 5 hours I'm on level 3 - not sure if that means I suck at the game or it has heaps of content/grind (depending on your personal views).\nIt is a lot of fun, easy to play and for me has been addictive.\n\nIt's basic gameplay, your character auto moves with you firing missiles and healing as you go - when the level gets to 100% you get a BOSS to beat. After you die you can visit the shop upgrade/enchant/purchase equipment and rinse repeat until you beat the BOSS, then next level.\n\nWARNING - I have found this game addictive.\n\nAt $5.00 its an suitable buy, so get it now, as IMHO its overpriced at $8.00. I'm surprised the DEVs didnt go with the freemium model - but then again pleased they didn't.\n\n8/10 (-2 for lack of control/game explanation, but the gameplay is fun)\n\nEnjoy.","September 3, 2015","true","15.0"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","2"

When u find the same artefact that 1 level up . There is like 20 artefacts in the game so there is more than 1 build with each class .\n\nI strongly recommand to buy this game when its on discount and if you do then it worth the money .\n\nmusic is cool and different on each stages.\n\n3/5 stars","September 2, 2015","true","2.7"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

Though I would've loved if there were more stuff to buy in the shop. More customizations, more skills, more different attacks, more characters.\n\nYou attack monsters coming towards you and you can use 2 special attacks against them. When they die, the grant you gold so you can buy better equipments and buy potions aswell. I wished there was a way to buy new artifacts or new skills, buy a new character and repeat game or something like that.\n\nBuy this if it is at a discount.","September 18, 2015","true","9.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kipofmudd/recommended/385440/","kipofmudd","KipofMudd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kipofmudd/","155 products in account","First off, this game is not worth full price. Definitely not the $9 it was at this time.\n\nThis game is pretty fun I guess. Not really sure what to say to be honest to get you to buy this or see it favorably other than I actually enjoyed it. It's pretty mind numbing to just play it and you basically have to die multiple times over and over and over again to slowly progress through the stages. I don't really mind that last part but I figured that could deter some people. The gameplay is pretty straightforward. Just push a button to use potions to heal, a button to use your magic that auto attacks the closest enemy to you, a button to attack, a button to use special abilities you pick up throughout the map and finally you can use the Dpad to air juggle enemies\n\nDon't buy this game if you're expecting something grand and fascinating. Don't get this if you want to perfect the achievements without a crazy grind. Don't get this if you don't have a controller.\n\nAll in all, I would say get this game when it's on a discount and I don't think you'd be disappointed.","November 4, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
