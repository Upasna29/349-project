If you're into the pokemon formula then you've got a pretty good idea about what Minimon is trying to accomplish.\n\nExcept don't bother. This game is terrible.\n\n"But the game is early access! You should expect some bumps!" you might say, and you'd be absolutely right. I've played many early access games and greatly enjoyed them. This one, however, is shockingly bad. The graphics are terrible, the animations are worse, the controls are awkward and disjointed, the sound comes and goes as it pleases, the dialogue reads as if it's been run through google translate, there's no documentation readily available, menus haphazarldy transition or dissappear all together at random, scripted NPC behavior often sends them running to walls or vanishing mid-sentence, there's intense lag (even in single player!), and so on.\n\nThe whole thing feels like a first attempt at making a game- the sort of thing you'd expect from a high school senior who's still learning the finer points of javascript. Instead it's tucked among other actual games, boasting positive reviews from people I can only assume are friends of the developer. It's a train wreck and everyone's on fire.\n\nBut really, this should all be excusable. After all, it's early access. Except it's not. It's awful. The game would have to be scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up to be salvagable. The developed expects this game to be finished in roughly 5 months (as of this review) which includes "player suggestions." This is basically the game you're getting.\n\nEven were it free it wouldn't be worth your time. If you want the pokemon experience on your computer try Pokemon Zeta Omicron, PokeMMO, or even Pokemon Legends. This game doesn't deliver.","April 30, 2015","false","1.9"," 134 of 183 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","134","183","12","22"

This is the review that you SHOULD read instead of the past reviews. Let's begin...\n\nStoryline:\nMinimon's storyline is very unique from other games that are an innovation of Pokemon because it involves your family, criminals, and the urge to become the best! monster hunter (trainer). The theme can clearly be seen as a mix of good and evil and the importance of family.\nRate: 8/10\n\nGameplay Time:\nNext, the game's storyline is much more time consuming compared to other games. I recently discovered an article stating that for every hour of gameplay there is in a game is $1.00. I currently have at this time 62.3 hours of gameplay, and have not completed the storyline yet (including leveling monsters). It appears that this game produces a large amount of content considering it being in early development.\nRate: 10/10\n\nCreativity:\nSurely most of you have seen at least one Pokemon game that was not produced by Game Freak, one of Nintendo's subsidary corperation. It also enables the customer to purchase the game for free. However, this game does not because of it's originality, to a certain extent. The regions are orginal, the 'gym leaders' are orginal, the monsters are orginal, etc...\nRate: 5/10\nReason: Reminds me of Pokemon\n\nMinor Details:\nToo many to explain.\nRate: 10/10\n\nBugs:\nKEEP IN MIND THIS SHOULD NOT INHIBIT YOU FROM BUYING THIS GAME, NOW OR LATER IN THE FUTURE.\nYes, I agree there are minor bugs to this game. However, the game is still playable.\nRate: Can't rate bugs...ladybug is pretty hot though\n\nComplaints:\nMore animations\nRate: 9/10\n\nPersonal Experience:\nI recently stated I have currently played this game for 62.3 hours. I have been playing since June/July and have not regreted purchasing this game. You are capable of playing online or offline, which is the beuty of this game. I have encountered countless bugs, but most, if not all, have been fixed.\nRate: 10/10\n\nDeveloper(s):\nThe developer of this game is known as Sushi. He responds to problems or questions that members of the community posts within 24 hours. He is very helpful and wishes the best for the game. If the game contains minor bugs/glitches, he will fix it within that week. If he does not respond, then the co-developer(?) responds helping in any way he can. It appears he wants the best for the game, including Sushi.\nRate: 10/10\n\nAverage Rate: 8.86/10\nShould you purchase the game? Yes; make sure you limit yourself from playing too much.\n","December 19, 2015","true","68.9"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","30","45","5","4"

The overall direction seems very contrived yet not very controlled, leaving the whole experience feeling very cobbled together with no real direction in mind. Perhaps in the future Minimon might have some sort of potential to be what it aims to be, but it would need a massive overhaul to come anywhere close to what it aspires to be. For a game inspired by what is to some, one of the greatest franchises of all time, it takes very little that what makes it great, trying to improve on it and ultimately failing.\n\nMore details and a full analysis can be found in my video preview below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHjeWGqaU7s\n\nDisclaimer: I was given a Steam code by someone I personally know who worked on the game - to assess it. I hold no biases, but keep this in mind as you hear what I have to say on the game.","April 6, 2015","false","1.6"," 35 of 59 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","35","59","0","4"

Of course it might seem like a ripoff, but it introduces a few new features. And that game was inspired by Pokemon in first place. And you have it for PC. So now shut up and read what's written below. I will make references to Pokemon games, so watch out and grab your (poke)balls.\n\nLet's begin with story - don't expect god-tier Hideo Kojima-level storytelling or Christopher Nolan's level of complexity. You're a 14 year old kid (you can customize the character) that needs to find something to cure his/her mother's illness so you become a monster hunter. Game progresses just like...you guessed it - Pokemon. You will catch monsters, grind exp like in good ol' times and fight elemental trainers. Everything seems familiar, no? Of course sometime later we get to oh-so-generic "defeat the bad guys" thing, but this kind of game is never about the story, is it?\n\nNow, let's get to gameplay, since we're (I mean me) kinda talking about it anyway. You send out monsters, pick the attack you want to use...and ALL RISE SURPRISE MOTHA*****, you yourself are fighting too! Well, your character does. You punch those little harmless monsters...you should feel bad. BUt you don't. And it works. And with that in mind, you can now win battle by defeating all monsters or kicking other trainer's ♥♥♥ tête-à-tête. Also, walking around towns and other locations.\n\nOkay, time to talk about the game's looks...THEY AIN'T ALL THAT BAD. Well, 3D environment and monsters, players...don't expect next-gen stuff. I'd say it's solid and fitting that kind of game.\n\nMoving on...multiplayer aspects. Of course, you can fight other players or engage in some kind of cooperation which is good. Also, split-screen so you can pay with your little bro/big sis. Or other way around. But also you can be a lone wolf and play everything in single-player mode, you're not forced to do any MP stuff. Yay.\n\nTL;DR PROs and CONs, you lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nPROs:\n+nostalgia if you played Pokemon\n+kicking trainer's ♥♥♥ in battle\n+you can customize your character (I like that feature in games I play)\n+servers work (take that, EA)\n+Ye Olde XP Grinding\n\nCONs:\n-it has bugs, but it's early access, so that's the way it has to be I guess\n-some haters will think of it as ripoff anyway\n-I'm coming up with random ♥♥♥♥ at the moment, since I can't think of anything.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes, but try getting it for a bit lower price.","March 25, 2015","true","7.8"," 93 of 169 people (55%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","55","93","169","26","7"

I really, really do. But I just cannot. I understand it is early access, but the bugs I ran into are just too big. Idk if it is a problem with my own pc, or the servers are recently down, but i can only get into "Local Server" and not the ones that should have other people in them.\n\nNow the real bugs.\n1) cannot feed my pets treats\n2) cannot level up properly. Each time I do, it does not show on my team list, yet does on the monster's, or my info. To fix this I have to exit the game and relog.\n3) Whenever I try assigning points, either i have ntot enough points because i need 93 points, then it suddenly changes to 200+ points needed, or they do not go up at all.\n\nThere are more, but these are the major ones. The minor ones I do not mind as they were to be expected. Until these bugs can somehow be fixed, I just cannot play this game, despite really wanting to..","December 20, 2015","false","12.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","3"

(Seriously, these games are about people enslaving animals and having them fight each other)\n\nFrom what I've played the story seems silly to me (really both parents leave? how old is the protaganist like 13? "Good luck son! Go out and fight all those scary monsters!")\n\nDad goes off to find a cure for moms illness, and surprise doesn't return! So a year after he abandones his family, mom decides to go find a cure herself. Seems legit.\n\nThe monsters are still somehow unique enough that you wouldn't call them clones of any pokemon (At least the ones I've seen so far) Although during my playthrough I was still yelling Chansey at one of them.\n\nIf you want a game thats a little pokemon, a little final fantasy and a little mmorpg with cute 3d graphics then I'd totally check out 'Minimon' and if you don't pick it up today, I'd at least keep an eye on it cause I think it will build a dedicated following as long as the dev's keep at it.\n\nI'm uploading a first look that takes place 30 minutes in (I had to delete the first video because it showed my account password =/ why it shows it in plain text is beyond me lol).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1vbDanyFHMg\n\nFor more reviews and a bi-weekly podcast about Early Access and Indie games check out www.EarlyAccessPodcast.com","March 28, 2015","true","5.6"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","19","36","5","3"

There is just way too much input lag though. Maybe it's because I was playing online though, I don't know. On top of that, the game also ran at a ♥♥♥♥ poor frame rate, and character models just sometimes freaked out for no reason.\n\nAlso, I got stuck on menus multiple times, and had to manually close the game by stopping the process since I couldn't even click the exit button on the window.\n\nTechnical bugs aside, the combat didn't flow well at all. I also had a lot of trouble using items. Like, I couldn't use healing items for some reason, and the way you throw the net to capture your monster is by declining to use the item, then saying you want to use the item.\n\nMaybe I'll come back to it once it's out of Early Access, but as of right now, the game is pretty awful, and you can take it from me, I usually just do joke reviews for games that offend me.","May 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","4"

The devs are actively trying to improve on it. It's fun if you like monster catching, and is slowly drifting away from the pokemon clone roots.\n\nHowever, what you pay right now in early access is to beta-test these builds, large feedback for better information for improvements and unless you're wanting to deal with some issues, the game is not worth 10$ right now. I don't really regret buying the game as I get to watch it develop, but that's not for everyone.\n\nThings I would like that I haven't discovered and may not exist:\nAn ability to hide my helm so I can have my pretty hair back\nNicknaming monsters\nBeing able to register my fishing pole again. that option vanished =(","January 4","true","6.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is like Pokemon, where you capture monsters and fight with them.\n\nGameplay-\nMinimon is a turned based game meaning you control your monster and take turns attacking. You also use your character to fight. You have options of what you do in a battle such as, attacking it or using an item. The gameplay is like Pokemon so if you like Pokemon, you'll most likely like Minimon. Rating: 8/10 There's also local co op so yay for that!\n\nCustomization-\nWhen creating your character, you can change what your character looks like and more. However, when I created my character, some of the options didn't work(guessing they weren't created yet). Rating: 6/10\n\nStoryline-\nI haven't finished the game yet, but for the time I played it, the storyline was pretty good. No Spoilers :D Rating: 8/10\n\nPrice-\nThe game is currently 10 dollars as of 1/27/2016. For the time I've played it, I don't think the game is worth $10. However, the game is in Early Access so, my opinion may change. Definitely get it when it's on sale though. Rating: 5/10\n\nGraphics-\nLooking at the pictures the game looks great. Sure it's not next gen level graphics but it's fine. In game, the game looks good and runs smoothly. 8/10\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10\n","January 27","true","1.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"
