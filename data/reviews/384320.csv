No tutorials/guides or practice sessions, you do get button guide through game but nothing explained further. Gameplay seems to fast and unrealistic so outside of tactical perspective you dont really get "immersion" which you get in other sport games.\n\nPhysics are completely out of question, kinda static players and standing above ball waiting for 1sec to collect it from ground looks kinda funny although really outdated in terms of mechanic along with couple more things.\n\nNo cool slowmotion goals mostly due to lack of physics and pretty much monotonous gameplay. Main menu including career/season statistic and overall gui is very simple without any a bit more involved features and options.\n\nOverall if you are huge fan of Handball sport, go get it but definitely even then not worth 40$ or even 30$ (currently on sale). Perhaps for 15$ it would be suitable game.","December 1, 2015","false","13.6"," 37 of 51 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","37","51","2","0"

There is absolutely no indication to me that there is anymore to the game now. First off i tried out the career mode, which didn't feel like a career mode, more like normal games, with the exception that you can improve your player on FOUR DIFFERENT ASPECTS. If you aren't hooked yet you're about to be. When i got bored after the first two matches in career mode, i decided to try out the season mode, the first match ending 0-4. Whoo was that a thrill.\n\nNow for the gameplay in general: It sucks. It sucks so hard that i'm almost crying for spending money on this game.\nI would rather have used that money to pay a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to give my mortal enemy his best ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ever - this right here, is the worst purchase i have EVER made.\n\nBut if you like me got carried away by the handball on TV, and decided to not listen to your own reason (that handball is not a serious sport, and it sure as hell isn't gonna comply with a computer), i have one good piece of advice;\nGo to options, and disable 2-minute suspension. I got myself a good laugh after this. I'm sure it wasn't what the developers intended, but then again i paid the 40 euros, so i might as well do with the game as i damn well please.\n\nI have never ever recommended a game so little especially at that price (which actually had me thinking that it had to be good if they require 40 euros for it).\nIf you want a  serious sports simulation experience, spend the extra 10 euros, and get NBA 2k series instead. This is a real game, with real career feeling to it. And some production, which Handball 16 simply does not have any of.\n\nTL;DR: If an evil person threatens you or any of your loved ones with a gun, telling you to buy the game or he'll shoot you or them, just take the bullet.","January 28","false","1.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","11","16","4","2"

The whole game is poorly designed and it lacks content as lack of the developer creativity. I hope that this will not stop the EKO Software developer from developing another and much improved handball simulation game or someone else will try to make a proper handball simulation. I can’t really recommend this game.\n\nFULL REVIEW: https://pcgamesnnews.wordpress.com/2016/04/17/review-handball-16/","April 18","false","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For a new player, who had seen only on TV handball is really hard to try out the movements, shots during a match. And only one difficulty level (with Kiel is hard to be beat a one-star team for a newby). After many local and career mode play the game is really hard, and the rules ... sometimes funny (from one fault x2 2min; frequent offensive fouls); ball steals after rebound are comic. During the career mode you can control the whole team -> whose career? Even the results\nare hidden, and the table is buggy (w4/d6/l4 against w6/d7/l0 is equal).\n\nI played with the Training Camp earlier, and waited for the evolution of the game, but I think this is a wrong way...","December 26, 2015","false","27.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

But having said that on the downside there are NO difficulty levels! When was the last time you played a sports game with only one difficulty setting, no sliders, nothing. The season play is very sparse, you can't even view the scores of the other games. and you have no option to simulate games. I haven't tried the career mode so maybe a lot of these issues are addressed there. Perhaps after some patches and updates a lot of this can be fixed, although Big Ben is not known for their post release support. I'm giving a hopeful "yes"","November 28, 2015","true","1.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","0"

Obviously Handball 16 can not be compared to other well established sports games but I have played the entire series (HC12 and HC14) and I really feell there is a great potential.\n\nHandball is a fun sport to play. Dynamic, spectacular and with tactical elements. Handball 16 fails to completely capture the handball atmosphere, but it is still fun to play. Graphics are ok and you have all the game modes you would expect from a sports game (league, career, offline and online exhibition). Also you have the first german, french and spanish league. There are also some danish teams but they don't have the original players I believe.\n\nGameplay is quite different to the previous version. The scoring system is harder and you really need to test around for a while to get the hang of it. Unfortunately there is no tutorial so it took me half a season to win my first match.\n\nThe biggest strength however is the new offense play system. You can choose from different plays and if you perfrom them correctly you are awarded with a slowmotion jump shot giving you more time to aim and making it easier to score. This is actually a lot of fun and bringst out the hnabdall feeling.\n\nI also like the german commentators Stefan Kretzschmar and Markus Götz. It's nice to have the original voices know from TV.\n\nSo personally I would defintely recommend this game to anybody interested in handball. You will need some time to get used to it, but it is the only handball game out there and I as I definetely want this series to continue it just makes sense to support it.","January 9","true","43.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
