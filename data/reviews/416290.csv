The graphics look like a bad Doom map from the mid 90s. Low res textures, low poly models, horrible lighting. Enemies look look plastic and ridiculous, not especially scary. Wierd invisible walls in the single layout that passes for each level.\n\nThis looks like an afternoon project by a middle schooler. Executed on by someone who gave a damn, this could be an interesting gameplay mechanic in an interesting, compelling game but this is not it.","November 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 40 of 58 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","40","58","2","1"

Neither did I.\n\nIt took just over 30 minutes to complete after getting stuck in walls and objects multiple times and having to slowly kill myself by stabbing my arm with a screwdriver repeatedly. Very boring. The only positive I can give this game is the opening intro.\n\nTerrible game. Glad I got it from an old Greenlight bundle. This isn't even worth the current discount price of £4.19, £0.19 sounds about right.","November 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","0"

But… it’s ♥♥♥♥ing broken.\n\nYou’ll be playing as Zoey, a run-of-the-mill survivalist living in a post-apocalyptic world ravished by rubbery, fleshy monsters called the Pale Ones. After a scavenging trip goes awry, Zoey’s fellow survivors are slaughtered by Pale Ones. She just barely manages to escape before losing her arm to a monster. Although, in the brutal process, she learns that her blood is somehow capable of poisoning the beasts. (I’d tell you why that is… but I failed to beat this poor excuse for a game.)\n\nAnyway, your goal is to reach the roof of the dilapidated office building and ride the cabal car back to safety.\n\nNow, I’d first like to commend the concept this game has created. Using a rusty screw driver, the player must stab Zoey’s gaping wound and spray incoming monsters with blood to kill them. Really cool idea, but this game’s disgusting design, disgusting optimization, and disgusting character models ruin what might’ve been a decent horror experience.\n\nThere really isn’t anything else to this title. You’ll walk up floor by floor, slaying the odd monster, reading notes and picking up keys. Oh, and by the way, these notes are everywhere, and I mean EVERYWHERE. But trust me… it won’t be long before any sane person ignores them all together; trying to read while stomaching this game’s frame rate is as plausible as Donald Trump winning the 2016 election.\n\nOh yeah, did I mention the frame rate? It’s like something straight out of hell. My rig is nothing to brag about, in fact, it’s kinda ♥♥♥♥, but Jesus… COD: Ghosts had better optimization than this.\n\nThis game crashed on me three times, and one of those crashes managed to freeze up my entire computer. I couldn’t get halfway through this crap before succumbing to my migraine and quitting entirely.\n\nJust do yourself a favor: Stay far, far away.","November 12, 2015","false","0.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

It's been...♥♥♥♥ me, it's been JUST ONE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ED NIGHT since I last played a recently-released "horror" game which I should have known full well would turn out to be a steaming pile of dog turd.  And yet, Father...I JUST CAN'T HELP MYSELF.  I know it's BAD, Father, I...I think I might have an ADDICTION, Father.  I think I might be addicted to purchasing and, moreover, compulsively REVIEWING cheap-arsed, scammy horror games which alleged "developers" knocked up in a little over a fortnight using free or inexpensive software in order to indulge their delusional fantasies of becoming rich and adored video game designers, and/or just to swindle a few indiscriminate ♥♥♥♥ers like myself into buying what looks like it will be a highly satisfying gaming experience, when it should be painfully clear from the Steam Store page that it will be anything but.\n\nThey are ♥♥♥♥, Father.  Oh yes.  And I feel like I also must be ♥♥♥♥ to keep giving them my money.  But this is precisely what I shall continue to do...oh yes, Father, I shall.  (Though I might have to force myself in future not to pay six dollars - on SALE, at that! - to indulge this idiotic hobby of mine.  I already owe way too much on my ♥♥♥♥ing credit card.)\n\nOkay, fair enough, let's drop the gimmicky facade for long enough to step out of the confession booth, and examine this one in a little more depth.  The depth it surely deserves, considering the many TENS of hours (not hundreds; definitely not thousands) which Curse Box Studios - aka the weird, socially-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ twentysomething year-old dude who still lives up the road with his mum - put into it.\n\nOkay, first of all, it looks like puppy vomit.  Secondly, the monsters squeal like puppies who've just had their bellies tickled whenever you "kill" them WITH YOUR OWN BLOOD (never really explained, but it's "different", I guess...though it must be awfully troublesome being a human-murdering monster if a tiny bit of the red stuff kills you instantly).  Thirdly, every floor is basically THE SAME MAP OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  Fourthly...it crashes quite a lot (despite the aforementioned thing about the game looking no better than puppy vomit).  Fifthly...oh, why would I even bother?!\n\nJust don't make the same mistake that I did, and remember, kids: Just say NO to reviewing cheap 'n' nasty "horror" games on Steam.  Look at what it's done to me.  BEST SIX BUCKS I EVER FLUSHED DOWN THE TOILET.\n\nVerdict: 3.5/10 (hey, at least it gets points for being original, even if the "twist" it presents makes ABSOLUTELY NO ♥♥♥♥ING SENSE WHATSOEVER.  And the little cartoon sequences are at least borderline nifty.)","November 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","55","21","38","13","0"

Your only weapon against the tentacled beasts that hunt you is your own vital fluids which you spray from your sketchily bandaged stump by jamming a screwdriver in the wound hole.\nThen again, it's pretty novel for a reason. Why would a species so dramatically allergic to human blood EAT PEOPLE? How are there any of these imbeciles left in the first place?\nI'd be willing to lay that to one side if the game itself were any good but, for a title that sees you trying to flee to a rooftop cable car before you wring yourself dry out of your mangled arm, it's a tediously placid experience. There's no urgency in your situation. You'll find more medipacks than you'll ever need. There are notes, NOTES for god's sake, like I'm going to stop to check them out mere minutes after my hand's been chewed off, and the monsters just kind of slowly amble towards you, giving you plenty of time to douse them in artery juice. Once you get over the amusing gruesomeness of this sole attack, it's a wildly annoying six second animation that will unavoidably cause you to take damage before you can kill your opponent.\nAt around 25 minutes long, the only positive you can take from this mess is that it's a surefire refund candidate.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6f_6Lb7bIU","November 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","15","27","6","0"

The abysimal performance, horrid  movement and terrible invisible walls did me in. Died, and just couldn't get myself to get through the horrid experience again of navigating that level.\n\nYou ascend a tower with identical ugly layout every single level. You fight a single-monster, although on higher levels it's texture is replaced by a completely yellow one(?) as it spawns in your face (literally) rather than walk about... oh jolly. Oh did I say walk about, I meant slide along the floor of course, my bad.\n\nYou fight foes by stabbing yourself and getting your blood over them, then frantically need to look for a medpack to cure your bloodloss. This restoring goes ridicilously slow so be prepared to AFK for a minute or so everytime. Oddly enough a giant hook on enemies hitting you doesn't cause bloodloss though like a screwdriver does. What?\nAlso odd is that your blood is toxic to them but if they hit you with their blade, and obviously make you bleed, that's just fine and dandy.\n\nAlso, let's forget you find a freaking shotgun on level 2 or 3, but hey, let's just stab yourself and bleed out instead.\n\nAnd so every level resorts into find foe, kill foe, find medpack, use medpack, find key, use key, repeat 12x. All the while going at what feels 10FPS. You can also find notes to read but OH GOD THE ENGRISH. Not to mention the game doesn't pause so generally you bleed out trying to actually read them. The developer obviously stopped bothering with them aswell since you will find the same note multiple times on different levels.","February 28","false","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's blatantly unfinished, with two out of three game modes to be added later. There's a few nasty glitches, though no longer anything game breaking.\n\nI still have to recommend this as one of the best horror games I've played. Beyond just having some legitimately creepy monster designs, it just has an incredibly effective central mechanic that ratchets up the tension. You're in an abandoned building, filled with monsters. The good news is that you have a 100% effective weapon against them. The bad news is that it's your blood -- every time you try to kill an enemy, you inflict a bleeding wound on yourself and need bandages or you'll eventually bleed out and die. The game becomes an exercise in avoiding combat where possible, and where forced to, it frequently becomes a tense race for the next medkit before you become too far gone and either collapse or get easily picked off by one of the monsters. I've rarely played a game that left me with as much dread and fear as this one did.","February 17","true","0.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
